https://openalex.org/W2010031803,"We have studied patients with variable degrees of left hippocampal and amygdala pathology who performed a verbal encoding task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the impact of pathology on emotional-memory performance and encoding-evoked activity. The severity of left hippocampal pathology predicted memory performance for neutral and emotional items alike, whereas the severity of amygdala pathology predicted memory performance for emotional items alone. Encoding-related hippocampal activity for successfully remembered emotional items correlated with the degree of left amygdala pathology. Conversely, amygdala-evoked activity with respect to subsequently remembered emotional items correlated with the degree of left hippocampal pathology. Our data indicate a reciprocal dependence between amygdala and hippocampus during the encoding of emotional memories."

Oct-4, a member of the POU family of transcription factors, is necessary for the pluripotency of the inner cell mass lineage. Embryonic stem (ES) cells, which contribute to all of embryonic lineages, express the Oct-4 gene. Trophoblast stem (TS) cells, which have the ability to differentiate into trophoblast lineage in vitro, never contribute to embryonic proper tissues in chimeras and differentiate only into trophoblastic cells in the placenta. Expression of the Oct-4 gene was undetectable and severely repressed in trophoblastic lineage, including the stem cells. We found that the culture of TS cells with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine or trichostatin A caused the activation of the Oct-4 gene. Analysis of the DNA methylation status of mouse Oct-4 gene upstream region revealed that Oct-4 enhancer/promoter region was hypomethylated in ES cells but hypermethylated in TS cells. Furthermore, in vitro methylation suppressed Oct-4 enhancer/promoter activity in reporter assay. In the placenta of Dnmt1n/n mutant mice, most of the CpGs in the enhancer/promoter region were unmethylated, and Oct-4 gene expression was aberrantly detected. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that Oct-4 enhancer/promoter region was hyperacetylated in ES cells compared with TS cells, thus demonstrating that DNA methylation status is closely linked to the chromatin structure of the Oct-4 gene. Here we propose that the epigenetic mechanism, consisting of DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling, underlies the developmental stage- and cell type-specific mechanism of Oct-4 gene expression.

In mammalian embryogenesis the first cellular differentiation begins at the end of the third cleavage, which leads to compaction and formation of the blastocyst. The inner cell mass (ICM) 1The abbreviations used are: ICM, inner cell mass; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; dpc, days postcoitum; ES cells, embryonic stem cells; TS cells, trophoblast stem cells; T-DMR, tissue-dependent, differentially methylated region; 5-aza-dC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; TSA, trichostatin A; MeCP2, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2; DE, distal enhancer; PE, proximal enhancer. of the blastocyst is known to generate all fetal somatic cells and germ cells, whereas the outer cell layer, the trophectoderm, gives rise to the trophoblastic components of the placenta. The explant culture of ICM or epiblast cells produces pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, which contribute to all of the ICM lineages in chimeric embryos (1Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1981; 78: 7634-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4355) Google Scholar, 2Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9424-9428Google Scholar). Trophoblast stem (TS) cell lines, which have the ability to differentiate into trophoblast lineage in vitro, have also been established from blastocyst or early postimplantation trophoblastic tissue (3Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). TS cells do not contribute to the embryo proper in chimeras but differentiate only into the trophoblastic cells of the placenta. We previously investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation status of CpG islands by RLGS (restriction landmark genomic scanning) of mouse stem cells, i.e. ES, embryonic germ, and TS cells, before and after differentiation, as well as germ cells isolated from testis and some somatic tissues (4Shiota K. Kogo Y. Ohgane J. Imamura T. Urano A. Nishino K. Tanaka S. Hattori N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These analyses revealed that genes having tissue-dependent, differentially methylated regions (T-DMRs) were numerous. The methylation pattern of T-DMRs was specific but varied according to cell lineage and tissue type (4Shiota K. Kogo Y. Ohgane J. Imamura T. Urano A. Nishino K. Tanaka S. Hattori N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 5Imamura T. Ohgane J. Ito S. Ogawa T. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Genomics. 2001; 76: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have also shown that individual cloned mice have different methylation aberrations, mainly at tissue-specific methylated loci (6Ohgane J. Aikawa J. Ogura A. Hattori N. Ogawa T. Shiota K. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Considering that DNA methylation is involved in various biological phenomena, such as tissue-specific gene expression, cell differentiation, X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, changes in chromatin structure, and tumorigenesis (7Eden S. Hashimshony T. Keshet I. Cedar H. Thorne A.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 842Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 8Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3389-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the formation of specific DNA methylation patterns is one of the principal epigenetic events underlying mammalian development. In mice, Oct-4, a member of the POU transcription factors, is expressed in the oocyte and preimplantation embryo but is later restricted to only the ICM of the blastocyst (11Okamoto K. Okazawa H. Okuda A. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Hamada H. Cell. 1990; 60: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 12Rosner M.H. Vigano M.A. Ozato K. Timmons P.M. Poirier P.W. Rigby P.W.J.

Nature. 1990; 344: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), indicating that expression is restricted to totipotent and pluripotent cells. In Oct-4-deficient embryos, the ICM loses pluripotency and the trophoblast cells no longer proliferate to form the placenta (14Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Schöler H.R. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Expression of the Oct-4 gene is found in ES cells but not in TS cells (3Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J.

Reduction in Oct-4 gene expression leads to the trans-differentiation of ES cells into TS cells under adequate culture conditions (16Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar), demonstrating that suppression of the Oct-4 gene is a critical step for the determination of the potency of these stem cells. The Oct-4 gene has a GC-rich and TATA-less minimal promoter (17Okazawa H. Okamoto K. Ishino F. Ishino-Kaneko T. Takeda S. Toyoda Y. Muramatsu M. Hamada H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and several trans-activators and repressors have been reported as the regulators of Oct-4 expression (17Okazawa H. Okamoto K.

However, specific regulatory mechanisms conferring the developmental stage- and cell type-specific expression of the Oct-4 gene have not been conclusively revealed to date. In this report, to determine whether DNA methylation is involved in the regulation of Oct-4 gene expression, we investigated 1) the effect of a DNA methylation inhibitor on Oct-4 non-expressing cells, 2) the methylation status of Oct-4 enhancer/promoter locus in both ES and TS cells, 3) the effect of in vitro methylation on Oct-4 enhancer/promoter activity, 4) Oct-4 expression in the DNA methyltransferase-1 (Dnmt1)-deficient conceptus, and 5) the chromatin structure of Oct-4 enhancer/promoter region in both ES and TS cells. Reagents, Cell Culture, and Tissue Preparation—All reagents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan) unless stated otherwise. The ES cell line MS12, derived from C57BL/6 mice (26Kawase E. Suemori H. Takahashi N. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 385-390PubMed Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. H. Suemori and cultured in a standard condition (27Matise M.P. Auerbach W. Joyner A.L. Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 102-132Google Scholar). The cells were kept undifferentiated by the addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon, Temecula, CA (28Williams R.L. Hilton D.J. Pease S. Willson T.A. Stewart C.L. Gearing D.P. Wagnew E.F. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Gough N. Nature. 1988; 336: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar)). TS cells were derived from C57BL/6NCrj mice according to the methods described previously (3Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). To maintain the undifferentiated state of these TS cells, they were cultured on feeder cells in the presence of FGF-4 and heparin (3Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). TS cells from ICR mice were maintained in the undifferentiated state by culturing in 70% embryonic fibroblast-conditioned medium supplemented with FGF-4 and heparin on gelatin-coated culture dishes. NIH/3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) (DNA methylation inhibitor, Sigma), TS cells were pre-cultured for 48 h and then cultured for 2 days in medium containing 0, 1, or 5 μm 5-aza-2′-dC with or without 200 nm trichostatin A (TSA; inhibitor of histone deacetylase 1, Wako). NIH/3T3 cells were similarly cultured in medium supplemented with 0, 1, or 5 μm 5-aza-dC for 3 days following preculture. For treatment with TSA, NIH/3T3 cells were incubated for 24 h and then exposed to 200 or 400 nm TSA with or without 5 μm 5-aza-2′-dC for 72 h. Dnmt1 heterozygote mice (Dnmt1n/+) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. They were maintained on a 14-h light/10-h dark schedule and allowed free access to food and water. Noon of the day on which a vaginal plug was found was designated as 0.5 days postcoitum (dpc). Dnmt1n/n embryos and placentas were obtained from intercrosses between Dnmt1n/+ mice and dissected at 10.5 dpc, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until used. Determination of the GC Content and CpG Frequency—We analyzed the GC content and CpG frequency of the genomic DNA fragments with a computer program (CpG view version 1.2.2) provided by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (www.nih.go.jp/yoken/genebank/). Sodium Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing—Genomic DNA from cultured cells and tissues of C57BL/6NCrj mice and Dnmt1n/n placentas was extracted as described previously (6Ohgane J. Aikawa J. Ogura A. Hattori N. Ogawa T. Shiota K. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, each sample was treated with proteinase K (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) following phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1) extraction and dissolved in 200 μm TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Genomic DNA, digested with EcoRI, was denatured by adding 0.3 m NaOH and incubating for 15 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, sodium metabisulfite, pH 5.0, and hydroquinone were added to final concentrations of 2.0 m and 0.5 mm, respectively, and the mixture was further incubated at 55 °C for 14 h in dark. The modified DNA was purified through the Wizard DNA Clean-Up system (Promega, Madison, WI), and the bisulfite reaction was terminated with NaOH (0.3 m, final) at 37 °C for 15 min. The solution was then neutralized by adding NH4Oac, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 3 m. The ethanol-precipitated DNA was resuspended in water and then amplified by PCR using primers designed as follows: PRO F, 5′-TGGGTTGAAATATTGGGTTTATTT-3′; PRO R, 5′-CTAAAACCAAATATCCAACCATA-3′; DE2 F, 5′-GTGTGT TTATGT AATTGT AGATGATT-3′; DE2 R, 5′-TCTACCCCCTTTAAAAATCACTTTAA-3′; DE4 F, 5′-TAAAGGGAGTAGGTATATTT-3′; DE4 R, 5′-CAAATAACCACACTTACTAAA-3′; DE5 F, 5′-GTGATATATTTTAGTAGAAGGTTAGGTT-3′; DE5 R, 5′-TTACAAAATATACCTACTCCCTTT A-3′. PCR fragments were digested with HpyCH4IV (New England Biolabs) or TaqI (Roche Applied Science) to evaluate the methylation status of Oct-4 upstream region. Because only unmethylated cytosine residues are changed to thymines by the sodium bisulfite reaction, PCR fragments from nonmethylated genomic DNA are resistant to HpyCH4IV or TaqI, and those from methylated DNA are digested by the enzymes. The resultant products of restriction mapping were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The images were recorded and quantified using NIH Image 1.61 software provided by the National Institutes of Health (rsbweb.nih.gov/pub/nih-image/nih-image/nihimage161_fat.hqx). The electrophoresed PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega), and 10 clones were sequenced for each sample. Analysis of Oct-4 Expression by RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Before synthesis of first strand cDNA, total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) to eliminate any residual genomic DNA. The mixture of total RNA was converted into first strand cDNA synthesis with random hexamer and SuperScript II™ First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with forward (5′-GGCGTTCGCTTTGGAAAGGTGTTC-3′) and reverse (5′-CTCGAACCACATCCTTCTCT-3′) primers to detect Oct-4 cDNA, whereas control detection of β-actin was performed with forward (5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCAA-3′) and reverse (5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′) primers. In the case of Oct-4, PCR reactions were performed under the following conditions: 95 °C, 30 s; 35 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 62 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min; final extension 72 °C, 5 min. For β-actin, PCR reactions were performed under the following condition: 95 °C, 30 s; 35 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 65 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min; final extension 72 °C, 5 min. Luciferase Reporter Assays—The 5′-flanking region of the Oct-4 gene including the proximal enhancer/promoter (–1524 to –30) was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of C57BL/6NCrj background, and the fragment was cloned into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Amplification of the reporter construct was carried out using the dam–,dcm– bacterial strain, SCS110 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which lacks two methylase found in Escherichia coli. To obtain methylated reporter, the construct was incubated with 3 units/μg SssI methylase (New England Biolabs (29Renbaum P. Abrahamove D. Fainsod A. Wilson G.G. Rottem S. Razin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)) in the presence of 160 μm S-adenosylmethionine at 37 °C for 3 h. Completion of the methylation was confirmed by resistance to HpaII digestion. NIH/3T3 cells plated at 2.5 × 104/well in a 24-well dish were incubated for 48 h and then were transfected transiently with 0.38 μgofthe luciferase reporter construct using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). To normalize the luciferase activity, 0.02 μg of a control plasmid having a Renilla luciferase sequence was co-transfected into the cells. In a parallel study, a mixture of 0.2 μg of the luciferase reporter construct and 0.2 μg of MeCP2 expression vectors was co-transfected into NIH/3T3 cells. The activities of both luciferases were determined using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were performed three times each in triplicate. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed using anti-acetylated histone H3 and H4 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY (30Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar)). In brief, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature to form DNA-protein cross-links. Each sample was then sonicated on ice and incubated with the antibodies at 4 °C overnight. PCR was performed with aliquots of the extracted DNA from the immunocomplexes for 28 cycles. The amount of each product was evaluated with an ethidium bromide-stained gel image using NIH Image 1.61 software. The following primers were used to amplify the Oct-4 proximal enhancer (Primer A), promoter (Primer B), and mouse β-actin: Primer A forward, 5′-GGAGGTGCAATGGCTGTCTTGTCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTGCCTTGGGTCACCTTACACCTCAC-3′; Primer B forward, 5′-GTGAGGTGTCGGTGACCCAAGGCAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGCGAGCGCTATCTGCCTGTGTC-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-AAATGCTGCACTGTGCGGCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGGCAACTTTCGGAACGGCG-3′, at an annealing temperature of 63, 66, and 63 °C, respectively. Breakdown of Oct-4 Gene Silencing by Treatments with Reagents Affecting Epigenetic Status—The Oct-4 gene is expressed only in restricted types of cells. The expression of Oct-4 was not detected in TS cells or in NIH/3T3 cells, even by RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 1). Similarly, the Oct-4 gene was silenced in other somatic tissues and cells (data not shown). Oct-4 mRNA became detectable in TS cells following treatment with 5-aza-dC, an inhibitor of DNA methylation, in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the Oct-4 expression was also observed in TS cells treated with an inhibitor of histone deacetylase 1, TSA. This suggests that Oct-4 gene activity is kept in the suppressed state in TS cells by DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling (Fig. 1A). The expression of Oct-4 in NIH/3T3 cells, however, was not attained by treatment with either 5-aza-dC or TSA alone. Interestingly, the combined treatment with 5-aza-dC and TSA effectively activated the Oct-4 gene in NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, DNA demethylation or histone acetylation alone was not sufficient to evoke Oct-4 transcription in NIH/3T3 cells. Nonetheless, the data suggests that the repression mechanism of the Oct-4 gene in Oct-4 non-expressing cells involves DNA methylation. If this was the case, then the 5′-flanking region of the Oct-4 gene is likely to be hypermethylated in cells or tissues in which the Oct-4 gene is silenced. DNA Methylation Status of the 5′-flanking Region of the Oct-4 Gene—The Oct-4 gene has two distinct enhancers, a distal enhancer (DE) and proximal enhancer (PE), which alternately drive the cell type-specific expression of the Oct-4 gene (31Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Schöler H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yoshimizu T. Sugiyama N. De Felice M. Yeom Y.I. Ohbo K. Masuko K. Obinata M. Abe K. Schöler H.R. Matsui Y. Dev. Growth Differ. 1999; 41: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DE is implicated in Oct-4 expression in preimplantation embryos, germ cells, ES and embryonic germ cells (31Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Schöler H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yoshimizu T. Sugiyama N. De Felice M. Yeom Y.I. Ohbo K. Masuko K. Obinata M. Abe K. Schöler H.R. Matsui Y. Dev. Growth Differ. 1999; 41: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is no CpG island at the 5′-region of the Oct-4 gene, although the promoter region is relatively rich in CpG dinucleotide sequences (Fig. 2A). There is one HpyCH4IV recognition site (at –4401 (Site 1)) and three TaqI sites (at –4028 (Site 2), –3030 (Site 3), and –2823 (Site 4)) in the DE, whereas PE has a site each for HpyCH4IV and TaqI at –638 (Site 5) and –314 (Site 6), respectively. In the promoter region, there is one HpyCH4IV site at –202 (Site 7) (Fig. 2A). We analyzed the DNA methylation status of the Oct-4 regulatory region by restriction mapping analysis, focusing on these seven recognition sites in ES cells, TS cells, and adult liver. In ES cells, PCR products generated for Site 1 were not digested with HpyCH4IV, indicating that the genomic DNA of ES cells was unmethylated at Site 1 (Fig. 2B). Similarly, PCR products including Site 2, Site 6, and Site 7 remained intact after restriction enzyme treatment in ES cells. Thus, it is clear that the Oct-4 locus was hypomethylated over a wide range of regulatory regions in ES cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in TS cells all PCR products were sensitive to enzymatic digestion. The overall percentage of CpG methylation was 37–91% (Fig. 2B). This clearly shows that the Oct-4 upstream region of TS cells was more highly methylated than that of ES cells (Fig. 2C). Likewise, in the liver, in which the Oct-4 gene is also silenced (data not shown), all recognition sites of restriction enzymes were digested, indicating that the Oct-4 is highly methylated over the regulatory regions in this tissue (54–94%) (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, there is a T-DMR covering the promoter, proximal, and distal enhancer regions of the Oct-4 gene (Fig. 2C). Importantly, the T-DMR was hypomethylated in ES cells that express the Oct-4 gene, whereas TS cells and the liver, which do not express Oct-4, have methylated T-DMR. DNA Methylation Profile of the Oct-4 Promoter Region—We further investigated the methylation status of each CpG immediately upstream of the Oct-4 gene containing the promoter region up to –470 bp from the translation start site (designated as +1) by sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing (Fig. 3A). There are 16 CpGs in this region, and the CpG density is higher than in other regions upstream of the Oct-4 gene (see diagram in Fig. 2A). In ES cells, the overall percentage of CpG methylation was only 5%, and the region is almost unmethylated. In contrast, the region was heavily methylated in TS cells, exhibiting 74% methylation. Similarly, the liver showed 74% methylation of CpGs. Thus, we confirmed that the promoter region of Oct-4 is hypomethylated in ES cells but hypermethylated in TS cells and liver. Taking these results together with those of the 5-aza-dC treatment, it is highly probable that Oct-4 gene expression is regulated through DNA methylation-mediated gene silencing. Repression of Oct-4 Regulatory Region Activity by DNA Methylation—The promoter activity of Oct-4 without the enhancer region was low (31Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Schöler H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed the reporter plasmid with the 5′-upstream region of Oct-4 containing the PE and promoter regions (–1527 to –30, Fig. 3B). The Oct-4 reporter construct showed 4.3-fold activity relative to that of the empty vector. The transcriptional activity of Oct-4 was dramatically reduced by in vitro DNA methylation. Thus, DNA methylation at the Oct-4 regulatory region elicited strong repression in Oct-4 transcription. Co-transfection of the reporter plasmid with MeCP2 expression vector also caused severe suppression. These data clearly demonstrated that the transcription of the Oct-4 gene was regulated through CpG methylation. Expression of Oct-4 in Dnmt1-deficient Mouse Placenta— Genome-wide demethylation has been observed in Dnmt1n/n mice, which exhibit ∼30% Dnmt1 activity compared with wild type (33Li E. Bestor T.H. Janisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). We assumed that the Oct-4 gene might be activated in Dnmt1-deficient mice if the Oct-4 promoter region is also demethylated in these mutants. We therefore analyzed the methylation status of the Oct-4 promoter region and the expression of Oct-4 in the placenta of Dnmt1n/n mice at 10.5 dpc (33Li E. Bestor T.H. Janisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). As expected, methylated CpGs in the Oct-4 promoter region comprise only 5% of the total CpGs in the placenta of Dnmt1n/n mice, whereas methylated CpGs comprise 43% in the placenta of wild type littermates (Fig. 4A). Importantly, the expression of Oct-4 mRNA was detected in the Dnmt1n/n placenta but not in wild type placenta (Fig. 4B). Expression of the Oct-4 gene was detectable in wild type embryos due to the presence of primordial germ cells that express the Oct-4 gene. Greatly reduced expression of Oct-4 in the mutant embryo may be due to retarded growth, particularly in the caudal region. Thus, aberrant DNA demethylation results in the ectopic expression of Oct-4 gene. Chromatin Structure of the Oct-4 Gene Enhancer/Promoter Region in ES and TS Cells—Methylation of CpG dinucleotide interferes with the binding of transcription factors (34Bird A. Cell. 1992; 70: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) and binding of MeCP2 and other methyl CpG-binding domain proteins physically obstructs the basal transcription machinery (35Nan X. Campoy F.J. Bird A. Cell. 1997; 88: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Alternatively, DNA methylation induces chromatin condensation following deacetylation by histone deacetylases associated with MeCP2 and methyl CpG-binding domain proteins (36Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the histone acetylation status in ES cells and TS cells at the PE and promoter region of the Oct-4 gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using antibodies that recognize acetylated histones H3 and H4 (Fig. 5). We designed two sets of primers from the Oct-4 PE (Primer A) and promoter (Primer B) regions (Fig. 5A). By ChIP assay using Primer A, enrichment of histone H3 acetylation in ES cells was more than 2-fold that of TS cells (Fig. 5, B and C), revealing that the acetylation status of histone H3 in the Oct-4 PE region was higher in ES cells than in TS cells. Furthermore, using Primer B, the acetylation status of histone H3 in ES cells was revealed to be more than three times that of TS cells, indicating that the Oct-4 promoter region was highly acetylated in ES cells compared with TS cells (Fig. 5, B and C). Similarly, the extent of histone H4 acetylation at both the Oct-4 PE and promoter was higher in ES cells than in TS cells. Thus, DNA methylation status is linked to the chromatin structure of the Oct-4 upstream region. We confirmed and expanded on the previous reports (3Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A.

This diversity can potentially be used to distinguish cells. We analyzed the Dscam mRNA isoforms expressed by different cell types and individual cells. The choice of splice variants expressed is regulated both spatially and temporally. Different subtypes of photoreceptors express broad yet distinctive spectra of Dscam isoforms. Single-cell RT-PCR documented that individual cells express several different Dscam isoforms and allowed an estimation of the diversity that is present. For example, we estimate that each R3/R4 photoreceptor cell expresses 14-50 distinct mRNAs chosen from the spectrum of thousands of splice variants distinctive of its cell type. Thus, the Dscam repertoire of each cell is different from those of its neighbors, providing a potential mechanism for generating unique cell identity in the nervous system and elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W1965531638,"The MDM2 oncogene has both p53-dependent and p53-independent activities. We have previously reported that antisense MDM2 inhibitors have significant anti-tumor activity in multiple human cancer models with various p53 statuses (Zhang, Z., Li, M., Wang, H., Agrawal, S., and Zhang, R. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 100, 11636–11641). We have also provided evidence that MDM2 has a direct role in the regulation of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Here we provide evidence supporting functional interaction between MDM2 and p21 in vitro and in vivo. The inhibition of MDM2 with anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotide or Short Interference RNA targeting MDM2 significantly elevated p21 protein levels in PC3 cells (p53 null). In contrast, overexpression of MDM2 diminished the p21 level in the same cells by shortening the p21 half-life, an effect reversed by MDM2 antisense inhibition. MDM2 facilitates p21 degradation independent of ubiquitination and the E3 ligase function of MDM2. Instead, MDM2 promotes p21 degradation by facilitating binding of p21 with the proteasomal C8 subunit. The physical interaction between p21 and MDM2 was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo with the binding region in amino acids 180–298 of the MDM2 protein. In summary, we provide evidence supporting a physical interaction between MDM2 and p21.

The Ring finger domain in the C terminus of MDM2, containing the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, is responsible for p53 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (14Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L.

Following MDM2 inhibition, induction of p21 was observed in human cancer cells or xenografts, regardless of p53 status (17Wang H. Nan L. Yu D. Agrawal S. Zhang R. Clin.

In the present work, we sought to attain a greater understanding of the interaction between MDM2 and p21. We demonstrated that MDM2 has direct activity in the degradation of p21 protein by directly binding to it and facilitating its interaction with the C8 subunit of 20 S proteasome, independent of both p53 and ubiquitination. We also have shown that p21 has an important role in the mechanism of action for MDM2 inhibitors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Reagents—The pCMV-MDM2 and pC53-SN3 vectors for the expression of human MDM2 and p53 were kindly provided by Dr. J. Chen (Moffitt Cancer Center). The human MDM2 cDNA insert was digested with BamHI and XhoI and subcloned into the same sites of pcDNA3 and pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences). The pcDNA3-Flag-MDM2 was a gift of Dr. Z. Ronai (Ruttenberg Cancer Center). Additional constructs expressing deletions of MDM2 protein were generated by proofreading PCR of pCMV-MDM2 using primers containing BamHI and NotI sites followed by ligation back into the pcDNA3-Flag-MDM2 digested with the same enzymes. The pcDNA3-p21 was kindly provided by Dr. C. Maki (Harvard University), and the plasmid expressing HA-tagged p21 protein was constructed with proofreading PCR in which the downstream primer contained a sequence encoding the HA epitope. To generate the vector expressing p21 protein in bacteria, human p21 cDNA insert was digested with BamHI and EcoRI from pcDNA3-p21 and subcloned into the same sites of pGEX-5X-2. pGEX-2T-C8 and pcDNA3-HA-ubiquitin were gifts of Dr. M. J. Allday (Imperial College) and Dr. Bert O'Malley (Baylor University), respectively. The vector for the expression of His-tagged ubiquitin was kindly provided by Dr. E. Flemington (Tulane University). To construct short interference RNA (siRNA) expression plasmids under the control of the U6 promoter, selected oligonucleotides were cloned into pBabe-U6 at BamHI and XhoI sites for expression of siRNA in vivo. One and two pairs of siRNA oligonucleotides from MDM2 and p21 were synthesized and cloned into pBabe-U6. The target sequence of the oligonucleotides for MDM2 knockdown (derived from the MDM2 gene, +937 to +955) is 5′-gaagcagtagcagtgaatc. The sequences of the oligonucleotides selected for p21 gene knockdown, +400 to +418 and +460 to +478, respectively, are 5′-gaccatgtggacctgtcac and 5′-gggtccccaggtggacctg. Puromycin, neomycin, cycloheximide, MG115, MG132, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cisplatin were purchased from Sigma. Anti-human MDM2 antisense oligonucleotide and its control were described previously (20Zhang Z. Li M. Wang H. Agrawal S. Zhang R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11636-11641Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).Cell Lines—PC3 cells were maintained as described previously (20Zhang Z. Li M. Wang H. Agrawal S. Zhang R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11636-11641Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. To establish MDM2, p21, and MDM2 plus p21 stable knockdown PC3 cell lines, PC3 cells were transfected with pBabe-U6-MDM2 and/or pBabe-U6-p21. Positive cell clones were selected, maintained with puromycin (1.2 μg/ml), and confirmed by immunoblotting. For the stable MDM2 overexpressing PC3 cell line, PC3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-MDM2 followed by the addition of a selective reagent, neomycin (450 μg/ml). The positive clones were confirmed by immunoblotting and maintained in medium containing neomycin.Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 5% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After preclearance by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the extracts were incubated with appropriate antibodies as ndicated in the figures at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplex was captured by protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), which were washed five times with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by 5×SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and detected by the appropriate antibodies indicated in the figures.In Vitro Translation—MDM2 and p21 proteins were synthesized in vitro from corresponding vectors in reticulocyte lysates using the TnT T7 polymerase quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega).Recombination Protein Preparation and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull Down Assay—The plasmids pGEX-2T-C8, pGEX-5X-2-MDM2, pGEX-5X-2-p21, or empty vector were transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) (Promega) and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma). Bacterial pellets were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 5% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and then were sonicated for 2 min. The fusion proteins and GST protein were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads, eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm glutathione), and quantified with a Coomassie protein assay kit (Pierce).To determine whether there is a direct physical binding between MDM2 protein and p21 protein in vitro, GST-MDM2 or GST-p21 protein (1 μg) was incubated with in vitro transcribed and translated p21 or MDM2 protein in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5% (v/v) protease inhibitors) at 4 °C for 2 h. The bound proteins were captured by glutathione-Sepharose beads, which were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, eluted with 5×SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 10 min, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and detected with p21 antibody (Oncogene) or MDM2 antibody (Oncogene). The same procedures were performed to detect p21 protein binding to GST-C8 protein. The cell lysates, with the same amounts of proteins, were incubated with identical amounts of GST-C8 or GST protein at 4 °C overnight. The bound protein also was detected by p21 antibody.Ubiquitination Assay—PC3 cells were transfected with various vectors (indicated in the figures). After 40 h, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with p21 or p53 antibody (Oncogene), and the bound proteins were purified with protein G-Sepharose beads, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and detected by ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz).Ni-NTA-Agarose Purification—Cells were lysed in buffer A (6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.1 m Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole). The cell lysates were incubated with 50 μl of Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) for 3 h at room temperature; this was followed by the intense washing of beads with buffer A and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mm imidazole. The bound proteins were eluted by 5×SDS sample buffer supplemented with 200 mm imidazole at 100 °C for 5 min, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and detected by the appropriate antibodies.Apoptosis and Bromouridine Cell Proliferation Assay—The methods described previously (20Zhang Z. Li M. Wang H. Agrawal S. Zhang R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11636-11641Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) were utilized.Clonogenic Assay—Cells were treated with cisplatin or 5-FU at various concentrations for 36 h. After being rinsed with fresh medium, cells were allowed to grow for 10–14 days to form colonies.Cell Viability Assay—Cells were treated with cisplatin or 5-FU for 24 h and then washed with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline (37 °C); this was followed by trypsinization. Following incubation with 0.4% trypan blue (1:1, v/v) for 3 min at room temperature, viable cells were counted in a 0.1-mm deep hemacytometer (Reichert).RESULTSMDM2 Protein Reduces p21 Protein Stability Independent of p53 and Ubiquitination—The effect of MDM2 on p21 protein was first investigated in PC3 (p53 null) cells by using anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotide (AS) or siRNA to knock down MDM2 expression. Following MDM2 inhibition, p21 was activated, and there was an inverse relationship between the level of MDM2 and that of p21 (Fig. 1, A1 and A2). In contrast, stably overexpressing MDM2 led to a remarkable decrease in p21 protein (Fig. 1, A3). To test whether p21 degradation is proteasome-dependent and whether MDM2-induced p21 degradation can be reversed by inhibition of proteasome, PC3 cells overexpressing MDM2 were treated with the proteasome inhibitors MG115 or MG132. In cells transfected with corresponding empty vector, the level of endogenous p21 protein was increased following exposure to proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 1B). The effect of MDM2 overexpression on p21 degradation was partially reversed by proteasome inhibitors or by the anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B). In a separate experiment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, overexpression of MDM2 increased the turnover rate of p21 by greater than 50% relative to the corresponding empty vector controls (Fig. 1, C1 and C2).To determine whether MDM2 facilitates p21 ubiquitination through its E3 ligase function, PC3 cells were co-transfected with MDM2 and ubiquitin. Minimal levels of ubiquitinated p21 were observed (Fig. 2, A1). In this experiment, MDM2 promoted the ubiquitination of p53, which was used as a positive control (Fig. 2, A2). To confirm that MDM2 does not facilitate p21 ubiquitination and to exclude possible leaking signals of IgG, PC3 cells were transfected with p21 and MDM2 and with His-tagged ubiquitin in different combinations (as indicated in Fig. 2, B1), followed by the treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132. Ubiquitinated p21 was purified by Ni-NTA beads and probed by p21 antibody. Consistent with the results above, MDM2 did not facilitate p21 ubiquitination (Fig. 2, B1). However, ectopically expressed p53 was observed to be ubiquitinated in PC3 cells with co-transfected MDM2 (Fig. 2, B2). Because p21 protein can bind directly to the C8 subunit of the 20 S proteolytic core of the 26 S proteasome and is degraded by purified 20 S proteasome in vitro (21Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that MDM2 has a direct effect on this process. When cell lysates of MDM2 and/or p21 overexpressed PC3 cells were incubated with GST-C8 in vitro, p21 bound to C8 only in the lysates of cells co-transfected with MDM2 and p21 (Fig. 2C), supporting the notion that MDM2 facilitates p21-C8 interaction. To establish that the effect of MDM2 on p21 protein stability is independent of its E3 ligase function, an MDM2 deletion protein lacking the Ring finger domain (where E3 ligase activity resides) was constructed (Fig. 2, D1). This deletion protein (Deletion A) retained the capacity to reverse endogenous p21 stabilization by MG132 (Fig. 2, D2) but failed to decrease the co-transfected p53 protein level (Fig. 2, D3).Fig. 2MDM2 facilitates p21 degradation independent of its E3 ligase function.A, overexpressed MDM2 induces ubiquitination of p53 protein but not p21 protein. A1, PC3 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for MDM2 and/or ubiquitin for 40 h. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by p21 antibody and then were immunoblotted with ubiquitin antibody or p21 antibody. A2, PC3 cells were overexpressed with MDM2 and ubiquitin with or without p53 for 40 h, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by p53 antibody; this was followed by immunoblotting with ubiquitin or p53 antibody. B1, PC3 cells were transfected with vectors of p21, MDM2, or His-ubiquitin (Ub) or in various combinations of the three vectors for 40 h. This was followed by incubation with MG132 (15 μm) for an additional 8 h. Whole cell lysates were incubated with Ni-NTA beads. Bound proteins were eluted, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and detected with p21 or MDM2 antibody. B2, PC3 cells were transfected with MDM2 and His-ubiquitin (Ub) with or without p53 for 48 h; whole cell lysates were incubated with Ni-NTA beads. Bound proteins were eluted and resolved on SDS-PAGE, and ubiquitinated MDM2 or p53 was detected by MDM2 or p53 antibody. C, MDM2 protein facilitates p21 protein binding to the proteasome C8 subunit in vitro. C1, PC3 cells were overexpressed with MDM2 with or without p21 for 48 h, and the cell lysates were incubated overnight with equal amounts (4 μg) of bacterially expressed GST-C8 fusion protein. The bound p21 protein was captured by glutathione-Sepharose beads, resolved on SDS-PAGE (15%), and detected by p21 antibody (upper panel). The p21 protein expression levels in the whole cell lysates (Input) were also detected by immunoblotting (lower panel). C2, cell lysates of PC3 cells transfected with MDM2 and p21 expression vectors for 48 h were incubated overnight with equal amounts (4 μg) of GST-C8 fusion protein or GST protein. The bound p21 protein was resolved on SDS-PAGE (15%) and detected by p21 antibody (upper panel) in parallel with the p21 protein level in the whole cell lysates (lower panel). D, the capacity of MDM2 protein to decrease p21 protein stability is independent of its E3 ligase function. D1, the schematic shows the comparison of the schematic structures of full-length MDM2 protein and its Ring finger domain-deleted protein (MDM2 Deletion A). D2, endogenous p21 protein level in PC3 cells overexpressed with MDM2 or MDM2 Deletion A (40 h) followed by the treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μm, 8 h) was detected by immunoblotting. D3, PC3 cells overexpressed with MDM2 or MDM2 Deletion A with p53 for 40 h. MDM2, p53, and β-actin proteins were detected by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There Is Direct Physical Binding between MDM2 and p21 Proteins—In the immunoprecipitation experiments with endogenous proteins, whole cell lysates of PC3 cells were precipitated by p21 antibody (Fig. 3, A1) or MDM2 antibody (Fig. 3, A2), which was followed by immunoblotting with MDM2 antibody or p21 antibody; these results demonstrate a direct physical interaction between p21 and MDM2. To confirm this finding, MDM2-Flag- and/or p21-HA-expressing vectors were transfected into COS-1 cells. To detect bound proteins, the whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 3, B1) or anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3, B2). The bound proteins were detected by anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3, B1) or anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 3, B2), confirming that the interaction of the two proteins was detected only following co-transfection (Fig. 3, B1 and B2).Fig. 3There is physical interaction between p21 and MDM2 proteins.A, physical binding between endogenous MDM2 and p21 proteins was detected in PC3 cells. Immunoblotting (IB) for whole cell extracts (Extr.) or immunoprecipitates (IP) with the p21 antibody (A1) and MDM2 antibody (A2) in parallel with immunoprecipitates with the non-immune IgG was performed with MDM2/p21 antibody (A1) or p21/MDM2 antibody (A2). B, COS-1 cells were overexpressed with MDM2-Flag protein with or without p21-HA protein for 24 h. Immunoblotting for whole cell extracts or immunoprecipitates with the Flag antibody (B1) or HA antibody (B2) was performed with HA/MDM2 antibody (B1) or Flag/p21 antibody (B2). C, the Flag-tagged MDM2 protein and its truncated forms bind to the p21 protein in COS-1 cells. C1, this representation shows the schematic structures of MDM2 and its deletion proteins. C2, COS-1 cells were transfected with p21-HA alone or with Flag-tagged MDM2 full-length protein or its deletions for 24 h followed by immunoprecipitation with Flag antibody. The bound protein was resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with HA antibody. D, MDM2 deletion mutant (Deletion D), lacking the binding site for p21 (amino acids 180 to 298), is not capable of inducing p21 degradation. PC3 cells were transfected with full-length MDM2 or Δ180–298 mutant for 40 h, which was followed by the incubation with MG132 for an additional 8 h. Target proteins were detected by immunoblotting. E, MDM2 protein binds to the p21 protein in vitro. E1, GST-MDM2 (upper panel) or GST-p21 (lower panel) expressed in bacteria, purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and detected by MDM2 or p21 antibody. E2, GST-MDM2 (1 μg) (upper panel) or GST-p21 (1 μg) (lower panel) was incubated with in vitro transcribed and translated p21 protein (upper panel) or MDM2 protein (lower panel) at 4 °C for 2 h. The bound proteins were isolated by glutathione-Sepharose beads, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and detected by p21 antibody (upper panel) or MDM2 antibody (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The binding domains on the MDM2 protein were mapped by immunoprecipitation with full-length and a series of truncated MDM2 proteins. The region between amino acids 180 and 297 was involved in MDM2 binding to the p21 protein (Fig. 3, C1 and C2). To further stress the importance of the binding between MDM2 and p21 proteins in the process of p21 degradation, the Δ180–298 MDM2 mutant was constructed. This mutant MDM2 protein was not capable of inducing p21 degradation (Fig. 3D). To exclude the possibility that the observed interaction between p21 and MDM2 proteins occurs in a complex form involving multiple protein partners in the cell, a pull down assay was accomplished by using bacterially expressed GST-MDM2 or GST-p21 protein and in vitro synthesized p21 or MDM2 protein, respectively. Direct binding between the two proteins was detected (Fig. 3E), indicating that the binding does not require participation of other proteins.p21 Has an Important Role in MDM2 Knockdown-induced Cell Growth Inhibition and Chemosensitization—Our previous studies demonstrated that, in cell culture and in xenograft models of human cancers, MDM2 inhibition resulted in significant anti-tumor activity and chemosensitization effects (17Wang H.

In this work, we attempted to clarify the role that p21 may play in the biological activity of MDM2 knockdown. The parental and p21 knockdown PC3 cells were treated with the anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotide (Fig. 4, A1). The p21 knockdown cells were less sensitive to the MDM2 antisense treatment than parental cells. At a concentration of 200 nm AS, the proliferation index was 120% higher than that of parental cells (Fig. 4, A2).Fig. 4p21 has a role in the tumor inhibitory and chemosensitization effects induced by MDM2 inhibition.A, p21 knockdown (p21 KD) PC3 cells were resistant to the decreased cell proliferation effects of MDM2 inhibition compared with parent cells. p21 knockdown and parent PC3 cells were treated with various concentrations of AS for 48 h, followed by immunoblotting (A1) or cell proliferation assay (A2). B, C, D, and E, chemosensitization effects were reduced in MDM2 and p21 double knockdown PC3 cells compared with MDM2 knockdown (MDM2 KD) PC3 cells. The p21 and MDM2 protein levels were detected in MDM2 knockdown, p21 knockdown, MDM2 and p21 double knockdown, and parent PC3 cells treated with cisplatin (B1) or 5-FU (B2) for 24 h followed by immunoblotting.

However, the precise mechanism of the regulation of TRPC channel activity remains unknown. Here, we provide the first evidence that direct tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is a novel mechanism for modulating TRPC6 channel activity. We found that TRPC6 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in COS-7 cells when coexpressed with Fyn, a member of the Src family PTKs. We also found that Fyn interacts with TRPC6 and that the interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Fyn and the N-terminal region of TRPC6 in a phosphorylation-independent manner. In addition, we demonstrated the physical association of TRPC6 with Fyn in the mammalian brain. Moreover, we showed that stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 in COS-7 cells. This epidermal growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 was significantly blocked by PP2, a specific inhibitor of Src family PTKs, and by a dominant negative form of Fyn, suggesting that the direct phosphorylation of TRPC6 by Src family PTKs could be caused by physiological stimulation. Furthermore, using single channel recording, we showed that Fyn modulates TRPC6 channel activity via tyrosine phosphorylation.

Various growth factors or hormones can induce activation of phospholipase C (PLC), 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; TRP, transient receptor potential; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; OAG, oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; SH2, Src homology domain 2; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; TRP, transient receptor potential; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; OAG, oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; SH2, Src homology domain 2; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor. production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), and Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane (1Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Google Scholar). This PLC-dependent Ca2+ influx is thought to play important roles in many physiological functions, such as cell proliferation and apoptosis, T cell activation, and the maturation and functions of B cells (3Venkatachalam K. Van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to understand regulation of such PLC-dependent Ca2+ channels, because modulation of the channel activities can profoundly affect these various physiological processes. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channel superfamily has emerged as candidates responsible for such a PLC-dependent Ca2+ influx. The TRP channel superfamily can be divided into at least three subfamilies of Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels (TRPC, TRPV, and TRPM families), having closely related structures comprised of six transmembrane domains, a large NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, and a COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain (4Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Google Scholar). Among the three subfamilies, TRPC channels are one of the molecules that have been extensively characterized. The TRPC channel family is composed of seven non-selective ion channels that can be divided into four subgroups (TRPC1; TRPC4 and -5; TRPC3, -6, and -7; and TRPC2) based on their amino acid sequences and functional similarities (4Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Google Scholar, 5Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2001; http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/RE1Google Scholar, 6Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Google Scholar). Recent investigations have extensively studied the regulation of TRPC channel activity. TRPC1, -4, and -5 appear to be activated through a store-operated mechanism (7Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Google Scholar, 8Philipp S.

Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Google Scholar) and are activated when a gated conformational change in the IP3 receptors or ryanodine receptors is sensed. Calmodulin (CaM) directly binds to TRPC3 and TRPC6 in a Ca2+-dependent manner, thereby reducing channel activity (15Boulay G. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 201-207Google Scholar, 16Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Google Scholar). DAG directly activates TRPC3, -6, and -7 channel activities (17Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Google Scholar, 18Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27359-27370Google Scholar). More recently, it is reported that Homer, a scaffolding protein, binds TRPC1 and regulates gating of TRPC1 by IP3 receptors (19Yuan J.P. Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Chen J. Shcheynikov N. Kang S.H. Dehoff M.H. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H. Muallem S. Worley P.F. Cell. 2003; 114: 777-789Google Scholar). However, considering that the TRPC channels appear to be organized into macromolecular assemblies (5Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2001; http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/RE1Google Scholar), several unidentified mechanisms that regulate TRPC channel activities are thought to exist. The activation of various growth factors and hormonal receptors that stimulate the TRPC channel through PLC activation may also induce tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins. Here, we provide evidence that direct tyrosine phosphorylation by Fyn is a novel mechanism for modulating TRPC6 channel properties. We found that Fyn physically interacts with and directly phosphorylates TRPC6 in COS-7 cells. Src, another type of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) also phosphorylates TRPC6 in vitro and in COS-7 cells. We also found that tyrosine phosphorylation on TRPC6 was caused by the stimulation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and that this tyrosine phosphorylation event was absolutely diminished by inhibition of Src family PTK activity. Moreover, we showed that tyrosine phosphorylation increases TRPC6 channel activity. Our results suggest that Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation enhances DAG-induced TRPC6 channel activity, resulting in a more efficient calcium influx through the TRPC6 channel upon EGF receptor stimulation. Culture—COS-7 cells, CHO-K1, and HEK 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin. HEK 293 cells stably expressing TRPC6 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 400 μg/ml G418, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (20Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29672-29680Google Scholar). DNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—Mouse TRPC6 expression vector (pcDNA3-TRPC6) was constructed as follows. The EcoRI-BamHI fragment encoding mouse TRPC6 cDNA was excised from TRPC6-HA/pVL139 (a kind gift from Dr. M. Zhu). The fragment was inserted into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pcDNA3 expression vector (Clontech). The NH2-terminal deletion mutant of TRPC6 (Δ1–388 amino acids) was constructed as follows. TRPC6 cDNA in the EcoRI-BamHI site of pBluescriptII SK- was cut with BamHI and NdeI and a double strand DNA encoding the HA tag (sense: 5′-GATCCATGTATCCTTATGACGTCCCAGACTATGCTAGCTCCA-3′, antisense 5′-TATGGAGCTAGCATAGTCTGGGACGTCATAAGGATACATG-3′) was inserted between the sites. The truncated TRPC6 fragment in pBluescriptII was excised with BamHI and EcoRI, and transferred into the BamHI-EcoRI restriction site of pcDNA3. The COOH-terminal truncated mutant of TRPC6 (Δ634–930 amino acids) was constructed as follows. The TRPC6 expression vector (pcDNA3-TRPC6) was cut with EcoRV and ApaI, and a double strand oligo DNA-encoding HA tag (sense: 5′-ATCTATCCTTATGACGTCCCAGACTATGCCTGAGGGCC-3′, antisense: 5′-CTCAGGCATAGTCTGGGACGTCATAAGGATAGAT-3′) was ligated to the sites. For the construction of the TRPC6-EGFP expression vector, the DNA fragment of mouse TRPC6 was amplified using two primers (sense primer: 5′-CCGAATTCGATGAGCCAGAGCCCGAGG-3′, underline: EcoRI site; and antisense primer: 5′-CCGTCGACTCTGCGGCTTTCCTCCAGCTTTG-3′, underline: SalI site), Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and pCMV-TRPC6 as a template. PCR cycles used were: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 53 °C, and 3 min at 68 °C for 25 cycles. After digested with EcoRI and SalI, the amplified fragment was inserted into the restriction site between EcoRI and SalI of pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech). The nucleotide sequences of these constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression vectors encoding wild-type and various mutants of Fyn kinase (pME-FynYF and pME-FynKM) and plasmids encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion with the SH2 or SH3 regions of Fyn were kind gifts from Dr. T. Yamamoto (21Fusaki N. Matsuda S. Nishizumi H. Umemori H. Yamamoto T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1369-1377Google Scholar). Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—The cells (5 × 106) in 6-cm dishes were transfected with total of 3 μg of various plasmids encoding HA-tagged TRPC6, TRPC6-GFP, Fyn YF, or Fyn KM by the lipid method using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 36 h, cells were lysed with 1.0 ml of TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm Na3VO4) for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Then, 5 μg of appropriate antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (MBL), mouse monoclonal anti-Fyn antibodies (Wako Biochemicals), or rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPC6 antibody (Chemicon)) and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose were added to the supernatants. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the resultant immunocomplexes were washed 5 times with the same buffer. For immunoblotting, the precipitated proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was treated with the blocking solution (0.05% Tween/PBS) containing 5.0% skim milk, and probed with the indicated primary antibodies. The antibodies were used at the following concentrations: rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (1.0 μg/ml, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), rabbit polyclonal anti-Fyn antibody (1.0 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biochemicals), and mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1.0 μg/ml, MBL). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (from donkey) or anti-mouse IgG (from sheep) antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), the immobilized specific antigen was visualized with ECL plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). For the detection of tyrosine phosphorylation, the membrane filter was treated with blocking reagents containing 5.0% bovine serum albumin and probed with an anti-PY antibody (RC-20, Chemicon International, Inc.). Preparation of Rat Brain Microsomal Fractions—Rat brains were dissected and homogenized in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5)). The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min and the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer. Three hundred micrograms of the soluble proteins in TNE buffer were used for immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of the appropriate antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPC6 antibody (Chemicon), mouse monoclonal anti-synaptophysin antibody (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-Src antibody (Sigma), rabbit normal IgG, rabbit polyclonal anti-Fyn antibody (Sigma)) and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed five times with TNE buffer. Immunoblotting was performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPC6 antibody (Chemicon) as described above. EGF Stimulation—The COS-7 cells transiently expressing HA-tagged TRPC6 were serum starved for 1.5 h in PBS containing 1.0 mm Ca2+ and 0.8 mm Mg2+ to reduce the basal tyrosine phosphorylation level of TRPC6. For the inhibition of Src family PTKs or EGFR, the cells were treated with 4 μm PP2, a chemically synthesized specific Src family PTKs inhibitor (Calbiochem) for the last 15 min or 10 μm AG1478 (Calbiochem) for the last 10 min. Then, the cells were stimulated with 200 ng/ml EGF (Sigma) for 1, 3, or 5 min. The cells were quickly washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with 1 ml of TNE buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. In Vitro Kinase Assay—COS-7 cells (5 × 106) were transfected with HA-tagged TRPC6 expression vector, and lysed with TNE buffer containing 0.5% SDS and then diluted with 4 volumes of TNE buffer. HA-TRPC6 was immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunoprecipitated HA-tagged TRPC6 was incubated with 3 units/ml Fyn (UBI) in the kinase buffer (40 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2,10 μm ATP) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing 3 times with TNE buffer, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Transfected CHO-K1 cells with HA-TRPC6 and wild-type Fyn grown on glass coverslips were washed once with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked in 5% skim milk/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and mouse monoclonal anti-Fyn antibody (Wako) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS for 15 min, the coverslips were stained with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS for 15 min, the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and observed under IX-70 confocal fluorescence microscopy (Olympus). In Vitro Binding Assay—HEK 293T cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmids encoding HA-tagged TRPC6. After 36 h, the cells were lysed with 1.0 ml of TNE buffer, and the cell lysates were incubated with 10 μg of the GST fusions with various regions of Fyn (21Fusaki N. Matsuda S. Nishizumi H. Umemori H. Yamamoto T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1369-1377Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing three times, the protein complexes were subjected to immunoblotting. Single Channel Recording—Ionic currents through single TRPC6 channels were recorded from inside-out patches excised from HEK 293 cells stably expressing TRPC6 using a method as reported previously (17Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Google Scholar). Borosilicate glass pipettes (4–5 megaohms) filled with an extracellular solution (120 mm CsCl, 5.87 mm calcium gluconate, 1.0 mm magnesium gluconate, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Cytoplasmic faces of excised patches were perfused with an intracellular solution (120 mm sodium isothionate, 5.87 mm calcium gluconate, 1.0 mm magnesium gluconate, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 100 μm 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) (Calbiochem). For the analysis of the effect of Fyn on the channels, the intracellular solution was changed with the solution containing 100 μm OAG, 3 unit/ml recombinant wild-type Fyn (UBI), and 100 μm ATP. For boiled Fyn, Fyn boiled for 10 min in a water bath was used. The membrane patches were voltage-clamped at -60 mV with an Axopatch 200A amplifer (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Single channel currents were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz by a filter with Bessel characteristics (48 db/octave) (model 3625, NF Instruments), sampled at 10 kHz, displayed, and stored in a Macintosh computer with custom-made software, TI work bench (developed by T. Inoue). Data were analyzed by Patch Analyst Pro software (version 1.16, MT Corp) after digital filtering at 500 Hz and baseline adjustments. As reported previously (17Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Google Scholar, 22Jung S. Muhle A. Schaefer M. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3562-3571Google Scholar), duration of single channel events of TRPC6 elicited by application of OAG were typically too short to determine the TRPC6 single channel conductance. Therefore, we decided to express the channel activity as mean current of TRPC6 (pA/s). All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22-24 °C). Fyn Interacts with and Directly Phosphorylates the TRPC6 Channel—As various ion channel activities are regulated by direct tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family PTKs (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, K+ channels, etc.) (23Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 233-235Google Scholar, 24Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Google Scholar), we set out to examine whether TRPC channels are tyrosine phosphorylated by Src family PTKs. For this, we transiently expressed HA-tagged TRPC6 along with a constitutively active form of Fyn (Fyn YF), one of the Src family PTKs, in COS-7 cells and examined tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6. When we expressed HA-tagged TRPC6 in COS-7 cells, we detected TRPC6 as a glycosylated broad band migrating between 100 and 150 kDa that was absent in control COS-7 cells, as reported previously (Fig. 1A, a) (20Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29672-29680Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of TRPC6 from the cell lysates followed by immunoblotting with antibody to phosphotyrosine revealed that TRPC6 is efficiently tyrosine-phosphorylated by Fyn (Fig. 1A, a). To neglect the possibility that the observed tyrosine-phosphorylated band was a TRPC6-associated protein, we constructed a fusion protein of TRPC6 with EGFP (TRPC6-EGFP) that had a higher molecular mass (∼150 kDa) than HA-tagged TRPC6 (∼100 kDa). We next transiently expressed TRPC6-EGFP along with Fyn YF in COS-7 cells and examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6-GFP. If TRPC6 is really phosphorylated by Fyn, the tyrosine-phosphorylated band should be detected at a molecular mass of TRPC6-GFP (∼150 kDa). As shown in Fig. 1A, b,we observed the decreased motility of both the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein and TRPC6-EGFP (lane 2) compared with HA-tagged TRPC6 (lane 1), strongly supporting the idea that TRPC6 was tyrosine phosphorylated by Fyn. Moreover, an in vitro kinase assay showed that recombinant Fyn directly tyrosine phosphorylates TRPC6 (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results demonstrated that Fyn directly tyrosine phosphorylates the TRPC6 channel. We also observed tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 by Src, another member of the Src family PTKs, in vitro and in COS-7 cells (data not shown). To examine the physical interaction between Fyn and TRPC6, we transiently expressed HA-tagged TRPC6 along with either Fyn KM or Fyn YF in COS-7 cells, and tested for their phosphorylation-dependent interactions by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies to HA and Fyn. Fyn coimmunoprecipitated with TRPC6 at similar levels irrespective of the phosphorylation state of TRPC6 (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8). Conversely, the result of co-immunoprecipitation using anti-Fyn antibodies showed that TRPC6 is precipitated with Fyn, confirming the physical interaction between TRPC6 and Fyn (Fig. 1D). As a control experiment, no TRPC6 was observed in the immunoprecipitates with normal control IgG, indicating the specific interaction of TRPC6 with Fyn (Fig. 1D). Thus, these results indicate that Fyn constitutively interacts with TPRC6 regardless of the tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6. Co-localization of TRPC6 with Fyn in Heterologously Expressed Cells—To further confirm the physical interaction of TRPC6 with Fyn, we examined the subcellular localization of TRPC6 and wild-type Fyn in heterologously expressed cells using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, we found that the immunoreactivities of both TRPC6 and Fyn were observed at or near the plasma membrane in the transfected cells and extensively overlapped each other. These data strongly support the physical interaction of TRPC6 with Fyn. Identification of the Sites That Are Responsible for TRPC6-Fyn Interaction—To determine the region responsible for TRPC6-Fyn interaction, we performed an in vitro binding assay using GST fusion proteins with the Src homology 2 (SH2) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of Fyn (GST-Fyn-SH2 and GST-Fyn-SH3). Pull-down experiments performed on lysates of HEK 293T cells expressing TRPC6 using these GST fusion proteins showed that TRPC6 is efficiently precipitated with GST-Fyn-SH2, but not with GST-Fyn-SH3 and GST alone (Fig. 3A). To determine the region of TRPC6 necessary for Fyn binding, we constructed deletion mutants of TRPC6 lacking either the NH2- or COOH-terminal cytoplasmic regions as shown in Fig. 3B, and performed in vitro binding experiments using GST-Fyn-SH2. As shown in Fig. 3C, whereas the COOH-terminal deletion mutant of TRPC6 still bound to GST-Fyn-SH2, the NH2-terminal deletion mutant of TRPC6 no longer did so. Taken together, these results indicate the TRPC6-Fyn association to be dependent on the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic region of TRPC6 and the SH2 domain of Fyn. Interaction between TRPC6 and Fyn in the Mammalian Brain—To demonstrate that TRPC6 associates with Src family PTKs in vivo, we prepared microsome fractions from rat brain and examined their interaction by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. We used TRPC6 antibody that efficiently recognized both HA-tagged TRPC6 exogeneously expressed in COS cells and endogeneous TRPC6 in the brain lysate (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, TRPC6 was coimmunoprecipitated with Fyn from brain lysates (lane 5). We also found that TRPC6 interacted with Src, another member of the Src family PTKs, in rat brain (lane 4). As a control, no TRPC6 was detected in the immunoprecipitates either with control IgG (lane 1) or with anti-synaptophysin antibody, a presynaptic vesicle protein (lane 2). Thus, TRPC6 interacts with Fyn in the mammalian brain. Stimulation of the EGF Receptor Induces Rapid Tyrosine Phosphorylation of TRPC6 through the Activation of Src Family PTKs Activation—To examine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of the TRPC6 channel was occurring in response to physiological stimuli, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 following EGF stimulation in COS-7 cells. We found that EGF application rapidly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 within 1 min (Fig. 5A, lanes 6 and 7). As a control experiment, no tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was detected in immunoprecipitates from non-transfected control COS-7 cells stimulated with EGF for 3 min (Fig. 5A, lane 8). Pretreatment of cells with an inhibitor of EGF receptor (EGFR), AG1478, significantly inhibited the TRPC6 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that TRPC6 is tyrosine phosphorylated following EGF stimulation in COS-7 cells. Because EGFR itself has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and can also activate Src family PTKs via its downstream signaling pathways (25Mariotti A. Kedeshian P.A. Dans M. Curatola A.M. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 447-458Google Scholar), there are at least two possible mechanisms for the EGF-induced TRPC6 tyrosine phosphorylation: (i) direct tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 by the EGFR; or (ii) tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 by Src family PTKs activated by the EGFR. To assess the involvement of Src family PTKs in the EGF-induced TRPC6 tyrosine phosphorylation, we treated TRPC6 expressing COS-7 cells with PP2, a specific inhibitor of Src family PTKs, before EGF application. PP2 treatment dramatically reduced EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 (Fig. 5C, lane 8). Moreover, EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 was completely abolished by co-expression of a kinase negative form of Fyn (Fyn KM), one of the Src family PTKs (Fig. 5D, lane 8). EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation level of the cell lysates from PP2-treated and Fyn KM-expressed COS cells was similarly increased as compared with the control cell lysate, suggesting that neither PP2 treatment nor expression of Fyn KM interfered with EGFR activation (Fig. 5, C, lanes 2 and 4, and D, lanes 2 and 4). Indeed, this was confirmed by the evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR after EGF stimulation was similarly detected, irrespective of the presence of PP2 or Fyn KM expression (Fig. 5E). Our findings thus suggest that EGFR activation leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 through activation of Src family PTKs. Fyn Modulates TRPC6 Channel Activity via Tyrosine Phosphorylation—To explore the functional effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on the TRPC6 channel, we next examined the effect of Fyn on the channel properties of TRPC6 using an inside-out patch clamp recording technique. As previously reported (17Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Google Scholar), the TRPC6 channel opening events occurred, when OAG (100 μm) was applied to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane patch excised from stably TRPC6 expressing HEK 293 cells (Fig. 6B). No similar channel events were detected from control HEK 293 cells (n = 7). Generally, the opening events of TRPC6 channels increased gradually after 100 μm OAG application, reached the maximum within 40 s, and declined gradually thereafter as shown in Fig. 6C, a (n = 7). Therefore, we applied Fyn to the TRPC6 channel at 45 s after the start of recording, while examining the effect of Fyn on TRPC6 channel activity, as illustrated in Fig. 6A. Application of Fyn (3 units/ml) and 100 μm ATP to the cytoplasmic face of the patch from TRPC6 expressing cells substantially increased channel activity (n = 6) (Fig. 6, B and C, b). Because application of Fyn, OAG, and ATP to the cytoplasmic face of the patch excised from control HEK 293 cells did not result in similar events (data not shown, n = 7), the increase in events presumably resulted from the modification of TRPC6 channel events altered by Fyn. Application of 100 μm ATP alone (n = 3) or boiled Fyn and ATP (n = 8) caused no significant change in TRPC6 channel activity, which excluded the possible involvement of any other kinases or a direct effect by ATP (Fig. 6C, c and e). Moreover, application of Fyn without ATP did not change TRPC6 channel activity (n = 6) (Fig. 6C, d), strongly suggesting the increased TRPC6 channel activity to be because of tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 by Fyn rather than the physical association with Fyn. Fig. 6D shows the -fold increases in TRPC6 channel activity expressed as a relative increase of mean amplitude (M.A.2/M.A.1); OAG, 0.93 ± 0.34 (n = 7); OAG + Fyn + ATP, 2.91 ± 0.79 (n = 6); OAG + ATP, 0.93 ± 0.31 (n = 3); OAG + Fyn - ATP, 1.32 ± 0.13 (n = 6); OAG + boiled Fyn + ATP, 1.31 ± 0.29 (n = 8). Thus, our findings clearly demonstrate that Fyn increases TRPC6 channel activity via tyrosine phosphorylation. Here, we describe the first evidence that Fyn tyrosine kinase physically interacts with TRPC6 and increases TRPC6 channel activity via tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, we also show that this tyrosine phosphorylation event occurs rapidly in response to EGF receptor stimulation in COS-7 cells. Thus, two simultaneous events, opening by DAG and modulation by Fyninduced tyrosine phosphorylation, are thought to contribute to the efficient influx of calcium through the TRPC6 channel upon EGF stimulation. Recent studies have shown that several protein kinases are involved in the regulation of Drosophila TRP channels and some non-classical and classical TRP-related cation channels. TRPV1 activity is modulated by protein kinase C (26Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A potentiates TRPV1 by direct phosphorylation (27Bhave G. Zhu W. Wang H. Brasier D.J. Oxford G.S. Gereau IV, R.W. Neuron. 2002; 35: 721-731Google Scholar). TRPC6 is a substrate for protein kinase A, although phosphorylation appears to not affect cation permeation (28Hassock S.R. Zhu M.X. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Authi K.S. Blood. 2002; 100: 2801-2811Google Scholar). The TRPM7 activity seems to be dependent on the Src family PTKs, although whether TRPM7 is directly phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases or not is unclear (29Jiang X. Newell E.W. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42867-42876Google Scholar). In particular, TRPV4 is regulated by Src family kinase-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (30Xu H. Zhao H. Tian W. Yoshida K. Roullet J.B. Cohen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11520-11527Google Scholar). Thus, protein phosphorylation appears to be a common important regulatory mechanism for TRP superfamily channels. The Drosophila TRP channel is assembled as a result of macromolecular signaling complexes that include INAD (inactivation no afterpotential D), TRPL, PLCβ, rhodopsin, protein kinase C, calmodulin, and myosin III (5Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2001; http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/RE1Google Scholar). These macromolecular complexes contribute to the localization and stability of component proteins, which is necessary for proper phototransduction (5Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2001; http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/RE1Google Scholar, 31Li H.S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1411-1422Google Scholar). Like Drosophila TRP channels, mammalian TRPC channels also appear to be organized into macromolecular assemblies of cellular signaling proteins. TRPC3 physically associates with the brain-derived nerve growth factor receptor and is activated in response to brain-derived nerve growth factor stimulation in neurons (32Li H.S. Xu X.Z. Montell C. Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Google Scholar). TRPC4 and TRPC5 associate with the Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor (NHERF), a protein that binds to PLCβ through its PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1) domains (33Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Google Scholar). TRPC1 appears to be assembled in a signaling complex containing IP3R3, caveolin-1, and Gαq/11 (34Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Google Scholar). Such assemblies of signaling proteins in mammalian cells may contribute to proper signal transduction, as in Drosophila. Indeed, recent study indicates that caveolin-1 regulates the localization of TRPC1 on the plasma membrane and contributes to the proper regulation of the TRPC1 channel activity in human submandibular gland cells (35Brazer S.C. Singh B.B. Liu X. Swaim W. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27208-27215Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that Fyn is involved in the establishment of TRPC6 macromolecular complexes and that EGF stimulation induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6. Because physical interactions between Src PTKs and their target proteins are critical for efficient target phosphorylation (36Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 435-440Google Scholar, 37Yokoyama K. Su Ih I.H. Tezuka T. Yasuda T. Mikoshiba K. Tarakhovsky A. Yamamoto T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 83-92Google Scholar), TRPC6-Fyn interaction may also contribute to the rapid and efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of the TRPC6 channel and the regulation of TRPC6 channel properties. The Fyn-TRPC6 interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Fyn and the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of TRPC6; this interaction is not dependent on phosphorylation. Although associations involving the SH2 domain are usually mediated by an SH2-phosphotyrosine-based interaction, a phosphorylation-independent interaction between the SH2 domain and its target proteins has been reported in several SH2-dependent protein interactions (36Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 435-440Google Scholar, 38Onishi-Haraikawa Y. Funaki M. Gotoh N. Shibuya M. Inukai K. Katagiri H. Fukushima Y. Anai M. Ogihara T. Sakoda H. Ono H. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 476-482Google Scholar, 39Itoh T. Miura K. Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27931-27935Google Scholar, 40Cleghon V. Morrison D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17749-17755Google Scholar). TRPC6 might also recruit other SH2-containing signaling molecules in the macromolecular signaling complex to maintain proper TRPC6 channel regulation via the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain. TRPC6 is reported to be highly expressed in vascular smooth muscles (41Jung S. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C347-C359Google Scholar, 42Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 325-332Google Scholar). Inoue et al. (42Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 325-332Google Scholar) reported that heterologous expression of TRPC6 in HEK 293 cells reproduces almost all the essential properties of α1-adrenoreceptor-activated non-selective cation channels in portal vein smooth muscle. In addition, they reported that the treatment of portal smooth muscle cells with TRPC6 antisense oligonucleotides results in marked inhibition of the adrenoreceptor-activated nonselective cation channel (42Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 325-332Google Scholar). Thus, TRPC6 is likely to be an essential component of the α1-adrenoreceptor-activated non-selective cation channel in portal vein smooth muscles. Worthy of mention is the fact that a peptide of Src PTK activator and a phosphatase inhibitor, Na3VO4, can produce non-selective cation currents similar to noradrenaline-induced currents in portal vein smooth muscle (43Albert A.P. Aromolaran A.S. Large W.A. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 207-217Google Scholar). These findings lead us to speculate that the non-selective cation channel induced by Src PTK activation might be a TRPC6-mediated current and that TRPC6 might be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation in portal vein smooth muscle. It is an interesting future issue to determine whether the TRPC6 channel can be tyrosine phosphorylated in portal vein smooth muscle cells. In summary, we have shown that Fyn tyrosine kinase interacts with and phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the TRPC6 channel. This tyrosine phosphorylation event is caused by EGF receptor stimulation. In addition, we have shown, using single channel recording, that tyrosine phosphorylation increases TRPC6 channel activity. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation is a novel regulatory mechanism of TRPC6 channel activity. Because DAG stimulation and Fyn-mediated stimulation are additive (Fig. 6), tyrosine phosphorylation seems to modulate the TRPC6 channel properties activated by DAG. However, the possibility cannot be completely excluded that tyrosine phosphorylation directly affects TRPC6 gating, because tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV4 by Src PTKs is known to be crucial for channel opening (30Xu H. Zhao H. Tian W. Yoshida K. Roullet J.B. Cohen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11520-11527Google Scholar). Because the basal TRPC6 channel activity was observed before OAG application in our experiments (Fig. 6C, a and d), we could not clearly distinguish direct opening of the TRPC6 channel by tyrosine phosphorylation from modification of the TRPC6 channel activity by tyrosine phosphorylation, at present. Identification of the tyrosine residue(s) of TRPC6 phosphorylated by Src family kinases would help in understanding the mechanical insight into how tyrosine phosphorylation regulates TRPC6 channel properties, and this project is underway. We thank Dr. Lutz Birmbaumer and Dr. M. Zhu for the TRPC6 plasmid and HEK 293 cells stably expressing TRPC6; Dr. T. Yamamoto and Dr. T. Tezuka for fruitful discussions and Fynrelated materials; and Dr. H. Umemori for technical advice."
https://openalex.org/W1989170134,"The hyh (hydrocephalus with hop gait) mouse shows a markedly small cerebral cortex at birth and dies postnatally from progressive enlargement of the ventricular system. Here we show that the small hyh cortex reflects altered cell fate. Neural progenitor cells withdraw prematurely from the cell cycle, producing more early-born, deep-layer cerebral cortical neurons but depleting the cortical progenitor pool, such that late-born, upper-layer cortical neurons are underproduced, creating a small cortex. hyh mice carry a hypomorphic missense mutation in the gene Napa encoding soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein alpha (alpha Snap), involved in SNAP receptor (SNARE)-mediated vesicle fusion in many cellular contexts. A targeted null Napa mutation is embryonically lethal. Altered neural cell fate is accompanied by abnormal localization of many apical proteins implicated in regulation of neural cell fate, including E-cadherin, beta-catenin, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and INADL (inactivation-no-afterpotential D-like, also known as protein associated with Lin7, or Pals1). Apical localization of the SNARE Vamp7 is also disrupted. Thus, alpha Snap is essential for apical protein localization and cell fate determination in neuroepithelial cells."

To elucidate the role of group V sPLA2, we used targeted gene disruption to generate mice lacking this enzyme. Zymosan-induced generation of leukotriene C4 and prostaglandin E2 was attenuated ∼50% in peritoneal macrophages from group V sPLA2-null mice compared with macrophages from wild-type littermates. Furthermore, the early phase of plasma exudation in response to intraperitoneal injection of zymosan and the accompanying in vivo generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes were markedly attenuated in group V sPLA2-null mice compared with wild-type controls. These data provide clear evidence of a role for group V sPLA2 in regulating eicosanoid generation in response to an acute innate stimulus of the immune response both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a role for this enzyme in innate immunity.

The first step in the biosynthesis of eicosanoids is the release of arachidonic acid from cell membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.

Paralogues of cPLA2-α (cPLA2-β and cPLA2-γ) have been described previously (5Underwood K.W. Sung C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol.

They are distinguished from one another by their structures, their biochemical properties, and their tissue distribution.

They have been implicated in membrane remodeling, regulation of store operated calcium channels, apoptosis, and release of arachidonic acid.

Separate studies demonstrated a marked attenuation of the release of labeled arachidonic acid from cPLA2-α-null peritoneal macrophages in response to zymosan, A23187, phorbol myristate acetate, and okadaic acid (19Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M.

Whereas these data demonstrate the essential function of cPLA2-α in supplying arachidonic acid for leukotriene and prostaglandin biosynthesis, several lines of evidence have suggested that low molecular weight sPLA2 enzymes amplify the actions of cPLA2-α in eicosanoid generation. Transfection of HEK293 cells with the heparin-binding group IIA sPLA2, group V sPLA2, or group IID sPLA2 amplified the cPLA2-α-dependent release of arachidonic acid and PGE2 generation in response to A23187 or to LPS and interleukin-1β (22Murakami M.

The action of these enzymes was attributed to their ability to bind to glypican in caveoli, leading to internalization and co-localization with prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase enzymes (22Murakami M.

Similarly, adenoviral transfection of group V sPLA2 or group IIA sPLA2 into mouse mesangial cells amplified H2O2-induced release of arachidonic acid. This was observed only in cPLA2-α-sufficient and not in cPLA2-α-null cells (24Han W.K. Sapirstein A. Hung C.C. Alessandrini A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24153-24163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When P388D1 macrophages were primed with LPS for 1 h and then activated with platelet activating factor, there was biphasic release of labeled arachidonic acid (25Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Studies with pharmacological inhibitors and with antisense oligonucleotides suggested that the initial intracellular release of arachidonic acid was dependent upon cPLA2-α, whereas the subsequent extracellular release was dependent upon group V sPLA2, which was dependent upon the initial action of cPLA2-α (26Balboa M.A. Balsinde J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In certain subclones of the P388D1 macrophage, LPS stimulation alone elicited a delayed phase of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2-dependent PGE2 generation. Both cPLA2-α and group V sPLA2 were required; however, in contrast to the primed-immediate response to LPS and platelet activating factor, activation of cPLA2-α led to induction of group V sPLA2 expression that in turn induced prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 (28Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The data implicating low molecular weight sPLA2 enzymes in eicosanoid generation have thus relied on either transfection experiments or pharmacological and antisense inhibition experiments. The former, although informative with regard to the potential functions of a sPLA2, fail to address the role of the endogenous enzymes. The latter have lacked specificity (25Balsinde J. Barbour S.E.

To definitively test the role of group V sPLA2in vivo and in vitro, we have generated mice with targeted disruption of the gene encoding this enzyme. Materials—Restriction enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Human serum albumin, zymosan A, Evans blue dye, and paraformaldehyde were from Sigma. Targeted Disruption of the Gene for Group V sPLA2—We used a group V sPLA2 cDNA (32Bingham III, C.O. Fijneman R.J.A. Friend D.S. Goddeau R.P. Rogers R.A. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31476-31484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to screen a 129 mouse genomic DNA library in Lambda FIX II (Stratagene). An ∼11-kb portion of the group V sPLA2 gene, composed of two contiguous SacI restriction fragments, was isolated and used to construct a targeting vector in pBluescript (Fig. 1A)in which the fourth exon was excised with BclI and replaced with a neomycin resistance gene that lacked a polyadenylation signal. This leads to loss of the histidine residue essential for the catalytic function of the sPLA2 enzymes (33Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and will lead to a premature stop codon if exons III and V are spliced. A thymidine kinase gene was inserted at a SalI site within pBluescript upstream of the BamHI site. Embryonic stem cells were transfected with the linearized targeting construct. Clones with homologous recombination of the targeting vector were selected in gancyclovir and neomycin according to established protocols and identified by genomic Southern blotting. Two 129 embryonic stem cell clones heterozygous for disruption of the group V sPLA2 gene were injected separately into blastocysts from C57BL/6 mice and transferred to the uteri of C57BL/6 pseudopregnant females. Pups that were chimeric for 129 and C57BL/6 cells were detected by coat color. Five mice (three males and two females) with >50% chimerism were obtained. Two of the males, each derived from different embryonic stem cell clones, were bred back to C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Offspring were screened for transmission of the disrupted allele of group V sPLA2 by Southern blotting of DNA derived from tail snips. Breeding pairs from this F1 generation of group V sPLA2+/- mice were established, and their F2 group V sPLA2-null and group V sPLA2-wild-type progeny were used in subsequent experiments. Southern Blotting—DNA extracted from mouse tail snips was digested with NcoI or EcoRI, resolved in separate lanes of 1% agarose gels, transferred to Immobilon NY membranes (Millipore), and probed with a [32P]dCTP random prime-labeled (Stratagene) 306-bp portion of DNA from the 3′-untranslated region of the group V sPLA2 gene that lies outside the targeting construct (Fig. 1A). Northern Blotting—Mouse hearts were homogenized in Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH), and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. Ten μg of RNA from each heart were resolved in separate lanes of 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gels, blotted to Immobilon-N (Millipore), and probed with a [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA spanning the open reading frame of group V sPLA2 as described previously (34Arm J.P. Nwankwo C. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2342-2349PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—Expression of transcripts for group V sPLA2 was also analyzed by RT-PCR. One μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and the Advantage RT for PCR kit (Clontech) for 1 h at 42 °C. Five μl of the resulting reaction mixture were used in a PCR reaction with Taq Gold polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using the following primers that span the open reading frame: forward primer, 5′-ACACTGGCTTGGTTCCTGGC-3′ in exon II; and reverse primer, 5′-GACATTAGCAGAGAAGTTGGGG-3′ in exon V. PCR conditions were as follows: a denaturing step at 95 °C for 5 min; followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 65 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s; followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. Primers for S15 ribosomal protein (Ambion, Austin, TX) were used as a positive control. Products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Immunofluorescence Analysis of Group V sPLA2 Expression—The peritoneal cavities of mice were flushed with 5 ml of ice-cold PCG buffer (25 mm Pipes, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 g/liter glucose, pH 7.4). After washing, 3.3 × 105 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates in 500 μl of PCG buffer, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing three times with PCG buffer. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, washed once in Hanks' balanced salt solution without Mg2+ or Ca2+ (HBSS-) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (HBA), permeabilized with 0.025% saponin (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and washed twice with HBA. Macrophages were then blocked in HBA containing 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse group V sPLA2 (32Bingham III, C.O. Fijneman R.J.A. Friend D.S. Goddeau R.P. Rogers R.A. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31476-31484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature, washed extensively with HBA, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light chains; Jackson ImmunoResearch), diluted 1:400. Cells were washed five times with HBA, mounted in Vectashield™ mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and imaged with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U microscope coupled with a Spot-RT digital camera. Isolation and Activation of Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages—The peritoneal cavities of mice sacrificed by CO2 inhalation were flushed with 5 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Sciences, Rockville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 units/ml heparin. After two washes in HBSS-, 3.75 × 105 cells in 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin were placed in individual wells of a 48-well tissue culture plate and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing with HBSS-. Nonadherent cells from each mouse were pooled and counted to determine the fraction of adherent cells, which did not differ between group V sPLA2-null cells and wild-type cells. Two hundred μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% human serum albumin were added to each well, and adherent cells were stimulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner with zymosan A (0–100 particles/cell; 0–6 h) (35Qiu Z.H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24506-24513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants were collected for measurements of cysteinyl leukotrienes and PGE2 by enzyme-linked immunoassays (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments, supernatants were analyzed for cysteinyl leukotriene content by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Zymosan-induced Peritonitis—Each mouse received an injection of 0.5% Evans blue dye in PBS into the tail vein (100 μg dye/g body weight) immediately before injection of 1 ml of zymosan A (1 mg/ml in PBS) into the peritoneal cavity (36Maekawa A. Austen K.F. Kanaoka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20820-20824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). At selected times (up to 2 h later), the mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation, and the peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 4 ml of ice-cold PBS. The peritoneal lavage fluid was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the optical density of the supernatant was measured at 610 nm to assess extravasation of Evans blue dye. In some experiments, 4 volumes of ethanol and 60 ng of PGB2 (as internal standard for RP-HPLC) were added to the lavage fluid, mixed well, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then dried by vacuum centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and methanol (1:2, w/v), and analyzed for cysteinyl leukotriene content by RP-HPLC. RP-HPLC Analysis of Cysteinyl Leukotrienes—Cysteinyl leukotrienes were measured by RP-HPLC as described previously (36Maekawa A. Austen K.F. Kanaoka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20820-20824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 37Sanchez Meija R.O. Lam B.K. Arm J.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were applied to a 5-μm, 4.6 × 250-mm C18 Ultrasphere RP column (Beckman) equilibrated with a solvent of methanol/acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (10:15:100:0.2, v/v), pH 6.0 (solvent A). After injection of the sample, the column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a programmed concave gradient to 55% of solvent A and 45% methanol over 2.5 min. After 5 min, methanol was increased linearly to 75% over 15 min and maintained at this level for an additional 15 min. The UV absorbance at 280 nm was recorded. The retention times for PGB2, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 were 21.4, 22.2, 23.7, and 25.1 min, respectively. Quantities of cysteinyl leukotrienes were calculated from the ratio of the peak area of each leukotriene to the peak area of the PGB2 internal standard after correction for the differences in molar extinction coefficients. Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as arithmetic means and S.E. Statistical differences between groups were calculated using Student's t test. Generation of Mice Lacking Group V sPLA2—To generate mice lacking group V sPLA2, we used targeted gene disruption. Southern blotting of wild-type genomic DNA for group V sPLA2 yielded bands of ∼5 and ∼3.7 kb with NcoI (Fig. 1B) and EcoRI (data not shown) digestion, respectively. Southern blotting of DNA from animals with disruption of the group V sPLA2 gene yielded bands 2.6 and 0.8 kb smaller than wild-type DNA after digestion with with NcoI (Fig. 1B) and EcoRI (data not shown), respectively, as predicted from restriction enzyme mapping of wild-type and mutated alleles (Fig. 1A). The mouse heart is rich in transcripts for group V sPLA2 (8Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2365-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that incorporation of the disrupted allele for group V sPLA2 led to loss of normal transcripts, RNA was extracted from the hearts of mice born to the F1 intercrosses and analyzed for group V sPLA2 transcripts by RNA blotting (Fig. 1C) and RT-PCR (Fig. 1D). RNA from the hearts of wild-type mice and BALB/c mice yielded a band of ∼2 kb on Northern analysis (Fig. 1C), whereas RNA from mice genotyped as having no wild-type allele for the group V sPLA2 gene yielded only aberrant transcripts of ∼4 kb and lacked a transcript of the appropriate size on Northern analysis (Fig. 1C). The finding that the aberrant transcripts observed in group V sPLA2-null hearts were non-productive is revealed by RT-PCR. RT-PCR analysis of wild-type hearts yielded a product of the expected size (∼400 bp) and also yielded a smaller product that on sequencing was shown to lack exon IV, indicative of alternate splicing, as described previously for group V sPLA2 (38Degousee N. Ghomashchi F. Stefanski E. Singer A. Smart B.P. Borregaard N. Reithmeier R. Lindsay T.F. Lichtenberger C. Reinisch W. Lambeau G. Arm J. Tischfield J. Gelb M.H. Rubin B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5061-5073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis of RNA from group V sPLA2-null hearts failed to yield a product in RT-PCR (Fig. 1D). Immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 2) confirmed the lack of expression of group V sPLA2 in peritoneal macrophages from group V sPLA2-null mice. By comparison, peritoneal macrophages from wild-type littermates revealed cytoplasmic staining for group V sPLA2 with perinuclear accentuation, similar to the pattern we reported previously for mouse bone marrow culture-derived mast cells (32Bingham III, C.O. Fijneman R.J.A. Friend D.S. Goddeau R.P. Rogers R.A. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31476-31484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Breeding of mice heterozygous for the disrupted allele of group V sPLA2 produced approximately equal numbers of male and female mice with a Mendelian pattern of inheritance of the disrupted allele. Group V sPLA2-null mice were healthy to at least 6 months of age, indicating that group V sPLA2 is not required for normal growth and development of mice. Peritoneal macrophages have been used extensively to study eicosanoid generation (17Uozumi N. Kume K. Nagase T. Nakatani N. Ishii S. Tashiro F. Komagata Y. Maki K. Ikuta K. Ouchi Y. Miyazaki J.

As phagocytes, they are an integral part of the innate immune response. They respond to ingestion of zymosan particles, extracted from yeast, with robust eicosanoid generation in vitro (40Rouzer C.A.

We therefore studied eicosanoid generation in peritoneal macrophages from group V sPLA2-null mice in vitro and cysteinyl leukotriene generation and plasma extravasation in response to intraperitoneal injection of zymosan in vivo. Zymosan-induced Eicosanoid Generation by Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages—Stimulation of group V sPLA2-null and wild-type macrophages with unopsonized zymosan particles elicited maximum cysteinyl leukotriene and PGE2 generation at 3 h (data not shown). Cysteinyl leukotriene generation plateaued at 30–100 zymosan particles/cell, whereas PGE2 generation plateaued with a maximal response at 3–10 particles/cell (Fig. 3, A and B). Both cysteinyl leukotriene generation and PGE2 generation were attenuated at all doses of zymosan in group V sPLA2-null peritoneal macrophages compared with wild-type control cells, with no change in the position of the dose-response curves (Fig. 3, A and B). Cysteinyl leukotriene generation in response to 100 zymosan particles/cell was attenuated 58% in group V sPLA2-null macrophages (24.6 ± 5.7 ng/106 cells compared with 57.4 ± 10.7 ng/106 wild-type cells; n = 9; p = 0.01). PGE2 generation in response to 3 zymosan particles/cell was attenuated 49% in group V sPLA2-null macrophages (7.1 ± 1.6 ng/106 cells compared with 14.1 ± 1.8 ng/106 wild-type cells; n = 9; p = 0.01). RP-HPLC analysis revealed the identity of the cysteinyl leukotrienes in the cell supernatants as LTC4, with no detectable extracellular conversion to LTD4 or LTE4 (data not shown), and confirmed the attenuation of LTC4 generation in group V sPLA2-null macrophages compared with wild-type macrophages (Fig. 3C). Attenuation of eicosanoid generation in zymosan-stimulated group V sPLA2-null peritoneal macrophages was demonstrated for macrophages obtained from mice derived from two separate embryonic stem cell clones. These data demonstrate a role for group V sPLA2 in eicosanoid generation by zymosan-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. Nevertheless, there was still significant"
https://openalex.org/W2070160124,"Propagation of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is believed to involve the conversion of cellular prion protein, PrPC, into a misfolded oligomeric form, PrPSc. An important step toward understanding the mechanism of this conversion is to elucidate the folding pathway(s) of the prion protein. We reported recently (Apetri, A. C., and Surewicz, W. K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 44589-44592) that the folding of wild-type prion protein can best be described by a three-state sequential model involving a partially folded intermediate. Here we have performed kinetic stopped-flow studies for a number of recombinant prion protein variants carrying mutations associated with familial forms of prion disease. Analysis of kinetic data clearly demonstrates the presence of partially structured intermediates on the refolding pathway of each PrP variant studied. In each case, the partially folded state is at least one order of magnitude more populated than the fully unfolded state. The present study also reveals that, for the majority of PrP variants tested, mutations linked to familial prion diseases result in a pronounced increase in the thermodynamic stability, and thus the population, of the folding intermediate. These data strongly suggest that partially structured intermediates of PrP may play a crucial role in prion protein conversion, serving as direct precursors of the pathogenic PrPSc isoform."

Ensuing regulatory volume decrease has been considered the primary function of these channels. However, Cl– channels, which share functional properties with volume-sensitive Cl– channels, have been shown to be involved in other physiological processes, including cell proliferation and apoptosis, raising the question of their physiological roles and the signal transduction pathways involved in their activation. Here we report that exogenously applied H2O2 elicited VSOR Cl– channel activation. Furthermore, activation of these channels was found to be coupled to NAD(P)H oxidase activity. Also, epidermal growth factor, known to increase H2O2 production, activated Cl– channels with properties identical to swelling-sensitive Cl– channels.

In general, cells produce O2·¯ that is rapidly converted into H2O2 and its generation is modulated by activation of cell surface receptors, stress responses, and apoptosis (5Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S.

Although H2O2 is also known to be produced by xanthine oxidase, NO synthase, and cytochrome P450, as well as the mitochondria, there is no compelling evidence linking them to cell surface receptor activation. It is well documented that addition of exogenous H2O2 or increased intracellular generation of H2O2 influences the function of various proteins, including protein-tyrosine phosphatases, protein kinases, and transcription factors, suggesting that H2O2 might be an intracellular messenger (8Finkel T.

These channels are also found to be activated under conditions in which cell volume is constant (14Doroshenko P. Penner R. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 436: 711-724Google Scholar, 15Schumacher P.A. Sakellaropoulos G. Phipps D.J. Schlichter L.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 145: 217-232Google Scholar, 16Voets T. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 95-107Google Scholar), providing further evidence for their participation in a variety of functions other than cell volume regulation. For instance, VSOR Cl– channel expression is modulated during cell cycle (17Chen L. Wang L. Zhu L. Nie S. Zhang J. Zhong P. Cai B. Luo H. Jacob T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1313-C1323Google Scholar), and proliferation in mouse liver cells is inhibited by blocking these channels (18Wondergem R. Gong W. Monen S.H. Dooley S.N. Gonce J.L. Conner T.D. Houser M. Ecay T.W. Ferslew K.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 532: 661-672Google Scholar). Chloride channels are also proposed to play a major role in apoptosis. Stimulation of Fas receptors have been shown to induce activation of outwardly rectifying Cl– channels (4Szabo I. Lepple-Wienhues A. Kaba K.N. Zoratti M. Gulbins E. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6169-6174Google Scholar), which were also activated by osmotic swelling (19Lepple-Wienhues A. Szabo I. Laun T. Kaba N.K. Gulbins E. Lang F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 281-286Google Scholar). Apoptosis is accompanied by normotonic shrinkage of cells (apoptotic volume decrease) (20Maeno E. Ishizaki Y. Kanaseki T. Hazama A. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9487-9492Google Scholar, 21Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Google Scholar), and blockers of VSOR Cl– channels prevent apoptotic volume decrease induction (22Okada Y. Maeno E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 130: 377-383Google Scholar).Because these channels are activated under many different conditions, we searched for a common modulator that mediates activation of VSOR Cl– channels. In the present study, the question of whether H2O2 mediates VSOR Cl– channel activation was examined in two different epithelial cell lines. Our results indicate that H2O2 is a common second messenger in VSOR Cl– channel activation in cell volume regulation and cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Electrophysiological Measurements—HTC and HeLa cells were cultured as described previously (23Stutzin A. Eguiguren A.L. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C999-C1007Google Scholar). For electrophysiological experiments, cells were grown on 22-mm coverslips and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (IX-70, Olympus America Inc.) equipped with epifluorescence. Bath solution contained (mm): 5 NaCl, 95 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 100 sorbitol, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4 adjusted with Tris. Osmolality was adjusted with sorbitol to 300 ± 5 mosmol (kg H2O)–1. Pipette solution contained (mm): 5 NaCl, 133 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.2 adjusted with Tris and an osmolality of 295 ± 5 mosmol (kg H2O)–1. Hypotonic solutions (200 ± 5 mosmol (kg H2O)–1) were made by not adding sorbitol. In substitution experiments 95 mm NaCl was used instead of N-methyl-d-glucamine as reference solution and was substituted by the equivalent sodium salt. Permeability ratios (Px/PCl) for the various anions were calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (24Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 441-470Google Scholar). Changes in liquid junction potential were calculated (25Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 107-116Google Scholar), and voltages were corrected for, when necessary. Unless stated otherwise, experiments were performed using the perforated whole-cell configuration using nystatin (final concentration of 2 mg·ml–1) (26Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 92: 145-149Google Scholar). The acquisition rate was 1 kHz, and the experiments were performed at room temperature. Current analysis was performed as described elsewhere (23Stutzin A. Eguiguren A.L. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C999-C1007Google Scholar).Measurements of Cell Volume—Changes in cell water volume were assessed in single HTC cells by measuring changes in concentration of an intracellularly trapped fluorescent dye (calcein) as described previously (13Stutzin A.

Methods Neurosci. 1995; 27: 361-391Google Scholar).Determination of Cellular H2O2 Production and Release—Hydrogen peroxide generated and released by the cells was measured by a coupled peroxidatic reaction, using horseradish peroxidase and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid as electron donor (28Panus P.C.

Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Google Scholar) mutant was subcloned into the pNS2Z plasmid containing an enhanced form of the green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fused to the zeocin resistance gene (31Schroder R.L. Jensen B.S. Strobaek D. Olesen S.P. Christophersen P. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 440: 809-818Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of the plasmid pNS2Z_p47S379A using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science, Mannhein, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophysiological experiments were performed 48 h post-transfection.Cell Treatments—In experiments in which catalase and 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acid (Tiron) were used, cells were preincubated for 3 h as described (32Moreno-Manzano V. Ishikawa Y. Lucio-Cazana J. Kitamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12684-12691Google Scholar). In the case of diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI), preincubation time was 1 h.Statistics—Statistical analysis of the data was performed by unpaired Student's t test and considered significant at p < 0.005.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONH2O2 Mediates VSOR Cl– Channel Activation—In nystatin-perforated whole-cell experiments, exposure of cells from a liver-derived cell line (HTC) to H2O2 (20–200 μm) in isotonic solutions activated reversibly an outwardly rectifying Cl– current with a reversal potential, Vrev, of 2.4 ± 0.8 mV (n = 15) not significantly different from the calculated ECl of 3.1 mV (Fig. 1A, C, and D). This current was similar to that elicited by a hypotonic bath solution in respect to its outward rectification, inactivation at positive potentials (Fig. 1E), and Cl– selectivity, as indicated by the shift in Vrev after changes in [Cl]o (Fig. 1D). The relative anion permeability of the channels activated by H2O2 followed the selectivity sequence SCN– > I– ≈ NO3- > Cl– > glutamate. This anion selectivity resembles Eisenman's sequence I and the sequence described for VSOR Cl– channels (33Nilius B. Eggermont J. Voets T. Buyse G. Manolopoulos V. Droogmans G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 69-119Google Scholar). On average, the magnitude of the Cl– current at steady state measured at 80 mV was 49.6 ± 2.3 nA/nF after addition of 200 μm H2O2 with a half-time constant for current onset of 562 ± 53 s (n = 7). The current attained was dependent on H2O2 concentration with an EC50 = 101 ± 23 μm (Fig. 1B, n = 4–7). The half-time constant for current onset decreased monoexponentially from 900 ± 54 s (20 μm H2O2) to 207 ± 24 s (10 mm H2O2) (n = 4–7). These results indicate that addition of H2O2 to HTC cells elicits the activation of a Cl– current in the absence of cell swelling (see Supplemental Fig. 2) that is indistinguishable from the swelling-induced Cl– current. We next examined the influence of a known VSOR Cl– channel blocker on the channels activated by H2O2. Tamoxifen (10 μm) caused a voltage-independent inhibition (87 ± 2%, n = 8) of the H2O2-induced Cl– current. Furthermore, exposure to a hypertonic solution, a maneuver reported to inhibit the swelling-activated Cl– channels in many cell types, also inhibited H2O2-induced Cl– current by 86 ± 1% (n = 8), strongly suggesting that the anion channels activated by H2O2 are the same as the channels activated by cell swelling (not shown).Extracellular Hypotonicity Induces NAD(P)H Oxidase-dependent H2O2 Production in HTC Cells—If H2O2 is mediating VSOR Cl– channel activation, it would be expected that hypotonically challenged cells would increase intracellular [H2O2]. Cells exposed to hypotonic solutions revealed a transient increase in intracellular [H2O2] as measured by a coupled reaction using horseradish peroxidase and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid as an electron donor. Exposure of HTC cell to a 30% hypotonic solution caused a fast, 15-fold accumulation in H2O2 within the first 30 s followed by a decrease in H2O2 production. The increase in H2O2 production was dependent on the magnitude of the osmotic challenge (not shown) and was not observed under isotonic or hypertonic conditions (Fig. 2A). The role of NAD(P)H oxidase in the swelling-induced H2O2 generation was explored next. In hypotonically challenged cells pretreated with a NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, DPI (10 μm), H2O2 production was reduced by 70 ± 11% (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that extracellular hypotonicity increases H2O2 generation, at least partially, through a NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent mechanism. These data are in agreement with the increase in radical oxygen species observed in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts following hypotonic challenge (34Lambert I.H. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 192: 19-32Google Scholar).Fig. 2Cell swelling-stimulated H2O2 production is required for activation of volume-sensitive chloride channels. A, the mean change (±S.E.) in extracellular H2O2 produced by the cells during a 30% hypotonic challenge in nonpreincubated (○) and DPI-preincubated cells (▿) was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As control conditions, the production of H2O2 in isotonic (•) as well as in hypertonic (▾) solutions were measured, n = 8; *, p < 0.005 between hypotonically challenged, DPI-treated, and non-DPI-treated cells; **, p < 0.005 between hypotonically challenged cells and control conditions. B, effect of Tiron, catalase, and DTT on VSOR Cl– channels. Data are expressed as percentage of Cl– current ± S.E. HTC cells were preincubated with Tiron and catalase and then exposed to either hypotonicity or H2O2. DTT (5 mm) was included in the pipette solution in conventional whole-cell experiments, allowing 15 min to equilibrate before exposing the cells to either hypotonicity or H2O2, n = 4; *, p < 0.005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Swelling-induced Cl– Current Requires H2O2 Production— Because increased H2O2 production under hypotonic conditions may not necessarily cause activation of the swelling-induced Cl– current, we investigated whether the activation of this Cl– current requires H2O2 generation. Preincubation of cells with DPI inhibited the swelling-induced Cl– current by 77 ± 2% (n = 8, p < 0.005, not shown) without affecting the H2O2-induced Cl– current supporting the notion that H2O2 is directly involved in the activation of VSOR Cl– channels. In line with these results the only detectable current in COS-7 cells overexpressing all the NAD(P)H oxidase components is an outwardly rectifying Cl– current, reminiscent of the swelling-induced Cl– current (35DeCoursey T.E. Morgan D. Cherny V.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 773-779Google Scholar). A major, though not unique, source of H2O2 generation is the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen by the NAD(P)H oxidase complex to yield superoxide ( O2·¯), which is spontaneously or enzymatically converted to H2O2. Thus, we studied the effect of the membrane-permeable O2·¯ scavenger Tiron on the activation of VSOR Cl– channels. Preincubation of HTC cells with Tiron (5 mm) abolished the swelling-activated Cl– current but not the H2O2-elicited Cl– current (Fig. 2B), indicating that O2·¯ production and subsequent conversion to H2O2 are required for VSOR Cl– channel activation. To examine whether hydrogen peroxide-elicited Cl– channel activation was specifically mediated by H2O2 and not by other radical oxygen species, we decreased [H2O2] in HTC cells by increasing the amount of the peroxide-scavenging enzyme catalase. Addition of H2O2 to HTC cells preincubated with catalase significantly inhibited the swelling-induced Cl– current (82 ± 5%, n = 6, Fig. 2B and Supplemental Fig. 1A), indicating that VSOR Cl– channel activation is dependent on H2O2 and not on other radical oxygen species. Conversely, incubation of the cells with aminotriazole (20 mm), a catalase inhibitor, elicited a slowly developing Cl– current with similar properties to that induced by H2O2 (Supplemental Fig. 1B).Substantial evidence suggests that H2O2 exerts its effect as a second messenger by targeting deprotonated cysteine residues, such as that present in the sequence motif HCXXGXXRS/T found in the catalytic center of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), thus inhibiting PTP activity (36Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Google Scholar, 37Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Google Scholar, 38Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Google Scholar). Alternatively, a number of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) appear to be directly activated by H2O2 (39Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Google Scholar, 40Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Google Scholar) and members of the Src family of PTKs have been shown to be involved in cell volume regulation (41Moore A.L. Roe M.W. Melnick R.F. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34030-34035Google Scholar). It would be anticipated, therefore, that a highly reduced intracellular environment would prevent PTP inhibition and/or PTK activation by H2O2. In conventional whole-cell experiments, inclusion of dithiothreitol (DTT, 5 mm) in the pipette solution precluded both, the swelling- and H2O2-induced Cl– channel activation, indicating that H2O2-oxidizable targets play a critical role in the activation of these Cl– channels (n = 6, Fig. 2B).NAD(P)H Oxidase Is Required for H2O2 Activation of Volume-sensitive Chloride Channels—To examine whether H2O2-activated Cl– channels were present in a different epithelial cell line, we performed experiments on HeLa cells. Exposure of HeLa cells to H2O2 (200–500 μm, n = 6) in isotonic solutions elicited a Cl– current comparable to the swelling-induced Cl– current and also similar to the H2O2-induced Cl– current described above for HTC cells (Fig. 3A). We also used HeLa cells to study further the involvement of the NAD(P)H oxidase complex in VSOR Cl– channel activation. Because DPI is a nonspecific blocker of the NAD(P)H oxidase, prevention of H2O2 production and inhibition of the swelling-induced Cl– current by this compound should be interpreted with caution. To address this point more directly, we used HeLa cells transiently transfected with a dominant negative mutant (p47S379A) of the p47PHOX component of the NAD(P)H oxidase complex (30Faust L.R. el Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Google Scholar). This mutant is unable to translocate to the membrane, resulting in a loss of enzyme activity. As expected, Cl– current was elicited by exogenously added H2O2 even in the presence of a p47S379A dominant negative mutant (Fig. 3B). In contrast, hypotonically challenged HeLa cells treated with DPI or transfected with the p47S379A dominant negative mutant showed significantly reduced swelling-induced Cl– currents when compared with mock-transfected and wild type cells (Fig. 3C), confirming that NAD(P)H oxidase activity is essential for activating the swelling-induced Cl– current.Fig. 3NAD(P)H oxidase is required for H2O2 activation of volume-sensitive chloride channels.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is known to elicit a H2O2 response in various cell types (40Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Google Scholar) and to up-regulate the swelling-activated Cl– current in murine mammary cells (42Abdullaev I.F. Sabirov R.Z. Okada Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 749-758Google Scholar). Exposure of HTC cells to EGF (500 ng/ml) in isotonicity activated an outwardly rectifying Cl– current similar to the H2O2-induced Cl– current. This was blocked by intracellular DTT and inhibited by hypertonicity (n = 5, Fig. 4, A and B). The EGF-induced Cl– current was significantly reduced in DPI-pretreated cells (Fig. 4C) supporting the hypothesis that H2O2, independent of the stimuli leading to its production, acts as a common mediator for VSOR Cl– channel. Furthermore, the Cl– channel activation elicited by EGF was abolished in HeLa cells expressing the p47S379A dominant negative mutant (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4Epidermal growth factor activation of volume-sensitive chloride channels is mediated by NAD(P)H oxidase.

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that NAD(P)H oxidase is a key component in this process by identifying this enzymatic complex as a relevant source of O2·¯ required for the production of H2O2 (see Table I). The results presented here suggest that H2O2 is exerting its effect by shifting the intracellular phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance toward an enhanced phosphorylation state. Although the first step leading to activation of NAD(P)H oxidase and the downstream mechanisms of H2O2-dependent VSOR Cl– channel activation need to be elucidated, our findings add substantial information to clarify the role of VSOR Cl– channels in several fundamental physiological processes including cell proliferation and apoptosis.Table IEffect of different maneuvers on swelling, H2O2, and EGF-activated Cl- current in epithelial cell linesHypertonicityTamoxifenTironCatalaseDTTDPIp47S379ASwelling—aInhibition > 75%.—aInhibition > 75%.—aInhibition > 75%.—aInhibition > 75%.—aInhibition > 75%.—bInhibition 50-75%.—bInhibition 50-75%.H2O2—aInhibition > 75%.—aInhibition > 75%.0cNo effect.—aInhibition > 75%.—aInhibition > 75%.0cNo effect.0cNo effect.EGF—aInhibition > 75%.NDdNot determined.NDdNot determined.NDdNot determined.—aInhibition > 75%.—bInhibition 50-75%.—aInhibition > 75%.a Inhibition > 75%.b Inhibition 50-75%.c No effect.d Not determined.

However, these channels are increasingly found to be involved in other physiological processes, including cell proliferation. (3Shen M.R. Droogmans G. Eggermont J. Voets T. Ellory J.C. Nilius B. J.

In general, cells produce O2·¯ that is rapidly converted into H2O2 and its generation is modulated by activation of cell surface receptors, stress responses, and apoptosis (5Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S.

Candidate tau protein kinases include members of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of phosphotransferases, which are highly overexpressed in Alzheimer's disease brain and colocalize with neuritic and granulovacuolar lesions. Here we characterized the contribution of one CK1 isoform, Ckiδ, to the phosphorylation of tau at residues Ser202/Thr205 and Ser396/Ser404 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells using immunodetection and fluorescence microscopy. Treatment of cells with membrane permeable CK1 inhibitor 3-[(2,3,6-trimethoxyphenyl)methylidenyl]-indolin-2-one (IC261) lowered occupancy of Ser396/Ser404 phosphorylation sites by >70% at saturation, suggesting that endogenous CK1 was the major source of basal phosphorylation activity at these sites. Overexpression of Ckiδ increased CK1 enzyme activity and further raised tau phosphorylation at residues Ser202/Thr205 and Ser396/Ser404in situ. Inhibitor IC261 reversed tau hyperphosphorylation induced by Ckiδ overexpression. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed direct association of tau and Ckiδ in situ, consistent with tau being a Ckiδ substrate. Ckiδ overexpression also produced a decrease in the fraction of bulk tau bound to detergent-insoluble microtubules. These results suggest that Ckiδ phosphorylates tau at sites that modulate tau/microtubule binding, and that the expression pattern of Ckiδ in Alzheimer's disease is consistent with it playing an important role in tau aggregation.

Each manifestation of neuritic pathology is comprised of tau protein aggregated into filaments. Because the spatial distribution of tau fibrillization appears stereotypically, correlates with neuronal cell loss, and parallels cognitive decline, it is a useful marker of and may contribute to degeneration in AD and other dementias. Tau fibrillization is accompanied by extensive phosphorylation on over 25 distinct sites (2Hanger D.P. Betts J.C. Loviny T.L. Blackstock W.P. Anderton B.H. J.

Neurochem. 2003; 85: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, isoforms Ckiα and Ckiδ associate with the neurofibrillary lesions of AD (25Kuret J. Johnson G.S. Cha D.

These observations led to the hypothesis that CK1 enzymes regulate tau phosphorylation in vivo, and that their up-regulation in level or activity contributes to tau hyperphosphorylation in disease (22Ghoshal N.

Here we test this hypothesis by examining the ability of one CK1 isoform, Ckiδ, to phosphorylate tau under basal and overexpression conditions in situ. The data suggests that CK1 activity makes a major contribution to basal levels of tau phosphorylation, and that Ckiδ can modulate microtubule stability by direct interaction with tau protein. Materials—Polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of p35 (C-19) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), whereas monoclonal antibodies AT8, Tau5, PHF1, and 128A were obtained from Endogen (Woburn, MA), Dr. L. I. Binder, Northwestern University Medical School, Dr. Peter Davies, Einstein College of Medicine, and ICOS Corp. (Bothell, WA), respectively. Monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (27Blose S.H. Meltzer D.I. Feramisco J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), Taxol, and protease inhibitors (1× complete contained: 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benezenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 40 μm bestatin, 20 μm leupeptin, 15 μm pepstatin A, 14 μm l-transepoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-[4-guanidino]butane, and 26 μmN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleu-al) were obtained from Sigma. HEK-293 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), TransFast™ transfection reagent from Promega (Madison, WI), inhibitor IC261 from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), and purified bovine brain tubulin from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant htau40 containing a His6 tag was expressed and purified as described (28Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Poly-His free recombinant htau40 was prepared the same way, except that Escherichia coli expression was from vector pET-14b (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), and protein isolated from immobilized metal affinity chromatography was digested 20 h at 4 °C with thrombin prior to repetition of immobilized metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. Human brain Ckiδ cDNA served as template for PCR amplification of C-terminal-truncated Ckiδ (Ckiδ-Δ317). The sense primer (5′-ACGGATCCCATATGGAGCTGAGAGTC) incorporated an NdeI site at the start codon, whereas the downstream primer (5′-CTCGAGTTAGTGTCTCCAGCCGCTC) contained a TTA stop codon downstream of the codon for His317 followed by an XhoI site. The amplified PCR product was subcloned directly into TOPO2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced in both directions for errors. The Ckiδ-Δ317-TOPO2.1 cDNA was digested with NdeI and XhoI, the approximate 0.9-kb Ckiδ-Δ317 fragment was gel purified and subcloned into E. coli expression vector PT7C (28Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Recombinant Ckiδ-Δ317 was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography as described previously for tau protein (28Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Treatment—cDNAs encoding the longest human tau isoform (htau40), human Ckiδ, or p25 (an activator of Cdk5) were cloned into the mammalian cytomegalovirus expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). HEK-293 cells, which were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (37 °C with 5% CO2), were transiently transfected with these plasmids (5 μg per 60-mm dish) using TransFast™ reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate a cell line stably expressing human htau40 (stable tau cells), 5 μg of tau-pcDNA3.1 plasmid was linearized with BglII and transfected into HEK-293 cells. Forty h after transfection, cells were cultured in selective medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. To assay CK1 inhibitor IC261, tau stable cells treated with different IC261 concentrations were harvested after 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min of incubation. IC261 was stored as a 50 mm stock solution in Me2SO and diluted to a working stock of 1 mm in H2O before treatment. To assess toxicity of various treatments, cells were stained with the DNA-specific fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and examined under fluorescence for chromatin condensation (29McGinty A. Chang Y.W. Sorokin A. Bokemeyer D. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12095-12101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cells with uniformly distributed chromatin were scored as “viable.” Immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested and disrupted in Lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3NO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× complete protease inhibitors), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g) at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Blue binding method with bovine serum albumin as standard (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation experiments, extracts (500 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of each monoclonal antibody examined (anti-Ckiδ, 128A; anti-tau, Tau5; anti-p25, C-19) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose beads (60 μl of 25% (w/v) slurry) were then added to the samples and incubation was continued for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with Lysis buffer, and subjected to immunoblot or in vitro protein kinase assays as described below. Immunoblot Analysis—Aliquots of cell lysates (20–40 μg) or immunocomplexes derived from immunoprecipitation experiments were boiled in SDS-PAGE Loading buffer (1× buffer contained 48 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 7.5% glycerol, 1.8% SDS, and 3.8% 2-mercaptoethanol), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After 1 h in Blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat milk), membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature followed by 1 h with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG). Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence, collected on x-ray film, and finally quantified on a Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated laser densitometer. In Vitro Protein Kinase Assay—Purified protein kinase (Ckiδ-Δ317) or immunocomplexes derived from immunoprecipitation experiments were incubated with 2 μg of htau40 in 20 μl of Kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, 200 μm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for up to 4 h. When necessary, reactions were supplemented with 1.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. All reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE Loading buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, gels were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above or stained and dried for autoradiography using a Molecular Imager FX Pro Plus multi-imager system (Bio-Rad). RNA Interference—Sequence specific post-transcriptional silencing of selected genes was initiated by transfection of HEK-293 cells with double stranded RNA oligonucleotides (synthesized by Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Ckiδ/ϵ isoforms were silenced with RNA duplexes consisting of oligonucleotides 5′-CUGGGGAAGAAGGGCCdTdT and 5′-GGUUGCCCUUCCCCAGdTdT (31Eide E.J. Vielhaber E.L. Hinz W.A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17248-17254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). RNA duplexes targeting luciferase, a non-mammalian protein found in fireflies, were used to control for nonspecific effects of siRNA transfection. These oligonucleotides, termed GL2, consisted of sense (5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT) and antisense (5′-UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGdTdT) components (32Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). GL2 or Ckiδ/ϵ siRNA duplexes (5 μg) were transfected into stable tau cells using TransFast™ reagents for 48 h. Levels of Ckiδ, tau, and phospho-tau were then quantified by immunoblot analysis performed on cell lysates (30 μg of protein) as described above. Microtubule Binding Assay—To assay the ability of tau to bind microtubules in situ, HEK-293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/tau or Ckiδ/tau for 24 h were harvested in 500 μl of Microtubule-stabilizing buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 30% glycerol, and 1× complete protease inhibitors) in the presence of 10 μm Taxol at 37 °C. After cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) at 37 °C, supernatant fractions were collected and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 35 °C (5Wagner U. Utton M. Gallo J. Miller C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1537-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant pellets (P1) were washed twice with and resuspended (500 μl) in Microtubule-stabilizing buffer, sonicated for 10 s, and then subjected along with 100,000 × g supernatants (S1) to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described above. To assay the ability of tau to bind microtubules in vitro, tubulin (1 mg/ml) was first assembled in Microtubule assembly buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm GTP) containing 10 μm Taxol for 30 min at 30 °C. Resultant microtubules were then incubated (37 °C for 30 min) with supernatants (S1; 500 μg) from the in situ microtubule binding assays described above, and then harvested by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h at 25 °C). Pellet fractions (P2) were resuspended in Microtubule-assembly buffer so that their final volumes equaled those of supernatant fractions (S2). Equal amounts of supernatant (S2) and pellet (P2) fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the distribution of tau protein was examined by immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibody Tau5. Cell Extraction and Immunofluorescence Staining—Wild-type HEK-293 cells were cultured on coverslips for 24 h and transfected with Ckiδ/tau or PcDNA3.1/tau for 24 h as described above. To extract soluble proteins, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Microtubule-stabilizing buffer containing 10 μm Taxol for 2 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once with Microtubule-stabilizing buffer without detergent. Both the extracted cells and non-extracted cells were fixed with methanol. Following the phosphate-buffered saline washes, cells were sequentially incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, Tau5 antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C, and fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:1000) for 1 h. Immunostaining was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Eclipse 800, Nikon, Japan), captured with a SPOT II digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI), and processed with Metamorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Analytical Methods—Hyperbolic inhibition curves were fit to the rectangular hyperbola: y = ax/(b + x), where y is immunoreactivity determined at inhibitor concentration x, and constant b corresponds to x at 50% ymax (i.e. IC50). Probability values were determined by Student's t test for single comparison and one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed using the InStat Software program. Ckiδ Phosphorylates Tau in Vitro—To determine whether Ckiδ could directly phosphorylate tau, a truncated form of the human enzyme (Ckiδ-Δ317) was expressed and purified as a His6 fusion protein and used to phosphorylate tau protein in vitro. Truncated enzyme was used because it was easily prepared after heterologous expression in E. coli while retaining the protein kinase activity of full-length protein (33Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Incubation of htau40 with purified Ckiδ-Δ317 in the presence of radioactive nucleotide substrate led to detectable phosphate incorporation within 30 min (Fig. 1A). Detection of total tau protein on Western blots using monoclonal antibody Tau5, the reactivity of which is not phosphorylation dependent (28Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), revealed a substantial electrophoretic mobility shift by 4 h incubation (Fig. 1B). These slowly migrating tau species were strongly labeled by monoclonal antibodies AT8 and PHF1, which selectively bind phospho-tau residues Ser202/Thr205 (34Goedert M. Jakes R. Vanmechelen E. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 189: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and Ser396/Ser404 (35Otvos Jr., L. Feiner L. Lang E. Szendrei G.I. Goedert M. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), respectively. These data show that the CK1 isoform Ckiδ could directly phosphorylate tau protein, and that monoclonal antibodies AT8 and PHF1 could be used as probes for Ckiδ-mediated phosphorylation reactions. Ckiδ Phosphorylates Tau in Situ—To determine whether Ckiδ could modulate tau phosphorylation in situ, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding htau40 and Ckiδ, p25 (an activator of Cdk5), or empty pcDNA vector. Transfection times of 24 h were employed because cells remained viable during this time frame in all studies reported herein (data not shown). Cdk5 activator p25 was included because of its ability to activate endogenous Cdk5 in situ (36Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) and therefore serve as an alternate source of tau hyperphosphorylation activity. Total tau protein was detected with monoclonal antibody Tau5, whereas phospho-tau was detected with antibodies AT8 and PHF1. All cells transfected with htau40 constructs contained detectable levels of tau protein (Fig. 2A). When these cells were co-transfected with empty vector (i.e. in the absence of exogenous protein kinase), a portion of total tau was PHF1 and AT8 positive, reflecting basal levels of tau phosphorylation. Basal levels of Ckiδ also were substantial in these cells as demonstrated by Western analysis using monoclonal antibody 128A. However, cotransfection with DNA constructs encoding Ckiδ significantly increased the amounts of both Ckiδ and phospho-tau detectable by both the AT8 and PHF1 antibodies (Fig. 1A). These data recapitulate the pattern seen in vitro (Fig. 1A) and suggest that Ckiδ overexpression significantly increased tau phosphorylation in situ (Fig. 2B). Expression of p25 also induced a large increase in tau phosphorylation, primarily because of the absence of endogenous p25 in non-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). To confirm that the increased levels of Ckiδ observed upon overexpression were accompanied by increases in phosphotransferase activity, Ckiδ was immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro kinase assays using htau40 and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates 24 h after transient transfection with Ckiδ/tau or pcDNA3.1/tau constructs. Radioactive assay reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and visualized on a phosphorimager. Although CK1 activity was found in both the Ckiδ/tau overexpressing and pcDNA3.1/tau control cells (Fig. 3A), quantitation of the data showed that Ckiδ overexpression led to ∼2-fold increases in recoverable phosphotransferase activity (Fig. 3B). These data confirmed that Ckiδ overexpression lead to increased Ckiδ activity within HEK-293 cells, but also showed that significant levels of Ckiδ activity were present under basal conditions. Ckiδ and Tau Directly Interact in Situ—The Ckiδ-mediated tau phosphorylation observed in HEK-293 cells could be direct or arise from an indirect protein phosphorylation cascade. To distinguish these alternatives, tau and Ckiδ were separately immunoprecipitated from stable tau cells and subjected to Western analysis using monoclonal antibodies 128A or Tau5. Results showed that tau and Ckiδ coimmunoprecipitated in both experimental paradigms (Fig. 4, C and D). These data suggest that tau associates with Ckiδ in situ, and therefore potentially serves as a direct substrate for Ckiδ-mediated phosphorylation reactions. To determine the region of Ckiδ involved in binding tau protein, htau40 (non-His6 tagged) was incubated with or without the truncation mutant Ckiδ-Δ317 in vitro and immunoprecipitated with antibody 128A. Subsequent Western analysis with antibodies 128A and Tau5 confirmed direct association between truncated Ckiδ and htau40 (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that at least a portion of the amino acid sequences mediating direct binding of Ckiδ to tau protein are located in the protein kinase catalytic domain. CK1 Inhibitor IC261 Reverses Tau Hyperphosphorylation Induced by Ckiδ Overexpression—IC261 is a small molecule, membrane-permeable, ATP-competitive inhibitor of CK1 isoforms including Ckiδ (14Behrend L.

To determine whether inhibitor treatment could selectively reverse Ckiδ-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation, HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with Ckiδ/tau, P25/tau, or pcDNA3.1/tau for 24 h, treated with and without IC261 (10 μm for 30 min), and then probed for phospho and total tau levels with antibodies PHF1, AT8, and Tau5. The resultant Western blots showed that IC261 inhibited tau phosphorylation induced by Ckiδ overexpression without affecting expression levels of Ckiδ (Fig. 5A). Inhibition was selective for CK1, as shown by the failure of IC261 to significantly modulate tau phosphorylation induced by p25 overexpression (Fig. 5B). These findings are consistent with the inhibitory selectivity of IC261 determined both in vitro and in situ (37Mashhoon N. DeMaggio A.J. Tereshko V. Bergmeier S.C. Egli M. Hoekstra M.F. Kuret J. J.

Moreover, they suggest that CK1-mediated tau phosphorylation is opposed by endogenous phosphoprotein phosphatase activity that can decrease occupancy of phosphorylation sites in response to IC261 over time courses as short as 30 min. Endogenous CK1 Contributes to Basal Levels of Tau Phosphorylation—The above data showed that basal levels of both Ckiδ and phospho-tau were substantial in HEK-293 cells expressing tau protein, and were consistent with previous studies showing that phosphorylation sites Ser396 and Ser202 were partially occupied in both stable and transiently transfected 3T3, Chinese hamster ovary, and SH-SY5Y cells (39Hamdane M.

We used this approach to optimize the tetracycline (Tc)-regulated gene expression system (Tet system) for its function in mammalian cells. The components of the Tet system were incorporated in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 virus such that viral replication is controlled by this regulatory system. Upon long term replication of this HIV-rtTA virus in human T cells, we obtained a virus variant with an enhanced replication potential resulting from an improved rtTA component of the introduced Tet system. We identified a single amino acid exchange, F86Y, which enhances the transcriptional activity and doxycycline (dox) sensitivity of rtTA. We generated a new rtTA variant that is 5-fold more active at high dox levels than the initial rtTA, and 25-fold more sensitive to dox, whereas the background activity in the absence of dox is not increased. This new rtTA variant will be very useful in biological applications that require a more sensitive or active Tet system. Our results demonstrate that the viral evolution strategy can be used to improve the activity of genes by making them an integral and essential part of the virus.

Technology for the regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells and tissues is of primary importance for a wide variety of basic and applied biological research areas, including functional genomics, gene therapy, animal models for human diseases, and biopharmaceutical protein production. All these applications require that production of the protein(s) of interest be regulated in both a quantitative and temporal way. For this purpose, artificial gene expression systems have been developed that are controlled by effector molecules in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. The most frequently used regulatory circuit is the so-called Tet system, which allows stringent control of gene expression by tetracycline (Tc) 1The abbreviations used are: Tc, tetracycline; dox, doxycycline; r, reverse; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TAR, trans-acting response region; LTR, long terminal repeat; wt, wild type; CSR, compartmentalized self-replication. 1The abbreviations used are: Tc, tetracycline; dox, doxycycline; r, reverse; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TAR, trans-acting response region; LTR, long terminal repeat; wt, wild type; CSR, compartmentalized self-replication. or its derivative doxycycline (dox) (1Gossen M. Bujard H. Nelson M. Hillen W. Greenwald R.A. Tetracyclines in Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel2001: 139-157Google Scholar, 2Baron U. Bujard H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 401-421Google Scholar, 3Freundlieb S. Baron U. Bonin A.L. Gossen M. Bujard H. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 159-173Google Scholar). The Tet system is based on the specific, high affinity binding of the Escherichia coli Tet repressor protein (TetR) to the tet operator (tetO) sequence. Tc and dox induce a conformational change in TetR, which impedes the interaction with tetO. Fusion of the activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein to TetR resulted in the transcriptional activator tTA, which induces gene expression from promoters placed downstream of tetO elements (Ptet) in eukaryotic cells. The presence of Tc or dox abolishes this gene expression. A tTA variant with four amino acid substitutions in the TetR moiety exhibits a reverse phenotype (4Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Google Scholar). This reverse tTA (rtTA) binds to Ptet, and activates gene expression in the presence of dox but not in its absence. The Tet system is now widely applied to control gene expression in eukaryotes, including mammals, plants, and insects (reviewed in Ref. 1Gossen M. Bujard H. Nelson M. Hillen W. Greenwald R.A. Tetracyclines in Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel2001: 139-157Google Scholar). Since the Tet system originates from a bacterial regulatory system, it seems likely that the components can be optimized for their new transcriptional function in mammalian cells.A commonly used strategy to improve or alter a specific biological function is directed evolution, which involves genetic diversification followed by selection. This strategy mimics natural evolution, but in a guided and accelerated fashion. In the first step of this approach, cloned DNA sequences, for example encoding a protein, are mutated via random mutagenesis or recombination, resulting in a library of related mutant sequences. In the second step, the mutant sequences with improved or novel function are selected from this library through careful screening in an in vitro or in vivo assay. Directed evolution has been used to change the activity, selectivity, or stability of enzymes (reviewed in Refs. 5Farinas E.T. Bulter T. Arnold F.H. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 545-551Google Scholar and 6Sutherland J.D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 263-269Google Scholar) but also to improve viral vector stability (7Powell S.K. Kaloss M.A. Pinkstaff A. McKee R. Burimski I. Pensiero M. Otto E. Stemmer W.P. Soong N.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1279-1282Google Scholar), cytokine efficacy (8Leong S.R. Chang J.C. Ong R. Dawes G. Stemmer W.P. Punnonen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1163-1168Google Scholar), and antibody fragment binding (9Boder E.T. Midelfort K.S. Wittrup K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10701-10705Google Scholar). Recently, Yokobayashi et al. (10Yokobayashi Y. Weiss R. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16587-16591Google Scholar) successfully applied directed evolution to genes comprising a simple genetic circuit and demonstrated that a nonfunctional circuit containing improperly matched components could evolve rapidly into a functional one (10Yokobayashi Y. Weiss R. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16587-16591Google Scholar, 11Hasty J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16516-16518Google Scholar). The success of direct evolution depends on both the realization of a sufficiently large genetic diversity and the effectiveness of the selection procedure.Previous optimizations of the Tet system were based on the introduction of rationally designed mutations, and on directed evolution, in which large scale mutagenesis of the components of the Tet system was followed by functional screening of the mutants in bacterial or yeast assay systems (12Urlinger S. Baron U. Thellmann M. Hasan M.T. Bujard H. Hillen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7963-7968Google Scholar, 13Baumeister R. Helbl V. Hillen W. J. Mol.

Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2723-2729Google Scholar). However, these approaches are labor intensive, and mutations selected in a bacterial or yeast assay system may not be improvements in higher eukaryotes. We here present viral evolution as a novel and powerful method to optimize non-viral proteins. We used this approach to optimize the Tet system for its function in mammalian cells. The components of the Tet system were incorporated into the HIV-1 virus such that virus replication is controlled by this regulatory system. During replication of this virus on human T cells, genetic diversity is continuously generated due to the error-prone reverse transcription process, followed by outgrowth of faster replicating variants. Thus, the generation of genetic diversity and selection of improved variants are combined in this natural evolution approach. In this way, we have selected for HIV variants with improved replication capacity resulting from an improved rtTA-component of the introduced Tet system. The observed rtTA mutation does not only improve virus replication but also the Tet system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Viruses—SupT1 T cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin. SupT1 cells were transfected with HIV-1 molecular clones by electroporation. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were washed in RPMI 1640 with 20% FBS and mixed with 1–10 μg of DNA in 250 μl of RPMI 1640 with 20% FBS. Cells were electroporated in 0.4-cm cuvettes at 250 V and 960 microfarads and subsequently resuspended in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. Cells were split 1 to 10 twice a week.HeLa X1/6 cells (15Baron U. Gossen M. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2723-2729Google Scholar) are derivatives of the HeLa cervix carcinoma cell line and harbor chromosomally integrated copies of the CMV-7tetO promoter/luciferase reporter construct pUHC13–3 (16Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar). HeLa X1/6 and C33A cervix carcinoma cells (ATCC HTB31) (17Auersperg N. J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 1964; 32: 135-163Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 as a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Cells were grown in 1 ml of culture medium in 2-cm2 wells of a 24-well plate to 60% confluence. 1 μg of DNA in 15 μl of water was mixed with 25 μl of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.1)-250 mm NaCl-1.5 mm Na2HPO4 and 10 μl of 0.6 m CaCl2, incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and added to the culture medium. The culture medium was refreshed after 16 h.The incorporation of the Tet system into the HIV-1 genome was described previously (18Verhoef K. Marzio G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 979-987Google Scholar). The HIVrtTA used in this study is the KYK version, which contains the inactivating Y26A mutation in the Tat gene and five nucleotide substitutions in the TAR (trans-acting response region) hairpin motif. This virus contains the rtTA2S-S2 gene (12Urlinger S. Baron U. Thellmann M. Hasan M.T. Bujard H. Hillen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7963-7968Google Scholar) in place of the nef gene and eight tetO sequences in the LTR promoter region.For the selection of viruses with improved replication capacity, 10 μg of the HIVrtTA molecular clone was transfected into SupT1 cells. Cells were cultured in the presence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) for up to 114 days. When HIV-induced cytopathic effects were seen, high level virus replication was maintained by passage of the cell-free culture supernatant onto uninfected SupT1 cells. Cell and supernatant samples were isolated and stored at -80 °C. An HIVLAI virus stock was produced by transfection of 10 μg of the corresponding molecular clone (19Peden K. Emerman M. Montagnier L. Virology. 1991; 185: 661-672Google Scholar) into SupT1 cells. Virus was quantitated by CA-p24 antigen ELISA (Abbott) (20Back N.K.T. Nijhuis M. Keulen W. Boucher C.A.B. Oude Essink B.B. van Kuilenburg A.B.P. Van Gennip A.H. Berkhout B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4040-4049Google Scholar).Proviral DNA Analysis and Cloning of Revertant Sequences—HIV-1-infected cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 4 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. DNA was solubilized by resuspending the cells in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)-1 mm EDTA-0.5% Tween 20, followed by incubation with 200 μg of proteinase K/ml at 56 °C for 30 min and at 95 °C for 10 min. Proviral DNA sequences were PCR amplified from total cellular DNA, using the 5′ primer nef-seq1 (positions 56 to 37 upstream of the rtTA translation start site) and the 3′ U3 primer anti-U3-att (positions 63 to 44 downstream of the rtTA translation stop codon). PCR fragments were digested with XcmI and SmaI and cloned into the corresponding sites in the shuttle vector pBlue3′LTRext-ΔU3-rtTA-2ΔtetO, which is identical to the vector pBlue3′LTRext-ΔU3-rtTA-K8-TAR* (18Verhoef K. Marzio G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 979-987Google Scholar) but with the optimized 2ΔtetO promoter configuration (21Marzio G. Verhoef K. Vink M. Berkhout B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6342-6347Google Scholar, 22Marzio G. Vink M. Verhoef K. de Ronde A. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3084-3088Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed by big dye terminator cycle sequencing (PE Biosystems). For the construction of the F86Y single mutant, the F86Y-containing XcmI-NdeI rtTA fragment of pBlue3′LTRext-ΔU3-rtTAF86Y A209T-2ΔtetO was used to replace the corresponding sequence in pBlue3′LTRext-ΔU3-rtTA-2ΔtetO to create pBlue3′LTRext-ΔU3-rtTAF86Y-2ΔtetO. For the cloning of the mutant rtTA sequences into the HIVrtTA provirus, the BamHI-BglI fragment of the shuttle vectors was used to replace the corresponding sequences in HIVrtTA.The plasmid pCMV-rtTA contains the improved rtTA2S-S2 gene cloned in the expression vector pUHD141–1/X (12Urlinger S. Baron U. Thellmann M. Hasan M.T. Bujard H. Hillen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7963-7968Google Scholar). The XbaI-SmaI fragment from the shuttle vector pBlue3′LTRext-ΔU3-rtTAF86Y-2ΔtetO and pBlue3′LTRext-ΔU3-rtTAF86Y A209T-2ΔtetO was used to replace the corresponding sequence in pCMV-rtTA, resulting in the plasmid pCMV-rtTAF86Y and pCMV-rtTAF86Y A209T, respectively. The plasmids pCMV-rtTAS12G and pCMV-rtTAS12G F86Y A209T were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis in which the oligonucleotide 5′-ATAACCATGTCTAGACTGCACAAGAGCAAAGTCATAAACGGAGCTCTGGAATTACTCAATGGTGTCGGTATCGAAGGCCTGACGACAAGGAAACTCGCT (mutated codon underlined) was annealed to the oligonucleotide 5′-AGCAGGGCCCGCTTGTTCTTCACGTGCCAGTACAGGGTAGGCTGCTCAACTCCCAGCTTTTGAGCGAGTTTCCTTGTCGTCAGGCCTTCGA, both strands were completed with Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of dNTPs, digested with XcmI and ApaI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pCMV-rtTA and pCMV-rtTAF86Y A209T, respectively.rtTA Activity Assay—In the plasmid pLTR-2ΔtetO-lucff the expression of firefly luciferase is under the control of the LTR-2ΔtetO-promoter of HIVrtTA (22Marzio G. Vink M. Verhoef K. de Ronde A. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3084-3088Google Scholar). In the plasmid pCMV-7tetO-lucff the firefly luciferase expression is controlled by seven tetO elements coupled to a minimal CMV promoter. This plasmid was previously named pUHC13–3 (16Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar). The plasmid pRL-CMV, in which the expression of renilla luciferase is controlled by a CMV promoter, is co-transfected into the C33A and HeLa X1/6 cells to allow correction for differences in transfection efficiency.C33A cells were co-transfected with 0.4 ng of pCMV-rtTA (wild type or mutant), 0.5 ng of pRL-CMV, and either 20 ng of pLTR-2ΔtetO-lucff or pCMV-7tetO-lucff. HeLa X1/6 cells were co-transfected with 8 ng of pCMV-rtTA and 2.5 ng of pRL-CMV. pBluescript was added to the transfection mix to a total of 1 μg of DNA. The cells were cultured after transfection for 48 h in the presence of different dox concentrations. Cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined with the dual-luciferase assay (Promega). The expression of firefly and Renilla luciferase was within the linear range and no squelching effects were observed. The ratio between the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities reflects the activity of the rtTA proteins.Western Blot Analysis—HeLa X1/6 cells were transfected at 90% confluency with 1 μg of wild-type or mutant pCMV-rtTA and 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 2-cm2 wells. Cells were cultured for 48 h in the absence of dox and lysed in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). 10 μl of the lysate was mixed with 10 μl of reducing SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol). Proteins were resolved in an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (1 h, 80 V), and subsequently blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk. For immunochemical detection of rtTA, membranes were subsequently incubated with rabbit serum containing polyclonal anti-TetR antibodies (23Krueger C. Berens C. Schmidt A. Schnappinger D. Hillen W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3050-3056Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were visualized with peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG and the ECL+ kit (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with a Storm 860 Imager (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSThe Tet System as an Essential Component of HIV-1 Replication—We have previously reported the construction of an infectious HIVrtTA virus that is critically dependent on dox for its replication (18Verhoef K. Marzio G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 979-987Google Scholar). HIV-1 gene expression and replication are naturally controlled by the viral Tat protein, which binds to the 5′ TAR hairpin in the nascent RNA transcript (24Berkhout B. Silverman R.H. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 273-282Google Scholar) and thereby enhances transcription (reviewed in Ref. 25Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Google Scholar). In the HIVrtTA variant, this Tat-TAR regulatory mechanism was inactivated by mutation of both Tat and TAR and functionally replaced by the components of the Tet system (Fig. 1A). The gene encoding the rtTA transcriptional activator protein was inserted in place of the 3′-terminal nef gene, and eight copies of the tetO binding sites were introduced in the LTR promoter. This virus does not replicate in the absence of dox. Administration of dox induces transcription of the viral genome and expression of the viral proteins, including rtTA. This rtTA protein subsequently activates transcription, gene expression, and virus replication. Other groups have also tried to implement the Tet system in HIV and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), but these attempts failed to produce an efficiently replicating virus (26Smith S.M. Khoroshev M. Marx P.A. Orenstein J. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32184-32190Google Scholar, 27Xiao Y. Kuwata T. Miura T. Hayami M. Shida H. Virology. 2000; 269: 268-275Google Scholar). Although our HIVrtTA virus can initiate a spreading infection in the presence of dox, replication was relatively poor when compared with the parental HIVLAI virus. Instead of trying to improve HIVrtTA by additional molecular-biological manipulations, we set out to let nature select for virus variants with improved replication capacity.Improved Viral Replication through Evolution-driven Optimization of the rtTA Gene—We previously reported that a characteristic change in the LTR-tetO promoter occurred in multiple, independent long term virus cultures (21Marzio G. Verhoef K. Vink M. Berkhout B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6342-6347Google Scholar, 22Marzio G. Vink M. Verhoef K. de Ronde A. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3084-3088Google Scholar). In a particular culture with greatly accelerated virus replication we also observed amino acid changes in the rtTA protein. Genetic analysis at 114 days of culture indicated that HIVrtTA had acquired two amino acid changes in the rtTA protein; the phenylalanine at position 86 was replaced by tyrosine (F86Y) and the alanine at position 209 by threonine (A209T; Fig. 1A). The F86Y mutation is striking because it changes a strictly conserved residue in the TetR domain that is in direct contact with the Tc/dox effector molecule (Fig. 1C). To directly compare the replication capacity of this evolved HIVrtTA, the original HIVrtTA, and the wild-type HIVLAI, we infected SupT1 T cells with equal amounts of virus (Fig. 1B). Replication potential of the evolved HIVrtTA virus was significantly improved when compared with the original virus and approached that of the parental HIVLAI. Like the original HIVrtTA virus, the new HIVrtTA variant does not replicate in the absence of dox.To demonstrate that the rtTA mutations are responsible for the observed improvement in viral replication, we constructed viruses with the individual F86Y mutation (HIVrtTA-F86Y) or the combined F86Y and A209T mutations (HIVrtTA-F86Y A209T) and assayed replication of these variants at different dox concentrations (Fig. 2). The fully wild-type HIVLAI isolate of which the replication is not influenced by dox was included as a control (Fig. 2A). The parental HIVrtTA did not replicate in the absence of dox and a low level of replication was observed at 100 ng/ml dox (Fig. 2B). Increasing the dox concentration resulted in a gradual increase in replication rate. Replication of HIVrtTA-F86Y was also completely dependent on dox, but a high level of replication was already apparent at 100 ng/ml dox (Fig. 2C). At this dox concentration, HIVrtTA-F86Y replicates even more efficiently than HIVrtTA at 1000 ng/ml dox. The HIVrtTA-F86Y A209T showed the same dox dependence and replication potential as HIVrtTA-F86Y (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the F86Y rtTA mutation is sufficient to significantly improve viral replication both at low and high dox concentrations. The superior replication capacity of HIVrtTA-F86Y was confirmed in a direct competition experiment with HIVrtTA. SupT1 cells were infected with equal amounts of the two viruses in the presence of 1000 ng/ml dox. The F86Y variant dominated the viral population within 1 week of culture (more than 80% of the population-based sequence), and this variant was exclusively detected at later times (results not shown).Fig. 2The F86Y rtTA mutation improves viral replication. The F86Y and A209T mutations observed upon prolonged culturing of HIVrtTA were cloned into the original HIVrtTA virus. Molecular clones (1 μg) encoding HIVLAI (A), HIVrtTA (B), HIVrtTA-F86Y (C), and HIVrtTA-F86Y A209T (D), all containing the improved LTR-2ΔtetO promoter (21Marzio G. Verhoef K. Vink M. Berkhout B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6342-6347Google Scholar), were transfected into SupT1 T cells. Cells were cultured in the presence of different dox concentrations (0–1000 ng/ml). Virus replication was monitored by CA-p24 ELISA on culture supernatant samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We also tested the effect of the rtTA mutations in a virus production assay by transiently transfecting plasmids encoding wt and mutant HIVrtTA proviral genomes into C33A cervix carcinoma cells. These cells support viral gene expression and virion production but do not support viral replication because they lack the appropriate receptors. HIVrtTA virus production gradually increases with increasing dox concentration and reaches its maximal level at 250 ng/ml dox (Fig. 3). HIVrtTA-F86Y A209T virus production is also dox-dependent, but a high production level is already reached at 30 ng/ml dox. Thus, the rtTA mutant significantly improves expression of the proviral genome at low dox concentrations.Fig. 3rtTA mutations improve virus production. C33A cervix carcinoma cells were transfected with 1 μg of the molecular clones encoding HIVrtTA and HIVrtTA-F86Y A209T and cultured in the presence of different dox concentrations (0–1000 ng/ml). Virus production was measured by CA-p24 ELISA on culture supernatant samples at 2 days after transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Evolved rtTA Variant Greatly Improves the Tet System—To test whether the evolved rtTAs do also improve the Tet gene expression system, we assayed the rtTA variants in a regular Tet system, out of the HIVrtTA virus context. Expression plasmids encoding the wt (rtTAwt) and mutant rtTA proteins (rtTAF86Y and rtTAF86Y A209T) were co-transfected into C33A cells with a plasmid encoding the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the viral LTR-2ΔtetO promoter (Fig. 4A). The luciferase level measured 2 days after transfection reflects the transcriptional activity of the rtTA protein. The wt and mutant rtTAs show no activity in the absence of dox (Fig. 4B). rtTAwt activity is detectable first at 500 ng/ml dox and increases further at 1000 ng/ml. rtTAF86Y and rtTAF86Y A209T activity is detectable at dox levels as low as 50 ng/ml, and this activity gradually increases with higher dox concentrations. Moreover, these mutant rtTAs are ∼4-fold more active than the rtTAwt at higher dox levels. Identical activities are observed with rtTAF86Y and rtTAF86Y A209T, confirming that the F86Y mutation is solely responsible for the increased rtTA activity.Fig. 4Evolved rtTA variants show increased activity and dox sensitivity in different Tet systems. A, the rtTA activity of wild-type (rtTAwt) and mutant rtTA proteins (rtTAF86Y and rtTAF86Y A209T) was measured in Tet systems that differ in the tetO-promoter reporter-gene configuration. The rtTA activity was measured in C33A cells transfected with a plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of the viral LTR-2ΔtetO promoter (LTR-2ΔtetO; B) or under the control of a minimal CMV-derived promoter coupled to seven tetO elements (CMV-7tetO; C). Furthermore, rtTA activity was measured in HeLA X1/6 cells (15Baron U. Gossen M. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2723-2729Google Scholar) that contain a chromosomally integrated copy of the CMV-7tetO firefly luciferase construct (CMV-7tetO-integrated; D). Cells were transfected with rtTA expression plasmids (rtTAwt, rtTAF86Y, and rtTAF86Y A209T) or pBluescript (-; no rtTA) and a plasmid constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. Cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of dox (0–1000 ng/ml), and the ratio of the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities measured 2 days after transfection reflects the activity of the rtTA protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This optimization of the rtTA protein by spontaneous virus evolution is not a specific adaptation to the LTR-2ΔtetO promoter, since similar results were obtained in assays with a standard reporter gene construct in which the luciferase gene is under control of seven tet operators coupled to a minimal CMV promoter (Fig. 4C). We also assayed the rtTA activity in HeLa X1/6 cells that contain a chromosomally integrated copy of this CMV-7tetO reporter construct (15Baron U. Gossen M. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2723-2729Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D). Also in these cells, both rtTAF86Y and rtTAF86Y A209T show activity at much lower dox concentrations when compared with rtTAwt, and the mutants are more active than the wild type at high dox levels. Thus, the F86Y mutation improves rtTA activity independent of the type of promoter and the episomal or chromosomal status of the promoter.In their random mutagenesis studies, Urlinger et al. (12Urlinger S. Baron U. Thellmann M. Hasan M.T. Bujard H. Hillen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7963-7968Google Scholar) recently identified an S12G mutation that improved rtTA activity. We made expression vectors encoding this mutant (rtTAS12G; previously named rtTA2S-M2 in Ref. 12Urlinger S. Baron U. Thellmann M. Hasan M.T. Bujard H. Hillen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7963-7968Google Scholar) and a mutant in which the S12G mutation was combined with the F86Y and A209T mutations (rtTAS12G F86Y A209T). The rtTAs were tested in combination with the LTR-2ΔtetO reporter construct in C33A cells (Table I). rtTAS12G is indeed more active than rtTAwt, both at low and high dox levels. When compared with rtTAF86Y A209T, rtTAS12G is more active at the lowest dox concentration assayed but less active at high dox levels. Combining the mutations in rtTAS12G F86Y A209T yielded the highest activity at both low and high dox concentrations. To reach an activity that is comparable with the activity of rtTAwt at 1000 ng/ml dox, rtTAS12G F86Y A209T only needs 40 ng/ml dox, which can be translated into a 25-fold increased dox sensitivity (Table I). Importantly, like the other mutants, rtTAS12G F86Y A209T does not show any activity in the absence of dox. The optimal performance of this rtTA is also obvious when considering the fold induction of gene expression by dox. The rtTAS12G F86Y A209T activity is induced up to 47-fold, whereas rtTAwt can only be induce"

Assembly is mimicked by a cell-free system consisting of membranes and cytosolic components, activated by an anionic amphiphile. We reported that a chimeric construct, consisting of residues 1–212 of p67phox and full-length Rac1, activates the oxidase in vitro in anamphiphile-dependent manner, and when prenylated, in the absence of amphiphile and p47phox. We subjected chimera p67phox-(1–212)-Rac1 to mutational analysis and found that: 1) replacement of a single basic residue at the C terminus of the Rac1 moiety by glutamine is sufficient for loss of activity by the non-prenylated chimera; replacement of all six basic residues by glutamines is required for loss of activity by the prenylated chimera. 2) A V204A mutation in the activation domain of the p67phox moiety leads to a reduction in activity. 3) Mutating residues, known to participate in the interaction between free p67phox and Rac1, in the p67phox-(R102E) or Rac1 (A27K, G30S) moieties of the chimera, leads to a marked decrease in activity, indicating a requirement for intrachimeric bonds, in addition to the engineered fusion. 4) Chimeras, inactive because of mutations A27K or G30S in the Rac1 moiety, are reactivated by supplementation with exogenous Rac1-GTP but not with exogenous p67phox. This demonstrates that Rac has a dual role in the assembly of NADPH oxidase. One is to tether p67phox to the membrane; the other is to induce an “activating” conformational change in p67phox.

Phagocytic cells possess an enzyme complex responsible for the generation of superoxide (O2˙-) 1The abbreviations used are: O2˙-, superoxide; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mant-GMP-PNP, 2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-β,γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GDPβS, guanosine 5′-2-O-(thio)-diphosphate; GMP-PNP, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; LiDS, lithium dodecyl sulfate; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor. in response to stimuli acting via membrane receptors. The complex, commonly referred to as NADPH oxidase (briefly, “oxidase”), is composed of a membrane-associated flavocytochrome b559 (a heterodimer consisting of two subunits, gp91phox and p22phox) and four cytosolic components, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase Rac (Rac1 or 2) (reviewed in Refs. 1Nauseef W.M. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1999; 111: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and 2Leto T.L. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 3rd Ed. Lippincott, Philadelphia, PA1999: 769-786Google Scholar). The component responsible for electron transport from cytosolic NADPH to oxygen is gp91phox, which contains the NADPH binding site and three redox stations, represented by FAD and two nonidentical hemes (3Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 4Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C.

A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It is now apparent that homologues of gp91phox (also known as Nox2) are found in a variety of mammalian nonphagocytic cells and in some lower organisms (the Nox/Duox family) (reviewed in Ref. 6Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Recently, homologues of p47phox, known as Nox organizer 1 (NOXO1), and p67phox, known as Nox activator 1 (NOXA1), were also described in such cells (reviewed in Ref. 7Bokoch G.M. Knaus U.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). 2The terms NOXO (NOX organizer) and NOXA (NOX activator) were recently adopted as terms to apply to all p47phox and p67phox homologues, respectively (7Bokoch G.M. Knaus U.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The Nox proteins function as components of enzyme complexes generating oxygen radicals with a variety of roles, other than host defense, such as regulation of cell proliferation, signal transduction, oxidative modification of proteins, and oxygen sensing. Activation of the oxidase, resulting in O2˙- production, is probably the consequence of a conformational change in gp91phox, caused by the interaction of cytochrome b559 with one or several of the cytosolic oxidase components (8Paclet M.-H. Coleman A.W. Vergnaud S. Morel F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9302-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Establishing contact with cytochrome b559 requires the translocation to the plasma membrane of p47phox, p67phox, and Rac, a process known as oxidase assembly (reviewed in Refs. 9De Leo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar and 10Lambeth J.D. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 33: 427-439Google Scholar). Stimulus-elicited activation of the oxidase in intact cells can be mimicked in a cell-free system, in which phagocyte membranes or purified and relipidated cytochrome b559 are mixed with the cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, and Rac, in the presence of an anionic amphiphile, serving as an activator (11Bromberg Y.

Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amphiphile acts by causing a conformational change in p47phox (16Swain S.D. Helgerson S.L. Davis A.R. Nelson L.K. Quinn M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29502-29510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and, possibly, also by the induction of structural changes in cytochrome b559 (17Foubert T.R. Burritt J.B. Taylor R.M. Jesaitis A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1567: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The impairment of O2˙- production in the p47phox-deficient form of chronic granulomatous disease shows that p47phox is essential for oxidase assembly in vivo. Oxidase activation can, however, be achieved in vitro, in the absence of p47phox, but not in the absence of p67phox (18Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol.

These findings support a pivotal role for p67phox in oxidase activation, a concept that was strengthened by the definition of an “activation domain” in p67phox, consisting of residues 199–210 (21Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) or 187–210 (22Grizot S. Fieschi F. Dagher M.-C. Pebay-Peyroula E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21627-21631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This domain was proposed to interact with gp91phox and to control electron flow from NADPH to FAD (23Nisimoto Y. Motalebi S. Han C.-H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence for this was recently provided by the findings that p67phox binds to gp91phox (24Dang P.M.-C. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3001-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and that Rac1 (24Dang P.M.-C. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3001-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and phosphorylated p47phox (25Dang P.M.-C. Cross A.R. Quinn M.T. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4262-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) increase the binding of p67phox to cytochrome b559. Versions of p67phox truncated at residues 199 or 210, both bound to cytochrome b559 (better than the intact protein) (25Dang P.M.-C. Cross A.R. Quinn M.T. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4262-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but only the form truncated at residue 210 was capable of supporting oxidase activation in vitro (21Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It was, consequently, suggested that binding of p67phox to gp91phox is required but not sufficient for oxidase activation and that a conformational change, involving the activation domain of p67phox, is required (25Dang P.M.-C. Cross A.R. Quinn M.T. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4262-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A model of oxidase activation has been put forward (21Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 23Nisimoto Y. Motalebi S. Han C.-H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in which p67phox functions as the “activator,” whereas p47phox and Rac serve as “organizers,” in agreement with the recently adopted nomenclature of p67phox and p47phox homologues. To better understand the distinct organizer roles of p47phox and Rac, we designed a cell-free activation system consisting of prenylated (geranylgeranylated) Rac1, which represents the physiological form of Rac1 in eukaryotic cells, phagocyte membranes, and p67phox (26Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this situation, interaction of p67phox with cytochrome b559 was made dependent exclusively on prenylated Rac and oxidase activation could be achieved in the absence of p47phox and amphiphile. This suggested that, under certain conditions, targeting of Rac to the phagocyte membrane was sufficient for the induction of oxidase assembly. Recently, Tamura and colleagues (27Miyano K. Ogasawara S. Han C.-H. Fukuda H. Tamura M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14089-14097Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and we (28Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) introduced a novel methodological approach to the study of oxidase activation, consisting of the construction of chimeric proteins, in which specific moieties of p67phox and Rac1 were fused. The prototype chimera consisted of residues 1–212 of p67phox and residues 1–192 of Rac1 and was named chimera 3 (28Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The moieties of the fused components comprised all the elements participating in the natural interaction between p67phox and Rac. This is mediated by residues located in the pre-switch I and switch I regions and a more C-terminal region of Rac1 (29Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A.

This interaction is dependent on Rac being in the GTP-bound form (29Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and is of relatively low affinity (Kd = 1.7 μm; see Ref. 31Lapouge K. Smith S.J. Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The fusion of p67phox with Rac1 generated a structure in which the components were brought permanently into close proximity and also resulted in a protein behaving as a bona fide small GTPase, capable of binding GTP/GDP in equimolar amounts (28Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the design of chimera 3, the C terminus of Rac1 was placed at the C terminus of the chimera, enabling prenylation at Cys189 in the Rac moiety. Thus, a set of p67phox-Rac1 chimeras enzymatically prenylated in vitro were also generated (33Gorzalczany Y. Alloul N. Sigal N. Weinbaum C. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18605-18610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Non-prenylated chimera 3 was found to be an activator of the oxidase in vitro, in both GTP- and GDP-bound forms, in the presence of p47phox and the anionic amphiphile lithium dodecyl sulfate (LiDS) (28Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the GTP-bound form, it was also capable of moderate oxidase activation in the absence of p47phox. Prenylated chimera 3, in the GTP-bound form, was found to elicit a high level of NADPH-dependent O2˙- production by phagocyte membranes, in the absence of both activator and p47phox (33Gorzalczany Y.

This report describes the effect of mutating specific residues in the p67phox and Rac moieties of the prototype chimera 3 (p67phox-(1–212)-Rac1-(1–192)) on its functional ability and supports a model of oxidase assembly in which Rac has a dual role of membrane tethering and “activation” of p67phox.

Preparation of Non-chimeric Recombinant Proteins—p47phox was prepared in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, as described earlier (35Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Non-prenylated Rac1, Rac1 mutants A27K, G30S, and Q61L, Rac1 truncated at residue 178 (Rac1-(1–178)) or 185 (Rac1-(1–185)), GDP dissociation inhibitor for Rho (Rho GDI), and p67phox, truncated at residue 212 (p67phox-(1–212)), were produced in Escherichia coli, as described earlier (26Gorzalczany Y.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Non-prenylated CDC42Hs and RhoA were expressed in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Sigma), followed by cleavage by thrombin in situ, as described before (35Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All recombinant proteins listed above were expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus™ competent cells (Stratagene). Generation of Chimeras 3 and 5—Chimera p67phox-(1–212)-Rac1-(1–192) (chimera 3) and chimera p67phox-(1–212)-Rac1-(1–178) (chimera 5) were generated by polymerase chain reaction, joining DNA fragments from p67phox with DNA fragments from Rac1, as described earlier (28Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins, essentially as described for Rac1 (35Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Toporik A. Gorzalczany Y. Hirshberg M. Pick E. Lotan O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but E. coli DH5α™ cells (Invitrogen) were used. Induction was with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 18 h at 18 °C (chimera 3), and 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 18 h at 22 °C (chimera 5), in flasks shaken at 190 rpm. The chimeric proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose, followed by cleavage by thrombin in situ, as described before (35Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Chimera 3—Eight mutants of chimera 3 (numbers 9–16) were constructed and are illustrated in Fig. 1. The numbering of mutant chimeric constructs continues the list of chimeras (numbers 1–8), as appearing in Ref. 28Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. Single and multiple mutations were inserted into the p67phox or Rac1 cDNA moieties of p67phox-(1–212)-Rac1-(1–192) cDNA, in pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), by PCR site-directed mutagenesis using specific oligonucleotide primers and PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the mutant proteins were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide-based sequencing. Chimera 9 was generated from chimera 3, by converting Lys183 to Gln, in the Rac1 moiety. Chimera 10 was generated from chimera 9, by converting both Lys184 and Arg185 to Gln, in the Rac1 moiety. Chimera 11 was generated from chimera 10, by converting Lys186 to Gln, in the Rac1 moiety. Chimera 12 was generated from chimera 11, by converting both Arg187 and Lys188 to Gln, in the Rac moiety. Chimera 13 was generated from chimera 3, by converting Val204 to Ala, in the p67phox moiety. Chimera 14 was generated from chimera 3, by converting Arg102 to Glu, in the p67phox moiety. Chimera 15 was generated from chimera 3, by converting Ala27 to Lys, in the Rac1 moiety. Chimera 16 was generated from chimera 3, by converting Gly30 to Ser, in the Rac1 moiety. All mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli DH5α™ cells as GST fusion proteins and purified on glutathione-agarose, by the methodology used for the wild type chimeras. Characterization of Mutant Chimeras—The protein content of mutant chimeric proteins was assessed by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar), using the microplate modification (Bulletin 1177 EG; Bio-Rad). The level of purity of the chimeric proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and staining by GelCode™ blue stain reagent (Pierce). All chimeras were assayed for the ability to bind GTP, by using the fluorescent analogue 2′- (or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-β,γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate (mant-GMP-PNP) (Molecular Probes), as described (28Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The identity and amount of nucleotides bound to the native or nucleotide-exchanged forms of the recombinant mutant chimeras were determined by liberating the bound nucleotides from the protein, as described in Ref. 38Bromberg Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7055-7058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and identifying the nucleotides by anion exchange chromatography on a Partisil 10 SAX column, as described in Ref. 39Sigal N.

Prenylation of Chimeras—Recombinant chimeric proteins were generated in E. coli in the unprocessed form and were geranylgeranylated in vitro by recombinant geranylgeranyltransferase type I, as described recently (33Gorzalczany Y. Alloul N. Sigal N. Weinbaum C. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18605-18610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The level of prenylation was assessed by phase separation in Triton X-114 (40Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Nucleotide Exchange—Chimeras and Rac1 were subjected to nucleotide exchange from the native GDP-bound form to GTPγS, GDPβS, or GMP-PNP (all from Roche Applied Science), as described before (26Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A nucleotide to protein ratio of 10/1 was used for exchange to GTPγS and GDPβS, and a ratio of 20/1 was used for exchange to GMP-PNP. NADPH Oxidase Activation in a Semirecombinant Cell-free System— Mutant chimeras were tested for the ability to support oxidase activation in a semi-recombinant cell-free system as described before for non-prenylated (28Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and prenylated (33Gorzalczany Y. Alloul N. Sigal N. Weinbaum C. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18605-18610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) chimeras. When assaying non-prenylated chimeras, the cell-free system consisted of phagocyte membrane vesicles (at a concentration equivalent to 5 nm cytochrome b559 heme), p47phox (300 nm), chimeras (at concentrations that varied from 50 to 800 nm), and the amphiphilic activator LiDS (130 μm). In selected experiments, oxidase activation was performed in the absence of p47phox. Prenylated chimeras were assayed in a cell-free system consisting of phagocyte membrane vesicles (at a concentration equivalent to 5 nm cytochrome b559 heme), and chimeras (at concentrations that varied from 50 to 800 nm), in the absence of p47phox and an amphiphilic activator. Mixtures were incubated in 96-well microplates, in volumes of 200 μl of assay buffer (36Toporik A. Gorzalczany Y. Hirshberg M. Pick E. Lotan O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) per well, in duplicate, for 90 s at 25 °C, followed by the addition of NADPH (240 μm), to initiate O2˙- production. This was quantified by the kinetics of cytochrome c reduction, as described (36Toporik A. Gorzalczany Y. Hirshberg M. Pick E. Lotan O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In specific experiments, certain components were added to or removed from the standard mixtures; these variations are described under “Results.” The ability of the p67phox and Rac1 moieties of the various mutant chimeras to function independently of their fusion partners was measured as described for the wild type chimeras (28Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For testing the Rac1 moiety, the chimeras were subjected to exchange to GTPγS. Synthetic Rac1 C-terminal Peptide—A peptide corresponding to the C-terminal polybasic segment of Rac1 (residues 178–192) was synthesized by Mimotopes Fisher Scientific, at a purity of 92%. The peptide was dissolved in 75% dimethyl sulfoxide, 25% water (v/v), at a concentration of 1.5 mm, and further diluted in oxidase assay buffer (36Toporik A. Gorzalczany Y. Hirshberg M. Pick E. Lotan O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to the desired final concentration. Inhibition of Cell-free Oxidase Activation by Non-prenylated and Prenylated Chimera by Rac1 C-terminal Peptide and Rho GDI—The standard cell-free assay methodologies for the two forms of chimeras were applied, with two exceptions. First, p47phox was also omitted in experiments involving non-prenylated chimera, to make the two assays strictly comparable. Second, to compensate for the lower reaction rates in assays involving non-prenylated chimera, in the absence of p47phox, the concentration of non-prenylated chimera was set at 600 nm, whereas prenylated chimera was used at 300 nm. The order of addition of the components in peptide inhibition experiments was: peptide, assay buffer with or without LiDS, membrane, and chimera, followed by 90 s incubation before the addition of NADPH. In experiments assessing inhibition by Rho GDI, the order of addition of the components to the reaction was: chimera, assay buffer with or without LiDS, and Rho GDI. These mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by the addition of membrane, and, after 90 s, of NADPH. The degree of inhibition was calculated in relation to samples in which peptide or Rho GDI were replaced by an equivalent volume of buffer. Characterization of Chimeras and Chimera-Rac Interactions by Gel Filtration—Chimeras or mixtures of chimeras and Rac1, exchanged to mant-GMP-PNP, were subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2,and 2 mm dithioerythritol. Chromatography was performed on a high performance liquid chromatography system (Waters), at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, at 4 °C, and absorbance at 280 nm was measured continuously by a diode array detector (MD-1510, Jasco). When Rac, labeled with mant-GMP-PNP was present, the fluorescent signal (excitation = 361 nm; emission = 440 nm) was also recorded continuously, by passing the column eluate through a spectrofluorometer (FP-750; Jasco), fitted with a high performance liquid chromatography flow cell (MFC-132, Jasco). The column was standardized with molecular mass markers in the range 6,500–66,000 (MW-GF-70 Kit, Sigma). The Rationale on Which the Design of Mutant Chimeras Was Based—All mutants were derived from chimera p67phox-(1–212)-Rac1-(1–192) (chimera 3; Ref. 28Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and are listed in Fig. 1. Each mutant was meant to assess the importance of a certain residue or cluster of residues, in either the p67phox or the Rac1 moiety, for the oxidase activating ability of the original chimera 3. Thus, chimeras 9–12 were designed to examine the effect of modifying the number of basic residues at the C terminus of the Rac1 moiety. Chimera 13 was meant to test the importance of the activation domain in the p67phox moiety. Chimeras 14–16 were designed to investigate the need for an interaction between t"

CHL1 is expressed as a transmembrane protein of 185 kDa, and ectodomain shedding releases soluble fragments relevant for its physiological function. Here we describe that ADAM8, a member of the family of metalloprotease disintegrins cleaves a CHL1-Fc fusion protein in vitro at two sites corresponding to release of the extracellular domain of CHL1 in fibronectin (FN) domains II (125 kDa) and V (165 kDa), inhibited by batimastat (BB-94). Cleavage of CHL1-Fc in the 125-kDa fragment was not detectable under non-reducing conditions arguing that cleavage resulting in the 165-kDa fragment is more relevant in releasing soluble CHL1 in vivo. In cells transfected with full-length ADAM8, membrane proximal cleavage of CHL1 was similar and not stimulated by phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and pervanadate. No cleavage of CHL1 was observed in cells expressing either inactive ADAM8 with a Glu330 to Gln exchange (EQ-A8), or active ADAM10 and ADAM17. Consequently, processing of CHL1 was hardly detectable in brain extracts of ADAM8-deficient mice but enhanced in a neurodegenerative mouse mutant. CHL1 processed by ADAM8 in supernatants of COS-7 cells and in co-culture with cerebellar granule neurons was very potent in stimulating neurite outgrowth and suppressing neuronal cell death, not observed in cells co-transfected with CHL1/EQ-A8, CHL1/ADAM10, or CHL1/ADAM17. Taken together, we propose that ADAM8 plays an important role in physiological and pathological cell interactions by a specific release of functional CHL1 from the cell surface.

Many membrane-anchored proteins are subjected to proteolytic processing thereby releasing their extracellular domains, a process termed ectodomain shedding (1Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P.

Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). These functions are due to distinct protein domains involved in either cell-cell fusion or cell-cell interaction, or to their zinc-coordinating metalloprotease domain. To date, the family of ADAM proteinases comprises more than 30 members in different species (3Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin.

Fourteen of the murine ADAMs contain the catalytic consensus sequence HEXXHXXGXXHD in their metalloprotease domains and are therefore predictably proteolytically active (3Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin.

As α-secretases, a number of ADAMs have been described to cleave APP at the respective α-cleavage site, ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17, suggesting that ADAM family members serve essential roles in the CNS.Recently, ADAM8, an ADAM originally cloned from monocytic cells (12Yoshida S. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), has been shown to be expressed in the CNS in neurons, reactive glia cells (astrocytes and microglia), and oligodendrocytes (13Schlomann U. Rathke-Hartlieb S. Yamamoto S. Jockusch H. Bartsch J.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7964-7971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was described as a sheddase of the low affinity IgE receptor CD23 (14Fourie A.M. Coles F. Moreno V. Karlsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30469-30477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition to substrates of ADAM8 in the immune response, a specific substrate of ADAM8 in the CNS has not yet been described. From these examples it is clear, that for each substrate and tissue, the physiological relevance of processing has to be proven by a series of biochemical methods.In the CNS, neural recognition molecules play important roles in specifying cell interactions during development, regeneration, and modification of synaptic activity. One subfamily of recognition molecules is the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. In their extracellular parts these molecules contain IgG-like domains with essential cysteine residues and four to five fibronectin repeats (FN). Within these FN domains, cell adhesion molecules can be proteolytically processed and released from the cell membrane, thereby exerting important biological functions. The first identified member of the Ig family was L1 (15Rathjen F.G. Schachner M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). L1 is a 200- to 220-kDa type I transmembrane protein. In the mouse brain, L1 protein is detectable in four distinct molecular forms with sizes of 200, 180, 140, and 80 kDa (16Sadoul K. Sadoul R. Faissner A. Schachner M. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 510-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that L1 is processed by ADAM10 into 85- and 32-kDa fragments (17Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P. Agmon-Levin N. Stoeck A. Oleszewski M. Riedle S. Postina R. Fahrenholz F. Fogel M. Lemmon V. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but also the proprotein convertase PC5A plays an essential role in L1 processing leading to processed fragments of 180- and 140-kDa size (18Kalus I. Schnegelsberg B. Seidah N.G. Kleene R. Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10381-10388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Based on cross-reactivity of L1 antibodies, the close homologue of L1, termed CHL1, was cloned (19Holm J. Hillenbrand R. Steuber V. Bartsch U. Moos M. Lubbert H. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1613-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brain extracts, CHL1 is detectable in three distinct fragments of 185, 165, and 125 kDa. The 185-kDa fragment was only weakly detectable in non-detergent soluble brain extracts indicating that this might be the membrane-spanning form of CHL1, whereas the 165- and 125-kDa fragments are considered as proteolytically released fragments (20Hillenbrand R. Molthagen M. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The soluble forms of L1 and CHL1, in which the extracellular portion was fused to an Fc tail, promote neuronal survival and control neurite outgrowth (21Chen S. Mantei N. Dong L. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 38: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As demonstrated for processed L1, soluble forms can interact effectively with the extracellular matrix to regulate migration by interactions with the integrin αvβ5 (17Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P. Agmon-Levin N. Stoeck A. Oleszewski M. Riedle S. Postina R. Fahrenholz F. Fogel M. Lemmon V. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Thelen K. Kedar V. Panicker A.K. Schmid R.S. Midkiff B.R. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4918-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by unknown ligands. Similar observations have been made for CHL1 (23Buhusi M. Midkiff B.R. Gates A.M. Richter M. Schachner M. Maness P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25024-25031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Expression of CHL1 in injured and regenerating central and peripheral neurons is strongly up-regulated (24Chaisuksunt V. Zhang Y. Anderson P.N. Campbell G. Vaudano E. Schachner M. Lieberman A.R. Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 87-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Rolf B. Lang D. Hillenbrand R. Richter M. Schachner M. Bartsch U. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 71: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but its functional role in regeneration remains to be defined. Because specific proteolytic processing of CHL1 may be of functional importance for neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth, and cell migration, we screened for the ability of several members of the family of ADAM metalloproteases to process CHL1 into its naturally occurring fragments.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—Breeding and experimental use of mice were performed in agreement with the German law on the protection of animals, with a permit by the local authorities. The wr mutation was maintained on a C57BL/6 background. 30-day-old mutant mice with a manifest WR phenotype were used for biochemical analysis. Mice deficient in ADAM8 were received from Dr. A. J. P. Docherty (Celltech, Slough, UK) and were maintained on a C57BL/6 background. Genotype analysis was done by PCR diagnosis on tail tip DNA. A more detailed description of these mice will be given elsewhere.Reagents—Taq DNA polymerase (Master-Mix) was obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), and Pfu polymerase was from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany). The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Pervanadate was prepared by mixing 100 μl of 50 mm Na3VO4 with 30 μl of 30% H2O2 for 5 min at room temperature, followed by adding 520 μl of water. Recombinant tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) 1 and 2, the inhibitory domain of TIMP4, and the broad range matrix metalloprotease inhibitor batimastat (BB-94) were kindly provided by Dr. Harald Tschesche (Bielefeld University). TIMP3 was obtained from Chemicon (Heidelberg, Germany). As antibodies, polyclonal CHL1 antibody (25Rolf B. Lang D. Hillenbrand R. Richter M. Schachner M. Bartsch U. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 71: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), monoclonal antibody 4A6 directed against a birch pollen profilin tag, kindly provided by Dr. B. M. Jockusch (Braunschweig University) (26Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Schlomann U. Wildeboer D. Webster A. Antropova O. Zeuschner D. Docherty A.J. McLoughlin S. Skelton L. Jockusch H. Bartsch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48210-48219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM8 (13Schlomann U. Rathke-Hartlieb S. Yamamoto S. Jockusch H. Bartsch J.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7964-7971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ADAM10 (epitope: amino acids 727–741 of mouse ADAM10) were used. For sample normalization, we used mouse monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon).Cloning of Expression Constructs—The prodomain and the catalytic domain of mouse ADAM8 were amplified by PCR with the primers mXhoFLA8MET (5′-CTC GAG ATC AGA TCT CCT GAG GCT TAA ACT GAG GGA AGG ACA CGA ACC GGT TGA CAT-3′) and mEcoREnA8Sta (5′-GAA TTC GAC GAC GAC GAC AAG ATG CTT GGC CTC TGG CTG CTC-3′). The resulting PCR product was ligated into the respective cloning sites (XhoI at the 5′ end; EcoRI at the 3′ end) of pSecTag2B vector (Invitrogen) to generate pA8MPSecTag. Full-length mouse ADAMs10 and 17 cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription-PCR with mRNA from mouse brain and spleen, respectively. Amplification of cDNAs by PCR was performed with Pfu polymerase with proofreading activity and the following primers: ADAM10s, 5′-ATG GTG TTG CCG ACA GTG TTA ATT CT-3′; ADAM10as, 5′-TTA GCG TCG CAT GTG TCC CAT TTG A-3′. For ADAM17 containing a Bi-Pro tag (26Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we used the following primers: ADAM17s, 5′-ATG AGG CAG TCT CTC CTA TTC CTG-3′; ADAM17as (with Bi-Pro tag sequence), 5′-TCA GAT CTC CTG AGG CTT AAA CTG AGG GAA GGA GCA CTC TGT TTC TTT GCT GTC A-3′. The resulting PCR products were cloned in the mammalian expression vector pTARGET (Promega, Heidelberg) containing a cytomegalovirus promoter. Insertion of correct sequences was verified by sequencing.Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum and 1% glutamine. Transient transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). Stable transfected CHOK1 cells for the production of Fc fusion proteins were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplied with 5% ultra low IgG fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, and HT-Supplement. From these cells, Fc fusion proteins were prepared as described previously (21Chen S. Mantei N. Dong L. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 38: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—The supernatants of transiently transfected cells were collected after addition of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 36–48 h before harvest and were concentrated ∼10-fold by using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices 10K (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). To obtain cell lysates, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing Complete™ EDTA-free inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) and 10 mm OPT. After incubation on ice for 1 h, samples were sonicated. Freshly prepared tissues were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing the inhibitor mixture. After incubation on ice for 1 h, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were used for analysis. All samples were concentrated by affinity chromatography with ConA-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Braunschweig, Germany). Proteins bound to ConA-Sepharose were washed twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2 and were eluted with 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (for reducing conditions: 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 9% glycerol, 0.0025% Bromphenol Blue, and 0.36 m mercaptoethanol; for non-reducing running conditions, mercaptoethanol was omitted). Where indicated, cell supernatants were subjected to a high speed spin in an ultracentrifuge for 30 min at 100,000 × g to remove released membrane vesicles. For detection of CHL1 and ADAM8 proteins, samples were subjected to 5% and 7.5% SDS-PAGE, respectively. Samples were blotted onto nitrocellulose transfer membranes (Protran®, Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany) by semi-dry electroblotting. After staining with 0.1% Ponceau S solution, proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% milk powder for 2 h. Antibodies were used in a 1:10,000 dilution (crude serum of a polyclonal anti-CHL1 antibody), 1:25 (monoclonal anti-Bi-Pro antibody), 1:1,000 (polyclonal anti-ADAM8-CD antibody), and 1:1,000 (polyclonal anti-ADAM10 antibody). Detection of the proteins was performed with anti-rabbit-IgG-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Sigma) or anti-mouse-IgG-horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) using LumiLight Plus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as chemiluminescent substrate. For quantification of band intensities, silver-stained gels were scanned, and intensities were determined using Quantiscan software (Bio-Rad, Göttingen, Germany).Purification of Soluble ADAM8 Catalytic Domain—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the construct pA8MPSecTag (Invitrogen, Heidelberg, Germany) containing the pro- and the catalytic domain with a C-terminal His tag and an N-terminal secretion signal (Sec tag). For purification of ADAM8 protease, COS-7 supernatants were collected 36–48 h after addition of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Samples were concentrated with Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices 10K (Millipore) and further purified by affinity purification with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (ProBond™ Purification System, Invitrogen). After elution, the supernatants were concentrated a second time by ultrafiltration ∼100-fold compared with harvested supernatants. The purity of soluble protease was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, concentrations were determined using the BCA reagent (Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany), and proteolytic activity was monitored by a fluorescent cleavage assay in which ADAM8 cleaves the quenched fluorescent peptide Suc-H-(Mcp)-GSLPQKSH-K(Dpa)-R-amide (27Schlomann U. Wildeboer D. Webster A. Antropova O. Zeuschner D. Docherty A.J. McLoughlin S. Skelton L. Jockusch H. Bartsch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48210-48219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Protease Assays—Purified ADAM8 was kept in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, 100 μm ZnCl2, 100 mm NaCl, Complete™ EDTA-free inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For inhibition experiments, ADAM8 was preincubated with 10 mm 1,10-ortho-phenantroline (OPT) or 200 nm batimastat (BB-94) or 500 nm of each TIMP for 1 h before substrates were added. Cleavage assays were usually performed with 1 μg of recombinant Fc-tagged proteins L1 (L1-Fc), CHL1 (CHL1-Fc), or NCAM (NCAM-Fc), described in Ref. 21Chen S. Mantei N. Dong L. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 38: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, and were mixed with 1 μg of purified ADAM8 protease. Samples were incubated 3 h to overnight at 37 °C. Cleavage products were analyzed by 5% SDS-PAGE and either silver stained (28Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3729) Google Scholar) or blotted for immunostaining with anti-Bi-Pro (for ADAM8) and anti-CHL1.Analysis of Protease Activities in Cell Lysates—24 h after transfection of Chinese hamster ovary or COS-7 cells with the constructs encoding full-length ADAM proteases, the cells were washed 1× with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholate. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min, the resulting cell pellet containing cell-bound proteases was directly assayed for protease activity by adding 150 μl of mixture consisting of 50 μm TNF-α substrate (Dnp-SPLAQAVRSSSRNH2), 1× protease inhibitor mixture in fluorescamine assay buffer (0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.01 m CaCl2, 0.01% Brij 35). After 1–2 h at 37 °C, 25 μl of the sample was removed and mixed with 5 μl of 1% fluorescamine in Me2SO and 70 μl of fluorescamine assay buffer. About 50 μl of this mixture was diluted with 150 μl of assay buffer, and fluorescence (excitation: 386 nm; emission: 477 nm) was measured in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B Luminescence spectrometer in black-coated 96-well plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). For activity measurements with the MBP substrate, the cell pellets were mixed with 50 μl of 100 μm MBP substrate (Suc-H-(Mcp)-GSLPQKSH-K(Dpa)-R-amide (26Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) and 50 μl of assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.0015% Brij 35). Activity was measured at 340-nm excitation and 405-nm emission.N-terminal Sequence Analysis—For preparation of samples for sequencing, ∼10 μg of CHL1-Fc protein was incubated overnight with 10 μg of soluble, recombinant ADAM8. The samples were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and washed in borate buffer (50 mm H3BO3, pH 9.0, 20% ethanol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) after electrophoresis. Samples were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Porablot, Macherey and Nagel, Düren, Germany) and stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 45.5% EtOH, 9% acetic acid, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For N-terminal sequencing, the respective bands were excised and applied to a protein sequencer (Knauer, Germany). Five cycles of automated Edman degradation were run to obtain sufficient sequence information.Neurite Outgrowth Assays—Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from 6- to 8-day-old CD1 mice as described previously (29Keilhauer G. Faissner A. Schachner M. Nature. 1985; 316: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine (PLL)-coated coverslips and were maintained in serum-free medium (30Fischer G. Kunemund V. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 605-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1–2 h after seeding the neurons, CHL1-Fc protein was added to the medium as a positive control. To determine neurite outgrowth in the presence of supernatants from transfected COS-7 cells, serum-free medium was applied 12 h after co-transfection of COS-7 cells with CHL1/ADAM constructs and was left on the cells for 24 h. The COS-7 supernatants were applied to cerebellar neurons, and 18 h after addition of either CHL1-Fc protein or supernatants of transfected COS-7 cells, neurite outgrowth was determined. To visualize neurite outgrowth, cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde (4%) for 5 min and stained with either Richardson's Blue or with a polyclonal anti-NF200 antibody (Sigma, Germany). For each experimental setup, neurites of at least 50 cells with processes longer than the cell body diameter were measured using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with digital equipment.Neurite outgrowth assays in co-cultures of cerebellar neurons with transfected COS-7 cells were performed by plating 5 × 104 COS-7 cells in 30-mm plates on PLL-coated coverslips. One day after transfection of COS-7 cells, freshly prepared cerebellar neurons were added at densities of 105 cells/plate, and the co-culture was maintained in serum-free medium. After 24 h, the number of attached neurons per visual field and neurite lengths were determined as described above.Each neurite outgrowth experiment was performed with cerebella from 3 mice, and each condition was determined in triplicates. The experiments were repeated at least 3 (n = 9) or 4 (n = 12) times as indicated. Data are given as means ± S.E.Cell Survival Assay—Cerebellar granule neurons were seeded in 96-well plates coated with PLL at densities of 105/well. After cell attachment, either serum-free medium or supernatants from transfected COS-7 cells were applied. After days 1, 3, and 5, the numbers of surviving cells were counted by Trypan blue exclusion staining. Data are from three independent experiments in triplicates and as means ± S.E. A Student t test was used to determine the significance, and a p value of <0.01 was considered as highly significant.RESULTSCleavage of Recombinant CHL1 by ADAM8 —Recombinant ADAM8 was expressed as a secreted soluble form from COS-7 cells containing the pro- and metalloprotease domain (A8-MP). To monitor for catalytic activity, a parallel assay with a fluorogenic substrate was performed (27Schlomann U. Wildeboer D. Webster A. Antropova O. Zeuschner D. Docherty A.J. McLoughlin S. Skelton L. Jockusch H. Bartsch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48210-48219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Extracellular domains of NCAM, L1, and CHL1 (Fig. 1) fused to an Fc tag (21Chen S. Mantei N. Dong L. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 38: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) were incubated with purified ADAM8 (Fig. 2A). Whereas NCAM and L1 were not cleaved by ADAM8, CHL1-Fc was cleaved into two products: a prominent 165-kDa fragment corresponding to the entire extracellular portion of CHL1 and a less prominent 125-kDa fragment. Whereas the 165-kDa fragment was detectable under reducing and non-reducing conditions, the 125-kDa fragment disappeared under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2A, right panel). Specificity of the cleavage was confirmed by immunostaining using an antibody against the extracellular portion of CHL1 (Fig. 2B), and equal loading as well as processing of pro-ADAM8 into active protease by autocatalytic prodomain removal was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). Usually, about 50% of he ADAM8 protein is processed into the active form. In Western blot experiments with anti-CHL1, the specific cleavage of CHL1 was confir"
https://openalex.org/W2116901586,"Renal ammonium (NH3 + NH4+) transport is a key process for body acid-base balance. It is well known that several ionic transport systems allow NH4+ transmembrane translocation without high specificity NH4+, but it is still debated whether NH3, and more generally, gas, may be transported by transmembrane proteins. The human Rh glycoproteins have been proposed to mediate ammonium transport. Transport of NH4+ and/or NH3 by the epithelial Rh C glycoprotein (RhCG) may be of physiological importance in renal ammonium excretion because RhCG is mainly expressed in the distal nephron. However, RhCG function is not yet established. In the present study, we search for ammonium transport by RhCG. RhCG function was investigated by electrophysiological approaches in RhCG-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes. In the submillimolar concentration range, NH4Cl exposure induced inward currents (IAM) in voltage-clamped RhCG-expressing cells, but not in control cells. At physiological extracellular pH (pHo) = 7.5, the amplitude of IAM increased with NH4Cl concentration and membrane hyperpolarization. The amplitude of IAM was independent of external Na+ or K+ concentrations but was enhanced by alkaline pHo and decreased by acid pHo. The apparent affinity of RhCG for NH4+ was affected by NH3 concentration and by changing pHo, whereas the apparent affinity for NH3 was unchanged by pHo, consistent with direct NH3 involvement in RhCG function. The enhancement of methylammonium-induced current by NH3 further supported this conclusion. Exposure to 500 μm NH4Cl induced a biphasic intracellular pH change in RhCG-expressing oocytes, consistent with both NH3 and NH4+ enhanced influx. Our results support the hypothesis of a specific role for RhCG in NH3 and NH4+ transport. Renal ammonium (NH3 + NH4+) transport is a key process for body acid-base balance.

Whereas RhD, RhCE, and RhAG proteins are expressed in erythroid cells, RhBG and RhCG proteins are expressed in epithelial tissues. Northern blot analyses have shown that RhBG is expressed mainly in the kidney and liver (1Liu Z. Peng J. Mo R. Hui C. Huang C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1424-1433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and that RhCG is expressed mainly in the testis and kidney (2Liu Z. Chen Y. Mo R. Hui C. Cheng J.F.

Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Rh proteins share homologies with the Mep/Amt family from yeasts, bacteria, and plants (4Marini A.M.

Genomics. 1998; 47: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite numerous studies implicating Mep/Amt proteins in ammonium transport (6Ninnemann O. Jauniaux J.C. Frommer W.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3464-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 7Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. André B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), the transported substrate is still debated. Recent studies report, on one hand, that AmtB protein facilitates NH3 diffusion across the cytoplasmic membrane of Salmonella typhimurium (8Soupene E. Lee H. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3926-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and, on the other hand, that LeAMT1;1 acts as an NH4+ uniport after its functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes (9Ludewig U. von Wiren N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Consistent with the involvement of Rh proteins in transmembrane ammonium transport, yeasts deficient in endogenous ammonium transport system (ΔMep Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are enabled to grow in a low ammonium-containing medium when transformed by RhAG or by RhCG (3Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Based on their finding that Mep and Amt are NH3 channels, Soupene et al. (10Soupene E. Ramirez R.M. Kustu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5733-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Soupene E. King N. Feild E. Liu P. Niyogi K.K. Huang C.H. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7769-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) raised the hypothesis that Rh proteins are involved in gas transport rather than in ionic transport. However, Westhoff et al. (12Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) concluded that RhAG mediates an electroneutral ionic exchange of NH4+ for H+ after its functional expression in X. laevis oocytes. To our knowledge, the mechanistic properties of the human proteins RhBG and RhCG are not yet established. These proteins may have an important role in acid-base balance because ammonium excretion by the kidney plays a major role in acid excretion. The aim of our study was to functionally express RhCG in X. laevis oocytes and investigate whether RhCG is involved in ammonium 1In the text, “ammonium” is used when ammonia and ammonium ions are not discriminated. The chemical symbols for ammonia (NH3) and ammonium ions (NH4+) are used to distinguish the two forms of ammonium. (NH4+ and/or NH3) transport. Exposure of voltage-clamped RhCG-expressing cells to submillimolar concentrations of NH4Cl ([NH4Cl]) induced inward currents (IAM). The amplitude of IAM increased with [NH4Cl] and membrane hyperpolarization, consistent with an NH4+-related current. However, the amplitude of IAM was strongly sensitive to changes in extracellular pH (pHo) of ±0.5 pH unit (pH U), 2The abbreviations used are: pH U, pH unit; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; MeACl, methylamine chloride. an experimental maneuver that only slightly changes [NH4+] but substantially affects [NH3]. At alkaline but not physiological pHo, the enhancement of methylammonium-induced current by micromolar [NH4Cl] further supports the requirement of the neutral form for NH4+/methylammonium transport in RhCG-expressing oocytes. Exposure to 500 μm NH4Cl induced a biphasic intracellular pH change in RhCG-expressing oocytes, consistent with both NH3 and NH4+ influx into the cell. These results are consistent with RhCG-induced NH3 and NH4+ transport. cRNA Synthesis and Expression in X. laevis Oocytes—To routinely control RhCG expression in X. laevis oocytes, we constructed an N-terminal fusion of the protein RhCG with the green fluorescent protein (GFP; Ref. 13Bissig K.D. La Fontaine S. Mercer J.F. Solioz M. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). GFP-RhCG expression was demonstrated by membrane green fluorescence, observable under microscopic control (excitation wavelength, 480 ± 40 nm; emission filter, 505 nm). RhCG cDNA was amplified by PCR from the pRS426-RhCG construct (3Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) using 5′-CTGCAGCATGGCCTGGAACACCAACCT-3′ and 5′-CTCCTCACCTGCCCTGGGAGCCTAGGG-3′ as sense and antisense primers, respectively. The 1466-bp RhCG cDNA was inserted downstream of the GFP coding region into the pQBI25-fC1 vector. The in-frame insertion of RhCG cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. To synthesize cRNA coding for GFP-RhCG fusion protein, the GFP-RhCG cDNA was subcloned into pT7TS plasmid. The pT7TS-GFP-RhCG construct was linearized with SmaI restriction enzyme and transcribed in vitro from the T7 promoter using an mCAP mRNA capping kit. Defolliculated X. laevis oocytes (stage V–VI) were injected with cRNA dissolved in 50 nl of water or with 50 nl of water and then incubated at 18 °C (14Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7277-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in RhCG-expressing oocytes (oocytes injected with cRNA of GFP-RhCG) versus control oocytes (oocytes injected with water or cRNA of GFP). No difference was observed between control oocytes expressing GFP alone and control oocytes injected with water. Voltage-Clamp Experiments—Two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments were performed as described previously (15Cougnon M. Bouyer P. Planelles G. Jaisser F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6516-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Prie D. Huart V. Bakouh N. Planelles G. Dellis O. Gérard B. Hulin P. Benque-Blanchet F. Silve C. Grandchamp B. Friedlander G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Except where stated, the oocyte membrane potential was held at Vc = –50 mV. Oocytes were superfused by a control Ringer solution adapted for amphibia (containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes, adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH) or by up to seven substitution solutions differing from each other by a single parameter. In all experiments, the first substitution was a 500 μm NH4Cl-containing solution at pHo 7.5. Solutions at pHo = 7.0 or 8.0 were also buffered with Hepes/NaOH. Solutions at pHo = 8.5 were buffered with TAPS/NaOH (switching from Hepes to TAPS buffer, at identical pHo, had no effect). In Na+-free experiments, NaCl was replaced by an equimolar concentration of choline chloride, and pH was adjusted using Trizma (Tris base). To calculate [NH3] and [NH4+] in ammonium-containing solutions, the pKa was taken as 9.25. As reported by other groups (9Ludewig U. von Wiren N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Burckhardt B.C. Thelen P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 429: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we noticed that in control oocytes, even at low millimolar concentrations, NH4Cl (and methylammonium) may induce an inward endogenous current that increases at alkaline pHo (17Burckhardt B.C. Thelen P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 429: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This is likely related to the multiple endogenous cationic conductances that are activated by NH4Cl in native X. laevis oocyte (18Cougnon M. Bouyer P. Hulin P. Anagnostopoulos T. Planelles G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study, such endogenous currents were detected in H2O-injected oocytes upon exposure to [NH4Cl] ≥ 3 mm, [NH4Cl] ≥ 1.5 mm, and [NH4Cl] ≥ 500 μm at pHo = 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0, respectively. At these low [NH4Cl], the endogenous current amplitude (Iendog) varied from one batch of oocytes to another. Thus, when applying corrections, the NH4Cl-induced response in control cells was subtracted from the NH4Cl-induced response measured in RhCG-expressing oocytes from the same batch. However, because Iendog in oocytes may also vary within the same batch of oocytes, we avoided as far as possible the use of NH4Cl concentrations high enough to induce an endogenous response, except when necessary for further characterization of RhCG functional properties. Intracellular pH Measurements—Intracellular pH (pHi) and membrane potential (Vm) were simultaneously measured using double-barreled pH-sensitive microelectrodes (filled with the Fluka H+ ionophore 95291), as detailed previously (19Anagnostopoulos T. Planelles G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 393: 73-89Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The slope, S, of the pH-selective microelectrode was determined before and after each intracellular puncture by measuring the variation of potential induced by a 0.5 pH U change in pHo. In our experiments, S was 55–59 mV/pH U. pHi was calculated using the relationship pHi = pHo – (VH – Vm)/S, where VH is the proton electrochemical potential difference across the cell membrane. Except where stated, results were expressed as means ± S.E. (with n = number of oocytes), and the significance of the results was assessed by paired or unpaired Student t test (p < 0.05 was considered significant). Ammonium-induced Current in RhCG-expressing Oocytes—In preliminary experimental series, oocytes were injected with 5, 10, 15, 25, or 45 ng of cRNA of GFP-RhCG or GFP or with water. The effect of increasing [NH4Cl] (100, 250, 500, and 1000 μm; pHo = 7.5) was investigated in voltage-clamped cells. In control oocytes (n = 21), this experimental maneuver was without effect, except occasionally for [NH4Cl] = 1000 μm (which may induce a small endogenous inward current, up to –5 nA). In RhCG-expressing oocytes, this experimental maneuver induced increasing inward currents, as shown in Fig. 1. In this series, we also measured pHi. Resting pHi was not modified by RhCG expression (pHi = 7.44 ± 0.02 (n = 23) in RhCG-expressing oocytes versus 7.39 ± 0.03 (n = 18) in control oocytes; p = 0.2). This rules out a pHi change as the explanation for IAM measured in RhCG-expressing oocytes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that RhCG function is related to ammonium transport (3Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). For further analysis of IAM, oocytes were injected with 10 ng of cRNA of GFP-RhCG (this concentration seems to give the best functional response; see the inset in Fig. 1) or with water. Specificity of NH4Cl-induced Currents—The voltage dependence of IAM in RhCG-expressing oocytes was investigated by applying a [NH4Cl] = 500 μm pulse at various holding potential values. The resulting current-voltage relationship (Fig. 2) shows that IAM increased with hyperpolarization (inside negative), consistent with the enhancement of net entry of positive charges (namely, NH4+) into RhCG-expressing oocytes. Extrapolating the current-voltage relationship to more depolarized values (which were not experimentally assessed due to the activation of a Na+ conductance induced by depolarization; Ref. 20Rettinger J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) gives a reversal potential (Erev) near 0 mV. This Erev value may correspond to the combined equilibrium potential of the main cationic species (Na+ + K+) of NH4+ or of H+ ions (18Cougnon M. Bouyer P. Hulin P. Anagnostopoulos T. Planelles G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because a major involvement of H+ ions was not supported by the pHi stability of RhCC-expressing oocytes upon pHo change (from pHo 7.5 to 8.5, ΔpHi = 0.02 ± 0.01; p = 0.3; n = 4), we next determined the specificity of the currents to NH4+ compared with other cationic species. First, voltage-clamped oocytes (Vc = –50 mV) were exposed pairwise to a Ringer solution supplemented with 500 μm NH4Cl or 500 μm choline chloride or NaCl. Neither NaCl nor choline chloride induced a current in RhCG-expressing oocytes or control cells (data not shown), whereas IAM was –13.2 ± 1.1 nA in RhCG-expressing oocytes (n = 8) but was not detectable in H2O-injected cells (IAM = 0.1 ± 0.2; n = 4). The non-involvement of Na+ ions in RhCG function was further confirmed by measuring in a paired fashion that the current induced by 500 μm NH4Cl added to a plain Ringer solution or to a Na+-free solution was the same (n = 10; p = 0.3). This also confirms that RhCG does not mediate a nonselective cationic pathway, in which case IAM would be expected to increase under Na+-free conditions. Second, the discrimination between K+ and NH4+ in RhCG-expressing oocytes was investigated. To this end, the effect of adding 500 μm KCl to the Ringer solution was checked. This maneuver did not induce an inward current in RhCG-expressing oocytes, consistent with high selectivity for NH4+ over K+. This finding is in agreement with studies in S. cerevisiae showing that RhCG did not complement the growth defect of yeast deficient in K+ transport (3Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. André B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In fact, in this series, we observed a slight KCl-induced outward current in all oocytes (+2.1 ± 0.6 nA in RhCG-expressing oocytes and +0.8 ± 0.7 nA in H2O-injected oocytes; n = 8). This is likely related to the properties of the endogenous oocyte Na,K-pump activity, which is highly sensitive to changes in extracellular [K+] (18Cougnon M. Bouyer P. Hulin P. Anagnostopoulos T. Planelles G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which was increased by 25% in our experiments. The non-involvement of K+ in RhCG function was confirmed by measuring in a paired fashion that the current induced by 500 μm NH4Cl added in a plain Ringer solution or in a K+-free medium was the same (n = 3; p = 0.5). The above-mentioned results are consistent with the induction (or enhancement) of an ammonium-related, rheogenic process consecutive to RhCG functional expression. This suggests that RhCG has a different function than those proposed for RhAG (the erythroid homologue of RhCG) or for Rh1 protein from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (11Soupene E. King N. Feild E. Liu P. Niyogi K.K. Huang C.H. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7769-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). RhAG, after functional expression in X. laevis oocytes, was reported to mediate an electrically silent NH4+/H+ exchange (12Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In that study, the authors proposed that this electroneutral ionic transport mediated by RhAG would not change pHi, despite the RhAG-induced NH4+ influx into the cell (12Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Another group speculated that human Rh proteins mediate CO2 gas diffusion (11Soupene E. King N. Feild E. Liu P. Niyogi K.K. Huang C.H. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7769-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). According to the authors, this hypothesis is supported by their observation that incubation of the green alga C. reinhardtii in a high-CO2 environment increased the expression of the related RH gene, RH1 (11Soupene E. King N. Feild E. Liu P. Niyogi K.K. Huang C.H. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7769-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because our study focuses on ammonium transport, we will not discuss our results in the light of putative CO2 diffusion by RhCG. With regard to NH3, which is also a gas, RhCG-mediated transport of this uncharged species cannot account for the observed IAM, at least not in a simple manner. However, the rheogenicity of the ammonium-induced response does not exclude the possibility that NH3 is transported together with an ion or that NH3 stimulates an electrogenic ionic transport in RhCG-expressing oocytes. In the experiments reported above, the discrimination observed between NH4+ and K+ in RhCG-expressing oocytes, as well as the observation that Na+,K+, and choline+ do not mimic the effect of NH4+ on membrane current, agrees with results reported in X. laevis oocytes expressing LeAMT1;1, an Amt protein from tomato root hair (9Ludewig U. von Wiren N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that, under our experimental conditions, RhCG function is specifically related to ammonium transport. Effect of Extracellular pH on NH4Cl-induced Currents— When it is expressed in X. laevis oocytes, the Amt protein LeAMT1;1 mediates an NH4+ uniport (9Ludewig U. von Wiren N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The NH4+ currents induced by LeAMT1;1 expression were pHo-independent (9Ludewig U. von Wiren N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To determine whether LeAMT1;1 and RhCG have similar functional properties, we looked for the effect of changing pHo on IAM in voltage-clamped oocytes. We measured the current induced by a given NH4Cl concentration by exposing the cells in a paired fashion to 500 μm NH4Cl at pHo 7.5 and then at pHo 7.0 or 8.0. In RhCG-expressing oocytes, at pHo = 7.0, IAM was barely measurable (IAM = –1.2 ± 0.5 nA at pHo = 7.0 versus –13.2 ± 1.7 nA at pHo = 7.5; n = 10; p < 0.05), whereas it was greatly enhanced at pHo = 8.0 (IAM =–28.2 ± 2.8 nA at pHo = 8.0 versus –8.6 ± 0.6 at pHo = 7.5; n = 9; p < 0.05). Such large changes in IAM were surprising because at constant [NH4Cl] = 500 μm, changing pHo by ± 0.5 pH U only marginally affects NH4+ concentration ([NH4+] decreases by ≈25 μm from pHo 7.0 to 8.0). However, this change of pHo by ± 0.5 pH U causes a ≈3-fold change in [NH3]. To confirm that a pHo/NH3 change directly affects IAM, we compared the current induced by [NH4Cl] = 500 μm at pHo = 7.5 with the currents induced by NH4Cl-containing solutions with either the same [NH3] or the same [NH4+] (see Fig. 3). These solutions were buffered to pH 7.0 (Fig. 3A) or pH 8.0 (Fig. 3B). In both series, IAM was the same during exposure of RhCG-expressing oocytes to solutions with different pHo but containing identical [NH3]. The above-mentioned results show a strong effect of changing pH/NH3 on NH4+-induced current in RhCG-expressing oocytes. This is at variance with results reported for LeAMT1;1-expressing oocytes (9Ludewig U. von Wiren N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In that study, the pHo independence of IAM was invoked as a strong argument to conclude that LeAMT1;1 mediates an NH4+ uniport, independent of NH3 (9Ludewig U. von Wiren N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Our results also argue against a putative NH4+-H+ co-transport mediating both NH4+ and H+ influx into the cell. Such a transport system would induce an IAM inward current, but alkaline external pH should reduce IAM (conversely, acidic pH should increase IAM), whereas we observed the opposite. These results suggest that NH3 or H+ ions are directly involved in RhCG function. Substrate Dependence of IAM—Discrimination between H+ and NH3 effects is not obvious because of the equilibrium reaction between NH4+, NH3, and H+. Nonetheless, we attempted to arrive at a better understanding of RhCG function by establishing the concentration dependence of the ammonium-induced currents on each of these three species. To this end, IAM was measured while keeping pHo, [NH3], or [NH4+] constant while varying the other two. First, RhCG-expressing oocytes were exposed to increasing [NH4Cl] at a constant pHo of 7.5 (Fig. 4A) or 7.0 (Fig. 4B). This protocol gives the dependence of IAM on [NH4Cl]. This represents, to a first approximation, the IAM dependence on [NH4+] because NH4+ concentration is so much higher than that of NH3 in this pH range. The current-concentration relationships saturated at relatively low substrate concentrations, suggesting carrier (rather than channel) behavior. The apparent affinity for ammonium (thus, in a first approximation, for [NH4+]) appears to be pHo-dependent. This observation is at variance with results reported for the function of RhAG because changes in pHo did not modify the kinetics of ammonium inhibition of methylammonium uptake measured in RhAG-expressing oocytes (12Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This finding was taken as an argument against the transport by RhAG of NH3 or of the neutral form of methylammonium (12Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in RhCG-expressing oocytes, the apparent NH3 affinity (≈8 μm) seems to be pHo-independent. In another experimental series, RhCG-expressing oocytes were exposed to increasing [NH3] at constant [NH4+] (pHo was changing). This protocol was carried out at constant [NH4+] ≈ 491 μm (Fig. 5A) or 246 μm (Fig. 5B). Results confirmed that half-maximal IAM was reached for [NH3] ≈ 8 μm (corresponding to different pHo) as in the previous series (Fig. 4). This finding suggests NH3 transport by RhCG and/or its direct involvement in IAM. In a complementary protocol, RhCG-expressing oocytes were exposed to increasing [NH4+] at constant [NH3] (in the same range of pHo values as in the previous protocol, i.e. from pHo 7.0 to 8.0 by increments of 0.2 pH U). This experimental series was performed with [NH3] constant at 8.73 or 4.36 μm. Analysis (by analysis of variance) of the results (data not shown) obtained in n = 5–7 oocytes showed that IAM was constant for a given [NH3], despite the 10-fold change imposed in [NH4+] between pH 7.0 and 8.0. These results agree with results from Fig. 3 and suggest either that [NH3] acts as an “on-off switch” for IAM or that NH4+ was at a saturating concentration. To discriminate between these possibilities, RhCG-expressing oocytes were again exposed to increasing [NH4+] at constant [NH3], but the previous protocol was changed in two ways. First, to obtain solutions containing less [NH4+], pHo was raised to 8.6 or 8.8. To obtain a better resolution of the changes in IAM, [NH3] = 13.09 μm rather than [NH3] = 4.36 μm was used. Results shown in Fig. 5, C and D, show that half-maximal IAM was reached for [NH4+] ≈ 140 and 120 μm for [NH3] = 13.09 and 8.73 μm, respectively. These results show that [NH3] does not act as an on-off switch for IAM. They are consistent with the expression in RhCG-expressing oocytes of a high affinity NH4+ transport system dependent on NH3. Finally, to check whether pHo per se affects RhCG function, we measured the current induced by [NH3] and [NH4+] above their respective saturating concentrations as determined from Figs. 4 and 5. To this end, the current induced by [NH4Cl] = 5 mm was measured at various pHo values. In H2O-injected oocytes, this maneuver induced an endogenous current (Iendog) that increased with increasing pHo, in agreement with a previous report (17Burckhardt B.C. Thelen P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 429: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In RhCG-expressing oocytes, this maneuver induced a total current, ITOT, due to Iendog + IAM. Because Iendog variability appears to be high (especially at alkaline pHo) not only from one batch of oocytes to another but also within the oocytes of a given batch, we did not calculate IAM from ITOT – Iendog. Fig. 6 shows that [NH4Cl] = 5 mm induced significantly higher ammonium-induced current in RhCG-expressing oocytes than in H2O-injected oocytes. Results from Fig. 6 are also consistent with an increase of IAM when raising pHo and vice versa. This suggests that extracellular pH influences the maximal NH4+-induced current mediated by RhCG. With regard to the results shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, C and D, it may be that the pHo effect modified the value of Km for NH4+, decreasing it at alkaline pHo and increasing it at acidic pHo. The results also agree with the dependence of IAM on the concentrations of both the char"

Malhotra J.D. McEwen D.P. Mattei L.N. Berglund E.O. Ranscht B. Levinson S.R. Schachner M. Shrager P. Isom L.L. Xiao Z.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7517-7525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both β1 and β3 interact with neurofascin-186 (16Ratcliffe C.F. Westenbroek R.E. Curtis R. Catterall W.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and the intracellular domain of β1 has been shown to interact with the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase β (17Ratcliffe C.F. Qu Y. McCormick K.A. Tibbs V.C. Dixon J.E. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).The purpose of the present study was to determine the role of β1-mediated cell adhesive interactions in β1-mediated channel modulation and regulation of sodium channel cell surface expression. We hypothesized that β1-ankyrin and β1-contactin interactions are critical for the effects of β1 on sodium channel expression and function. We tested this hypothesis in vitro using wild type β1, β1Y181E, β1/β2 chimeras, and β3. Our results suggest that β1 subunits are multifunctional proteins that contain extracellular and intracellular sites for α subunit interaction, an extracellular Ig loop domain that is critical for homophilic and heterophilic interactions, and an intracellular, tyrosine-containing domain required for ankyrin recruitment and channel modulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—A pan-sodium channel antibody, anti-Sp-19, directed against a common peptide of the intracellular loop between domains III and IV of the α subunit, and the Nav1.2 specific antibody, Sp11II, were obtained from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against an extracellular portion of β1, “β1EX,” was described previously (12Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol.

Bennett. Monoclonal GFP antibodies were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA).Generation and Subcloning of cDNA Constructs—Chimeras in which entire domains were exchanged between the β1 and β2 subunits were constructed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of cDNA encoding the replacement domain, followed by two successive PCRs to generate the full-length clone. The 5′ forward and 3′ reverse primers were designed with small segments of nucleotides encoding the native construct that flank the region being replaced, resulting in in-frame fusions between replacement cDNAs and the native subunit cDNA. β1-β2Ig was constructed by replacing the B, C, C′, C″, D, E, F, and G β-sheets of the β1 Ig loop with the corresponding β-sheets of the β2 Ig loop. β1 Ig loop cDNA coded for amino acids Phe-17 through Val-127, whereas the β2 Ig loop cDNA coded for amino acids Leu-19 through Val-117. The final construct was ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), sequenced, and then subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 Hygro(+) (Invitrogen).To construct β2-β1Ig, the β2 Ig loop was replaced with cDNA encoding the β1 Ig loop. The β1 Ig loop cDNA contained 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences derived from the corresponding β2 cDNA. The final construct was ligated into pCR2.1, sequenced, and then subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 Hygro(-). β1/β1/β2 was generated by replacing the β1 juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and intracellular domains with the corresponding domains of β2. The β2 juxtamembrane domain cDNA contained the 5′-flanking sequence derived from the corresponding β1 cDNA. The final construct was ligated into pCR2.1, sequenced, and then subcloned into the BamHI site of pcDNA3.1 Hygro(+). β1STOP was described previously (3Meadows L. Malhotra J.D. Stetzer A. Isom L.L.

Amplified cDNA was ligated into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). β3 was subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+). cDNA encoding GFP was excised from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) using Asp-718 and NotI restriction enzymes, and the ends were end-blunted using Klenow. β3-pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+) was digested with NotI, and the ends were filled with Klenow. The GFP cDNA was ligated into β3-pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+) and checked for directionality using an ApaI digest. Correct constructs were verified by sequencing. The stop codon in β3 was mutated from TAA to TAT using QuikChange mutagenesis, yielding an in-frame β3-GFP fusion protein.Transfection and Characterization of Cell Lines—The Chinese hamster lung (CHL) 1610 cell line was obtained from the American Type Cell Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

Colonies were expanded and expression was verified by Western blot using the β1EX antibody (1:500) for β1, β2-β1Ig, β1STOP, and β1/β1/β2, using the β2EC antibody (1:200) for β2 and β1-β2Ig, and using the β3 antibody (1:500) for β3.Coimmunoprecipitation—For transfected cells, 100-mm dishes were grown to confluence and harvested. Cell lysates were solubilized in 500 μl of dilution buffer (60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 180 mm NaCl, 1.25% Triton X-100, and 6 mm EDTA) containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and soluble fractions were then incubated with primary antibody on a rotator at 4 °C for either 4 h (for immunoprecipitation of α subunits) or overnight (for immunoprecipitation of β subunits). Following incubation with primary antibody, the immune complex was incubated with protein A-Sepharose 4B fast flow beads (Sigma) by end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% SDS, and 5 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) followed by a single wash with wash buffer without Triton X-100. Samples were then resuspended in a sample buffer containing 1% SDS and 500 mm β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and separated on 4–15% SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Bio-Rad). The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with antibodies directed against the proteins of interest (contactin, 1:500; β1 or β3 subunits, 1:500; and β2 subunits, 1:200). Blots were probed with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualized using the West Dura enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce).For coimmunoprecipitation of Nav1.2 and β1 with ankyrinG-GFP, cells stably expressing Nav1.2, Nav1.2/Cn/β1, or Nav1.2/Cn/β1Y181E were transiently transfected with 2 μg of ankyrinG-GFP cDNA using FuGENE 6. 36 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated with Sp11II as described above for α subunits. GFP staining was detected with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:1000).[3H]Saxitoxin (STX) Binding Analysis—Whole cell [3H]STX saturation binding analysis of each cell line was performed using a vacuum filtration method as described previously (8Isom L.L.

[3H]STX (28 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Binding data were normalized to protein concentrations using advanced protein assay reagent (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO).Electrophysiological Recording in CHL Cells—Expressed Nav1.2 channels were examined at room temperature by whole cell voltage clamp (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) (24Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15093) Google Scholar). Voltage pulses were applied and data were recorded on an IBM personal computer using the Clampex data acquisition system (Axon Instruments). Linear capacity currents were canceled using the internal voltage clamp circuitry. Residual linear currents were subtracted using the P/4 procedure (25Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 26Bezanilla F. Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 549-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Signals were low pass filtered at 5 kHz using internal voltage clamp circuitry and sampled at 50 kHz. The extracellular solution contained 130 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Intracellular pipettes contained 105 mm CsF, 10 mm CsCl, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm CsEGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH.Following break-in to the cell, a period of 6 min was allowed for peak current levels to stabilize before initiating the electrophysiological recording. The voltage dependence of channel activation was determined from the peak currents recorded during 190-ms-long test pulses in the range of -50 to +65 mV in 5-mV increments, following a 5-ms prepulse to -100 mV from a holding potential of -70 mV. Conductance (G) was calculated from peak current amplitude (I) according to G = I/(V - Vrev) where V is the test potential and Vrev is the measured reversal potential. Inactivation curves were measured using 100-ms-long prepulses in the range of -120 to 0 mV in 5-mV increments, followed by a test pulse to 0 mV, with a holding potential of -70 mV. Conductance-voltage curves and inactivation curves were fit with a Boltzmann relationship, G = 1/(1 + exp((V - V½)/k)) where V½ is the midpoint of the curve and k is a slope factor. The Student's t test was applied to the half-voltages of activation and inactivation (V½) to determine whether any statistically significant differences exist between cells expressing Nav1.2 alone and cells expressing Nav1.2, β1, and contactin. Current densities were calculated from measurements of peak current amplitudes evoked in response to a 190-ms pulse to 0 mV, following a 5-ms prepulse to -100 mV from a holding potential of -70 mV. Current densities were normalized with respect to the whole cell capacitance as determined by the internal circuitry of the amplifier.RESULTSThe β1 Ig Loop Domain Is Required for β1-Contactin Interactions—We reported previously that β1 interacts heterophilically with contactin, whereas β2 does not (15Kazarinova-Noyes K. Malhotra J.D. McEwen D.P. Mattei L.N. Berglund E.O. Ranscht B. Levinson S.R. Schachner M. Shrager P. Isom L.L. Xiao Z.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7517-7525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity in the predicted topology of β1 and β2 (5Isom L. Ragsdale D. De Jongh K. Westenbroek R. Reber B. Scheuer T. Catterall W. Cell. 1995; 83: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) allowed us to generate chimeras between these subunits by exchanging the B, C, C′, C″, D, E, F, and G β-sheets from the Ig loops of β1 and β2 to investigate the molecular basis of interaction of β1 with contactin (Fig. 1A). The A-A′ face regions of the Ig loops were left intact in each chimera. We also utilized the previously described β1STOP truncation mutant to test the importance of the β1 intracellular domain in β1-contactin interactions (3Meadows L. Malhotra J.D. Stetzer A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3954-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Contactin was co-expressed individually with each β subunit mutant in transfected CHL cells. Lysates of the transfected cells were solubilized in Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated with either non-immune IgG or anti-β-subunit antibodies. Immunoblotting with anti-contactin antibodies showed that β2-β1Ig, β1STOP, and wild type β1 were able to associate with contactin (Fig. 1B). Control IgG, β1-β2Ig, and wild type β2 were negative for contactin, despite immunoprecipitation of β1-β2Ig and β2 with specific β subunit antibodies (Fig. 1C). These results show that a region of the β1 Ig loop (residues 17 to 127) is critical for contactin binding.Ankyrin Interacts with Both Nav1.2 α and β1 Subunits—β1 subunits recruit ankyrin to the plasma membrane in response to homophilic adhesion, and β1 subunits associate with both ankyrinB and ankyrinG in transfected cells (12Malhotra J.D.

Two recent reports have shown that recombinant GST fusion proteins containing intracellular domains of Nav1.2 bind to a GST fusion protein containing the membrane binding domain of ankyrinG (27Bouzidi M.

CHL cells stably expressing combinations of Nav1.2, contactin, and β1 subunits were transiently transfected with ankyrinG-GFP. The cell lines containing β1 or β1Y181E and contactin were generated from the same stable Nav1.2-expressing line; thus all three cell lines contained that same amount of α subunit protein. Cell lysates were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with either non-immune IgG or α subunit antibodies. Western blot analysis with anti-GFP indicated that Nav1.2 interacted weakly with ankyrinG-GFP in the absence of β1, in agreement with the fusion protein studies (Fig. 2, lane 2). However, coexpression of Nav1.2 with β1 enhanced the interaction of Nav1.2 with ankyrin. In contrast, coexpression of Nav1.2 with β1Y181E, a protein that is unable to interact with ankyrin (13Malhotra J.D. Koopmann M.C. Kazen-Gillespie K.A. Fettman N. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26681-26688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), did not increase the immune signal for ankyrinG-GFP above that seen with Nav1.2 alone (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4).Fig. 2Nav1.2 and β1 subunits interact with ankyrinG. Cells expressing either Nav1.2 alone, Nav1.2/Cn/β1Y181E, or Nav1.2/Cn/β1 were transiently transfected with ankyrinG-GFP. 36 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated (IP) with either nonimmune IgG (1st lane) or a Nav1.2-specific antibody, Sp11II (2nd, 3rd, and 4th lanes). The immunoblot was probed with anti-GFP antibody (1:1000). Staining for ankyrinG-GFP was observed at ∼270 kDa (arrow). Equal cell volumes were used for each immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β1Y181E Associates with Nav1.2 but Does Not Modulate Sodium Currents—β1Y181E is not able to recruit ankyrin in response to homophilic adhesion (13Malhotra J.D.

We next asked what effect this mutation has on α-β1 subunit association, β1-contactin association, and β1 subunit-mediated modulation of sodium currents. Fig. 3A shows that sodium channel antibodies coimmunoprecipitate Nav1.2 and β1Y181E, indicating that these two subunits associate in transfected CHL cells. Despite their association, β1Y181E did not modulate Nav1.2 currents (Fig. 3, C and D). When comparing the half-voltages (V½) of inactivation (Fig. 3D, closed symbols), Nav1.2/β1Y181E/Cn-expressing cells exhibited a comparable V½ to Nav1.2 alone, whereas the V½ values for Nav1.2/β1 and for Nav1.2/β1/Cn were shifted approximately -10 mV compared with Nav1.2 alone (Fig. 3D; Table I). β1Y181E also had no detectable effects on the V½ of activation compared with wild type β1 (Fig. 3D, open symbols; Table I). We have shown previously that β1Y181E participates in trans homophilic adhesion in Drosophila S2 cells but is unable to recruit ankyrin (13Malhotra J.D. Koopmann M.C. Kazen-Gillespie K.A. Fettman N.

Next we asked whether β1-contactin heterophilic adhesion was affected by the tyrosine to glutamate mutation at residue 181. Immunoprecipitation of β1 or β1Y181E from transfected cell lysates with anti-β1EX antibody showed positive contactin staining for both subunits (Fig. 3B). Thus, the residue β1Y181 was not critical for β1-mediated homophilic or heterophilic cell adhesion or for α-β1 subunit association, but β1Y181 was critical for ankyrin association and for modulation of Nav1.2 kinetics.Fig. 3β1Y181E associates with Nav1.2 and contactin but does not modulate channel function.A, cell lysates from Nav1.2/Cn/β1Y181E CHL cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) either with non-immune IgG or Sp11II. Immunoblots were probed with anti-β1EX (1:500). Staining for β1 was observed at ∼37 kDa (arrow). Bands at 50 kDa are caused by the immunoprecipitating antibodies. B, cell lysates from Nav1.2/Cn/β1 and Nav1.2/Cn/β1Y181E CHL cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-β1EX. Immunoblots were probed with anti-contactin antibody (1:500). Staining for contactin was observed at 135 kDa (arrow). C, steady-state inactivation curves for Nav1.2/Cn/β1 (•) and Nav1.2/Cn/β1Y181E (•). The protocol for determining the voltage dependence of inactivation is described under “Experimental Procedures.” Error bars represent means ± S.E. The smooth lines are according to the Boltzmann equation (see “Experimental Procedures”) using mean values for V½ and k determined from fits of the individual experiments. The shift in the steady-state inactivation curve in the presence of β1 versus β1Y181E is statistically significant as determined by the Student's t test (p < 0.05). D, mean values for V½ of activation (open symbols) and steady-state inactivation (filled symbols) for Nav1.2, Nav1.2/β1, Nav1.2/Cn/β1, and Nav1.2/Cn/β1Y181E.

https://openalex.org/W2018752752,"Despite growing evidence for a mitochondrial localization of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and a broadening spectrum of NO actions on mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis, the basis for interaction between the enzyme and the organelle remain obscure. Here we investigated mitochondrial localization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human embryonic kidney cells transfected or infected with eNOS expression vectors. Copurification of eNOS with mitochondria was observed in both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and eNOS-expressing human embryonic kidney cells. Immunodetectable eNOS was cleaved from mitochondria by proteinase K treatment, suggesting eNOS association with the outer mitochondrial membrane. Localization of eNOS to a proteinase K-cleavable site on the cytoplasmic face of the outer membrane was confirmed by immunogold labeling of non-permeabilized mitochondria. Markers for mitochondrial subfractions ruled out the possibility of eNOS association with an intramitochondrial site or inverted mitochondrial particles. Denaturation of eNOS did not attenuate association with mitochondria. Mutant eNOS lacking a pentabasic amino acid sequence within the autoinhibitory domain (residues 628–632 of the bovine eNOS) showed dramatically reduced binding to the mitochondrial but not to the plasma membrane, which was associated with increased oxygen consumption. Collectively, these findings argue in favor of eNOS localization to the outer mitochondrial membrane in endothelial cells and identify elements of a novel anchoring mechanism.

Med. 2000; 29: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The potential distribution of mtNOS in subfractions of mitochondria has been explored but remains enigmatic. Some indirect evidence suggests that mtNOS is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Indeed, immunohistochemical findings suggest that mtNOS co-localizes with succinate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial marker for the inner membrane (2Kobzik L. Stringer B. Balligand J.L. Reid M.B. Stamler J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Further support for an inner membrane localization of NOS in mitochondria came from NOS activity assays, which indicated that specific activity in submitochondrial particles and crude fractions was higher than that of mitochondrial homogenates or permeabilized mitochondria (14Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent report (15Reiner M. Bloch W. Addicks K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1605-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) suggested that eNOS localizes to the outer membrane of mitochondria, as judged from immunoelectron microscopy of intact endothelial cells. In the present study, we sought to examine the molecular targeting of eNOS to mitochondria. Using three independent experimental approaches, we have verified that eNOS is present on mitochondria of HUVEC and specifically localized to the cytoplasmic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane. In vitro experiments with isolated mitochondria show that native and denatured eNOS interact with a proteinase K-hydrolyzable protein that participates in eNOS recruitment to mitochondria. Deletion analysis revealed a stretch of five basic amino acids in the autoinhibitory domain (AID) of eNOS that is required for anchoring the enzyme to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Tethering of eNOS by its AID would predictably disinhibit enzymatic activity, allowing for NO synthesis by the mitochondrial membrane-bound eNOS. One of the consequences of the reduced mitochondrial association of AID-deleted eNOS is the increase in oxygen consumption. Reagents and Antibodies—ATP, mannitol, phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, proteinase K, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide were obtained from Sigma. Precast gradient 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (1.0 mm) were obtained from Invitrogen. Mouse anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Los Angeles, CA). Mouse anti-human cytochrome oxidase subunit II monoclonal antibody, Alexa-Fluor goat anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa-Fluor goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rabbit anti-fumarase polyclonal antibody was obtained from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp. (Westbury, NY). Mouse anti-human VDAC monoclonal antibody (31HL) was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences (Los Angeles, CA). Mouse anti-Na+/K+ á-1 subunit monoclonal antibody was purchased from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flanders, NJ). Mouse anti-Golgi marker 58K protein monoclonal antibody was obtained from Abcam (UK). Rabbit anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated whole antibody from sheep and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated whole antibody from donkey were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (UK), Percoll was from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ), DMEM was from Biofluids (Rockville, MD), and EBM-2 was a product of Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown in EBM-2 medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum, and used in experiments at the 6th passage. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and HEK cells stably transfected with a pcDNA3 vector that engenders stable expression of wild-type bovine eNOS (HEK-eNOS; a gift of Dr. William Sessa, Yale University School of Medicine) or a truncated enzyme lacking the autoinhibitory domain (HEK-ΔeNOS, 628–632 deletion) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Construction, Propagation, and Purification of Adenoviral Vectors for Bovine eNOS (beNOS) Protein Expression—Construction of recombinant Ad-GFP-beNOS viruses was carried out following the manufacturer's protocol (Adeno-Quest, Quantum Biotechnologies Inc., Montreal, Canada). Briefly, cDNA-encoding bovine eNOS was subcloned into pQBIAd-GFP-IRES (ligating the flanking BamHI sites eNOS to BglII cloning site on the vector). The vector carries an adenovirus origin of replication and packaging sequence, cytomegalovirus promoter, and an internal ribosome entry site element that provides expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the inserted gene (wild-type eNOS or an eNOS deletion mutant lacking the oligonucleotide sequence that encodes amino acid residues 628–632, RRKRK) in a one-to-one ratio. The vector cloning site (Bg1II) is followed by a DNA sequence homologous to Ad5 9.4–15.5 map units. Recombinant adenoviruses were produced by homologous recombination during cotransfection of the linearized plasmid vector with the QBI viral DNA into HEK-293A cells. Transfected 293A monolayers were overlaid with an agar-DMEM mixture and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Expression of GFP and the appearance of plaques were tracked by fluorescence microscopy, and plaques were isolated as soon as they were identifiable. Plaque lysates were subjected to three rounds of plaque purification, expanded on HEK 293A cell monolayers, and finally purified on CsCl step and continuous gradients, respectively. Viral titers ranged from 5 × 1012 viral particles per ml and were stored at –20 °C in a glycerol/BSA storage solution. Adenoviral Infection of HEK Cells—HEK cells were plated in 10-cm plates to reach about 60–70% confluence at the time of transfection. The culture medium was removed, and 200 virus particles/cell were added to each plate in 2-ml serum-free DMEM. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking, 8 ml of fresh complete DMEM were added. Cells were harvested for the isolation of mitochondria 6–24 h after infection. Isolation of Mitochondria—All procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (16Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped into MSH buffer (0.225 mol/liter mannitol, 0.75 mol/liter sucrose, 20 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 7.4) and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer using 30 strokes. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min in a Beckman J-20 rotor, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet (crude mitochondria fraction) was washed with MSH buffer twice. Purified mitochondria were obtained by Percoll gradient centrifugation (16Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude mitochondrial pellets were suspended in MEHB buffer (0.25 mol/liter mannitol, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 5 mmol/liter HEPES, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.4) and 100 μl was layered onto 3.0 ml of 30% (v/v) Percoll in 225 mmol/liter mannitol, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 25 mmol/liter HEPES, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.4, and spun at 95,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman sw65 rotor. The brownish-yellow mitochondrial band was collected from the lower layer of the gradient, washed twice with MSH buffer to remove Percoll, and then suspended in a volume of MSH buffer to achieve a desired concentration. Hypotonic Rupture of Mitochondria—Rupture of mitochondria was performed according to the protocol described by Geissler et al (17Geissler A. Krimmer T. Bomer U. Guiard B. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3977-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mitochondria in MSH buffer were diluted with five volumes of 10 mmol/liter Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, to rupture the outer membrane by swelling. After 15 min of incubation on ice, an equal volume of S500H buffer (0.5 mol/liter sucrose, 10 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 7.4) was added to re-establish the original osmotic conditions. Mitochondria were then isolated by centrifugation and resuspended in MSH buffer. Binding of Recombinant Bovine eNOS to Mitochondria—Purified mitochondria (10 μl, 2.5 mg/ml) and 90 μl of buffer (250 mmol/liter sucrose, 1% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA, 80 mmol/liter KCl, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2 mmol/liter ATP, 2 mmol/liter nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 10 mmol/liter Mops-KOH, pH 7.2) were preincubated for 5 min at 25 °C before the addition of 1 μl of purified recombinant bovine eNOS (0.091 μmol/liter). After incubating at 25 °C for 1 h, 900 μl of MSH buffer were added to the samples. Mitochondria were subsequently re-isolated by centrifugation and washed twice with MSH buffer before protein extraction and analysis by SDS-PAGE. Proteinase K Treatment—Mitochondria were treated with proteinase K at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml (from a 100× stock solution) for 25 min at 0 °C. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was then added to a final concentration of 2 mmol/liter, and samples were incubated for a further 10 min at 0 °C. Mitochondria were then pelleted by centrifugation. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed by using standard procedures on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were electro-transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with primary antibodies. The blotted bands were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-eNOS antibody (1:500), anti-VDAC antibody (1:200), anti-fumarase antibody (1:1000), anti-cytochrome c oxidase (COX) antibody (1:1000), anti-cytochrome c antibody (1:200), and anti-caveolin antibody (1:1000). Secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:2000. Immunofluorescence—Mitochondria were incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1.5 h and then treated with anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody at 1:200 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Mitochondria were washed three times with PBS, incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor-goat anti-mouse antibody at 1:100 dilution at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS. Mitochondria were resuspended in PBS, and fluorescence was determined by using a fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at excitation wavelength of 584 nm and emission wavelength of 612 nm. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Mitochondrial fractions were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1.5 h at room temperature, then incubated with anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody at 1:50 dilution for 1 h, or mock-incubated (no antibody). Samples were pelleted and resuspended in 200 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG tagged with 5 nm gold, diluted 1:20 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% cold water fish gelatin (solution A) for 1 h at room temperature (Aurion ImmunoGold Reagents). Samples were spun to a pellet and washed twice without resuspension in solution A and then resuspended in PBS. Samples were pelleted for fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.002% picric acid in 0.1 mol/liter sodium cacodylate buffer and preserved in fixative overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then washed with 0.1 mol/liter cacodylate buffer, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, 1.5% potassium ferricyanide, and then en bloc stained with uranyl acetate, dehydrated through an ethanol series, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Sections were cut at 60 nm using a Diatome diamond knife (Diatome US, Fort Washington, PA) on an RMC MT-7000 ultramicrotome. Sections were stained with lead citrate and examined in a JEM 100CX-II electron microscope (JEOL, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 80 kV. Measurement of O2 Consumption—HEK cells were transfected with Adeno-eNOS, Adeno-ΔeNOS, and empty adenovirus vectors at their 80–90% confluency. Twenty-four hours later, cells were trypsinized, washed twice with Krebs bicarbonate buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 25mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.1 mm MgSO4, and 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm HEPES) and then suspended in the same buffer solution at a concentration of 1 million cells/ml. 3-ml cell suspension was then placed in a stirred chamber sealed with a Clark-type platinum O2 electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH). Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically using an O2 monitor (model YSI 5300) connected to a linear chart recorder (model 1202, Barnstead/Thermolyne Corp, Dubuque, IA). At the end of each experiment, sodium succinate (10–3 mol/liter) and then sodium cyanide (10–3 mol/liter) were added to confirm that changes in O2 consumption originated from mitochondrial respiration. Oxygen consumption was calculated as the rate of decrease in O2 concentration, assuming an initial O2 concentration of 224 nmol/ml, and was expressed as nmol O2 consumed per minute per million cells. The effects of eNOS and ΔeNOS expression on O2 consumption were calculated as percentage changes from the baseline O2 consumption level (the consumption rate of empty adenovirus vector-transfected HEK cells was set as 100%). To minimize the influence of intrinsic variations of individual electrodes, samples from each set of cells were analyzed sequentially using the same detection chamber, and the changes for each group (HEK/eNOS and HEK/ΔeNOS) were then averaged. Differential centrifugation of early passage HUVEC yielded several subcellular fractions that were probed for eNOS. Estimates from densitometric analysis of eNOS protein by Western blot analyses suggest that mitochondrial eNOS is robust, comprising ∼15% of total whole-cell lysates (Fig. 1A). The band of eNOS disappeared after the mitochondria from HUVEC were treated with proteinase K (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 4), but was resistant to mitochondrial rupture by swelling (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Notably, proteinase K treatment has been used extensively to selectively remove proteins from the surface of mitochondrial outer membrane (18Diekert K. Kispal G. Guiard B. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11752-11757Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gartner F.

To further analyze the submitochondrial localization of NOS in HUVEC, subfractions of mitochondria were identified by markers: VDAC for outer membrane (21Hodge T. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), cytochrome c for intermembrane space (22Sollner T. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), COX for inner membrane (16Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and fumarase for matrix (16Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The band on Western blots of the outer mitochondrial membrane marker VDAC was shifted to lower mass after treatment with proteinase K, consistent with VDAC integration in the outer mitochondrial membrane and protection from complete digestion by proteinase K (23Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 24Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The levels of cytochrome c, fumarase, and COX were not significantly affected by treatment of mitochondria with proteinase K, despite the complete loss of bound eNOS, indicating that eNOS was not located in the matrix, inner mitochondrial membrane, or intermembrane space of mitochondria. These results suggest that eNOS is expressed exclusively on the surface of the outer mitochondrial membrane. In the next series of experiments, we sought independent confirmation of eNOS localization to the outer mitochondrial membrane by immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 2, A–F). In sample blanks (secondary antibody, but not primary), gold particles were not detected in association with purified mitochondria (not shown), whereas eNOS staining was consistently observed on the outer aspect of the outer membrane of mitochondria exposed to eNOS-specific primary antibody (Fig. 2, A–E). The pattern of eNOS distribution was patchy, as illustrated in the images presented. In accord with Western blot and immunofluorescence results, treatment with proteinase K consistently resulted in the disappearance of immunoelectron microscopy-detectable eNOS (Fig. 2F). Next, we made use of a simple model system, wild-type HEK cells lacking eNOS, and infected the cells with adenoviral vector expressing eNOS protein. Appearance of eNOS protein in whole-cell lysates and mitochondrial fractions was monitored by Western blot analysis. Results of a representative experiment are illustrated in Fig. 3A. Initially, eNOS was undetectable in both whole-cell lysates and isolated mitochondria. Six hours after Ad5-eNOS infection, trace amounts of eNOS became detectable, and at 10–12 h, eNOS expression was robust in both HEK cell lysates and in purified mitochondria. The purity of the isolated mitochondria was assessed based on the enrichment of a mitochondrial marker (COX) and the absence of protein markers for contaminating Golgi membranes (58K protein) or plasma membranes (Na+/K+ ATPase). Results suggest that the isolated mitochondria were 10-fold enriched in COX, but devoid of detectable Golgi membranes and plasma membranes (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these data suggest that newly synthesized eNOS associates with the mitochondrial fraction and that this cannot be attributed to contamination with Golgi or plasma membranes. To examine the possibility of an import of eNOS from the cytoplasm, mitochondrial fractions obtained from wild-type HEK cells were incubated with the recombinant bovine eNOS (rbeNOS) in the next series of experiments. Results depicted in Fig. 4A demonstrate that rbeNOS can tightly associate with mitochondria in vitro (lane 1), and this association was not attenuated by prior denaturation of eNOS with 8 m urea (lane 3). Mitochondria-associated eNOS, both native and denatured, was completely removed by treatment of incubates with proteinase K (lanes 2, 4). These data suggest that eNOS can bind selectively to the outer membrane of mitochondria. When the treatment of mitochondria with proteinase K was performed prior to the incubation with eNOS, eNOS binding was eliminated (lanes 5, 6), suggesting the existence of an eNOS binding protein(s) on the surface of mitochondrial outer membrane. Experiments were performed to assess possible uptake of eNOS by mitochondria. Toward this end, purified mitochondria from Ad5-eNOS-infected cells were swollen in hypotonic medium, and subfractions were prepared that represent intermembrane space, inner membrane, and matrix. Results summarized in Fig. 4B demonstrate that the treatment of isolated mitochondria with proteinase K caused the disappearance of immunodetectable enzyme. Further, eNOS abundance in the swelling-ruptured mitochondria (in which the outer membrane was partially disrupted) was reduced compared with that present in an equal number of intact mitochondria. Based on the above findings, one would predict that anti-eNOS antibodies should be able to efficiently recognize the protein on non-permeabilized mitochondria. To examine this possibility, isolated mitochondria were incubated with anti-eNOS antibodies as detailed under “Materials and Methods,” followed by the detection of the antigen using fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies. The intensity of eNOS immunofluorescence is quantified in Fig. 5. Mitochondria obtained from HEK-eNOS cells and HUVEC showed significant fluorescence intensity, far exceeding that of mitochondria obtained from wild-type HEK cells. Cells that were only exposed to secondary antibodies served as sample blanks. These data further support the view that eNOS antigen resides on the surface of mitochondrial membranes. eNOS is unique among the NOS isoforms in its dual acylation by myristic and palmitic acids (25Gratton J.P. Fontana J. Sessa W.C. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 157-166Google Scholar, 26Michel T. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1999; 32: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). N-terminal myristoylation is required for the subcellular targeting of eNOS to cell membranes (where it associates with caveolin-1) and the Golgi complex (27Liu J. Garcia-Cardena G. Sessa W.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13277-13281Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that acylation may similarly be necessary for the targeting of eNOS to mitochondria, a series of experiments were performed using an eNOS mutant defective in N-myristoylation. Mutation of glycine-2 to alanine (G2A), the N-terminal myristoylation site of eNOS, did not attenuate the association of eNOS with mitochondria (Fig. 6A). These data indicate that myristoylation is not a prerequisite for localization of eNOS to mitochondria. A stretch of five basic amino acid residues resides within the autoinhibitory domain of eNOS (residues 628–632 in bovine eNOS, RRKRK). Notably, this domain is a 45-amino acid peptide insertion in the FMN-containing domain that serves a physiological role in regulating eNOS activity (42Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B Morales A.J. Smith S.E. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

Limited trypsinolysis studies have indicated that the pentabasic sequence in the autoinhibitory domain is sequestered in quiescent enzyme, maintaining eNOS in an inactive conformation, and exposed after eNOS becomes activated subsequent to Ca2+/calmodulin binding (42Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B Morales A.J. Smith S.E. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that only the CS domain of human Sgt1 physically interacts with HSP90. The tetratricopeptide repeat domain does not bind to either HSP90 or HSP70.

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; CHIP, C terminus of HSC70-interacting protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; CS, CHORD-containing proteins and Sgt1; SGS, Sgt1-specific; HSQC, 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, Nuclear Overhauser effect; SIP, Siah-1-interacting protein. 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; CHIP, C terminus of HSC70-interacting protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; CS, CHORD-containing proteins and Sgt1; SGS, Sgt1-specific; HSQC, 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, Nuclear Overhauser effect; SIP, Siah-1-interacting protein. is a molecular chaperone important for protein folding. HSP90 is different from other chaperones because most of its substrates are related to signal transduction (1Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggest that HSP90 plays a role in protein quality control where it facilitates the polyubiquitination and degradation of substrates through interaction with the co-chaperone C terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP) (2Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Thus, HSP90 can be involved in protein regulation in quite different ways depending on the cellular context. Very recently, it has been reported that Sgt1 interacts with HSP90 (3Takahashi A.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Sgt1 was originally identified as a suppressor of the G2 allele of Skp1 and was found to be important for both the G1/S and G2/M transitions in the cell cycle (6Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The G2/M transition involves activation of the kinetochore. Sgt1 was shown to be required for the activation of the kinetochore core complex CBF3 and to physically interact with Skp1, one component of CBF3 (6Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Sgt1 also physically interacts with Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes through interaction with Skp1. Moreover, a yeast Sgt1 mutant was defective in Sic1 degradation through ubiquitination (6Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of Sgt1 proteins from yeast, human, barley, rice, and Arabidopsis shows three conserved domains (tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), CHORD-containing proteins and Sgt1 (CS), and Sgt1-specific (SGS)) and two variable regions (VR1 and VR2) (7Azevedo C. Sadanandom A. Kitagawa K. Freialdenhoven A. Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Science. 2002; 295: 2073-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). TPR domains are known as heat shock protein binding domains. The SGS domain was shown to interact with S100 calcium-binding proteins (8Nowotny M. Spiechowicz M. Jastrzebska B. Filipek A. Kitagawa K. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26923-26928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The CS domain has high sequence homology with p23 and is also known as a p23-like domain (9Garcia-Ranea J.A. Mirey G. Camonis J. Valencia A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). p23 has been shown to physically and functionally interact with HSP90, apparently serving in a role as co-chaperone. Recently, HSP90 was shown to be an essential factor required for kinetochore assembly (10Stemmann O. Neidig A. Kocher T. Wilm M. Lechner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8585-8590Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and two-hybrid screens revealed an interaction between Sgt1 and HSP90 (3Takahashi A. Casais C. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Because Sgt1 has a standard heat shock protein binding TPR domain (3Takahashi A. Casais C. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 7Azevedo C. Sadanandom A. Kitagawa K. Freialdenhoven A. Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Science. 2002; 295: 2073-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), it is logical to assume that this TPR domain is the primary mediator of HSP90 interaction. However, given the homology with p23, it has been also postulated (11Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 12Muskett P. Parker J. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that the CS domain may also be involved. In fact, the CS domain has been proposed to play a direct role in binding HSP90 (3Takahashi A. Casais C. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To more fully characterize the interaction of HSP90 and Sgt1, we report here a series of biophysical and structural experiments designed to map the HSP90 binding site on Sgt1. These results are then analyzed for their implications regarding the cellular functions of Sgt1 and related proteins. Expression Plasmids—For Sgt1 and its isolated domains, the appropriate fragments of human Sgt1 DNA were amplified from the BKK51 plasmid (6Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) by PCR with Pfu polymerase. PCR products and vector (pET28a from Novagen) were digested with restriction endonucleases (NdeI and BamHI, both from Promega), purified from an agarose gel using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and ligated by T4 DNA ligase (Promega) to produce pET28-Sgt1, pET28-Sgt1-(1–138) (TPR domain), pET28-Sgt1-(139–226) (CS domain), and pET28-Sgt1-(227–333) (SGS domain). These TPR and CS domains contain additional VR1 and VR2 regions, respectively (7Azevedo C. Sadanandom A. Kitagawa K. Freialdenhoven A. Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Science. 2002; 295: 2073-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Ligation mixtures were used to transform Escherichia coli (TOP10F′ strain). Single-colony PCR was used to detect clones that contained the insert. The plasmids encoding human p23 and chicken HSP90 were kind gifts from Dr. David Toft (13Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G.

Protein Production—All of the proteins encoded in pET28 vectors were expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli with the exception of the Sgt1-CS domain, which was expressed in BL21(DE3)RIL (Stratagene). Proteins were purified over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), the N-terminal His-tag was cleaved by thrombin (Calbiochem), and the thrombin was removed by passing over benzamidine resin (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were then passed over the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin again to remove the cleaved His tag. The proteins were exchanged against appropriate buffers for further studies. Human p23 and chicken HSP90 were purified as described previously (13Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 14Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.J.

The protein concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients calculated from the known content of aromatic amino acids. Protein samples for NMR experiments were expressed in minimal media with NH4Cl and glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. 15NH4Cl and 13C6-glucose were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Glutathione S-transferase fused HSC70-(540–650) was purified over glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) using a previously published method (15Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19594-19600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In Vitro Pull-down Assay—The coupling of p23 and Sgt1 to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). HSP90 was incubated in binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.01% Non-idet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm ATPγS (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 30 °C (13Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45942-45948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). ATPγS was treated beforehand by a regenerating system that included 7 units of creatine phosphokinase (Calbiochem) and 10 mm phosphocreatine (13Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For Fig. 1, 10 μg of ATPγS-treated HSP90 in binding buffer was applied to p23, Sgt1, and empty resin and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The unbound fractions were preserved for SDS-PAGE analysis. The resin was washed with the buffer, which had the same components as the binding buffer with the exception of ATPγS and the ATP-regenerating system. HSP90 that bound to the resin was eluted with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. HSP90 in the bound and unbound fractions was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In the experiments with no ATP, the only difference was that ATPγS was not present. All of the assays were repeated twice. We note a higher molecular weight band in the pulled-down fractions, the amount of which varies in different experiments. One possible explanation for this band might be that it is an endogenous E. coli heat shock protein (17Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) impurity that is carried along in the HSP90 preparation and then enriched by its affinity for p23 and Sgt1. There is some evidence for a similar small band in the unbound fractions. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed on Bruker Avance 600 and 800 spectrometers equipped with triple axis gradient QXI probe and triple axis gradient TXI probe, respectively. The NMR chemical shift perturbation assays utilized 15N-labeled Sgt1 and unlabeled HSP90 and were performed at 303 K. The initial NMR samples contained 0.05–0.2 mm15N-labeled Sgt1 proteins, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 (93% H2O, 7% D2O), 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT. A concentrated HSP90 solution (0.5–1 mm) in the same buffer was added to 15N-labeled Sgt1 proteins with the ratio adjusted between 0 and 1. The perturbation was monitored by the acquisition of 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra. To see the effect of ATPγS on the interaction between Sgt1-CS domain and HSP90, a sample of 15N-labeled Sgt1-CS was prepared with 4 mm ATPγS, 10 mm MgCl2,20mm phosphocreatine, and 70 units of creatine phosphokinase. For the interaction assay between HSP70 and the Sgt1 TPR domain, an excess of glutathione S-transferase-HSC70-(540–650) was added to 0.1 mm15N-labeled Sgt1 TPR domain and the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum was acquired. For structural analysis of the Sgt1-CS domain, the protein was dialyzed into 20 mm acetic acid-d3, pH 4.5. Five samples in the concentration range 1–2 mm were prepared: 15N/13C double-labeled sample in H2O; 13C-labeled sample in D2O; 10% fractionally 13C-enriched sample in D2O; and unlabeled samples in H2O and D2O. The backbone assignments were primarily derived from two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC, three-dimensional HNCA, three-dimensional HNCACB, three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH, and three-dimensional HNCO spectra. The amide chemical shifts provided the starting points for extending the backbone assignments to the side-chain atoms using three-dimensional CCONH, three-dimensional H(C)CONH, three-dimensional HBHA (CCO)NH, and three-dimensional H(C)CH-TOCSY. Stereospecific assignments of isopropyl methyls of Val and Leu were obtained using a sample of biosynthetically directed 10% fractional 13C-labeled protein (18Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) between CβH2 and aromatic protons observed in a three-dimensional 13C-resolved NOESY were used as starting points for sequence-specific assignments of aromatic side chains. These NOEs in combination with two-dimensional constant time (CT) 13C-1H HSQC and homonuclear two-dimensional 1H-1H TOCSY were used to complete the assignment of each aromatic side-chain spin system. The 10% fractionally 13C-labeled sample was used for a two-dimensional 13C-1H CT-TROSY-HSQC (19Jacob J. Louis J.M. Nesheiwat I. Torchia D.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with a 36-ms CT period to assign the ζ carbon and attached protons of Phe residues. In addition, this spectrum also helped identify δ and ϵ positions of Phe and Tyr residues. All of the spectra were processed using NMRPipe (20Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Sparky (21Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. Sparky 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2002Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Distance restraints were obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC. Assignments and volume integration were made with the program PIPP (22Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Distance-filtered NOE assignments using preliminary structures were made to expedite the process. Upper distance bounds for the structure calculation were set to 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 Å for the three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC and 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 Å for the three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC. Backbone torsion angles were obtained from the program TALOS (23Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). An ensemble of 50 starting structures were generated using the program DYANA, version 1.5 (24Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar), and refined using the SANDER module of AMBER (25Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Debolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2661) Google Scholar) using 1535 distance restraints (579 intraresidues, 349 sequential, 133 medium-range, and 474 long-range) and 118 torsion angle restraints. The program FINDFAM (26Smith J.A. GomezPaloma L. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1996; 34: S147-S155Crossref Google Scholar) was used to determine that a minimum of 20 structures was needed to represent the family accurately. The structures were selected on the basis of a combination of lowest constraint violation energies and large negative molecular energies. The final ensemble of 20 structures gave no distance violations greater than 0.2 Å and no torsion angle violations greater than 5° (Table I). Structures were analyzed graphically using MOLMOL (27Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of the final family of structures was analyzed using the PROCHECK NMR software (28Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar) showing that 97.5% of all residues fall within the favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot.Table IStatistics for the Sgt1 CS domain structural ensembleConstraint violations, mean ± S.D.

HSP90 Binds to Sgt1—Recent evidence suggesting that Sgt1 interacts with HSP90 (3Takahashi A. Casais C. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 11Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 12Muskett P. Parker J. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) led us to investigate whether or not there is direct interaction between human Sgt1 and HSP90 using a combination of pull-down assays and NMR spectroscopy. The pull-down assays in Fig. 1 show clear evidence for interaction between HSP90 and Sgt1. The well established ATP-dependent interaction between HSP90 and its co-chaperone p23 was used as a control to confirm the validity of our methods (13Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 16Sullivan W.P. Owen B.A.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45942-45948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Using the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS, we see the expected ATP dependence of the binding of p23 to HSP90 (Fig. 1, left two lanes). Remarkably, the interaction of Sgt1 with HSP90 did not require the presence of ATPγS as did p23. There is a notable difference in the amounts of HSP90 bound to the Sgt1 resin in the absence and presence of ATPγS, which implies that the binding of HSP90 may be stimulated by ATP. However, regardless of the relative amounts of HSP90 bound, the key finding from the pull-down assays is that Sgt1 can bind HSP90 in the absence of ATP. NMR spectroscopy was used to further characterize the nature of the interaction between Sgt1 and HSP90 (Fig. 1B). For these experiments, samples of 15N-enriched Sgt1 were titrated with increasing amounts of HSP90 and 15N-1H HSQC NMR spectra were recorded in the absence of ATP. NMR signals are exquisitely sensitive probes of protein structure, and in these spectra, signals are observed for each amide group in the protein. The NMR approach thus provides a large number of site-specific probes of the structure to be monitored as the binding of one component to another occurs. As HSP90 was titrated into the solution of labeled Sgt1, there was a general attenuation of peak intensity in the NMR spectrum, consistent with the binding of the large 180-kDa HSP90 dimer to the 38-kDa Sgt1. However, a comparison of the two panels in Fig. 1B shows that a select number of peaks were more severely affected than the others. This critical observation indicates that the binding of HSP90 occurs at a specific site on Sgt1. Sgt1 Is a Modular Protein—As noted above, Sgt1 is comprised of TPR, CS, and SGS domains. The fact that binding of HSP90 to Sgt1 leads to selective effects on a subset of NMR signals suggested that the HSP90 binding domain of Sgt1 is structurally independent of the other domains. These observations prompted the subcloning of each of the three Sgt1 domains (7Azevedo C. Sadanandom A. Kitagawa K. Freialdenhoven A. Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Science. 2002; 295: 2073-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) for in-depth biophysical analysis: TPR-(1–138); CS-(139–226); and SGS-(227–333). Successful bacterial expression of these constructs under standard conditions suggests that stably folded protein domains are produced. To determine whether or not the Sgt1 domains are structurally independent, 15N-enriched samples of intact Sgt1 and the three domains were prepared and 15N-1H HSQC NMR spectra were acquired under identical conditions (Fig. 2). The spectra for the isolated TPR and CS domains are well dispersed, indicating that they have a well folded globular structure. The spectrum of the SGS domain is much less dispersed, which indicates that it is not a well folded globular domain. An analysis by CD spectroscopy indicates there is a limited degree of helical secondary structure in the SGS domain. The C-terminal domain of calcyclin-binding protein (amino acids 178–229), which shows high sequence homology with Sgt1, has a similar CD spectrum (29Nowotny M. Bhattacharya S. Filipek A. Krezel A.M. Chazin W. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31178-31182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the SGS domain probably has some nascent helical elements but does not occupy a compact well folded globular structure. Comparison of the NMR spectra for the isolated domains to that of intact Sgt1 reveals peaks in identical positions (Fig. 2). Because the NMR chemical shift is extremely sensitive to structure, the similarity of peak positions constitutes unambiguous evidence that there are no differences in the structures of the domains, whether they are alone or tethered together in the intact protein. The line-widths of the peaks in the spectrum of intact Sgt1 are smaller than expected for a single domain molecule over 30 kDa, strongly implying that the linkers between the domains are flexible and that any contacts between domains are not long-lived. Hence, the domains probably function in a coordinated but not necessarily cooperative manner. The Interaction of Sgt1 with HSP90 Occurs via the CS Domain—The modular nature of Sgt1 enabled NMR to be used to identify the HSP90 binding region on Sgt1. This involved titration of HSP90 into solutions of 15N-enriched Sgt1 domains as described above for the intact protein. Fig. 3 shows the 15N-1H HSQC spectra after adding 1 molar equivalent of HSP90 to the TPR, CS, and SGS domains of Sgt1. Surprisingly, there is no effect on the TPR domain, contrary to the hypothesis that the Sgt1 TPR domain might be the main binding domain to HSP90 (11Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 12Muskett P. Parker J. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, the disappearance of the majority of signals in the spectrum of the CS domain is a clear indication of interaction with HSP90. The few peaks remaining in the spectrum of the CS domain in the presence of HSP90 are attributable to very flexible residues in loops and at the N and C termini. A detailed analysis of the peaks that disappear in the spectra of intact Sgt1 upon binding of HSP90 reveals that these signals correspond very closely to those affected by binding of HSP90 to the isolated CS domain (cf. Fig. 1B). Hence, all of the observations are consistent with the interaction of Sgt1 with HSP90 being mediated by the CS domain. Experiments on Sgt1-CS were also performed in the presence of ATPγS, and no detectable differences were observed, supporting the conclusion from the pull-down assay that, unlike p23, the interaction of Sgt1 with HSP90 can occur in the absence of ATP. The Structure of Sgt1-CS Domain Is Distinct from p23—The observation that the interaction of Sgt1 with HSP90 did not require ATPγS indicates that the Sgt-CS domain is biochemically distinct from p23. Although the sequence homology of Sgt1-CS and p23 implies that they share a common structural framework, the difference in biochemical properties implies that there are significant (although probably subtle) differences in their structures. To test this hypothesis and obtain possible insights into the reasons why Sgt1-CS and p23 have different biological functions, we determined the structure of Sgt1-CS by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR. Details of the protocols for structure determination are provided under “Experimental Procedures,” and key structural statistics are presented in Table I. The representative NMR structural ensemble of the Sgt1-CS domain is shown in Fig. 4A. Overlays of the Sgt1-CS domain and p23 structures (Fig. 4C) (41) reveal that the proteins are very similar. The proteins superimpose to a root mean square deviation of 1.6 Å. There are a series of conserved residues among the Sgt1-CS domain, p23, and other CS domain-containing proteins, which include Trp-144, Val-151, Leu-192, Ile-196, Ser-201, Lys-216, Trp-222, and Leu-225 (Sgt1 numbering). These residues are all found in the hydrophobic core (Fig. 4C) and are presumably important for maintaining the β-sandwich fold. There is one significant difference between the structures of p23 and Sgt1-CS. Sgt1-CS lacks the last β-strand found in p23 (Fig. 4B). The absence of this structural element is intrinsic to the Sgt1 protein, because all of the Sgt1-CS residues corresponding to the last β-strand in p23 are present in the construct. Moreover, we have directly observed all of their NMR signals and find that these residues appear to be significantly more flexible than the rest of the domain. They have unusually narrow line-widths and are not involved in any long-range NOEs. Interestingly, this region is highly conserved among p23 proteins but appears not to be conserved in CS domains including Sgt1-CS, Siah-1-interacting protein (SIP)-CS, and other “p23-like” domains (9Garcia-Ranea J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2082202446,"Macroautophagy is the process of intracellular bulk protein degradation induced by nutrient starvation and is generally considered to be a nonselective degradation of cytosolic enzymes and organelles. However, it remains a possibility that some proteins may be preferentially degraded by autophagy. In this study, we have performed a systematic analysis on the substrate selectivity of autophagy in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using two-dimensional PAGE. We performed a differential screen on wild-type and Δatg7/apg7 autophagy-deficient cells and found that cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald6p) decreased under nitrogen starvation. As assessed by immunoblot, Ald6p was reduced by greater than 82% after 24 h of nitrogen starvation. This reduction was dependent on Atg/Apg proteins and vacuolar proteases but was not dependent on the proteasome or the cytoplasm to vacuole targetting (Cvt) pathway. Using pulse-chase and subcellular fractionation, we have also demonstrated that Ald6p was preferentially transported to vacuoles via autophagosomes. Δatg7 Δald6 double mutant cells were able to maintain higher rates of viability than Δatg7 cells under nitrogen starvation, and Ald6p-overexpressing cells were not able to maintain high rates of viability. Furthermore, the Ald6pC306S mutant, which lacks enzymatic activity, had viability rates similar to Δald6 cells. Ald6p enzymatic activity may be disadvantageous for survival under nitrogen starvation; therefore, yeast cells may preferentially eliminate Ald6p via autophagy.

Ald6p enzymatic activity may be disadvantageous for survival under nitrogen starvation; therefore, yeast cells may preferentially eliminate Ald6p via autophagy. Cellular activities require the maintenance of a balance between the synthesis and degradation of proteins. Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an intracellular bulk degradation system that is well conserved in eukaryotes; autophagy transports cytoplasmic components to the lysosome/vacuole for degradation (1Ashford T.P. Porter K.R. J. Cell Biol. 1962; 12: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). This degradation is a cellular response to starvation and also plays a role in the recycling of cytoplasmic components, which may be important for cellular remodeling, development, and differentiation (2Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar, 3Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Kazgan N. Anderson O.R. Kessin R.H. J. Biol.

A total of 16 genes that are essential for autophagy and that are named APG and AUT (current nomenclature is ATG) (5Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A.

Much progress has been made in the functional analysis of these genes (6Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 7Ohsumi Y. Nat.

In eukaryotic cells, there is another major degradation system, the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which mediates the selective ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins by the proteasome. This pathway serves mainly to degrade short-lived proteins, such as transcription factors, cell cycle regulators, and defective proteins. However, more than 99% of cellular proteins are long-lived, and autophagic degradation contributes to the turnover of these proteins. In contrast to selective degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, autophagy is generally thought to be nonselective. Autophagy is initiated by the sequestration of cytoplasmic components in a double-membrane structure termed the autophagosome. Immunoelectron microscopy has shown that ribosomes and typical cytosolic marker enzymes, such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) 1The abbreviations used are: ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; API, aminopeptidase I; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-associated laser deionization time-of-flight; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase.2 T.

Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The measurement of the enzymatic activities of these proteins also supports this conclusion (10Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar).2 If degradation of long-lived proteins is exclusively mediated by autophagy, all proteins might be expected to have similar lifetimes. However, long-lived proteins have a variety of lifetimes; therefore, the autophagic pathway might have some selectivity. It is known that fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (via the vacuolar import and degradation, the Vid pathway) (6Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 11Hoffman M. Chiang H.L. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the peroxisome (via pexophagy) (12Mukaiyama H. Oku M. Baba M. Samizo T. Hammond A.T. Glick B.S. Kato N. Sakai Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) are selectively transported from the cytoplasm to the vacuole and degraded. To investigate the possibility of selective autophagic degradation, we attempted to compare the amounts of each intracellular protein under growth and starvation conditions in yeast, S. cerevisiae. We performed a systematic analysis using two-dimensional PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to detect the autophagy-dependent degradation of intracellular proteins. During these analyses, we observed an interesting behavior of the Mg2+- and NADPH-dependent cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald6p), which catalyzes the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate in the cytosol (acetaldehyde + NADP+ → acetate + NADPH) (13Meaden P.G. Dickinson F.M. Mifsud A. Tessier W. Westwater J. Bussey H. Midgley M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae genome encodes five or more different members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family. Ald4p is the major K+- and NAD+-dependent mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (14Tessier W.D. Meaden P.G. Dickinson F.M. Midgley M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Ald5p is a minor K+-dependent mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which is induced when cells are grown in ethanol-containing medium (15Kurita O. Nishida Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 181: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ald2p and Ald3p are closely related cytosolic enzymes that are required for in vivo pantothenic acid biosynthesis via conversion of 3-aminopropanol to β-alanine (16White W.H. Skatrud P.L. Xue Z. Toyn J.H. Genetics. 2003; 163: 69-77PubMed Google Scholar). Ald4p and Ald6p function in the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate, which is a key intermediate during fermentation of sugars and growth on ethanol and are consequently important for acetyl-CoA production. In contrast, Ald2p, Ald3p, and Ald5p may not contribute to the oxidation of acetaldehyde in vivo. Therefore, Ald6p is the only cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in the yeast cell. We demonstrate here that Ald6p is degraded preferentially by autophagy and that reduction of Ald6p may improve viability rates under nitrogen starvation. Yeast Strains and Media—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Standard techniques were used for yeast manipulation (17Bruke D. Dawson D. Stearn T.

This strategy incorporated novel BamHI and XhoI sites into the resulting DNA fragment, which was then cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to yield pJO1. To create the Ald6p-GFP genome integration vector (pJO-402), novel XbaI sites were added to the terminator sequence (0.5 kb) of ALD6 by genomic PCR amplification using the following primers: 5′-GCTCTAGATGTACCAACCTGCATTTCTTTC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACGAAGAAGGATGTTATTATATG-3′. Novel XhoI and BamHI sites were added to the ALD6 promoter region (0.3 kb) and the ALD6 open reading frame lacking the stop codon (1.5 kb) by genomic PCR amplification using the following primers: 5′-CGCTCGAGCACCGACCATGTGGGCAAATTC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCAACTTAATTCTGACAGCTTTTAC-3′. BamHI sites were added to the open reading frame of modified GFP (S65T) lacking the initiation codon by PCR amplification using the following primers: 5′-CGCGGATCCGGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTCACTGG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTTACTTGTATAGTTCATCCATG-3′. The resulting DNA fragments were cloned into the pRS306 integration vector (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to yield pJO402. To create the Ald6p overexpression construct (pJO203), XhoI and BamHI sites were added to a sequence containing the ALD6 open reading frame (1.5 kb), the promoter region (0.3 kb), and the terminator sequence (0.5 kb) by genomic PCR amplification using the following primers: 5′-CCGCTCGAGCACCGACCATGTGGGCAAATTC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCGAAGAAGGATGTTATTATATGATCTC-3′. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pRS426 multicopy plasmid (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to yield pJO203. A QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create the Ald6pC306S mutant overexpression construct (pJO213). To generate pJO213, the pJO203 plasmid was amplified by PCR with the following primers: 5′-AGAACGCTGGTCAAATTTCTTCCTCTGGTT-3′ and 5′-AACCAGAGGAAGAAATTTGACCAGCGTTCT-3′. The site of mutagenesis in pJO213 was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Two-dimensional PAGE and Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—The lysates were prepared by breaking yeast cells with glass beads in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was desalted with NAP-10™ (Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce), and 300 μg of each lysate was applied to the gel. Isoelectric focusing was performed with IPGphor™ (Amersham Biosciences) and a 13 cm Immobiline™ DryStrip pH 4–7 (Amersham Biosciences) as described (19Görg A. Obermaier C. Boguth G. Harder A. Scheibe B. Wildgruber R. Weiss W. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1037-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). The gel strip was subjected to SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide), and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The protein spots were picked, washed with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated with acetonitrile, and dried in an evaporator. The spots were digested in the gel with 0.5 mg/ml of trypsin (Promega) in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 12 h at 30 °C. The digested peptides were extracted from the gel with 10% formic acid and 50% acetonitrile and desalted with the ZipTip™ C-18 (Millipore). The samples were mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (Fluka) in a 2:1 ratio and were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, REFLEX III (Bruker). The proteins were identified by searching the ProFound data base (www.129.85.19.192/). Antibodies—Ald6p-specific antibodies were prepared as follows. The pJO1 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli (DH5α), and transformants were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of 0.6. Recombinant protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for an additional 6 h at 37 °C. The recombinant protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and simultaneously stained with gel code (Pierce). The protein band was excised from the gel and eluted with an electric current. The eluted protein-dye complex was used to immunize rabbits. Anti-Ald4p/6p antibodies were purchased from Rockland. Anti-ADH antibodies have been described previously (9Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Anti-PGK antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes. Anti-aminopeptidase I (API) antibodies were our laboratory stock. Immunoblotting of Total Cell Lysates—Whole cell lysates were prepared by disrupting cells with glass beads in lysis buffer. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described (20Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Pulse-Chase Experiments—The cells were cultured in YPD medium to an A600 of 1.0 at 30 °C and were then washed twice and suspended in SD(-N) medium. The cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min by adding 1 MBq of [35S]methionine/1 A600 unit and chased by adding 0.004% methionine and 0.003% cysteine at 30 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (21Ishihara N. Hamasaki M. Yokota S. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Kihara A. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3690-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Light Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Delta Vision microscope (Applied Precision) as described (22Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation and Proteinase K Protection Assay—Yeast cells were converted to spheroplasts by treatment with 25 unit/ml of Zymolyase-100T (Seikagaku Corporation). The spheroplast lysates were separated into cell fractions as described previously (21Ishihara N. Hamasaki M. Yokota S. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Kihara A. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3690-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To examine proteinase K sensitivity, each fraction without protease inhibitors was treated with 2 mg/ml proteinase K on ice for 30 min with or without 1% Triton X-100. The samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed once with cold acetone, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Determination of Cell Viability—The cell viability was measured by phloxine B (final concentration 2 μg/ml) stain, and fluorescence microscopy was measured with a blue filter. Brightly fluorescent cells were counted as dead cells (2Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Screen for Proteins Reduced under Nitrogen Starvation—We investigated the expression profiles of soluble proteins before and after nitrogen starvation using two-dimensional PAGE. Using this method, we expected to be able to identify cellular proteins whose levels decreased during nitrogen starvation. The yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium, were harvested at mid logarithmic phase (A600 = 1.0), and were washed twice with starvation medium. The cells were then transferred to SD(-N) medium and incubated for 24 h. We chose a long stress period of 24 h to observe obvious differences in protein expression; importantly, most of the cells were still viable at this time point (2Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Major protein spots on the gel were identified by the peptide mass fingerprinting method using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In both wild-type (SEY6210) and autophagy-defective Δatg7/apg7 (KVY118) yeast cells, most proteins showed little change after starvation (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4). However, several proteins showed increased levels after starvation, including stress-induced protein, heat shock protein, and quenching enzyme of reactive oxygen species (data not shown). Cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald6p) exhibited the most apparent decrease during starvation in wild-type cells (Fig. 1A, lane 5). Therefore, we focused on this protein for further analysis. Proteins Required for the Reduction of Ald6p under Nitrogen Starvation—Using immunoblot analyses, we attempted to determine which proteins are required for the reduction of Ald6p. In wild-type cells (SEY6210), the amount of Ald6p decreased in a nearly linear manner and was ultimately reduced to 18% of the original level after 24 h of starvation (Fig. 1B). In contrast, Ald6p levels decreased only slightly in Δatg7 mutant cells (KVY118). We next investigated whether the amount of Ald6p was reduced in various yeast strains that are defective in various steps of autophagy. Δatg7 (KVY118), Δatg17/apg17 (JOY617), and all Δatg/apg mutant cells tested showed a similar defect in the loss of Ald6p (parts shown in Fig. 1C, lanes 1–6). The decrease of Ald6p also required Ypt7p, a protein that is essential for the fusion of autophagosomes to vacuoles (20Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), and Pep4p, vacuolar proteinase A (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 2, and 7–10). The selective transport of vacuolar enzymes (via the Cvt pathway), such as API and α-mannosidase, is known to utilize all of the Apg/Atg proteins except Atg17p (6Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 23Khalfan W.A. Klionsky D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Atg11p/Cvt9p and Atg19p/Cvt19p function only in the Cvt vesicle formation and do not play a role in autophagosome formation (24Kim J. Kamada Y. Stromhaug P.E. Guan J. Hefner-Gravink A. Baba M.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In Δatg11 (JOY69) and Δatg19 mutant cells, Ald6p was reduced in a manner similar to that of wild-type cells under nitrogen starvation (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 2, 11, and 12; data for Δatg19 not shown). As expected, another system of vacuolar transport, the Vid pathway (6Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 11Hoffman M. Chiang H.L. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Hung G.G. Elco C.P. Chiang H.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 655-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was not involved in this phenomenon (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 2, 13, and 14). One mutant allele of the proteasome subunit PRE1 is pre1-1, which is frequently used for the following reasons: the pre1-1 mutation causes a defect in the degradation of short-lived proteins, ubiquitinated proteins (27Heinemeyer W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Saidowsky J. Escher C. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 28Heinemeyer W. Gruhler A. Mohrle V. Mahe Y. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5115-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and N-end rule substrates (29Richter-Ruoff B. Heinemeyer W. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) at 30 °C. In pre1-1 mutant cells (WCG4–11a), Ald6p was decreased similarly to wild-type cells (WCG4a) under nitrogen starvation, indicating that Ald6p is not a substrate for proteasome-mediated degradation (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these mutant studies indicate that the reduction of Ald6p requires all of the Atg/Apg proteins and the processes of vacuolar proteolysis. However, Atg/Cvt proteins, Vid proteins, and proteasomal degradation are not involved in this phenomenon. Reduced Ald6p Levels Implied a Rapid Degradation under Nitrogen Starvation—We hypothesized that the decrease in Ald6p levels was the result of rapid degradation during nitrogen starvation. To examine this possibility, the kinetics of Ald6p degradation was measured by pulse-chase experiments. Wild-type (SEY6210) and Δatg7 (KVY118) cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine and chased with cold methionine and cysteine for 0, 3, 6, and 9 h. In wild-type cells, the Ald6p was rapidly degraded and was barely detectable after 6 h of chase (Fig. 2). In contrast, the degradation rate of Ald6p was clearly slower in Δatg7 mutant cells. In addition, ADH, a known nonselective marker of autophagy (9Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), did not show rapid degradation like Ald6p (Fig. 2). The reduction of Ald6p levels implied a rapid degradation dependent on Atg7p during nitrogen starvation. These results suggest that Ald6p is transported to the vacuole and degraded much more rapidly than typical cytosolic proteins. Visualization of Ald6p under Nitrogen Starvation—The process of Ald6p vacuolar transport was visualized by expressing physiological levels of an Ald6p-GFP fusion protein from the authentic ALD6 promoter. Upon starvation, the vacuoles gradually became fluorescent. In addition, in Δpep4 cells (JOY6005), many bright dots, which were presumably autophagic bodies, were observed moving around in the vacuole (Fig. 3). In Δpep4 Δatg7 double mutant cells (JOY6006), no fluorescence was observed in the vacuoles, but rather, the cytosol was evenly stained (Fig. 3). Because Ald6p-GFP was transported to the vacuole in autophagic bodies during nitrogen starvation, we hypothesized that transport of Ald6p from the cytosol to the vacuole occurred via the autophagosome. Ald6p Was Preferentially Transported to the Vacuole via the Autophagosome—We previously reported that Δypt7 cells accumulate autophagosomes in the cytosol under nitrogen starvation (20Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Using proform of API as a selective cargo marker of autophagosomes, Ishihara et al. (21Ishihara N. Hamasaki M. Yokota S. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Kihara A. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3690-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) showed the low speed pellet (P13) fraction enriches the autophagosomes. So next we studied the behavior of Ald6p in Δypt7 cells (KVY4). Under growing conditions proform of API was exclusively resided in the high speed supernatant (S100), but under nitrogen starvation conditions a significant portion was recovered in the P13 fraction as reported (Ref. 21Ishihara N. Hamasaki M. Yokota S. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Kihara A. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3690-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar and Fig. 4A). Similarly Ald6p was recovered in the P13 fraction only under nitrogen starvation condition (Fig. 4A). This fraction completely diminished in Δypt7 Δatg1/apg1 mutant (YAK1; Fig. 4B, lanes 5–8), indicating that a certain amount of Ald6p is in the autophagosomes. As shown in Fig. 4D, Ald6p and proform of API in P13 fraction were resistant to proteinase K treatment but were digested in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. This also supported the possibility that Ald6p is sequestered into autophagosomes. We also quantified the amount of Ald6p in the P13 fraction. Proform of API forms one or a few large complex named the Cvt complex in the cytosol and is taken up by an autophagosome at once (31Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PGK is shown to be distributed evenly in the autophagosome, autophagic bodies, and cytosol (9Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, Ald6p translocated to the P13 fraction much more efficiently than PGK (recovery in P13 fraction; Ald6p = 38.2 ± 2.1% n = 5; PGK = 14.9 ± 1.5% n = 5; Fig. 4C) but less than proform of API (67.2 ± 5.9% n = 5). Taken together, we concluded that Ald6p is preferentially sequestered into autophagosome, possibly in a manner different from the substrates for the Cvt pathway. Ald6p Enzymatic Activity May Be Disadvantageous during Nitrogen Starvation—Next, we examined the physiological relevance of the preferential degradation of Ald6p during nitrogen starvation. Autophagy-defective mutants cannot maintain viability under long span nitrogen starvation (2Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Δatg7 Δald6 mutant (JOY676) cells also started to die after 2 days of nitrogen starvation, but its viability decreased more slowly than that of Δatg7 mutant cells (KVY118; Fig. 5A). The viability of Atg+ Δald6 cells (JOY66) also improved slightly from that of wild-type cells (Atg+ALD6; SEY6210) under nitrogen starvation. However, disruption of mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald4p), Atg+ald4 (JOY64), and Δatg7 Δald4 (JOY674) cells had no effect on the viabilities of wild-type (SEY6210) and Δatg7 (KVY118) cells, respectively (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, wild-type cells (Atg+) expressing Ald6p via multicopy plasmid showed a defect in the maintenance of viability during nitrogen starvation (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that abundant Ald6p causes the decrease of viability, and the absence of Ald6p improves viability under nitrogen starvation. We next asked whether Ald6p enzymatic activity or the protein molecule itself is harmful to the cell under nitrogen starvation. To address it we constructed an inactive Ald6p mutant. Farres et al. (32Farres J. Wang T.T. Cunningham S.J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) isolated recombinant ALDH2C302S from rat liver mitochondrial class-2 aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). Rat ALDH2-Cys302 is an active site residue whose thiol group binds to the aldehyde group of the substrate. Ald6p-Cys306, which corresponds to Rat ALDH2-Cys302, was changed to a serine residue by site-directed mutagenesis. It was confirmed that the mutant form of Ald6p lost completely NADP+- and Mg2+-dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity (data not shown). Overexpression of Ald6pC306S in Atg+ and Δatg7 cells had no effect on viabilities of Atg+ Δald6 and Δatg7 Δald6, respectively (Fig. 5D). These results indicate that the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity of cytosolic Ald6p may have a disadvantageous effect on the survival of yeast cells during nitrogen starvation. We surveyed the changes of soluble proteins before and after nitrogen starvation using two-dimensional PAGE. One protein, Ald6p, showed a clear reduction, which was dependent on Atg/Apg proteins, under nitrogen starvation for 24 h (Fig. 1). Previous morphological studies have indicated that autophagy degrades about 2% of the cytosol/h in yeast (9Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 10Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Scott et al. (33Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) showed by [35S]methionine pulse-chase experiments that the rate of vacuolar delivery of cytosolic Pho8Δ60p by autophagy was 4%/h during the initial6hof nitrogen starvation. Autophagy proceeds linearly during the first 6 h of starvation and then gradually slows (33Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We know that both diploid and haploid cells induce autophagy in sporulation medium, 2% potassium acetate (10Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). In a previous report, Betz and Weiser (34Betz H. Weiser U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that protein degradation in haploid cells occurred at a slower rate than in diploid cells in sporulation medium. Diploid cells degraded 2.5% of the cellular protein/h in sporulation medium (34Betz H. Weiser U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that most proteins should not decrease below 70% of their original levels because of autophagy, even after 24 h of starvation. In wild-type cells, the amount of Ald6p was reduced to 18% of the initial level after 24 h of nitrogen starvation (Fig. 1B). This large decrease in Ald6p levels reflects preferential autophagic degradation. The result shown in Fig. 4C indicates that the specificity of Ald6p degradation may be achieved by a step of sequestration to the autophagosome. Suzuki et al. (22Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 31Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) indicated that the vacuolar targeting of the proform of API (via the Cvt pathway) required localization with the preautophagosomal structure, which plays a central role in autophagosome formation. In both Δatg11/cvt9 and Δatg19/cvt19 mutant cells, the proform of API localized to the cytosol away from the preautophagosomal structure and was not targeted to the vacuole (31Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Shintani T. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It was expected that Atg11p and Atg19p would be membrane receptors for the proform of API (24Kim J. Kamada Y. Stromhaug P.E. Guan J. Hefner-Gravink A. Baba M. Scott S.V. Ohsumi Y. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 25Scott S.V. Guan J. Hutchins M.U. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, Ald6p degradation was not dependent on Atg11p (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 2, 11, and 12) and Atg19p (data not shown). During nitrogen starvation, the half-life (t½) of Ald6p was 100 min (Fig. 2), and the half-life of API was 30 min (6Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Ald6p is not likely to be a cargo of the general Cvt pathway. One factor contributing to protein targeting is the existence of a membrane receptor; it is possible that the selective sequestration of Ald6p is mediated by a yet unknown molecule(s) on the autophagosome. Further studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying targeted autophagy are now in progress to investigate these possibilities. To address the physiological significance of this selective degradation, we analyzed the viability of Δald6 or ALD6 overexpressing cells. We have demonstrated that Ald6p enzymatic activity might be disadvantageous for the survival of yeast cells during nitrogen starvation (Fig. 5). Brejning and Jespersen (36Brejning J. Jespersen L. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2002; 75: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have previously reported that Ald6p levels increased during lag phase, the first hours after inoculation of the culture. Meaden et al. (13Meaden P.G. Dickinson F.M. Mifsud A. Tessier W. Westwater J. Bussey H. Midgley M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that the growth of Δald6 mutant cells is slower than that of wild-type cells in both YPD and synthetic medium. It is known that acetaldehyde dehydrogenase is closely related to lipid biosynthesis through the intermediary of acetyl-CoA synthase and fatty acid synthase in the cytosol. Because lipid biosynthesis is a critical process, the expression of Ald6p would be necessary during growth under nutrient conditions. Why is cytosolic Ald6p acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity harmful under nitrogen starvation conditions? One possible explanations might be that Ald6p may disturb NADPH flux during nitrogen starvation. It is well known that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf1p; glucose-6-phosphate + NADP+ → 6-phosphogluconolactone + NADPH) is the greatest contributor to the reduction of NADP+ in the yeast cell. Grabowska and Chelstowska (37Grabowska D. Chelstowska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13984-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that Δald6 Δzwf1 double mutant cells are not viable under normal growth conditions or under anaerobic growth conditions even in the presence of glutathione. It is suggested that Ald6p plays an important role in maintaining a high rate of NADPH/NADP+ cycling in the yeast cell. However, upon nitrogen starvation, both fatty acid and deoxyribonucleoside biosynthesis, which consume large amounts of NADPH, shut down immediately (38Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar, 39Murray R.K. Granner D.K. Mayes P.A. Rodwell V.M. Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry. 26th Ed. McGraw-Hill Co., Columbus, OH2003Google Scholar). We speculate that the reduction of NADP+ by Ald6p might be excessive in nitrogen-starved cells. An excessive amount of NADPH might inhibit the enzymatic activity of Zwf1p, which catalyzes the initial reaction of the pentose phosphate pathway. This pathway contributes to the synthesis of ribose-5-phosphate, which is an essential material for the generation of some amino acids and ribonucleotides (39Murray R.K. Granner D.K. Mayes P.A. Rodwell V.M. Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry. 26th Ed. McGraw-Hill Co., Columbus, OH2003Google Scholar). Ald4p, the mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, utilizes mainly NAD+ as a co-enzyme (14Tessier W.D. Meaden P.G. Dickinson F.M. Midgley M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is induced during nitrogen starvation (38Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar). In our experiments, Δatg7 Δald4 mutant cells were not able to maintain high rates of viability like Δatg7 Δald6 cells (Fig. 5B). It is likely that the down-regulation of Ald6p by preferential autophagic degradation may optimize NADPH/NADP+ levels in the cytosol. Thus, Ald6p may have a bilateral character: it is beneficial in growth under nutrient conditions but disadvantageous to survival under nitrogen starvation. Here, we show that Ald6p is one example of a preferential substrate for autophagic degradation. Ald6p was the only major protein on the two-dimensional PAGE gel to decrease during starvation; however, it is still possible that other minor proteins behave like Ald6p. If we are able to find such proteins, it would help clarify the molecular mechanisms of selective autophagy and the physiological significance of the preferential degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2039974624,"Apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor (AATF), also termed Che-1, was identified as interacting protein of Dlk/ZIP kinase and RNA polymerase II, respectively. Che-1 has additionally been shown to bind Rb, thereby activating transcription factor E2F and promoting cell cycle progression. Moreover, AATF enhances steroid receptor-mediated transactivation in a hormone- and dose-dependent manner (Leister, P., Burgdorf, S., and Scheidtmann, K. H., (2003) Signal Transduction 3, 18–25). These data suggest that AATF exerts its functions through interaction with different transcription factors. In search of novel interaction partners of AATF, we identified the tumor susceptibility gene product TSG101, which had also been recognized as a co-regulator of nuclear hormone receptors. Interestingly, TSG101 and AATF functioned as cooperative coactivators in androgen receptor-mediated transcription. Because TSG101 was also shown to play a role in regulation of ubiquitin conjugation, we asked whether its coactivating function might be linked to ubiquitination. Indeed, TSG101 enhanced monoubiquitination of the androgen receptor in a ligand-dependent manner, and this correlated with enhanced transactivating capacity. Furthermore, a dominant-negative mutant of ubiquitin preventing polyubiquitination also stimulated androgen receptor-mediated transcription, which in this case could not be enhanced by TSG101. We propose that TSG101 activates androgen receptor-induced transcription by transient stabilization of the monoubiquitinated state, thus revealing a novel regulatory mechanism for nuclear receptors.

Lödige I. Kögel D. Scheidtmann K.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Dlk/ZIP kinase, in turn, is a member of the death-associated protein kinase family that plays a role in different processes like apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 2Kögel D. Prehn J.H. Scheidtmann K.H. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and mitosis (3Preuss U. Landsberg G. Scheidtmann K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). AATF was shown to interfere with Dlk-induced apoptosis, thus explaining its name (1Page G. Lödige I. Kögel D. Scheidtmann K.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). AATF is conserved from yeast to man, suggesting that it fulfills an important function. Indeed, the mouse ortholog (termed traube) has been shown to play an essential role in early embryogenesis (4Thomas T. Voss A.K. Petrou P. Gruss P. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 324-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, the human ortholog of AATF (termed Che-1) was independently identified as an interacting protein of the RNA polymerase II, subunit 11, and the tumor-suppressor protein Rb (5Fanciulli M. Bruno T. Di Padova M. De Angelis R. Iezzi S. Iacobini C. Floridi A. Passananti C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 904-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This latter interaction releases the repression function of Rb on E2F-mediated transcription, presumably by displacing histone deacetylase-1 from the Rb·E2F complex, thereby promoting cell cycle progression (6Bruno T. De Angelis R. De Nicola F. Barbato C. Di Padova M. Corbi N. Libri V. Benassi B. Mattei E. Chersi A. Soddu S. Floridi A. Passananti C. Fanciulli M. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, AATF/Che-1 appears to play a role in cell cycle control. Consistent with this assumption is its down-regulation upon TGF-β-induced differentiation (7Lindfors K. Halttunen T. Huotari P. Nupponen N. Vihinen M. Visakorpi T. Maki M. Kainulainen H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The AATF protein has a modular structure. At its N terminus it contains an acidic region that is characteristic of several transcription factors, such as VP16 or BRCA-1. In its C-terminal half, it contains three highly conserved regions, the significance of which is not known. Furthermore, AATF contains a leucine zipper and three LXXLL motifs, the latter of which are characteristic interaction motifs of coactivators for nuclear hormone receptors (8Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). Nuclear hormone receptors (NR) comprise a large family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that play a role in diverse physiological processes like cell cycle control, differentiation, and apoptosis. They are classified into three classes. Class I includes the classical steroid hormone receptors (androgen, estrogen, glucocorticoid, progesterone, and mineralocorticoid receptor), class II receptors comprise non-steroid hormone receptors (thyroid, vitamin D, and retinoic acid receptor), and class III are the so-called orphan receptors for which the ligands or functions have yet to be identified. One of the best studied examples is the androgen receptor (AR). Like other members of the NR superfamily, AR contains four conserved functional domains: an N-terminal ligand-independent transactivation domain AF-1 (activation function 1), a central DNA-binding domain (DBD), a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) containing the ligand-dependent transactivation domain (AF-2), and a hinge region connecting the LBD and the DBD. In the absence of hormone, AR is kept inactive in the cytoplasm by complex formation with HSP90. After activation by testosterone, AR is translocated to the promoter or enhancer regions of target genes where it can activate transcription (for reviews, see Refs. 9Weigel N.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar and 10Beato M. Klug J. Hum. Reprod. Update. 2000; 6: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that NRs mediate their function by the recruitment of coregulators (coactivators or corepressors). These coregulators are involved in modification and remodeling of chromatin, and they facilitate the interaction between transcriptional activators and the general transcription machinery. Thus, several histone acetyl transferases and methyl transferases like SRC-1/p160, p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein, or CARM-1, respectively, have been identified as coactivators of NR, whereas corepressors exhibit or recruit histone deacetylase activity (reviewed in Refs. 11Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 12Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 13McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Many coactivators can interact directly with the LBD of activated receptors via an LXXLL signature motif (8Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 14Heery D.M. Hoare S. Hussain S. Parker M.G. Sheppard H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6695-6702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). AATF contains three LXXLL motifs. A recent investigation on their significance revealed that AATF can indeed directly interact with NRs and enhance NR-mediated transactivation in a hormone-dependent manner (15Leister P. Burgdorf S. Scheidtmann K.H. Signal Transduction. 2003; 3: 17-25Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, AATF behaved like a bona fide coactivator of NR. Together with the data on Rb-E2F, these findings suggest that AATF exerts its functions through interaction with different transcription factors and may, in fact, be a more general coactivator of transcription. In search of further interaction partners of AATF, we identified the TSG101 (tumor susceptibility gene 101) protein as a putative complex partner. TSG101 was originally identified by random gene inactivation to isolate putative tumor suppressor proteins (16Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Inactivation of tsg101 led to malignant transformation of NIH3T3 cells. However, tsg101 might also have a growth-promoting function as suggested from different knock-out models. tsg101 knock-out mice die by day 6.5 and fail to induce mesoderm upon gastrulation (17Ruland J. Sirard C. Elia A. MacPherson D. Wakeham A. Li L. de la Pompa J.L. Cohen S.N. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cells derived from knock-out embryos exhibit a dramatic decrease in proliferation, presumably due to accumulation of p53 and p21 (17Ruland J. Sirard C. Elia A. MacPherson D. Wakeham A. Li L. de la Pompa J.L. Cohen S.N. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and inhibition of CDK2 activity (18Krempler A. Henry M.D. Triplett A.A. Wagner K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43216-43223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These data can be explained by recent findings showing that TSG101 is included in the MDM2-p53 regulatory circuit. The levels of MDM2 and p53 are tightly balanced: MDM2 is a target gene of p53, which in turn is targeted by MDM2 for degradation through its ubiquitin ligase activity (reviewed in Ref. 19Lohrum M.A. Vousden K.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 197-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). TSG101 stabilizes MDM2, which then leads to down-regulation of p53 (20Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Consequently, loss of TSG101 would result in up-regulation of p53. Stabilization of MDM2 by TSG101 seems to be due to inhibition of ubiquitination (20Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that TSG101 might play a regulatory role in the ubiquitin system (21Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Ponting C.P. Cai Y.D. Bork P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Initial studies on the biochemical function(s) of TSG101 revealed an interaction with nuclear hormone receptors and down-modulation of their transactivation activities (23Sun Z. Pan J. Hope W.X. Cohen S.N. Balk S.P. Cancer. 1999; 86: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5380-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 25Watanabe M. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More recent investigations, however, point to a role in ubiquitination-dependent processes. TSG101 contains at its N terminus a region with high homology to ubiquitin conjugases. However, the cysteine residue in the active center, which normally mediates the covalent linkage to ubiquitin, is replaced by tyrosine. Therefore, TSG101 was proposed to be a dominant negative regulator of ubiquitination (21Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Ponting C.P. Cai Y.D. Bork P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The findings that TSG101 stabilizes proteins like MDM2 and p21 are consistent with this idea (20Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26Oh H. Mammucari C. Nenci A. Cabodi S. Cohen S.N. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5430-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, TSG101 has been implicated in protein sorting and virus budding, both of which include ubiquitination events (27Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 28Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 29Myers E.L. Allen J.F. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11226-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we identified TSG101 as an interaction partner of AATF. Because both TSG101 and AATF have individually been characterized as coregulators of nuclear hormone receptors, we investigated a possible functional relationship of these proteins. Both AATF and TSG101 functioned as synergistic coactivators of the AR. Furthermore, we investigated a possible link between ubiquitin-related functions of TSG101 and transcription. Interestingly, TSG101 enhanced monoubiquitination of the AR, and this modification correlated with transcriptional activation. We propose that TSG101 stimulates androgen receptor-induced transcription by promoting its monoubiquitination, thus revealing a novel regulatory mechanism for nuclear receptors. Plasmids—For the yeast two-hybrid screen, fragments of AATF cDNA (encoding amino acids 396–523 or 447–523) were cloned into pGBT9 (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). For expression of fusion proteins bearing the GAL4 transactivation domain, inserts were cloned into pGAD424 (Clontech). For the expression and purification of GST fusion proteins, TSG101 was cloned into pGEX-6T (Amersham Biosciences). For expression studies, TSG101 was cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). A plasmid encoding the AR under the control of the SV40 promoter (SV-AR0) was kindly provided by A. Brinkmann (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). An expression vector for human TSG101 was kindly provided by S. Cohen (Stanford University). For transient expression assays, AATF and rat TSG101 were cloned into pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), thereby adding a FLAG-tag to the N terminus. Expression plasmids for His6-tagged ubiquitin (H6M-Ub) and the dominant negative ubiquitin mutant (H6M-UbK48R) were a kind gift from R. Kopito (Stanford University). All cloning experiments were performed using standard methods. Expression plasmid encoding E2F and E2F-responsive cdc25 promoter-luciferase reporter construct were a kind gift from K. Helin, Milan, Italy. Expression plasmids encoding rat p53 and p53-responsive mdm2 promoter-luciferase reporter were described previously (30Lohrum M. Scheidtmann K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2527-2539PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid system (Clontech) with the yeast strain AH109 was used in this study. A total of 8.6 × 105 colonies was screened as described before (31Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The cDNA insert of the positive clones was amplified by PCR using the whole cell yeast PCR kit (Qbiogene, Grünberg, Germany) and 5′-CCAAACCCAAAAATGGAGATCGAATTC-3′ and 5′-CTAGAGTCGACCCGGGCTCGA-3′ as primers and analyzed by sequence analysis (AG-OWA, Berlin, Germany). Isolation of Full-length Rat TSG101—Total RNA was isolated from rat fibroblast cell line REF52.2 using the Qiagen RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse-transcribed using the Super-script II RT (Invitrogen). Rat TSG101 was then amplified by PCR from the cDNA using 5′-GCACTAGAATTCATGGCGGTGTCCGAGAG-3′ and 5′-GAGCTTGTCGACTCAGTAGAGGTCACTAAGGCC-3′ as primers. The resulting PCR product was verified by sequence analysis. In Vitro Binding Assays—GST pull-down assays were performed using full-length TSG101 fused to GST as binding matrix and in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled AATF. GST·TSG101 was expressed in Escherichia coli M15 and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. In vitro translation of AATF was performed in the TNT-T7/T3-coupled reticulocyte translation system (Promega). Binding of AATF was carried out in phosphate lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm leupeptin,) at 4 °C for 3 h. Thereafter, the beads were washed twice with phosphate lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 2 × SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection—REF52.2, CV1 and Rat-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom Seromed, Berlin, Germany). MCF-7 (human breast carcinoma) and PC3 (human prostate carcinoma) cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were carried out either by calcium phosphate coprecipitation, as for Rat-1, or by lipofection with jetPEI (QBiogene) (MCF-7 and PC3) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) (REF52.2 and CV1) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed again, and permeabilized and blocked in 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% dry milk, and 1% goat serum in PBS for 1 h. Cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against TSG101 (sc-7964; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:500) for 1 h, washed again, and incubated with goat anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) (1:500) for 30 min. 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining was performed with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 15 min. The subcellular distribution of expressed proteins was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy with an Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Transactivation Assays—For transactivation assays, 2 × 105 cells were plated on 35-mm Petri dishes and transfected with the indicated amounts of reporter construct, bearing the luciferase gene driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, and expression plasmids. The total amount of transfected DNA was balanced by supplementing with pCMV-Tag2B empty expression vector. After transfection, cells were treated with 10 nm dihydrotestosterone for another 16 h. Induced cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer (100 mm KHPO4, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Luciferase activity was determined in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tricine, 1 mm MgCO3, 2.6 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 470 μm D-luciferin, and 530 μm ATP and measured in a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). All transactivation experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—Ubiquitinated proteins are rapidly degraded by the proteasome pathway and are therefore difficult to analyze. To circumvent this problem, His-tagged recombinant ubiquitin has been employed. This allows isolation and purification of ubiquitinated proteins on Ni columns under denaturing conditions, that is, upon inactivation of the proteolytic system (32Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Plasmids H6M-Ub encoding His-tagged ubiquitin or H6M-UbK48R, a dominant negative mutant of ubiquitin that cannot be further ubiquitinated (33Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by R. Kopito (Stanford University). Plasmids were introduced into MCF-7 cells by cotransfection with plasmids expressing AR and TSG101. 16 h after transfection, cells were induced with 10 nm dihydrotestosterone. After another 8 h, 2 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) was added for an additional 16 h. Cells were harvested in denaturing lysis buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8), sonicated on ice for 1 min, and incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h. Thereafter, the beads were washed four times with washing buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.2), eluted with 2 × SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-AR antibody (sc-13062; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Identification of TSG101 as an Interaction Partner of AATF—To identify protein interaction partners of AATF, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using a cDNA library derived from SV40-transformed rat fibroblasts. Because the acidic domain at the N terminus of AATF displays transactivation activity in a Gal4-linked reporter assay in yeast, we employed a C-terminal fragment spanning a region from amino acid 396 to 523 as bait. This fragment contains two of three highly conserved sequence stretches, CR2 and CR3, and includes one of three LXXLL NR interaction motifs (7Lindfors K. Halttunen T. Huotari P. Nupponen N. Vihinen M. Visakorpi T. Maki M. Kainulainen H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), thus providing a suitable bait for two-hybrid screening. One of the putative interaction partners isolated was TSG101. TSG101 was originally identified by random gene targeting as a gene whose inactivation leads to malignant transformation (16Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Isolation of the plasmid encoding the GAL4 AD·TSG101 fusion protein and its retransformation together with the bait plasmid into yeast cells confirmed the interaction. The portion of rat TSG101 isolated from the cDNA library comprised the C-terminal part from amino acids 191 to 391 as deduced from sequence comparison with human TSG101. The full-length clone of the rat ortholog was obtained by PCR. Elucidation of the complete coding sequence predicted a 391-amino acid protein with 97% sequence identity with mouse and 92.6% identity with human TSG101 at the amino acid level, indicating that this protein is highly conserved. Even the yeast homolog Vps23p still displays a similarity of 34%. The complete sequence of rat TSG101 cDNA is available under GenBank™ accession number AY293306. Rat TSG101 contained all structural motifs that were elucidated for human TSG101, an N-terminal region with homology to ubiquitin conjugases (termed Ubc region), a proline-rich region, and a coiled coil motif, including a leucine zipper in the central part, and a C-terminal α-helical domain, including a so-called steadiness box (34Feng G.H. Lih C.J. Cohen S.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1736-1741PubMed Google Scholar) (see scheme in Fig. 1A). The interaction of AATF and TSG101 was confirmed in vitro by a GST pull-down experiment with full-length TSG101 expressed as GST fusion protein in E. coli and radiolabeled in vitro translated AATF. GST was used as negative control. AATF bound to the fusion protein, but not to GST, as shown in Fig. 1B. Interaction between AATF and TSG101 Is Mediated by Their C-terminal Regions—To determine the interaction regions between the two proteins, deletion mutants of both AATF and TSG101 were constructed as shown in Fig. 2A and tested for interaction in the two-hybrid system. The AATF construct originally used as bait implied that the interaction domain resided in the C-terminal region of AATF (residues 396–523). This conclusion was verified by employing this C-terminal fragment of AATF with constructs of TSG101 in the interaction assay (Fig. 2B). Further deletion of AATF to residue 446 still allowed interaction of the two proteins (data not shown), thus narrowing the interaction domain to the C-terminal 80 residues. Likewise, the portion of TSG101 isolated as two-hybrid clone, comprising residues 191–391, indicated that the interaction with AATF was mediated with the C-terminal half. Accordingly, we created additional mutants in which the N-terminal 235 or 317 residues were deleted. All these constructs, including full-length wild-type TSG101, were able to bind AATF (Fig. 2B), indicating that TSG101 also interacts with its C-terminal part (the last 74 residues) comprising the α-helical domain. To verify this conclusion, deletion mutants lacking the putative interaction domains were employed in the two-hybrid interaction assay. As expected, these truncated proteins did not interact, neither AATF (1–390) with full-length TSG101 nor TSG101 (1–326) with full-length AATF (Fig. 2C). Thus, although both proteins contain a leucine zipper, their interaction is mediated by their C termini. AATF Is Able to Recruit TSG101 to the Nucleus—Next we investigated whether both proteins would colocalize in intact cells. AATF is a nuclear protein (1Page G. Lödige I. Kögel D. Scheidtmann K.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas TSG101 has been localized to different compartments. It was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, partially associated with Golgi (35Xie W. Li L. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1595-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and endosomes (28Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), but showed also some nuclear accumulation during S and G2 phases (35Xie W. Li L. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1595-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 36Zhong Q. Chen Y. Jones D. Lee W.H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2699-2702PubMed Google Scholar). TSG101 was expressed as GFP-tagged fusion protein, and its subcellular localization was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3, GFP·TSG101 displayed a punctuate staining in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, left panels). Similar patterns were seen by others (28Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 36Zhong Q. Chen Y. Jones D. Lee W.H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2699-2702PubMed Google Scholar). This staining pattern was reminiscent of endosomes. To verify this assumption, we performed an endosome uptake experiment in which cells were incubated with Texas Red-labeled ovalbumin. Upon pinocytosis, ovalbumin is translocated to the endosomal compartment and can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy (37Refolo L.M. Sambamurti K. Efthimiopoulos S. Pappolla M.A. Robakis N.K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 694-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, Texas Red-labeled ovalbumin and GFP·TSG101 colocalized to a large extent (Fig. 3A, right panel). A similar distribution was obtained in other cell lines such as REF52.2, HeLa, or Saos-2 cells (data not shown). This subcellular localization of TSG101 is in agreement with a role of TSG101 in endosomal protein sorting (27Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 28Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To examine whether endogenous TSG101 shared the same distribution, cells were stained for immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody against TSG101. Because of low expression levels, this antibody detected TSG101 only in transfected but not in untransfected cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, endogenous TSG101 could not be localized in this way, although it could be detected by Western blotting. However, in the GFP·TSG101-expressing cells, the antibody revealed a diffuse staining of both cytoplasm and nucleus in addition to the punctuate endosome-associated staining ("
https://openalex.org/W2006690354,"Hat1 is the catalytic subunit of the only type B histone acetyltransferase known (HAT-B). The enzyme specifically acetylates lysine 12, and to a lesser extent lysine 5, of free, non-chromatin-bound histone H4. The complex is usually isolated with cytosolic fractions and is thought to be involved in chromatin assembly. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae HAT-B complex also contains Hat2, a protein stimulating Hat1 catalytic activity. We have now identified by two-hybrid experiments Hif1 as both a Hat1- and a histone H4-interacting protein. These interactions were dependent on HAT2, indicating a mediating role for Hat2. Biochemical fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Hif1 is a component of a yeast heterotrimeric HAT-B complex, in which Hat2 bridges Hat1 and Hif1 proteins. In contrast to Hat2, this novel subunit does not appear to regulate Hat1 enzymatic activity. Nevertheless, similarly to Hat1, Hif1 influences telomeric silencing. In a localization analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy on yeast strains expressing tagged versions of Hat1, Hat2, and Hif1, we have found that all three HAT-B proteins are mainly localized in the nucleus. Thus, we propose that the distinction between A- and B-type enzymes should henceforth be based on their capacity to acetylate histones bound to nucleosomes and not on their location within the cell. Finally, by Western blotting assays, we have not detected differences in the in vivo acetylation of H4 lysine 12 (acK12H4) between wild-type and hat1Δ, hat2Δ, or hif1Δ mutant strains, suggesting that the level of HAT-B-dependent acK12H4 may be very low under normal growth conditions.

Acetylation of specific lysine residues in the N termini of nucleosome core histones is a reversible and dynamic process that occurs in all eukaryotic organisms studied and has been correlated with several essential processes, including modulation of gene expression and nucleosome assembly (reviewed in Refs. 1Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 2Marmorstein R. Roth S.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet.

The current view of the mechanism by which acetylation of histones influences different biological processes is that it acts as a signaling system, actively participating in the recognition of and in the interaction with regulatory proteins or other complexes (5Loidl P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Turner B.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 7Tordera V. Sendra R.

It is well established that most HAT 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; GAD, Gal4 activation domain; GBD, DNA-binding domain of Gal4; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; E64, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucyl-amido-(4-guanidino)butane; 3,4-DCI, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin; WCE, whole-cell extract; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ORF, open reading frame; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; GAD, Gal4 activation domain; GBD, DNA-binding domain of Gal4; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; E64, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucyl-amido-(4-guanidino)butane; 3,4-DCI, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin; WCE, whole-cell extract; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ORF, open reading frame; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. enzymes have a marked preference with regard to target histone as well as lysine residue(s). Moreover, all of the native HATs are high molecular mass multiprotein complexes in which the different components are able to modulate substrate preferences (1Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 4Carrozza M.J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Côté J.

Biol. 1999; 10: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). On the basis of structural similarities, histone acetyltransferases are at present classified into distinct families found in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals (1Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 4Carrozza M.J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Côté J.

In addition, on the criteria of subcellular localization, histone preference, and ability to modify nucleosomal histones, native HATs have also been classified into two different groups. Type A HATs (HAT-A) are nuclear enzymes able to acetylate the N termini of the core histones after their assembly into nucleosomes and chromatin and are usually associated with transcription-related acetylation events, whereas type B HATs (HAT-B) are thought to be primarily cytoplasmic enzymes that acetylate only free histones, presumably prior to their deposition on DNA to form nucleosomes. In yeast nine different proteins with HAT activity have been described to date. Eight of them are the catalytic subunit of HAT-A complexes, with physical or functional connections to transcriptional regulation as follows: Gcn5 (11Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R.

The ninth yeast protein with HAT activity is another member of the GNAT superfamily, Hat1 (19Kleff S. Andrulis E.D. Anderson C.W. Sternglanz R. J. Biol.

Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In fact, Hat1 and its homologs from different organisms (21Eberharter A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4427-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are the only type B HATs identified at present. The presence of a type B HAT in yeast was first described in our laboratory as an enzymatic activity obtained from a cytoplasmic fraction with a molecular mass of 130 kDa, specific for histone H4 but unable to accept nucleosomal histones as substrates (25López-Rodas G. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Tordera V. Salvador M.L. Franco L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 239: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26López-Rodas G. Tordera V. Sánchez del Pino M.M. Franco L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3728-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the gene for the catalytic subunit of this HAT was identified (19Kleff S. Andrulis E.D. Anderson C.W. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24674-24677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 20Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Extensive biochemical characterization of the HAT-B enzyme from yeast cytosolic extracts showed that this complex is composed of two subunits, Hat1 as the catalytic subunit and Hat2, a yeast homolog of the mammalian proteins Rbap46 and Rbap48. The molecular mass obtained for this native enzyme (>200 kDa) suggests a subunit composition more complex than a simple heterodimer consisting of one Hat1 and one Hat2 subunit. The complex specifically acetylated lysine 12 of free histone H4, whereas recombinant Hat1 extended its specificity to lysines 5 and 12 of free H4 and, at a lesser extent, to H2A (19Kleff S. Andrulis E.D. Anderson C.W. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24674-24677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 20Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Comparative studies of the HAT-B activity recovered from wild-type and hat2Δ strains showed that in the absence of Hat2 the specific activity of the enzyme is ∼10-fold lower than that from wild-type cells, whereas the specificity toward lysine 12 of H4 remains unchanged. Moreover, the presence of Hat2 was required in vitro for stable binding of Hat1 to the histone H4 tail (20Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). There are several reasons to attribute a role to the HAT-B complex in the acetylation of histones prior to their assembly in nucleosomes. First, HAT-B is unable to acetylate histones when they are in nucleosomes. Second, it has been reported that in the cytoplasm Hat1 and Hat2 proteins together with acetylated forms of histones H4 and H3 interact with the karyopherin Kap123, a receptor implicated in the nuclear import of H4 and H3 (27Mosammaparast N. Guo Y. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 862-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Finally, there is a correlation between the acetylation pattern of newly synthesized histone H4 and the in vitro site specificity of HAT-B complexes. Thus, in all eukaryotic organisms where it has been studied, newly synthesized and deposited nucleosomal histone H4 was shown to be diacetylated on lysine residues 5 and 12, and this non-random pattern of acetylation is highly coincidental to that generated by biochemically isolated native HAT-B enzymes (20Parthun M.R.

Although there is not a strict pattern of acetylation, newly synthesized histone H3 also seems to be involved in chromatin assembly (33Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 34Verreault A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1430-1438PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, at present no cytoplasmic type B HAT specific for free histone H3 has been described. Despite all these data, it has been demonstrated by specific substitution mutations at the N-terminal domain of histone H4 that lysine residues 5 and 12 are not required for nucleosome assembly in vitro or in vivo (35Ma X.-J. Wu J. Altheim B.A. Schultz M.C. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6693-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, the human histone chaperone chromatin assembly factor-1, a protein complex that is thought to selectively target newly synthesized H3 and H4 histones to nascent DNA, binds H3-H4 tetramers lacking their N-terminal tails (36Shibahara K.I. Verreault A. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7766-7771Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, although the acetylation of newly synthesized histones H3 and particularly H4 seems to be conserved, its functional significance remains unknown. In this sense, it is not surprising that the search for a direct phenotype for yeast cells lacking of HAT1 or HAT2 genes has proven elusive. Only recently it has been demonstrated that deletion of HAT1 or HAT2, in combination with specific substitution mutations in the N-terminal tail of histone H3, results in a significant defect in telomeric silencing (37Kelly T.J. Qin S. Gottschling D.E. Parthun M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7051-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a similar combination of the HAT1 deletion and particular lysine residue substitution H3 mutations resulted in sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, demonstrating that Hat1 contributes to the recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks (38Qin S. Pathun M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8353-8365Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). How can an enzyme such as HAT-B (consisting of Hat1 and Hat2) traditionally localized in the cytoplasm play a role in nuclear events such as telomeric silencing or DNA repair? Certainly, biochemical studies on different organisms have previously found type B HATs in cytosolic fractions (20Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E.

However, in distinct species Hat1 has also been detected in the nucleus at specific physiological stages, such as the Xenopus oocyte maturation (23Imhof A. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13085-13093Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), maize germination (24Lusser A. Eberharter A. Loidl A. Goralik-Schramel M. Horngacher M. Haas H. Loidl P.

Biol. 1998; 8: 96-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Moreover, by using a combination of genetics and biochemical approaches, we have detected a yeast nuclear HAT complex, namely HAT-A3, that contains Hat1 and Hat2 (40Ruiz-García A.B. Sendra R. Galiana M. Pamblanco M. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Tordera V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12599-12605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These reports indicate that at least some of Hat1 (and Hat2) is located in the nucleus, possibly associated with other modulating proteins, suggesting that HAT-B complexes may have any other functional roles in addition to marking histones for deposition, although an indirect effect cannot be ruled out. In any case, it seems that some degree of uncertainty has been generated by the absence of a more systematic analysis on the cellular compartmentalization of the type B enzyme. In order to shed some light on these issues, we first undertook a search for proteins, other than Hat2, that bind in vivo to Hat1 and to the N-terminal tail of histone H4. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found a novel protein, Hif1, that is able to interact with both Hat1 and histone H4. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that Hif1 is indeed a member of HAT-B complex in yeast, and hence we have also investigated the involvement of Hif1 in telomeric silencing. In addition, our studies on the subcellular localization of Hif1, Hat1, and Hat2 proteins have shown clearly that the HAT-B complex is mainly nuclear, contrary to the current view. Finally, by Western blotting experiments, we have not found a dependence of the acetylation of histone H4 lysine 12 with HAT-B proteins in vivo. Strains, Plasmids, and Media—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Gene knockouts with kanMX4, natMX4, and his5+ were performed as described (41Wach A. Brachat A. Pölhmann R.

Deletions of the desired loci were verified by PCR on genomic yeast DNA. The hat2::HIS3 mutation in strains YSTT11 and YSTT62 is a deletion-insertion in which 255 bp upstream through nucleotide 804 of the open reading frame of HAT2 were deleted and replaced by HIS3 (originally constructed by P.

HAT1 and HAT2 were tagged with a sequence encoding six copies of the HA epitope followed by Kluyveromyces lactis TRP1 or Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIS3 as selectable markers. HIF1 was tagged with nine tandem repeats of the Myc epitope followed by the TRP1 marker. DNA fragments, with flanking sequences homologous to the desired gene, were amplified from the appropriated template plasmids (a gift from P. M. Alepuz; see Ref. 44Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Correct homologous integration was verified by PCR on isolated genomic DNA. Transformants were also assayed for expression of the desired tagged protein by Western blotting. Strains BQS1228 and BQS1230 were generated from UCC1111 and MPY1, respectively (37Kelly T.J. Qin S. Gottschling D.E. Parthun M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7051-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Plasmid pMP3 ((TRP1 CEN ARS)-HHT2-HHF2) was transformed into these strains and selected on plates lacking tryptophan. Red colonies, due to the loss of the pRS412-derivative plasmid, were selected. BQS1232 and BQS1234 strains expressing the K9R,K14R allele of histone H3 were produced similarly but with the pMP72 ((TRP1 CEN ARS)-HHT2-(K9,14R)-HHF2) plasmid instead of pMP3. Plasmids pMP3 and pMP72 were the gifts from M. Parthun. The bait plasmid pSTT20, encoding LexA-Hat1, was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment with the entire Hat1 coding sequence into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of a derivative of the vector, pBTM116 (45Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The bait plasmid pGBD-H4-(1–59) and plasmid libraries used in the two-hybrid screening were described previously (46Pamblanco M. Poveda A. Sendra R. Rodríguez-Navarro S. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Tordera V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The HIF1 gene was cloned from the genome into a derivative of pBR322 to create pSTT40. This was used to construct plasmid pSTT65, which contains the sequence coding for residues 8–385 of Hif1 fused in-frame with GAD in the vector pGAD424. Growth of yeast cells was performed on standard yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) or synthetic complete (SC) media supplemented as required. Manipulation of cells and media preparation were performed according to standard procedures. Two-hybrid Analyses—Two-hybrid screening with the bait plasmid pSTT20 (pLexA-Hat1) was performed in strain L40 as described previously (47Park H. Sternglanz R. Yeast. 1999; 15: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid screening with the bait plasmid pGBD-H4-(1–59) was carried out with the strain PJ69-4A (48James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (46Pamblanco M. Poveda A. Sendra R. Rodríguez-Navarro S. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Tordera V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). DNA of pGAD plasmids from those positive clones that arose on a medium lacking adenine and histidine and having β-galactosidase activity were purified and amplified. The presence of an ORF fused in-frame to GAD was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Effect of a HAT2 deletion on the H4-(1–59) two-hybrid interactions was carried out with YTH2, a hat2Δ derivative of PJ69-4A. Preparation of Enzymatic Extracts and Fractionation of HAT Complexes—Whole-cell extracts for enzymatic determinations and for fractionation of HAT complexes were obtained by the salt dissociation/ultracentrifugation method described previously (49Ruiz-García A.B. Sendra R. Pamblanco M. Tordera V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, yeast cells grown to exponential phase in liquid YPD medium were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in distilled water, and spheroplasted with Zymolyase as described (49Ruiz-García A.B. Sendra R. Pamblanco M. Tordera V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were lysed in buffer (5 ml/g cells) containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and the protease inhibitors 1 mm PMSF, 2 μm E64, 25 μm 3,4-DCI, and 2 μg/ml chymostatin and homogenized with vigorous magnetic stirring. This and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Solid NaCl was added to give a final concentration of 0.6 m, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. The homogenates were ultracentrifuged for2hat 100,000 × g, and the resulting supernatants were saved and dialyzed against three changes of buffer B (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.25 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm NaCl). The dialyzed extracts were made to 80 mm NaCl by addition of solid NaCl, centrifuged for 20 min at 27,000 × g, and loaded onto Q-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) columns (0.75 × 2 cm) equilibrated in buffer B containing 80 mm NaCl.

Recently, a novel cytotoxic necrotizing factor termed CNFY was identified in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains (Lockman, H. A., Gillespie, R. A., Baker, B. D., and Shakhnovich, E. (2002) Infect. Immun. 70, 2708–2714). We amplified the cnfy gene from genomic DNA of Y. pseudotuberculosis, cloned and expressed the recombinant protein, and studied its activity. Recombinant GST-CNFY induced morphological changes in HeLa cells and caused an upward shift of RhoA in SDS-PAGE, as is known for GST-CNF1 and GST-CNF2. Mass spectrometric analysis of GST-CNFY-treated RhoA confirmed deamidation at Glu63. Treatment of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 with GST-CNFY decreased their GTPase activities, indicating that all of these Rho proteins could serve as substrates for GST-CNFYin vitro. In contrast, RhoA, but not Rac or Cdc42, was the substrate of GST-CNFY in culture cells. GST-CNFY caused marked stress fiber formation in HeLa cells after 2 h. In contrast to GST-CNF1, formation of filopodia or lamellipodia was not induced with GST-CNFY. Accordingly, effector pull-down experiments with lysates of toxin-treated cells revealed strong activation of RhoA but no activation of Rac1 or Cdc42 after 6 h of GST-CNFY-treatment. Moreover, in rat hippocampal neurons, GST-CNFY results in the retraction of neurites, indicating RhoA activation. In contrast, no activation of Rac or Cdc42 was found. Altogether, our data suggest that CNFY from Y. pseudotuberculosis is a strong, selective activator of RhoA, which can be used as a powerful tool for constitutive RhoA activation without concomitant activation of Rac1 or Cdc42. The cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNF)1 and CNF2 from pathogenic Escherichia coli strains activate RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 by deamidation of Gln63 (RhoA) or Gln61 (Rac and Cdc42). Recently, a novel cytotoxic necrotizing factor termed CNFY was identified in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains (Lockman, H. A., Gillespie, R. A., Baker, B. D., and Shakhnovich, E. (2002) Infect. Immun. 70, 2708–2714). We amplified the cnfy gene from genomic DNA of Y. pseudotuberculosis, cloned and expressed the recombinant protein, and studied its activity. Recombinant GST-CNFY induced morphological changes in HeLa cells and caused an upward shift of RhoA in SDS-PAGE, as is known for GST-CNF1 and GST-CNF2. Mass spectrometric analysis of GST-CNFY-treated RhoA confirmed deamidation at Glu63. Treatment of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 with GST-CNFY decreased their GTPase activities, indicating that all of these Rho proteins could serve as substrates for GST-CNFYin vitro. In contrast, RhoA, but not Rac or Cdc42, was the substrate of GST-CNFY in culture cells. GST-CNFY caused marked stress fiber formation in HeLa cells after 2 h. In contrast to GST-CNF1, formation of filopodia or lamellipodia was not induced with GST-CNFY. Accordingly, effector pull-down experiments with lysates of toxin-treated cells revealed strong activation of RhoA but no activation of Rac1 or Cdc42 after 6 h of GST-CNFY-treatment. Moreover, in rat hippocampal neurons, GST-CNFY results in the retraction of neurites, indicating RhoA activation. In contrast, no activation of Rac or Cdc42 was found. Altogether, our data suggest that CNFY from Y. pseudotuberculosis is a strong, selective activator of RhoA, which can be used as a powerful tool for constitutive RhoA activation without concomitant activation of Rac1 or Cdc42. The cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNF) 1The abbreviations used are: CNF, cytotoxic necrotizing factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac1-interactive binding; PAK, p21-activated kinase; POSH, plenty of SH3 domains; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. 1The abbreviations used are: CNF, cytotoxic necrotizing factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac1-interactive binding; PAK, p21-activated kinase; POSH, plenty of SH3 domains; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.-1 and CNF2 from pathogenic Escherichia coli strains belong to the group of protein toxins that constitutively activate small GTPases of the Rho family. CNF1 and CNF2 catalyze the deamidation of RhoA at Gln63 (Gln61 of Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively), thereby inhibiting their intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activities (1Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 2Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In CNF1-treated HeLa cells, activation of Rac is most prominent, and Cdc42 is only slightly activated. Persistent activation of the Rho GTPases leads to typical morphological changes caused by rearrangements of the cellular actin cytoskeleton, e.g. RhoA induces the formation of stress fibers, Rac1 leads to membrane ruffling, and Cdc42 induces the formation of filopodia (for review, see Ref. 3Ridley A. Hall A. GTPases. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 89-136Google Scholar). Besides these direct effects on actin structures, the deregulation of Rho GTPases by CNF results in the formation of enlarged multinucleated cells, most likely by inhibition of cytokinesis (for review, see Ref. 4Aktories K. Schmidt G. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 152-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the cellular content of Rac1 decreases after CNF treatment, a process that is blocked by proteasome inhibitors (5Lerm M. Pop M. Fritz G. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4053-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Doye A. Mettouchi A. Bossis G. Clément R. Buisson-Touati C. Flatau G. Gagnoux L. Piechaczyk M. Boquet P. Lemichez E.

Proteasomal degradation of CNF-activated Rac1 increases the motility of target cells and may be involved in the destruction of the barrier function of epithelial host cells by CNF-producing bacteria (6Doye A. Mettouchi A. Bossis G. Clément R. Buisson-Touati C. Flatau G. Gagnoux L. Piechaczyk M. Boquet P. Lemichez E. Cell. 2002; 111: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). More recently, a novel cytotoxic necrotizing factor, CNFY, has been identified in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (7Lockman H.A. Gillespie R.A. Baker B.D. Shakhnovich E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2708-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cnfy gene is encoded by an open reading frame of 3,045 bp and is located on the chromosomal DNA and not on the virulence plasmid, which codes for the Yop proteins (8Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.-P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of CNFY is about 61% identical to that of CNF1 from E. coli. The amino acid residues essential for catalytic activity in CNF1, Cys866 and His881, are also conserved in CNFY with the same spacing (7Lockman H.A. Gillespie R.A. Baker B.D. Shakhnovich E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2708-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Schmidt G. Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Lockman et al. (7Lockman H.A. Gillespie R.A. Baker B.D. Shakhnovich E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2708-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that broth supernatants and cell-free lysates of Y. pseudotuberculosis strains containing the complete cnfy gene induced the development of Hep-2 cells into giant, multinucleated cells. The morphology of these cells was similar to the CNF1-induced phenotype. Interestingly, the biological activity was independent of the presence of the 70-kDa virulence plasmid of Yersinia, which encodes the components of a type-III secretion system (8Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.-P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains which produced CNFY but were cured of their virulence plasmid still had the ability to induce the multinucleation of cells. Therefore, the activity of CNFY seems to be independent of the type III secretion system of Yersinia. Moreover, CNFY is released from the bacteria, probably by a different secretion mechanism, because the bacterial culture supernatant contains the biological activity. In contrast, it is believed that CNF1 is not released from E. coli but stays cell-associated, based on the fact that the biological activity is only found in the presence of the bacteria (7Lockman H.A. Gillespie R.A. Baker B.D. Shakhnovich E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2708-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Caprioli A. Falbo V. Roda L.G. Ruggeri F.M. Zona C. Infect. Immun. 1983; 39: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the significant homology between CNFY and CNF1, a CNF1 polyclonal antibody was not able to inhibit the CNFY cytopathic effect (7Lockman H.A. Gillespie R.A. Baker B.D. Shakhnovich E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2708-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here, we cloned and expressed CNFY from Y. pseudotuberculosis as a recombinant GST-fusion protein (GST-CNFY = 146 kDa; GST = 26 kDa) and investigated its effects on the Rho GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, both in vitro and in intact cells. From our studies, we conclude that in intact cells, GST-CNFY is a selective activator of RhoA. Cell Culture and Preparation of Lysates—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (12 mm l-glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (4 mm), and streptomycin (4 mm) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For intoxication with GST-CNF1 or GST-CNFY, cells were treated with 400 ng of GST-CNF per ml of medium 1 day after seeding. For preparation of cell lysates, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, lysed in buffer A (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 5 min at 4 °C and harvested with a rubber policeman. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20 min, 20,800 × g, 4 °C), and supernatants were subjected to pull-down assays. Primary cultures of neurons were prepared from hippocampi of new-born Wistar rats, as described previously (11Benz I. Meyer D.K. Kohlhardt M. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The dissociated neural cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine/laminin-coated coverslips. Incubation medium consisted of neurobasal medium supplemented with B27. Fresh medium was mixed 1:1 with medium, which had been conditioned for 3 or 4 days with hippocampal astroglial cultures. Cultures were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 8.6% CO2. Neurobasal medium and B27 were obtained from Invitrogen. Actin-staining—Formaldehyde-fixed cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1 unit per coverslip) at room temperature for 1 h, washed again, and applied for fluorescence microscopy (bleaching preservative was Kaiser's glycerol gelatin from Merck). Micrographs were taken with an Axiocam camera (Zeiss). Immunocytochemistry—Neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. They were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Normal goat serum was used to block unspecific reactions. Thereafter, the neurons were incubated with the monoclonal mouse anti-β-tubulin III antibody (Sigma). The resulting immune complexes were visualized with a Cy™ 3-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Confocal Image Analysis—Neurons were imaged by using an MRC 1024 confocal system (version 3.2, Bio-Rad) with a krypton-argon laser and an Axiovert 135TV microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Fluorescence of Cy™ 3 was measured by using an excitation wavelength of 554 nm and an emission filter set at 576 nm. A Z-stock of 95 confocal images were obtained, and a vertical projection was produced by using Metamorph software from Vistron, München, Germany. Mutagenesis—The cnfy gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of Y. pseudotuberculosis strain YPIII using 5′-GGATCCATGAAAAATCAATGGCAACATCAATATTT-3′ as sense primer and 5′-CCCGGGGATATCTTTTCATTTCCCCCTGCC-3′ as antisense primer, thereby introducing restriction sites for BamHI and SmaI. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the expression vector pGEX-2TGL and transformed into E. coli BL-21 for protein expression. Mutagenesis was performed by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) based on the pGEX-2TGL-CNFY construct using the following sense primers (and corresponding antisense primers): CNFY(C866S), 5′-TTAACAGGGTCTACAGTTGTT-3′, CNFY(H881A), 5′-TATGCTGTAGCTACAGGAAATTCT-3′. All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing using a Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Protein Preparation—For toxin purification, BL21 E. coli strains, carrying pGEX-CNF1, pGEX-CNFY, and the mutated plasmids, respectively, were grown in LB medium. At A0.6, cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). Loaded beads were washed five times with lysis buffer (without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C. The GST-CNF fusion proteins were eluted from the beads by glutathione (10 mm glutathione and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) twice for 10 min at room temperature. Pull-down Experiments—The Rho-binding region, encoding the N-terminal 90 amino acids of rhotekin (rhotekin pull-down), the CRIB-domain (amino acids 56–272) of p21-activated kinase (PAK pull-down) or the Rac-binding domain of POSH (amino acids 282–371, POSH pull-down) were expressed as GST-fusion proteins in E. coli BL21. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 (for rhotekin 1:100) and grown for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration) was added. 2 h after induction, cells were collected and lysed by sonication in rhotekin lysis buffer (20% sucrose, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm sodium bisulfite, 2 mm MgCl2) and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Loaded beads were washed three times with rhotekin lysis buffer and once with buffer A. Toxin-treated cells were lysed in buffer A. For analysis of the total amount of the respective GTPase in the lysates, 1/10 of the volume was taken for Western blot analysis. 9/10 of the volume was incubated with protein-loaded beads for 1 h at 4 °C by head-over-head rotation. After incubation, beads were washed once with buffer A. Then SDS-sample buffer was added and samples were boiled and separated on SDS-PAGE. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were analyzed by immunoblotting with their specific antibodies. Treatment of Recombinant GTPases with GST-CNFYand GST-CNF1—Rho GTPases were incubated with GST-CNFY or GST-CNF1 at a molar ratio of GTPases:toxin of 20:1 for 3 h at 37 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. GTPase Assay—Recombinant Rho proteins were modified by GST-CNF. After incubation with the respective toxin, the proteins were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP for 5 min at 37 °C in loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol). MgCl2 (12 mm, final concentration) and unlabeled GTP (2 mm, final concentration) were added. Loaded GTPases were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times with or without p50RhoGAP, and the GTPase activity was analyzed by a filter-binding assay. Proteolytic Digestion in the Gel Matrix for Mass Spectrometric Analysis—The excised gel plugs of RhoA were destained for 1 h at 50 °C in 40% acetonitrile/60% hydrogen carbonate (50 mm, pH 7.8) to remove Coomassie Blue, gel buffer, SDS, and salts. The plug was subsequently dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 15 min. Thereafter, 30 μl of digestion buffer with trypsin was added, and digestion was carried out for 12 h at 37 °C. Sample Preparation for MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—4-Hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid (Aldrich) was recrystallized from hot methanol and stored in the dark. Saturated matrix solution of 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid in a 1:1 solution of acetonitrile/aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was prepared. 2 μl of the proteolytic peptide mixture was mixed with 2 μl of saturated matrix containing marker peptides (5 pmol of human ACTH (18–39), clip (MW 2466, Sigma), and 5 pmol of human angiotensin II (MW 1047, Sigma)) for internal calibration. Using the dried-drop method of matrix crystallization, 1 μl of the sample matrix solution was placed on the MALDI-TOF stainless-steel target and was allowed to air-dry several minutes at room temperature, resulting in a thin layer of fine granular matrix crystals. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Biflex mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (l = 337 nm) to desorb and ionize the samples. Mass spectra were recorded in the reflector positive mode in combination with delayed extraction. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blotting, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride-membrane. Rac was detected with a specific antibody (anti-Rac, BD Biosciences). Rho was detected with a monoclonal antibody directed against the insert region (anti-RhoA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and for Cdc42 detection, a monoclonal antibody (anti-Cdc42, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was used. Binding of the second horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody was detected with enhanced chemiluminescent detection reagent (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm luminol (Fluka, St. Gallen, Switzerland), 0.2 mm p-coumaric acid, 3 mm H2O2). Recently, the nucleotide sequence of CNFY from Y. pseudotuberculosis was described (7Lockman H.A. Gillespie R.A. Baker B.D. Shakhnovich E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2708-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It was shown that bacterial cell extracts of Yersinia induce multinucleation in Hep-2 cells as described for CNF1 produced by pathogenic E. coli strains. Cloning and Expression of CNFY—To analyze the activity of CNFY, the genomic DNA of Y. pseudotuberculosis was purified. We amplified the cnfy gene by PCR and cloned it into the pGEX vector. The proper construct was checked by DNA sequencing. Sequencing revealed some differences in the N-terminal part of the protein (S193N, G305Q, and T395A), as compared with the sequence published by Lockman (7Lockman H.A. Gillespie R.A. Baker B.D. Shakhnovich E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2708-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Repeated PCR gave the same results, indicating that the differing sequence is not due to mistakes of the polymerase. CNFY was then expressed as GST-fusion protein in BL21 cells and purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Activity of Recombinant GST-CNFY—The activity of the recombinant toxin was first studied by the change in electrophoretic mobility of modified RhoA. As shown in Fig. 1B, incubation of recombinant RhoA with GST-CNF1 (Fig. 1B, lane 2) or with GST-CNFY (Fig. 1B, lane 3) but not with buffer (Fig. 1B, lane 1) caused an upwards shift of the GTPase in SDS-PAGE, indicating deamidation of RhoA by GST-CNF1 and GST-CNFY. After incubation with GST-CNFY for 3 h, only ∼30% of the GTPase was shifted, whereas GST-CNF1 catalyzed modification of 100% of RhoA (Fig. 1B), indicating higher activity of the recombinant E. coli toxin in vitro. For CNF1, a catalytic dyad consisting of a cysteine and a histidine residue has been identified (9Schmidt G. Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These residues are identical in CNFY. We mutated the conserved catalytic residues Cys866 and His881 in GST-CNFY to serine or alanine, respectively, expressed the mutants (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3), and studied their activities. Incubation of recombinant RhoA with these mutants does not change the electrophoretic mobility of the GTPase (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). This indicates that CNFY shares the same catalytic residues with CNF1. Deamidation of RhoA can be detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (1Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). We used this method to verify the GST-CNFY-catalyzed deamidation of Glu63 of RhoA. The recombinant GTPase was incubated with the toxin and subjected to SDS-PAGE. In-gel digestion with trypsin was performed, and the tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 2, incubation of RhoA with GST-CNFY (Fig. 2, A and B, control) led to an increase in mass of one Dalton in a peptide corresponding to amino acids 52–68 of the GTPase. This increase in mass corresponds to deamidation of Glu63. As shown for GST-CNF1-catalyzed deamidation of Rho GTPases, this modification leads to the block of intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activity. In Vitro Substrate Specificity of Recombinant GST-CNFY— Measuring of GTPase activity can be used to study substrate specificity of the toxin. Therefore, recombinant RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were incubated with GST-CNFY, GST-CNF1, or buffer, respectively, as indicated and loaded with [γ-32P]GTP. The intrinsic or GAP-stimulated GTPase activity of the Rho proteins was then measured in a filter-binding assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, incubation of RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 with one of the two CNFs studied leads to the block of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of the respective GTPase. The same effect was found for the GAP-stimulated GTPase activity (Fig. 3B). GST-CNF1 caused a stronger inhibition of the GTPase activity than GST-CNFY under the conditions used. The finding that after this time period, still-unmodified GTPase was detected in the sample (Fig. 1, B and C) corresponds with the lower extent of inhibition of GTP hydrolysis by GST-CNFY as compared with GST-CNF1. Nevertheless, the data show that in vitro, all three GTPases (RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42) can serve as substrates for CNF1 as well as for CNFY. GST-CNFYInduces RhoA Morphology in HeLa Cells—To study the activity of the toxin in the living cell, HeLa cells were incubated with GST-CNF1, GST-CNFY, and the inactive mutant GST-CNFY(C866S) respectively, and morphological changes induced by the toxins were monitored by phase contrast microscopy. Moreover, the actin cytoskeleton of fixed cells was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. As expected, GST-CNFY induced the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton of HeLa cells and led to polynucleation. Notably, the morphology of cells and toxin-induced actin rearrangements observed with GST-CNF1 and GST-CNFY, respectively, were different. As shown in Fig. 4, incubation of HeLa cells with GST-CNF1 for 2 h led to cell spreading (Fig. 4C). Also, the formation of membrane ruffles and, to a lesser extent, the formation of actin stress fibers and filopodia were evident already after 2 h of incubation with GST-CNF1, indicating strong activation of Rac and activation of RhoA and Cdc42. In contrast, incubation with GST-CNFY for the same time period led to the formation of actin stress fibers, but no membrane ruffling, filopodia formation, or cell spreading were detected (Fig. 4D), indicating activation of RhoA but not of Rac and Cdc42 by CNFY. However, after 24 h of incubation with GST-CNFY, cells were flattened and showed membrane ruffling (Fig. 4E). As expected, the catalytically inactive mutant GST-CNFY(C866S) had no effect on the morphology of HeLa cells (Fig. 4A). From our in vitro data presented above, the slower flattening could be explained by the minor catalytic activity of GST-CNFY as compared with GST-CNF1. However, an even stronger stress fiber formation was observed after 2 h of GST-CNFY treatment than was observed after GST-CNF1 treatment. This finding indicates that GST-CNFY has even higher activity toward RhoA than GST-CNF1 in the living cell. GST-CNFYSelectively Activates RhoA in HeLa Cells—To clarify the in vivo substrate specificity of GST-CNFY, we performed pull-down experiments with bead-coupled GTPase-binding domains of rhotekin, PAK, or POSH. These effector domains exclusively bind to the GTP-bound form of the GT-Pases. HeLa cells were treated with the two toxins in a time course and then lysed. The pull-down experiments were performed with increasing incubation times to follow activation of the respective GTPase. In addition, toxin-treated HeLa cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin after the same time periods to allow comparison of GTPase activation and morphology. As shown in Fig. 5, incubation of the cells for 2 h with GST-CNF1 led to strong activation of Rac and activation of RhoA and Cdc42 with the corresponding formation of membrane ruffles, stress fibers, and filopodia in HeLa cells (Fig. 5A, lane 1). With GST-CNFY, a strong activation of RhoA was evident already after 1 h of incubation and was still present after 24 h of toxin treatment. In contrast, no activation of Rac and Cdc42 could be detected during the first 6 h of treatment with GST-CNFY. In line with this, GST-CNFY-treated HeLa cells showed a strong formation of stress fibers but no membrane ruffling or filopodia formation (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 3–6). After 8–24 h of treatment with GST-CNFY, a slight activation of Rac occurred, which was accompanied by the formation of membrane ruffles (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 7 and 8). Thus, activation of the GTPases detected in the pull-down experiments clearly depicts the morphological changes induced by GST-CNFY in HeLa cells. All together, the data indicate that GST-CNF1 and GST-CNFY have different substrate specificity in vivo, with GST-CNFY specifically modifying RhoA. GST-CNFYInduces RhoA Morphology in Rat Hippocampal Neurons—To further substantiate our observation that CNFy selectively activates RhoA, we studied the morphology of a different type of cell and tested the effect of GST-CNFY on rat hippocampal neurons. In these cells, it is possible to distinguish morphological changes induced by active RhoA from changes induced by active Rac and Cdc42 activation. It has been shown that RhoA activation in hippocampal neurons leads to the retraction of dendrites, whereas constitutive activation of Rac or Cdc42 induces the formation of small finger-like extensions along the dendrites (12Boutillier S. Rapp J. Staeb T. Olenik C. Schmidt G. Meyer D.K. Leemhuis J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2003; 368: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We treated rat hippocampal neurons with GST-CNF1 or GST-CNFY and studied the morphology induced. As shown in Fig. 6, incubation of the neurons for 4 h with GST-CNF1 or with GST-CNFY led to retraction of dendrites from the total neurite length of ∼500 μm to <100 μm in toxin-treated cells, indicating RhoA activation. Moreover, the induction of small finger-like extensions, indicating activation of Rac and/or Cdc42 from control levels with 3 spikes per neuron, increased to 12 spikes in mean only when the cells were treated with GST-CNF1. In contrast, incubation of the neurons with GST-CNFY for 4 h led to a clear retraction of dendrites but not to the formation of small extensions, suggesting that RhoA was activated exclusively. Activation of RhoA in this cell system was verified by pull-down experiments with rhotekin. Moreover, no activation of Rac or Cdc42 by GST-CNFY was found in PAK pull-down experiments (data not shown). All together, our data strongly suggest that CNFY can be used as a new tool for permanent and selective activation of RhoA in mammalian cells without concomitant activation of Rac and Cdc42. We and others analyzed the molecular mechanism and the structure-function relationship of the cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF1) of E. coli (for review, see Ref. 4Aktories K. Schmidt G. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 152-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently, the nucleotide sequence of the CNFY from Y. pseudotuberculosis was described (7Lockman H.A. Gillespie R.A. Baker B.D. Shakhnovich E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2708-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CNFY shows 61% identity in its amino acid sequence with CNF1 all over the protein. The activity of the toxin was analyzed using bacterial cell extracts. In these studies, GST-CNFY induced multinucleation in Hep-2 cells in the same manner as described for GST-CNF1. In the present study, we cloned and expressed the CNFY of Y. pseudotuberculosis for the first time and investigated the activity of the recombinant toxin in vitro and in vivo. We used different methods established for the analysis of CNF1 to analyze the activity of CNFY. First, we analyzed the GST-CNFY-catalyzed modification of recombinant RhoA by determination of the different migration behavior of unmodified and deamidated RhoA in SDS-PAGE. Incubation of the GTPase with the recombinant toxin led to the same shift as induced by GST-CNF1, indicating the same modification. The same activity was found for the thrombin-cleaved toxins (not shown). Deamidation at Glu63 of RhoA by GST-CNFY was further verified by the increase in mass of one Dalton in a peptide corresponding to amino acids 52–68 of the GTPase detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This increase in mass corresponds to deamidation of Glu63. Deamidation of RhoA leads to the block of intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activity, which can be analyzed in a filter-binding assay. We show that GST-CNFY deamidates RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 in vitro and leads to the block of the GTP-hydrolyzing activity of the respective GTPase. In CNF1, a catalytic dyad of Cys866 and His881 was identified (9Schmidt G. Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These residues are identical in CNFY. Mutation of these amino acids in GST-CNFY completely blocks the catalytic activity of the Yersinia toxin. As expected from the overall identity of 61%, including the catalytic amino acids, the data indicate that CNF1 and CNFY catalyze the same modification, namely the deamidation of Gln63 or Gln61 of RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, respectively. Notably, we observed marked differences in cell morphology induced by GST-CNF1 compared with GST-CNFY. HeLa cells treated with GST-CNFY showed strong formation of stress fibers, but no flattening, membrane ruffling, or formation of filopodia within the first 6 h of toxin treatment, indicating activation of RhoA, but suggesting that Rac and Cdc42 are not activated. After 24 h of treatment with GST-CNFY, however, the cells were spread out, and membrane ruffling was detectable. In all in vitro studies performed, we detected stronger activity of GST-CNF1 as compared with the recombinant Yersinia toxin. In contrast, we found a stronger activation in living cells of RhoA by GST-CNFY than after incubation with the same amount of GST-CNF1. For greater insight into the morphological differences observed, we performed pull-down experiments with bead-coupled GTPase-binding domains of rhotekin, PAK, or POSH, respectively, to exclusively precipitate activated Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 from lysates of toxin-treated cells. To allow comparison of GTPase activation and morphology, HeLa cells were treated with the toxins for the same time periods, fixed, and stained for F-actin. As known from previous studies, incubation of the cells for 2 h with GST-CNF1 leads to activation of RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, with preference for Rac and with the corresponding formation of stress fibers, membrane ruffles, and filopodia in HeLa cells (13Lerm M. Selzer J. Hoffmeyer A. Rapp U.R. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 496-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, with GST-CNFY, strong activation of RhoA was evident after 1 h of incubation. RhoA activation was still present after 24 h of toxin treatment, but no activation of Rac and Cdc42 was detected by pull-down experiments during the first 6 h of treatment with GST-CNFY and, subsequently, no membrane ruffling or formation of filopodia was observed. Activation of the GTPases detected in the pull-down experiments clearly depicts the morphological changes induced in HeLa cells. The finding of a selective activation of RhoA in intact cells is supported by the toxin-induced morphology of rat hippocampal neurons. In these cells, GST-CNF1 and GST-CNFY induced retraction of dendrites, indicating activation of RhoA. In contrast, only GST-CNF1 but not GST-CNFY induced the formation of small finger-like extensions in these cells, indicating that RhoA is activated exclusively by the Yersinia toxin. Our data show that Rac and Cdc42 is not activated by GST-CNFY in intact cells within the first 6 h of toxin treatment, whereas RhoA is activated strongly already after 1 h of incubation with GST-CNFY. In line with this, we detected no degradation of Rac in GST-CNFY-treated cells, whereas GST-CNF1-activated Rac is degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway (Refs. 5Lerm M. Pop M. Fritz G. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4053-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and 6Doye A. Mettouchi A. Bossis G. Clément R. Buisson-Touati C. Flatau G. Gagnoux L. Piechaczyk M. Boquet P. Lemichez E. Cell. 2002; 111: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar and data not shown). This finding again suggests that Rac is not activated by GST-CNFY in intact cells. In contrast, we found a decrease of total RhoA in cells treated with the Yersinia toxin for 24 h (compare Fig. 5B, lane 8). Similar results were obtained with thrombin-cleaved CNFY (not shown). There are many examples of toxins with a broader substrate specificity in vitro as compared with their actions in the living cell (14Coburn J. Wyatt R.T. Iglewski B.H. Gill D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9004-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ganesan A.K. Frank D.W. Misra R.P. Schmidt G. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol.

Moreover, substrate specificity has been shown to be even cell-type dependent. For example, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxins ADP-ribosyltransferase modifies a different set of small GTPases in different cell lines (18Csosz E. Keresztessy Z. Fesus L. Minerva Biotec. 2002; 14: 149-153Google Scholar). The reason for the tighter specificity of CNFY in living cells might be due to a different uptake mechanism or different localization within the cell and remains to be analyzed. All together, our data strongly indicate that CNF1 and CNFY have different substrate specificity in intact cells. CNFY is a specific and direct activator of RhoA in HeLa cells and primary hippocampal neurons and can be used as an important new tool for the permanent activation of RhoA without concomitant activation of other Rho family GTPases like Rac and Cdc42.

https://openalex.org/W2109961396,"The P2X family of ATP receptors (P2XR) are ligandgated channels that have been proposed to regulate cell death of immature thymocytes. However, the nature of the P2XR subtype involved has been controversial until recently. In agreement with previous studies, we found that extracellular ATP (ATPe) induces a caspase-dependent apoptosis of BALB/c thymocytes, as observed by DNA fragmentation. Additionally, ATPe induces a predominant caspase-independent thymocytes lysis characterized by plasma membrane disruption. Both responses to ATPe can be induced by a potent P2X7R agonist, benzoylbenzoyl-ATP, whereas P2X7R antagonists, oxidized ATP and pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid, inhibited the effect of ATPe. These results are further supported by observations where disruption of the P2X7R gene (P2X7R–/– mice) completely abolishes thymocytes death induced by ATPe. Interestingly, the natural P451L mutation in the C-terminal tail of P2X7R present in C57BL/6 mice, which impairs ATPe-dependent pore formation in T lymphocytes, significantly reduces thymocytes death triggered by ATPe. Furthermore, we found that P2X7R from BW5147 thymoma cells also harbors this point mutation, accounting for their insensitivity to ATPe-induced cell death. Concentrations of ATPe effective in inducing cell death also increase phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (PC-PLD) activity in BALB/c thymocytes through the stimulation of P2X7R. However, in contrast to ATPe-induced cell death, PC-PLD activation is totally Ca2+-dependent. Moreover, the stimulation of PC-PLD by ATPe is not affected by the P451L mutation present in C57BL/6 thymocytes and BW5147 cells, suggesting that cell death and PC-PLD activity are regulated through distinct domains of the P2X7R. Finally, the inhibition of ATPe-induced PC-PLD stimulation does not affect thymocytes death. Altogether, these data suggest that P2X7R-induced thymocytes death is independent of the stimulation of PC-PLD activity.

Two distinct subfamilies of P2 receptors have been described, namely the G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane P2Y receptors and the ligand-gated ionotropic P2X receptors (P2XR). Among the P2XR, the P2X7R subclass is notably expressed in hemopoietic tissue (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). Activation of the P2X7R by ATPe opens ion channels, which mediate fast permeability changes to monovalent and divalent cations (Na+, K+, and Ca2+). Upon prolonged activation, P2X7R induces the formation of nonselective membrane pores permeable to molecules up to 800 Da (2Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). At present, the mechanisms underlying the opening of the cation channel and its transition or coupling to a pore are still unknown. It has been proposed that P2X7R is able to undergo a progressive increase in size, possibly by recruitment of additional receptor subunits (2Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). However, Schilling et al. (3Schilling W.P. Wasylyna T. Dubyak G.R. Humphreys B.D. Sinkins W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C766-C776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) propose another attractive hypothesis, where P2X7R might interact with a distinct cytolytic pore allowing the entry of large molecules into the cell. Moreover, formation of the nonselective pore has been shown recently to be dissociated from large scale changes in P2X7R density (4Smart M.L. Panchal R.G. Bowser D.N. Williams D.A. Petrou S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C77-C84Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) but is dependent on the cytoplasmic C-terminal part of the P2X7R (5Gu B.J. Zhang W. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P.

A role for P2X7R has also been proposed in ATPe-triggered cell death of several cell types, including myeloid cells (8Ferrari D. Los M. Bauer M.K. Vandenabeele P. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), macrophages (9Chiozzi P. Murgia M. Falzoni S. Ferrari D. Di Virgilio F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The function of P2X7R in the latter is still controversial, because previous reports have proposed an additional role of P2X1R in thymocyte death (14Chvatchko Y. Valera S. Aubry J.P. Renno T.

ATPe has been shown to trigger PLD activation in various cell types such as macrophages (19El-Moatassim C. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23664-23673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lymphocytes (20Gargett C.E. Cornish E.J. Wiley J.S. Biochem.

Lett. 2001; 313: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In mammals, two types of PLDs have been described, those that are dependent of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for activity and those that are activated by oleate. Among the first type of PLDs, PLD1 and PLD2 isoforms have been cloned and characterized (23Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 24Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of regulation of PLDs are highly dependent on the cell-type studied (25Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rizzo M. Romero G. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 94: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PLDs are involved in a variety of physiological processes such as vesicular trafficking and secretion, superoxide generation, bacterial killing, proliferation, differentiation, and possibly apoptosis (25Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nozawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, PLD activity increases when apoptosis is induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or anti-Fas/Apo1 monoclonal antibody in HL60 cells and in murine B cell lymphoma A20 cells (28Kang J.H. Shin I. Han J.S. Exp. Mol. Med. 1998; 30: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Oleate-stimulated PLD activity is also associated with apoptosis induced by actinomycin D, TNFα, or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in Jurkat T cells (29Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, PLD activity has also been shown to be involved in anti-apoptotic responses. Thus, PLD2 plays a suppressive role in H2O2-induced apoptosis (30Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Han J.M. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and in hypoxia-induced cell death (31Yamakawa H. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Sawada M. Yamada J. Yoshimura S. Nishimura Y. Nozawa Y. Sakai N. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 3647-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Taking into account the divergent roles of PLD in apoptosis, we examined whether PLD activation via P2X7R is associated with ATPe-triggered cell death of thymocytes. During their development immature thymocytes undergo two selection processes. Positive selection insures that thymocytes can interact with self-major histocompatibility complex molecules via their receptor for antigen (TcR). Thymocytes die by neglect when they fail to undergo positive selection. Negative selection eliminates thymocytes bearing a TcR with too high an avidity for self-major histocompatibility complex molecules. Thus, a large proportion of thymocytes fails to develop and dies by apoptosis (32van Meerwijk J.P.M. Marguerat S. Lees R.K. Germain R.N. Fowlkes B.J. MacDonald H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to antigen stimulation through the TcR and the glucocorticoid receptor, a third pathway involving ATPe has been proposed to regulate apoptosis of immature thymocytes (14Chvatchko Y. Valera S. Aubry J.P. Renno T. Buell G. Bonnefoy J.Y. Immunity. 1996; 5: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 33Freedman B.D. Liu Q.H. Gaulton G. Kotlikoff M.I. Hescheler J. Fleischmann B.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that intrathymic elimination of self-reactive thymocytes is mediated by P2X1R (14Chvatchko Y. Valera S. Aubry J.P. Renno T. Buell G. Bonnefoy J.Y. Immunity. 1996; 5: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas death by neglect may be due to one or more PPADS-sensitive P2X1R, -2R, and -7R (33Freedman B.D. Liu Q.H. Gaulton G. Kotlikoff M.I. Hescheler J. Fleischmann B.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, it was also shown that P2X1Rs were up-regulated and antagonists to these purinoreceptors prevented cell death (14Chvatchko Y. Valera S. Aubry J.P. Renno T. Buell G. Bonnefoy J.Y. Immunity. 1996; 5: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the role of P2X1R in negative selection has been challenged recently (34Koshiba M. Apasov S. Sverdlov V. Chen P. Erb L. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Sitkovsky M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).In the present work, we have examined the consequences of P2X7R stimulation by ATPe in thymocytes by taking advantage of the P2X7R knock-out mice (P2X7R–/–) (35Solle M.

We showed that ATPe stimulation of P2X7R triggers phosphatidylcholinehydrolyzing PLD (PC-PLD) activity and cell death of mouse thymocytes. We also found that, in contrast to cell death, PC-PLD activation is calcium-dependent and not modified by the P451L mutation present in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of P2X7R of some strains of mice. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that PC-PLD is not directly involved in the pathways leading to ATPe-induced cell death of thymocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Tissue culture media were from Invitrogen SARL.

BW5147 cells (8.5 × 105) suspended in 1 ml of RPMI containing 1 mg/ml lipid-free BSA, were labeled with 6.4 μCi of [3H]myristic acid at 37 °C for 24 h. Analysis of [3H]myristic acid-labeled lipids, performed as previously described (36Auger R. Robin P. Camier B. Vial G. Rossignol B. Tenu J.P. Raymond M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28652-28659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), revealed that PC represents 86 ± 4% and 70 ± 5% of the labeled phospholipids in BALB/c thymocytes and BW5147 cells, respectively. After labeling, the thymocytes and BW5147 cells were washed with RPMI and preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min, in the presence of 0.3% butanol-1 in 2 ml of RPMI supplemented with 1 mg/ml lipid-free BSA and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (CaCl2 final concentration: 0.925 mm). ATPe or other agents were then added for 45-min incubation. At the end of the experiment, cellular lipids were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography as described previously (36Auger R.

The amounts of [3H]PBut formed were expressed as a percentage of the amount of total radiolabeled lipids.Calculations of Concentrations of ATP4– Species—In the medium routinely used, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations were 0.925 and 0.406 mm, respectively. The concentrations of ATP4–, ATP4–-Ca2+, ATP4–-Mg2+, free Ca2+ were calculated using the equilibrium values reported in Data for Biochemical Research (55O'Sullivan W.J. Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Oxford University Press, Oxford1969: 423-434Google Scholar).Measurement of LDH Release—Cell lysis was determined by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Murine thymocytes (5 × 106) and BW5147 cells (8 × 105) were incubated in 0.5 ml of RPMI supplemented with 1 mg/ml lipid-free BSA and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (CaCl2 final concentration: 0.925 mm). ATPe or other agonists were added, and at the end of the incubations, the cells were pelleted for 10 min at 200 × g and the LDH activity released from dead cells was measured in the media according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total LDH activity was measured by lysing thymocytes and BW5147 cells with 0.1% Triton X-100. The percentage of LDH released represents the fraction of LDH activity found in the supernatants with respect to the overall enzyme activity. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis; p < 0.05 was accepted as a significant difference.Flow Cytometric Analysis of Phosphatidylserine Externalization— The analysis of this phospholipid on the outer leaflet of apoptotic thymocyte-membranes was performed by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Annexin-V, which binds to phosphatidylserine (PS), and propidium iodide which allows the differentiation from lytic cells. Thymocytes (5 × 105) were incubated in 0.5 ml of RPMI supplemented with 1 mg/ml lipid-free BSA and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (CaCl2 final concentration: 0.925 mm) in the absence or the presence of ATPe. At the end of the incubation time, cells were pelleted for 10 min at 200 × g, washed with 1 mg/ml lipid-free BSA in PBS, and then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 0.5 μg/ml propidium iodide and annexin V diluted in a buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2, 140 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The cells were then immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Values of externalized PS correspond to the percentage of cells found in the quadrant annexin V-positive/propidium iodide-negative cells.Flow Cytometric Analysis of DNA Fragmentation—DNA fragmentation of thymocytes was followed by flow cytometry using the sensitive TUNEL method. Murine thymocytes (4–5 × 106) or BW5147 cells (1.2 × 106) were incubated in 1 ml of RPMI supplemented with 1 mg/ml lipid-free BSA and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (CaCl2 final concentration: 0.925 mm) in the absence or the presence of ATPe. At the end of the incubation time, the cells were pelleted for 10 min at 200 × g, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then labeled with fluorescein dUTP at strand breaks by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTSATPe Induces Thymocytes Lysis—It is well established that in lytic cells, plasma membrane disruption leads to the release of cytosolic proteins as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). To check that LDH release discriminates lytic from apoptotic cells, we verified that dexamethasone, a well established apoptotic agent for thymocytes (37Distelhorst C.W. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), does not induce LDH release. Indeed, after 2 h of incubation, LDH released represents 5.0 ± 0.8% and 4.9 ± 0.7% of total LDH in untreated and 0.1 μm dexamethasone-treated BALB/c thymocytes, respectively. In contrast, 1 mm ATPe (74.5 μm ATP4–) leads to a time-dependent release of LDH, reaching a maximum of about 50% of total LDH after 5 h (Fig. 1A). Increasing the ATPe concentration from 0.1 to 3 mm enhanced LDH release by about 6-fold (Fig. 1B) with a maximal effect at 1 mm ATPe. Cell lysis measured through the index of LDH release is in agreement with the number of trypan blue-positive cells (data not shown). To determine whether LDH released originates from cells of the T cell lineage, macrophages, B lymphocytes, and dendritic cells were removed from thymocytes suspension by immunomagnetic depletion with monoclonal anti-mouse major histocompatibility complex class II antibodies. We found that ATPe-triggered LDH release in purified thymocytes is identical to that of the unfractionated preparation of thymocytes (data not shown).To examine whether cell lysis is due to a sustained stimulation with ATPe, we performed experiments in which the medium containing 1 mm ATPe was removed after a 30-min incubation and then replaced by fresh medium for a further 4.5 h. In those conditions, the amount of LDH released in response to ATPe was reduced by about 40% (Fig. 1C), indicating that prolonged purinergic stimulation is required for a cytolytic effect. ATPe-triggered cell lysis has been shown in some cases to be a caspase-mediated process (10Le Feuvre R.A. Brough D. Iwakura Y. Takeda K. Rothwell N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3210-3218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD (50 μm), was unable to inhibit LDH released after 2 h of incubation of BALB/c thymocytes with 1 mm ATPe (Fig. 1D), whereas it completely abrogates dexamethasone-induced apoptosis of thymocytes (data not shown and Ref. 37Distelhorst C.W. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This result indicates that ATPe-triggered LDH release is a caspase-independent process in thymocytes.Involvement of P2X7R in ATPe-induced Thymocytes Lysis—To determine the identity of the purinergic receptors involved in ATPe-triggered cell lysis, we first examined the expression of P2XR mRNAs in murine thymocytes. C57BL/6 thymocytes were shown to express P2X1, P2X2, P2X6, and P2X7 purinergic receptors (33Freedman B.D. Liu Q.H. Gaulton G. Kotlikoff M.I. Hescheler J. Fleischmann B.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We found that P2X1, P2X2, and P2X7 receptors are expressed in BALB/c thymocytes. 2R. Auger, unpublished data. We then tested the effects of different purinergic receptor agonists or antagonists. As indicated in Fig. 2A, 250 μm BzATP, a potent P2X7R agonist, triggers cell lysis, whereas 1 mm UTP, a P2Y agonist, has no effect, suggesting that P2X7R may be implicated in this phenomenon. Thus, we determined the ATPe-triggered cell lysis in the presence of two well known P2X7R antagonists, oATP and PPADS. oATP and PPADS used alone did not affect thymocyte survival significantly. However, they reduced LDH release induced by 1 mm ATPe, to 7 and 15%, respectively (Fig. 2A). In addition, ATPe does not trigger LDH release from P2X7R–/– thymocytes, whereas about 20% LDH release is observed in P2X7R+/+ thymocytes (Fig. 2B). Thus, ATPe-induced cell lysis appears to be controlled by P2X7R.Fig. 2Implication of P2X7R on ATPe-induced LDH release of murine thymocytes. A, effect of different purinergic receptor agonists or antagonists on LDH release. BALB/c thymocytes were treated with 1 mm ATPe, 0.25 mm BzATP, or 1 mm UTP for 3 h. Supernatants were collected for LDH content determination. When antagonists were tested, thymocytes were preincubated for 2 h with 0.3 mm oATP and for 15 min with 0.3 mm PPADS. The amounts of LDH released are expressed as a percentage of the amounts of total LDH. Data are means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. B, effect of ATPe on LDH release in thymocytes from P2X7R-deficient mice. Thymocytes from wild-type BDF1 (WT) mice or P2X7R–/– mice were stimulated with 1 mm ATPe for 2 h. Supernatants were collected for LDH content determination. Data are means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. C, effect of ATPe-triggered LDH release from C57BL/6 thymocytes and BW5147 cells. Cells were incubated with 1 mm ATPe for 5 h, and supernatants were collected for LDH content determination.

To analyze the role of the C-terminal region of P2X7R in ATPe-induced cell lysis, we used thymocytes from C57BL/6 mice, which bear a natural mutation (P451L) in the C-terminal tail of P2X7R, associated to a drastic reduction of ATPe-dependent pore formation and PS externalization (6Adriouch S. Dox C. Welge V. Seman M. Koch-Nolte F. Haag F. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4108-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows that ATPe-triggered lysis in C57BL/6 thymocytes is reduced by almost 45% compared with BALB/c thymocytes. We next used BW5147 thymoma cells, which have also impaired responses to ATPe. Indeed, upon ATPe stimulation, a functional Ca2+ channel is formed in these cells while there is no opening of the nonspecific pore (38Humphreys B.D. Virginio C. Surprenant A. Rice J. Dubyak G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows that BW5147 cells are marginall"
https://openalex.org/W2071078803,"Akt/PKB is a crucial regulator of diverse cellular processes and contributes to cancer progression. Activation of Akt is essentially dependent on phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling. Here, we describe a novel mediator of Akt that is independent of PI 3-kinase. This mediator, PIKE-A, is a PIKE isoform and contains GTPase, pleckstrin homology, ArfGAP, and ankyrin repeats domains. PIKE-A directly binds to activated Akt but not PI 3-kinase in a guanine nucleotide-dependent way and stimulates the kinase activity of Akt. Overexpression of PIKE-A enhances Akt activity and promotes cancer cell invasion, whereas dominant-negative PIKE-A and PIKE-A knockdown markedly inhibit these processes. Our results demonstrate that PIKE-A is a physiologic regulator of Akt and an oncogenic effector of cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2102308786,"The molybdenum cofactor (Moco), a highly conserved pterin compound coordinating molybdenum (Mo), is required for the activity of all Mo-dependent enzymes with the exception of nitrogenase. Moco is synthesized by a unique and evolutionary old multi-step pathway with two intermediates identified so far, the sulfur-free and metal-free pterin derivative precursor Z and molybdopterin, a pterin with an enedithiolate function essential for Mo ligation. The latter pterin component is believed to form a tetrahydropyranopterin similar to the one found for Moco in the crystal structure of Mo as well as tungsten (W) enzymes. Here we report the spectroscopic characterization and structure elucidation of precursor Z purified from Escherichia coli overproducing MoaA and MoaC, two proteins essential for bacterial precursor Z synthesis. We have shown that purified precursor Z is as active as precursor Z present in E. coli cell extracts, demonstrating that no modifications during the purification procedure have occurred. High resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry afforded a [M + H]+ ion compatible with a molecular formula of C10H15N5O8P. Consequently 1H NMR spectroscopy not allowed structural characterization of the molecule but confirmed that this intermediate undergoes direct oxidation to the previously well characterized non-productive follow-up product compound Z.

Science. 1996; 272: 1599-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mo enzymes are important for diverse metabolic processes such as sulfur detoxification and purine catabolism in mammals (3Enemark J.H. Cosper M.M. Met. Ions Biol.

Plant Sci. 1999; 18: 33-69Crossref Google Scholar). Moco consists of an organic moiety originally called molybdopterin (5Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1783-1786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a tetrahydropyranopterin that carries a terminal phosphate group and a Mo atom bound to an enedithiolate system (Fig. 1) (6Schindelin H. Kisker C. Rajagopalan K.V. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 58: 47-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In all of the organisms studied so far, Moco is synthesized by an ancient and highly conserved pathway (7Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 317-368PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, a mutation in any of the steps of Moco biosynthesis results in the pleiotropic loss of sulfite oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and xanthine oxidoreductase activity (8Duran M.

In addition, many prokaryotes, mainly archaea, contain metallo-enzymes with a similar tetrahydropyranopterin enedithiolate cofactor that coordinates W instead of Mo. Therefore, the basic tetrahydropyranopterin component of Mo and W enzymes will be abbreviated as MPT, which stands for molybdopterin or metal-binding tetrahydropyranopterin enedithiolate (11Fischer B. Burgmayer S.J. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 265-316PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fischer B. Enemark J.H. Basu P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 72: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is also believed that W cofactor biosynthesis is similar to Moco biosynthesis with the exception of the final metal insertion step (7Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 317-368PubMed Google Scholar). Moco biosynthesis (Fig. 1) can be divided into three steps (7Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Met. Ions Biol.

Initially, the sulfur-free precursor Z is synthesized from a guanosine derivative by the action of two proteins (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Götze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S. Bacher A. Simon H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the second step, precursor Z is converted to MPT by the incorporation of two sulfur atoms at the C1′ and C2′ positions (see numbering in Fig. 1), forming an enedithiolate function (16Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3373-3378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed by the heterotetrameric enzyme MPT synthase (17Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that transfers two sulfur atoms from two thiocarboxylated small subunits to the carbon atoms C1′ and C2′ (18Gutzke G.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the last step of Moco biosynthesis, a Mo atom is transferred to one (prokaryotes and eukaryotes) or two (prokaryotes) MPT enedithiolates, resulting in the formation of Moco (20Kuper J. Palmer T. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6475-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

In bacteria, an additional modification of the pterin phosphate by nucleotide attachment has been found (22Johnson J.L. Bastian N.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on this finding, it was suggested that the tetrahydropyran is either already present in the intermediates (12Fischer B. Enemark J.H. Basu P. J. Inorg.

Bray R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 782-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). So far, neither MPT nor precursor Z has been studied by 1H or 13C NMR spectroscopy or crystallized, which leaves the question open whether or not the pterin side chain forms a tetrahydropyranopterin structure in an early stage of the biosynthetic pathway. The structure of precursor Z has been proposed based on the structure of the oxidation product (28Johnson J.L. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13440-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 31P NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry (MS) as well as oxidation studies (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The direct stoichiometric conversion of precursor Z by a two-electron oxidation to the stable oxidation product compound Z suggested a dihydro-state of precursor Z, which was explained by a quinonoid structure and an enol function in C1′ that might be subjected to a keto-enol tautomerization (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to compound Z, precursor Z is free of sulfur and contains a cyclic phosphate functionality bridging C2′ and C4′. In comparison to MPT and Moco, precursor Z is the most stable intermediate with an estimated half-life of several hours at a low pH (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have established a method for the purification of large amounts of precursor Z derived from E. coli. We report a detailed spectroscopic analysis and structural characterization of precursor Z. Using 1H NMR and MS methods, we demonstrate that precursor Z already possesses a fully reduced tetrahydropyranopterin structure and is predominately hydrated at the C1′ position resulting in a geminal diol.

The complete moaC expression unit with the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-regulatable T7 promoter/operator element, and the synthetic ribosomal binding site of pPH15moaC was then subcloned between the SphI and HindIII sites of pLysS (Novagen), resulting in pPHLysmoaC.

For standard HPLC purifications, cells were re-suspended in two volumes of 0.4 m HCl, sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation.

The clear supernatant was injected onto a semi-preparative reversedphase column (C8, 5 μm, 250 × 10 mm, Kromasil, EKA Chemicals) equilibrated in 5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0. Precursor Z was eluted in the first absorbing peak and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. In the second step, precursor Z-containing samples were pooled and loaded onto a semi-preparative strong anion exchange column (15 μm, 250 × 10 mm, Adsorbosphere, Alltech) equilibrated with 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 3.0. Precursor Z was eluted isocratically with starting buffer between 20 and 30 ml and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Final purification was achieved by loading the precursor Z onto an analytical reversed-phase column (C18, 5 μm, 250 × 4 mm, Alltech) equilibrated in 10 mm formic acid. Precursor Z-containing fractions were pooled and frozen in 20-μl aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until further use. Precursor Z concentrations were determined using the extinction coefficient of ϵ267 nm = 8960 m cm–1 (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Synthesis of Precursor Z—Precursor Z was converted into molybdopterin using thiocarboxylated E. coli molybdopterin synthase (18Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in a 5-ml volume of reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) containing either purified precursor Z (160 pmol) or a precursor Z-containing (220 pmol) cell crude extract of MJ7 chlM(DE3) cells also used for precursor Z purification and 90 pmol of molybdopterin synthase. The cell extract was freshly prepared by resuspending 300 mg of E. coli cells in 800 μl of reaction buffer, sonication, and clarification. First, the enzyme was diluted in 2.5 ml of reaction buffer. Second, the reaction was started with the addition of 2.5 ml of precursor Z-containing reaction buffer. The reaction was stopped by mixing 400 μl of the reaction mixture with 50 μl of iodine solution (1% I2, 2% KI, 1 m HCl). Molybdopterin content was determined by HPLC FormA analysis as described previously (32Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—Precursor Z was dissolved in a 1:1 (v:v) methanol, 1% formic acid solution. Approximately, 3 μl of this solution (final concentration of 20 pmol/μl) were filled into a gold-coated nanospray glass capillary (Protana). The tip of the capillary was placed orthogonally in front of the entrance hole of a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF 2) mass spectrometer (Micromass) equipped with a nanospray ion source, and a voltage of ∼1000 V was applied. For collision-induced dissociation experiments, parent ions were selectively transmitted from the quadrupole mass analyzer into the collision cell. Argon was used as the collision gas, and the kinetic energy was set at around –25 eV. The resulting daughter ions were then separated by the orthogonal time-of-flight mass analyzer. The isotopic composition of the sample was determined in the accurate mass mode using reserpine ([M + H]+ = 609.2811 Da) as an internal reference compound. 1H NMR Spectroscopy—One- and two-dimensional 1H NMR correlation (COSY) spectra were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker Avance DMX600 NMR spectrometer locked to the major deuterium resonance of the solvent D2O. Chemical shifts are given in parts/million relative to the residual signal of the solvent (4.80 ppm), and couplings are given in hertz. Precursor Z-containing samples (100–200 μg) were freeze-dried and re-suspended in 700 μl of degassed D2O and 2 μl of DCl at 36%. To reduce oxidation, nitrogen gas was bubbled into the tube for 5 min. These solutions were sufficiently stable to allow the accumulation of both one-dimensional and two-dimensional COSY spectra. Subsequently, exposure of the solution (400–800 μm in 700 μl) to air (opening the NMR tube) caused oxidation of the precursor to the well documented major single product, compound Z, and this reaction was followed by taking one-dimensional 1H spectra at regular intervals. Normally, the reaction was completed after 14 days in D2O and DCl at room temperature. Isolation and Purification of Precursor Z—Precursor Z was isolated from E. coli and purified using a three-step HPLC chromatographic procedure that yielded a homogenous product as proven by UV-visible (data not shown), ESI-MS, and 1H NMR spectroscopy (see below). An average yield of purified precursor Z was 40 μg/liter E. coli culture with a final concentration of 30–60 μg/ml. The isolated compound was identical with previous preparations (12Fischer B. Enemark J.H. Basu P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 72: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) because it showed the same UV-visible absorption spectrum with a maximum absorption at 267 nm, pH 3.0, and yielded the same unambiguously characterized oxidation product, compound Z, upon exposure to air (data not shown). Activity of Purified Precursor Z—To prove the activity of purified precursor Z, we have performed in vitro molybdopterin synthesis experiments using recombinant E. coli molybdopterin synthase (18Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The conversion of 160 pmol of precursor Z with 90 pmol of thiocarboxylated molybdopterin synthase followed a linear reaction kinetic over the first 40-s reaction time and reached completion after 1–2 min (Fig. 2A). Because the reaction is stoichiometric, we have observed the formation of 80–85 pmol of molybdopterin. Comparing the reaction curve of purified precursor Z with that of precursor Z (220 pmol) extracted from MJ7 chlM(DE3) cells by using a physiological buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) revealed an absolutely similar kinetic behavior (Fig. 2B). This finding clearly demonstrates that both purified precursor Z as well as precursor Z present in cell crude extracts are functionally similar in their reaction to molybdopterin, indicating that during the course of purification no modifications have occurred. ESI-MS of Precursor Z—ESI-MS was employed to determine the molecular mass of precursor Z. Positive ion mode ESI-MS afforded a [M + H]+ ion at 364 Da (Fig. 3A), which was 18 Da higher than the expected mass of 346 Da for the previously proposed structure (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed there was no evidence for such a peak in the spectrum. A further small peak in the spectrum (Fig. 3A) at 344 Da corresponds to the mass expected for compound Z (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is invariably present in such samples because of partial oxidation (Fig. 3A). This fact has also been confirmed by 1H NMR analysis (see below). In contrast to earlier attempts using thermospray or fast atom bombardment ionization, we were able to obtain an accurate mass in the positive ion ESI-MS mode of precursor Z of 364.064 ± 0.003 Da (364.0658 Da calculated for C10H15N5O8P). Thus, the molecular formula of precursor Z is C10H14N5O8P, which is incompatible with that proposed previously of C10H12N5O7P (12Fischer B. Enemark J.H. Basu P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 72: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The new formula of the 364-Da peak suggests a hydration of precursor Z that most probably might be at the C1′ position for which a single hydroxylation function with a possible keto-enol tautomerization has been proposed (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The additional hydration at the C1′ would then result in the formation of a geminal diol (Fig. 3A). MS/MS of the 364-Da peak resulted in the appearance of a major fragment at 166 Da (Fig. 3B), corresponding to a semioxidized dihydropterin indicating the pterin nature of that peak. The dihydropterin can be easily formed after tetrahydropyran opening without further oxidation (compare with Moco in Fig. 1). Two other peaks have been observed at 121 and 199 Da, probably corresponding to the masses of the side chain without or with the cyclic phosphate, respectively. Furthermore, MS/MS of the 344-Da peak in the precursor Z sample or MS/MS of purified compound Z afforded a similar daughter ion spectrum with a major fragment at 164 Da (data not shown), corresponding to a fully oxidized non-substituted pterin, which is comparable to MS/MS data from other hydrogenated pterins (33Schäfer A. Paul H. Fischer B. Hesse M. Viscontini M. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1995; 78: 1763-1776Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 1H NMR Spectroscopy of Precursor Z—To elucidate the structure of precursor Z and confirm our proposed hydration observed in MS, we have recorded 1H NMR spectra in acidified D2O and have followed the change of signal positions and intensities during oxidation to compound Z (Fig. 4, A–D). On the basis of 1H chemical shifts (Fig. 4, A–C), connectivities from two-dimensional COSY spectra (Fig. 4D), and the magnitude of coupling constants, all expected signals (six protons, Ha–Hf), were unequivocally assigned (Table I). The 1H chemical shifts and coupling constants (1H–1H and 31P–1H) of the oxidation product compound Z were comparable with published data (15Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Götze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S. Bacher A. Simon H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Johnson J.L. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

Coupling constants are indicated in parenthesis: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quintet. Broad peaks are indicated with (br). Open table in a new tab The three 1H NMR signals of protons Ha, Hb, and Hc in precursor Z are comparable with the protons present in the spectrum of compound Z (H′a, H′b, and H′c) in terms of chemical shifts and 1H–1H and 1H–31P coupling constants (Fig. 4 and Table I). These three protons were assigned to C4′ (Ha and Hb) and C3′ (Hc), and the magnitude of the vicinal 1H–31P couplings of the C4′ protons (22.7 and 2.1 Hz, respectively) were indicative of the intact cyclic phosphate (12Fischer B. Enemark J.H. Basu P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 72: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The highest shift of Hc among those three protons indicates significant changes in the environment of C3′ that could be explained by the opening of the proposed tetrahydropyranopterin ring structure in precursor Z during oxidation to compound Z. The signals of the remaining three protons (Hd, He, and Hf) of precursor Z differ significantly from those of compound Z (H′d, H′e, and H′f in Fig. 4 and Table I). Precursor Z shows a 1.7-Hz doublet at 5.39 ppm (Hf) that correlates with the broad doublet (broad signal) at 3.62 ppm (He). These two signals are gradually lost in the conversion to compound Z with the simultaneous emergence of the signal at 9.39 ppm (Hf in Fig. 4, A–C). The chemical shift of the Hf and He signals is comparable with the few pyranopteridines synthesized chemically (34Soyka R. Pfleiderer W. Prewo R. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1990; 73: 808-826Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Independent of the high resolution ESI-MS data, the coupling constants and large difference in chemical shifts of these two protons argues against a previous structure proposal because they would have to belong to a nitrogen-substituted methylene group. The third important signal shows similar vicinal couplings to Hc and P in both precursor Z (Hd) and compound Z but shifts downfield from 4.45 to 6.32 ppm during the oxidation process (Fig. 4 and Table I). These data imply the same relative disposition of Hd with respect to Hc and P in both compounds. The 1.87-ppm difference in the chemical shift of Hd signal strongly favors a significant change in the substituent at C1′ between precursor Z and compound Z, which rules out the possibility of the presence of an unchanged keto function in both compounds. Additional 1H NMR spectra were recorded at different pH values (1, 3, 7, and 10) with no significant changes in proton signals of precursor Z (data not shown). The only noticeable difference at higher pH values was increasing broadness of the He and Hf signals accompanied by a faster oxidation to compound Z. Thus, the high resolution ESI-MS and 1H NMR data for precursor Z, together with changes observed upon oxidation to compound Z, are only compatible with the closed tetrahydropyranopterin structure and a geminal diol in C1′ (Fig. 4E). Finally, precursor Z was also extracted under milder conditions (pH 4.0) to exclude a possible chemical modification that could have been a result of acidification (pH 1.5) during cell lysis. Although the overall yield of precursor Z was much lower because of the increased oxidation of precursor Z at higher pH values, the resulting MS as well as 1H NMR spectra were identical to those of previous preparations (data not shown). Precursor Z was first identified by Wuebbens and Rajagopalan (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and attributed to a dihydropterin structure with a C6-substituted 4-carbon side chain carrying a cyclic phosphate attached to C2′ and C4′ and a hydroxyl function in C1′. Based on the dihydro-state of precursor Z and its relative stability, a quinonoid structure of precursor Z has been suggested with a possible keto-enol tautomerization in the C1′ position (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). New insights into the structure of Moco derived from the crystal structure of Mo enzymes (24Romao M.J. Archer M. Moura I. Moura J.J. LeGall J. Engh R. Schneider M. Hof P. Huber R. Science. 1995; 270: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 35Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C.

Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) raised the question whether or not non-coordinated MPT and/or precursor Z already contain a tetrahydropyranopterin structure (12Fischer B. Enemark J.H. Basu P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 72: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we have addressed this question and verified the side chain structure of precursor Z by applying MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy to sufficiently large amounts of purified precursor Z. The complete functionality of purified precursor Z has been proven by in vitro molybdopterin synthesis that is virtually indistinguishable from the activity of precursor Z present in cell extracts. One aim of this study was to establish the oxidation state of the precursor Z pterin system to clarify its role in the context of the biosynthetic pathway. The observation of two protons at C6 (He) and C7 (Hf) showing a vicinal coupling of 1.7 Hz (COSY) and large chemical shift difference implies that precursor Z is fully hydrogenated in the pyrazine ring of the pterin. A dihydropterin would require a double bond either between N5 and C6 (7,8-dihydro), C6 and C7 (5,8-dihydro), or N8 and C7 (5,6-dihydro). In the case of a 7,8- or 5,8-dihydropterin, the He proton would be lost, whereas for the 5,6-dihydropterin, the presence of a double bond between C7 and N8 would result in a substantial shift to a lower field resonance of the Hf signal (∼7.5 ppm) because of the withdrawing effect of the double bond as observed in other dihydropterins (37Pfleiderer W. Katritzky A.R. Reese C.W. Scriven E.F. Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry. 7. Pergamon, Oxford1996: 679Google Scholar). Furthermore, the chemical shift difference between both pterin protons (He and Hf) of 1.77 ppm is very similar to that found in the few reports on chemically synthesized pyranopteridines (He = 3.1 ppm, Hf = 4.8 ppm in Me2SO) (34Soyka R. Pfleiderer W. Prewo R. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1990; 73: 808-826Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was important to establish whether there is a double bond between C1′ and C2′ as found in MPT and Moco. The presence of the precursor Z signal at 4.41 ppm (Hd), which reveals the same coupling partners as those found in compound Z, allows the assignment of the proton at the C2′ position. Thus, the presence of protons at C2′ and C6 ruled out the presence of double bonds either between C6 and C1′ (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or C1′ and C2′ (26Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because the 1H NMR data did not indicate the presence of a proton at C1′, it was possible that a carbonyl group was positioned at C1′ similar to the one present in compound Z (15Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Götze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S. Bacher A. Simon H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Johnson J.L. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13440-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the high resolution ESI-MS mass spectrum of precursor Z and the strong difference in chemical shift (1.87 ppm) for the C2′-bound Hd proton between precursor Z and compound Z could not be explained with the aromatization of the pterin ring upon oxidation to compound Z. This shift requires in addition a change in the substituents at C1′ with the formation of a geminal diol. Because all of the 1H-NMR and ESI-MS spectra were recorded at acidic pH values of 1–3, the observed geminal diol could be the product of an in vitro hydration catalyzed under acidic conditions. To see whether a carbonyl group would be formed under different pH conditions in an equilibrium reaction, 1H-NMR spectra were recorded at different pH values (pH 1–10). The only difference observed in the spectra was the broadening of the signals of He and Hf, whereas Hd showed no changes. Hence, we can conclude that the geminal diol is the main product at all of the pH ranges. Hydration at the C1′ position of the side chain seems to be a common feature in tetrahydropterins, because an intermediate (6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin) in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin has been shown to possess a geminal diol at the C1′ position with >90% hydroxylation at neutral pH (38Bracher A.

Beside an in vitro hydration, the other possibility might be an in vivo hydration during the synthesis of precursor Z. Therefore, we suggest that the geminal diol in precursor Z and other reduced pterins might serve a protecting function. So far, the theories proposed for the mechanism of precursor Z biosynthesis (15Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Götze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S. Bacher A. Simon H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 39Irby R.B. Adair Jr., W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23981-23987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) do not consider the formation of a geminal diol nor the synthesis of a tetrahydropyranopterin. It has been postulated that precursor Z formation occurs by an alternative cyclohydrolase-like reaction with a guanosine derivative as starting compound (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Götze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S. Bacher A. Simon H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). During precursor Z biosynthesis, all of the carbon atoms of the guanosine are utilized as the imidazole ring C8 atom is retained and incorporated in a rearrangement reaction as C1′ in precursor Z (14Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Götze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S. Bacher A. Simon H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For this reaction, the formation of a transient formyl ester is discussed (15Rieder C. Eisenreich W. O'Brien J. Richter G. Götze E. Boyle P. Blanchard S. Bacher A. Simon H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that might be bound to the conserved and functional important C terminus of proteins of the MOCS1A family (41Hänzelmann P. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18303-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The geminal diol might be the product of the formyl release reaction during precursor Z synthesis. Beside the increase in stability, the geminal diol might serve a second biosynthetic function. We have shown that E. coli MPT synthase transfers two sulfur atoms from two different thiocarboxylated small subunits to precursor Z, suggesting the formation of a one-sulfur intermediate (18Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) whose existence has been demonstrated recently (26Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The transfer of the first sulfur is accompanied with the opening of the cyclic phosphate, suggesting the initial attack at the C2′ position. The latter makes sense in light of the lower reactivity of the geminal diol at C1′ compared with a keto functionality. The second step in the reaction would involve abstraction of both hydroxyl groups and transfer of the second sulfur atom. In summary, we conclude that the basic structure of precursor Z is a tetrahydropyranopterin. This finding clearly demonstrates that not only Moco but also both intermediates of the biosynthetic pathway (precursor Z and MPT) are present as tetrahydropyranopterins and that the opening of this pyrano ring feature will, with a high probability, irreversibly destroy all of the intermediates including the cofactor itself. Both pyrano ring formation and the observed geminal diol functionality in C1′ seem to be important for (i) protecting precursor Z from oxidation, (ii) maintaining the stereochemistry of the pterin C6 position, and (iii) providing the directed reactivity of precursor Z for MPT synthesis. We thank A. Abrahamik and C. Kakosche for recording ESI-MS and 1H NMR spectra, respectively."

Here we provide evidence that Sla1 and Rvs167 are orthologues of the mammalian CIN85 and endophilin proteins, respectively, which are required for ligand-stimulated growth factor receptor internalization. Sla1 is similar in domain structure to CIN85 and binds directly to the endophilin-like Rvs167. Akin to CIN85, Sla1 interacts with synaptojanins and a ubiquitin ligase that regulates endocytosis. This ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5, binds directly to both Sla1 and Rvs167. The interaction between Rsp5 and Rvs167 is mediated through Rsp5 WW domains and PXY motifs in the central Gly-Pro-Ala-rich domain of Rvs167.

Rvs167 ubiquitination is not required for general function of Rvs167, but may control specific Rvs167 SH3 domain-protein interactions or negatively regulate SH3 domain activity. A diverse protein network is required to sort and internalize cell surface cargo into primary endocytic vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane. Many protein-protein interactions between members of this network have been mapped, suggesting a dynamic process that must be exquisitely temporally and spatially regulated. Phosphorylation is an important regulator of interaction between endocytic proteins (1Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.-C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), particularly as a modification that can disassemble endocytic complexes to prepare for another cycle of cargo sorting and vesicle formation. Recently, interaction with ubiquitin ligases and post-translational modification by ubiquitin have also emerged as important regulators of endocytic proteins (3Dunn R. Hicke L. J. Biol.

Several ubiquitin ligases play key roles in regulating transport through the endocytic pathway, in particular ubiquitin ligases of the Nedd4 and Cbl families. These proteins ubiquitinate multiple components of the endocytic machinery (e.g. see Refs. 4Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P.

Dunn R. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is the principal signal for the entry of plasma membrane cargo into primary endocytic vesicles in yeast and can also function as an internalization signal in mammalian cells (13Nakatsu F.

Ubiquitin-dependent internalization relies on proteins that orchestrate the selection of endocytic cargo, rearrangements of the underlying actin cytoskeleton at the plasma membrane, and deformation and scission of the plasma membrane. Of these proteins, epsin, Eps15, β-arrestin, and CIN85 are known to be ubiquitinated. Specifically, they are modified with monoubiquitin (4Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A number of observations suggest that CIN85/CMS regulates the actin cytoskeleton and may act as one link between actin polymerization and receptor internalization (e.g. see Refs. 21Lynch D.K.

The Cbl ubiquitin ligase was recently found to recruit a complex of CIN85 with another endocytic protein, endophilin, to facilitate the internalization of activated, ubiquitinated growth factor receptors (5Soubeyran P.

Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CIN85 is monoubiquitinated at an unknown site(s) by both Nedd4 and Cbl (7Haglund K. Shimokawa N. Szymkiewicz I.

Both proteins have N-terminal BAR (Bin, amphiphysin, Rvs) domains that mediate lipid interactions in vitro and a C-terminal SH3 domain that binds to dynamin and to the polyphosphoinositide phosphatases, synaptojanins (24David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. de Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 25Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Endophilin and amphiphysin are localized to the highly curved necks that link a deeply invaginated vesicle to the donor membrane (30Bauerfeind R. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol.

Like CIN85, endophilin is implicated in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Endophilin binds to and regulates N-WASP, an activator of actin polymerization (29Otsuki M. Itoh T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6461-6469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, after treatment of cells with growth factor, the CIN85-endophilin complex recruits cortactin, another regulator of actin polymerization (21Lynch D.K. Winata S.C. Lyons R.J. Hughes W.E.

The yeast endophilin/amphiphysin homologue, Rvs167 (reduced viability upon starvation 167), shares structural features of both mammalian proteins and functions in both endocytosis and actin regulation (32Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Here we identify endocytic proteins that bind to Rsp5, the sole yeast homologue of the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases. Rsp5, like most Nedd4 family members, contains a N-terminal C2 domain, WW protein-protein interaction domains, and a C-terminal catalytic HECT (homology to E6-AP Cterminus) domain. We find that Rsp5 co-precipitates with the interacting proteins Sla1 and Rvs167 required for receptor internalization and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. We further investigate the similarity of yeast Sla1-Rvs167 to the mammalian CIN85-endophilin complex and the consequences of Rsp5 interaction with Sla1 and Rvs167.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Media, and Reagents—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Genetic manipulations were performed by standard techniques, and cell transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method (34Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). The rvs167Δ::TRP1 disruption has been described (33Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol.

Sodium chloride (1 m) was added to 2% agar-containing medium prior to autoclaving. The growth medium of rsp5Δ (LHY2492) and congenic RSP5 (LHY2491) cells was supplemented with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm oleic acid (free acid; Sigma) to rescue the lethality of the rsp5Δ mutation.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeaAll strains are MATa unless specified otherwiseLHY10ste2Δ::LEU2 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 bar1-1LHY23rsp5-1 ura3 leu2 trp1 bar1LHY291his3 trp1 lys2 ura3 leu2 bar1LHY501end4-1 ura3 leu2 his4 bar1LHY1850ura3Δ met15Δ leu2Δ his3ΔLHY2085rvs167Δ::TRP1 trp1 ura3 leu2, his3 and/or his4 bar1LHY2086MATα rvs167Δ::TRP1 trp1 ura3 leu2 ade2 his3 and/or his4 bar1LHY2088ade2 leu2 trp1 ura3 his3 and/or his4 bar1LHY2089ste2Δ::LEU2 rvs167Δ::TRP1 ade2 ura3 leu2 bar1LHY2363pRVS167-HA[URA3] rvs167Δ::TRP1 trp1 ura3 leu2 his3 and/or his4 bar1LHY2422bThese strains were obtained from EUROSCARF (Microbiology Institute, Frankfurt, Germany)hul4Δ::kanMX4 ura3Δ met15Δ leu2Δ his3ΔLHY2423bThese strains were obtained from EUROSCARF (Microbiology Institute, Frankfurt, Germany)hul5Δ::kanMX4 ura3Δ met15Δ leu2Δ his3ΔLHY2491leu2 his3 ura3 trp1LHY2492rsp5Δ::HIS3 leu2 ura3 trp1 bar1LHY2510pRVS167P398A,P399A-HA[URA3] rvs167Δ::TRP1 trp1 ura3 leu2 bar1 his3 or his4LHY2529bThese strains were obtained from EUROSCARF (Microbiology Institute, Frankfurt, Germany)rvs167Δ::kanMX4 bar1 trp1 leu2 ura3 his3LHY2579pRVS167[URA3] rvs167Δ::kanMX4 bar1 trp1 leu2 ura3 his3LHY2582pRVS167-AAAY[URA3] rvs167Δ::kanMX4 bar1 trp1 leu2 ura3 his3LHY2627pRVS167-370Stop[URA3] rvs167Δ::kanMX4 bar1 trp1 leu2 ura3 his3LHY2664pRVS167-K290R[URA3] rvs167Δ::kanMX4 bar1 trp1 leu2 ura3 his3LHY2665pRVS167-K481R[URA3] rvs167Δ::kanMX4 bar1 trp1 leu2 ura3 his3LHY2726pHA-Vps9[LEU2] vps9Δ::kanMX4 his3 leu2 met15 ura3LHY2769pRVS167-AAAY[URA3] rvs167Δ::kanMX4 bar1 trp1 leu2 ura3 his3LHY2793pHA-ARC15[URA3] pYEplac112[TRP1] his3 trp1 lys2 ura3 leu2 bar1LHY2794pHA-ARC15[URA3] pCUP1-cmyc-UBI[TRP1] his3 trp1 lys2 ura3 leu2 bar1LHY2795pHA-ARC15[URA3] pCUP1-UBI[TRP1] his3 trp1 lys2 ura3 leu2 bar1LHY3111pRVS167-P372A,AAAY[URA3] rvs167Δ::kanMX4 bar1 trp1 leu2 ura3 his3LHY3112pRVS167-P334,372A,AAAY[URA3] rvs167Δ::kanMX4 bar1 trp1 leu2 ura3 his3LHY3113pRVS167-Δ PPPAY[URA3] rvs167Δ::kanMX4 bar1 trp1 leu2 ura3 his3LHY4050rsp5Δ::HIS3 trp1 ura3 his3 leu2LHY4366pRSP5[TRP1] rsp5Δ::HIS3 trp1 ura3 his3 leu2LHY4368pRSP5-ww1AxxP[TRP1] rsp5Δ::HIS3 trp1 ura3 his3 leu2LHY4370pRSP5-ww2AxxP[TRP1] rsp5Δ::HIS3 trp1 ura3 his3 leu2LHY4372pRSP5-ww3AxxP[TRP1] rsp5Δ::HIS3 trp1 ura3 his3 leu2LHY4374pRSP5-ww1AxxPww2AxxPww3AxxP[TRP1] rsp5Δ::HIS3 trp1 ura3 his3 leu2LHY4842pSTE2-3xHA[URA3] ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0LHY4845pSTE2-3xHA[URA3] sla1Δ::kanMX4 his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0LHY4851pHA-INP52[LEU2] his3 trp1 lys2 ura3 leu2 bar1a All strains are MATa unless specified otherwiseb These strains were obtained from EUROSCARF (Microbiology Institute, Frankfurt, Germany) Open table in a new tab Purification of polyclonal Ste2 antibodies was performed as previously described (36Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). His6 antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and GST antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Rvs167, Sla1, and hexokinase antisera were gifts from Howard Riezman (University of Geneva, Switzerland), Gregory Payne (UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA), and Gottfried Schatz (Biozentrum, University of Basel, Switzerland), respectively, and monoclonal HA (12CA5) antibodies were kindly provided by Robert Lamb (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL). Rsp5 for antibody production was purified from Escherichia coli expressing GST-Rsp5 from the pGEX-6P-1 vector (Ben Sehgal and Hilary Godwin, Northwestern University). The fusion protein was isolated on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and Rsp5 was cleaved with Prescission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Purified Rsp5 was used for injection of two rabbits (Covance Research Products Inc., Denver, PA).Plasmid Construction—RVS167 yeast expression plasmids were based on a URA3 marked centromeric plasmid, pFBKS (a gift from Florian Bauer) (32Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A triple hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was introduced at the C terminus of RVS167 by two steps. First, a NotI site was introduced at the 3′-end of RVS167 by QuikChange™ mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create pRVS167-NotI (LHP1026). A triple HA epitope was ligated into the NotI site to generate pRVS167-HA (LHP1027). RVS167-HA completely rescued the growth and internalization defects of rvs167Δ cells.Site-directed Pro → Ala mutations in pFBKS were generated by sequential QuikChange™ mutagenesis (prvs167P398A,P399A, LHP1131; prvs167P372A,P398A,P399A, LHP1439; prvs167P334A,P372A,P398A,P399A, LHP1450). The ΔPP-PAY mutation (LHP1436) was introduced by mutagenic QuikChange™ oligonucleotides that looped out the PPPAY sequence (codons 397–401) of pFBKS. Plasmids encoding hexahistidine (His6)-tagged Rvs167 or Sla1 fragments were generated by ligation-independent cloning of the appropriate PCR fragments into the pET-30 bacterial expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) to construct the RVS167 plasmids pET30-BAR (codons 1–291; LHP1494), pET30-GPA (codons 292–427; LHP1495), pET30-SH3 (codons 428–482; LHP1496), and pET30-RVS167 (codons 1–482; LHP1497) or the SLA1 plasmids pET30-1–420 (LHP2017), pET30-420–720 (LHP2018), and pET30-720–1240 (LHP2019). Introduction of the appropriate mutations or the in-frame fusion of the His6 tag in plasmids was verified by automated sequencing.Plasmid pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences) was used for production of GST-Sla1. Plasmids encoding GST fused to the N terminus of Sla1 (codons 1–420; LHP2098) or to a central fragment (codons 420–720; LHP2099) were generated by PCR amplification of the appropriate DNA using BamHI site-containing oligonucleotides. The PCR products were digested and ligated into BamHI-digested pGEX-6P-2. The in-frame fusions were verified by automated sequencing.Plasmids used for production of GST and GST-Rsp5 were pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) and pGST-RSP5 (a gift from Jon Huibregtse, University of Texas, Austin, TX). A plasmid encoding GST fused to the three WW domains of RSP5 (pGST-3×WW, LHP703) was generated by PCR amplification of the WW domains (codons 228–430) using a 5′ EcoRI site-containing oligonucleotide and a 3′ XhoI site-containing oligonucleotide. The PCR product was digested and ligated into EcoRI- and XhoI-digested pGEX-PKT (37Sehgal B.U. Dunn R. Hicke L. Godwin H.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).INP52 was amplified from yeast genomic DNA using 5′ PstI and 3′ BamHI site-containing oligonucleotides, digested and ligated into PstI- and BamHI-digested YCplac22 to yield plasmid LHP1459. The NotI site was inserted at the 5′-end of INP52 in LHP1459 via QuikChange™ mutagenesis. A triple HA epitope was ligated into the NotI site to generate pHA-INP52 (LHP1463). A PstI-SacI HA-INP52 fragment was subcloned into a LEU2-marked multicopy plasmid (YEplac181) digested with PstI and SacI to generate LHP2077.Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—RVS167 (codons 74–482) and RSP5 (codons 1–809) were cloned into the GAL4 yeast two-hybrid fusion vectors pAS2-1 and pACT2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), respectively, by standard procedures. The plasmids and control vectors were transformed into Y190 cells (Clontech), and three independent cultures of representative transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity according to the manufacturer's protocol.Preparation of Cell Lysates for Immunoblotting—For detection of Ste2, cell extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis and SDS/urea extraction as previously described (35Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). For detection of ubiquitinated Rvs167, cell lysates were prepared by alkaline lysis and trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described (38Horvath A. Riezman H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Native Co-immunoprecipitations—Cells were lysed in native immunoprecipitation buffer (0.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 25 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) containing yeast protease inhibitors by vortexing the cell suspension with acid-washed glass beads 4–6 times with intervening rests on ice. Whole cell lysates were extracted with 2 mg/ml β-d-maltoside for 30–60 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A fraction of each cleared lysate was reserved for analysis, and the remainder was incubated with Rsp5 antiserum followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were collected at 100 × g and washed four times in native immunoprecipitation buffer containing yeast protease inhibitors. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting.GST Fusion Protein Precipitation Experiments—GST pull-down experiments with yeast lysates were performed as previously described with minor modifications (35Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared in MES lysis buffer with the addition of 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were extracted with 2 mg/ml β-d-maltoside and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing equivalent amounts (∼20 μg each) of GST, GST-3×WW, or GST-Rsp5 for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After the binding incubation, beads were washed four times in MES lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting.E. coli cells were induced to express His6-tagged Rvs167 proteins with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1–3 h. Cells expressing full-length His6-Rvs167 were lysed by pulsed sonication in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. The lysate was extracted with 1% Triton X-100 and clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C. A fraction of the cleared lysate was reserved for analysis, and the remainder was split into equal aliquots and incubated with GST, GST-3×WW, or GST-Rsp5 glutathione-bound Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After several washes in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors and 0.2% Triton X-100, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Cells expressing His6-tagged GPA and SH3 fragments were lysed by the same procedure in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mm sodium chloride with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The tagged proteins were purified on TALON metal affinity resin according to the manufacturer's recommendations for native purification (Clontech) and eluted with 200 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Purified proteins were diluted into an E. coli cell lysate (prepared as described above) to equivalent concentrations. Binding to GST and GST-3×WW was performed as described for full-length His6-Rvs167. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad) or analyzed by immunoblotting.Immobilization of and Binding to Bacterially Expressed His6-tagged Proteins—His6-tagged Sla1 polypeptides were immobilized on TALON metal affinity resin by preparing bacterial lysates as described above and binding to the beads as previously described (40Shih S.C.

Pull-down assays with the immobilized polypeptides were performed as previously described with several modifications (35Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Bound proteins (10 μg) were incubated with 0.5 mg of yeast lysate proteins containing either Rvs167-HA or HA-Vps9 (9Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) prepared as described above. After the incubation, the beads were washed two times in MES lysis buffer plus 10 mm imidazole and two times in MES buffer plus 20 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer.A yeast lysate containing HA-Inp52 was prepared as previously described (41Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C.

In addition, beads with immobilized His6-tagged polypeptides were preincubated in buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, for 1 h at 4 °C. After the binding incubation, beads were washed two times in lysis buffer, 10 mm imidazole, and 1% Nonidet P-40 and two times with lysis buffer, 20 mm imidazole, and 1% Nonidet P-40.RESULTSThe Rsp5 Ubiquitin Ligase Binds Directly to Rvs167 and Sla1—Genetic studies suggested that Rsp5 regulates components of the receptor internalization machinery (3Dunn R. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25974-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To identify proteins involved in endocytosis that bind to Rsp5, we generated polyclonal rabbit antiserum against full-length native Rsp5. On immunoblots, Rsp5 antiserum recognized a single protein of the expected size in wild type cells but not in rsp5Δ cells (Fig. 1A). We then performed native immunoprecipitations with anti-Rsp5 on lysates prepared from wild type yeast strains, some of which expressed HA-tagged versions of different endocytic proteins. Although interactions with a number of endocytic proteins were observed inconsistently, Rvs167-HA and Sla1 reproducibly co-precipitated with Rsp5 (Fig. 1B). The Rsp5-Rvs167 interaction was further confirmed by yeast two-hybrid experiments (Table II). During the course of this study, a systematic analysis of interactions in the yeast proteome identified a complex containing both Rsp5 and Rvs167, providing a third independent confirmation of this protein-protein interaction (42Ho Y.

Hydrogen peroxide induces a short-lived cyt c-derived tyrosyl radical as detected by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping technique. This investigation was undertaken to characterize the fate and consequences of the cyt c-derived tyrosyl radical. The direct ESR spectrum from the reaction of cyt c with H2O2 revealed a single-line signal with a line width of ∼10 G. The detected ESR signal could be prevented by pretreatment of cyt c with iodination, implying that the tyrosine residue of cyt c was involved.

The endothelium relaxant factor nitric oxide is well known to mediate mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis. The consumption of NO by cyt c was enhanced by addition of H2O2 as verified by inhibition electrochemical detection using an NO electrode.

The above result was further confirmed by NO quenching of the ESR signal of the MNP adduct of cyt c tyrosyl radical. Immunoblotting analysis of cyt c after exposure to NO in the presence of H2O2 revealed the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine. The addition of superoxide dismutase did not change the cyt c nitration, indicating that it is peroxynitrite-independent.

Oxidative stress in mitochondria is a normal physiological process during respiration (1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol.

Genet. 2001; 106: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). During normal mitochondrial respiration, electrons may be released during steps prior to oxidative phosphorylation and subsequently react with molecular oxygen to form superoxide (3Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar), the first product in a chain of reactive oxygen species production. A decrease in the rate of mitochondrial phosphorylation (state 4 respiration) increases the production of superoxide in the early stages of the ETC. Generally, superoxide produced by the ETC is converted to H2O2 by mitochondrial manganese-superoxide dismutase. It has been estimated that ∼2% of the oxygen uptake by mitochondria in state 4 respiration results in production of O2.¯ and H2O2 (4Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Normally, the level of cellular H2O2 can be kept relatively low through the action of mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase and cytosolic catalase. However, under certain conditions such as ischemia reperfusion injury or inflammation, the mitochondria can produce an excess of H2O2 (5Flaherty J.T. Weisfeldt M.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1988; 5: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 6Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Williams R. Rayburn B.K. Smith D. Weisfeldt M.L. Flaherty J.T. J. Biol.

One of the most dominant proteins in mitochondria is cytochrome c (cyt c), the only soluble protein in the ETC. Cyt c has two physiological roles: 1) it mediates electron shuttling between ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) during mitochondrial respiration, and 2) it serves as a factor to regulate preapoptotic events (7Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4448) Google Scholar). Protein radical(s) induced by the reaction of cyt c with H2O2 and other oxidants have been detected by the ESR spin-trapping technique (8Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J.

A direct broad line ESR spectrum from cyt c has been assigned as a peroxynitrite- or H2O2-induced tyrosyl radical (8Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

The direct ESR spectra of protein tyrosyl radicals have been reported in a number of other enzymatic or heme protein systems including prostaglandin H synthase (11DeGray J.A. Gunther M.R.

Med. 2000; 28: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All of these have similar spectral characteristics with a line width (peak to trough) of more than 20 G, which is significantly broader than the parameter of cyt c-derived protein radical. It has also been reported that the cyt c-derived tyrosyl radical can form dityrosine through radical-radical addition as evidenced by H2O2-induced cyt c dimerization (17Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Hsu L.J. Takenouchi T. Masliah E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to re-evaluate the possible fate and consequences of H2O2-induced tyrosyl radical formation from cyt c. In addition to tyrosyl radical-initiated protein dimerization, we hypothesize that two potentially important reactions should be relevant in the mitochondrial and cellular milieu: 1) cyt c-derived tyrosyl radical (Scheme I, structure B), as detected by the ESR spin-trapping technique, is short-lived and subsequently oxidized to a long-lived radical with a narrower line width (compared with that of protein tyrosyl radical), forming a novel protein-derived tyrosine ortho-semiquinone radical (ToQ.) (Scheme I, structure C). This ortho-semiquinone anion radical can be stabilized by complexing with Zn2+ in acidic medium (Scheme I, structure D). 2) The endothelium relaxant factor NO, which can mediate a number of mitochondrial functions (18Moncada S. Erusalimsky J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), is capable of trapping the cyt c-derived tyrosyl radical at a favorable rate (1-2 × 109m-1 s-1), leading to the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine (Scheme I, structure E) (19Sturgeon B.E.

In the present work we have used a newly established technique combining metal divalent cation trapping with an approach based on the chemistry of heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent to characterize the cyt c-derived ToQ.. Cyt c nitration from NO trapping of the tyrosyl radical was identified by immunochemistry. This pathway of cyt c nitration is important in understanding the fundamental mechanism by which oxidants and NO induce mitochondrial damage and cellular apoptosis in the pathogenesis of disease. Reagents—Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), horse heart cytochrome c, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), sodium iodide, dithiothreitol, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and nitro blue tetrazolium were purchased from Sigma and used as received. Zinc sulfate heptahydrate, 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP), [3-(3,4-dihydroxylphenyl) l-alanine] (l-DOPA), and sodium hypochlorite (4% chlorine available in solution) were purchased from Aldrich. The 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) spin trap (from Aldrich) was vacuum-sublimed twice and stored under nitrogen at -70 °C until needed. Prepacked Sephadex G-25 (PD-10) size exclusion columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Lysozyme (from hen egg white) and Pronase were obtained from Roche Applied Science. N-Succinimidyl iodoacetate was purchased from Pierce. The NO donor diethylamine nonoate (DEA/NO) was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Perdeuterated MNP (MNP-d9) was provided as a gift from Dr. Joy Joseph (Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI) Analytical Methods—Optical spectra were measured on either an SLM Aminco DW-2000 UV-visible or Cary 300 spectrophotometer. The concentration of cyt c was calculated from the difference spectrum after ascorbate reduction using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 mm-1 cm-1 at 550 nm. H2O2 was purchased from Fisher. The H2O2 concentration was verified using the UV absorption at 240 nm (ϵ = 43.6 m-1 cm-1) (20Chen Y.-R. Gunther M.R. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3308-3314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The concentration of HRP was determined by using an extinction coefficient of 102 mm-1 cm-1 at 402 nm. The protein concentrations of lysozyme and l-DOPA-conjugated lysozyme (l-DOPA-LYS) were determined by the Lowry assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Iodonation of Tyrosine Residues of Cytochrome c—The reaction mixture contained 1-ml aliquots of cyt c (200 μm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and NaI (final concentration of 40 mm). Iodination of tyrosine residues of cyt c was initiated by the addition of two N- chloro-benzenesulfonamide immobilized beads (Iodo Beads; Pierce). The reaction was allowed to proceed on a rapid thermomixer at 23 °C for 15 min. To stop the reaction, the solution was removed from the vessel and passed through a prepacked Sephadex G-25 column to remove excess sodium iodide. The fraction containing iodonated cyt c was collected and measured with UV-visible spectrophotometry to determine its heme concentration, and the protein modification was confirmed with electrospray mass spectrometry (9Chen Y.R. Deterding L.J. Sturgeon B.E. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29781-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Preparation of l-DOPA-conjugated Lysozyme (l-DOPA-LYS)—Lysozyme (33 mg/ml, or 2.3 mm) was dissolved in 50 mm sodium borate buffer prebubbled with argon for 45 min, pH 8.3 (buffer A), and reduced with dithiothreitol (in excess by a factor of 2) at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against buffer A containing 5 mm EDTA overnight with one change of dialysis buffer. l-DOPA (5 mm) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm of NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline) was incubated with an equal amount of N-succinimidyl iodoacetate (SIA, 5 mm in Me2SO) at room temperature for 30 min. The resultant l-DOPA-conjugated SIA was mixed with dithiothreitol-treated lysozyme at a molar ratio of l-DOPA/protein of ∼1.2 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, overnight with one change of buffer. The resultant l-DOPA-LYS was concentrated with centricon-3, and the concentration of protein was adjusted to 10 mg/ml prior to ESR experiments. Electron Spin Resonance Experiments—ESR experiments were carried out on a Bruker EMX spectrometer operating at 9.8 GHz with 100-kHz modulation frequency at room temperature. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 10-mm quartz ESR flat cell, which was then positioned into the SHQ or HS cavity (Bruker Instrument, Billerica, MA). The sample was scanned using the parameters described in the figure legends. The concentration of the MNP adduct of cyt c radical was estimated by using the 4-hydroxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy radical standard (10, 50, and 100 μm) in 50% glycerin. The calibration was performed by using a fingertip Dewar flask containing liquid nitrogen (77 K) and operated at the following instrumental parameters: microwave power, 20 mW; center field, 3374 G; field of sweep, 200 G; scanning time, 30.14 s; time constant, 81.92 ms; receiver gain, 1 × 105; modulation amplitude, 1 G; and signal average, 10 scans. The spin quantitation of each spectrum was obtained by double integration. Nitric Oxide Consumption Rate by Cytochrome c—The NO consumption rate was measured electrochemically at 37 °C in an electrochemical vial using an APOLLO 4000 free radical analyzer and NO electrode (World Precision Institute, Sarasota, FL). The electrochemical detector continuously recorded the current through the working electrode, which is proportional to the NO concentration in the solution. The sensor was calibrated with known concentrations of NO, using NO equilibrated solutions as described in the literature (21Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A.

Immunoblotting Analysis—The reaction mixture was mixed with NuPAGE™ LDS sample buffer at a ratio 3:1 (v/v), incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and immediately loaded onto a 4-12% gradient Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). The samples were run on SDS-PAGE and were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in 25 mm Biocine, 25 mm Bis-Tris, and 10% methanol. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TTBS) with 2.5% bovine serum albumin. The blots were then incubated overnight with anti-nitrotyrosine polyclonal antibody (Up-state Biotechnology Inc.) in TTBS at room temperature, washed three times in TTBS, and incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG in TTBS at room temperature. The blots were washed again, twice in TTBS, and twice in Tris-buffered saline and then visualized using a mixture of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Cell Culture and H2O2-induced Apoptosis as Analyzed with DNA Fragmentation and Mitochondrial Cyt c Release—Rat cardiac myoblasts (H9c2 cell line from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown and maintained in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics in 35-mm polystyrene tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in the presence of 4.5% CO2. Confluent cells with >90% viability were used to conduct the experiments of apoptosis. Apoptosis was induced by exposure of the cells to H2O2 (200 μm) and continued culturing for 0.5, 1, 2,4, and 8 h. The cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were removed, and 330 μl of Sarkosyl detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% w/v sodium N-lauroyl sarcosine, pH 7.5) and 13-μl of proteinase K (15.6 mg/ml) (Roche Applied Science) were added, vortexed, and allowed to digest overnight at 37 °C. RNase A (0.3 mg/ml) was added, and the samples were incubated at 56 °C for 1 h. The lysates were then extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The DNA was precipitated by 3 m sodium acetate and 100% ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and then dried under the vacuum. The purified DNA (2 μg dissolved in Tris/EDTA buffer) was mixed with BlueJuice gel loading buffer (Invitrogen) and then subjected to gel electrophoresis (50 V for 2.5 h) using 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. DNA fragmentation was visualized and examined with ultraviolet light. The release of cyt c from mitochondria into the cytosol was examined by subfractionating the cell as described by Liu et al. (7Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4448) Google Scholar). The prepared soluble cytosol fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis using mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). An equal amount of protein (85 μg) was loaded prior to SDS-PAGE. Direct ESR Spectra from the Reaction of Cyt c with Hydrogen Peroxide—As previously demonstrated, a broad singlet ESR spectrum with a line width of ∼10 G can be detected when cyt c solution is mixed with H2O2 (8Barr D.P.

We confirmed that the detected ESR signal was enhanced when native cyt c was replaced by HOCl-cyt c in the same reaction system (Fig. 1) because of the enhanced peroxidase activity of HOCl-cyt c (9Chen Y.R.

Presumably, the concentration of any globin radical will increase with the peroxidase activity of the heme protein. The addition of heme blockers such as imidazole (100 mm) or cyanide (1 mm) completely inhibited formation of the detected ESR spectrum (data not shown), implying a heme-initiated reaction. The ESR signal was stable and even persisted after dialysis, suggesting a very stable, protein-derived free radical. Formation of the protein radical was prevented by prior iodination of cyt c, thereby indicating that tyrosine residues were involved in the radical formation (Fig. 1). In a parallel experiment, we conducted the same measurement at low temperature (77 K). At this temperature the ∼10-G line width of the ESR spectrum from the reaction system of either cyt c/H2O2 or HOCl-cyt c/H2O2 was not further broadened (data not shown). This failure to broaden indicates a total immobilization of the free radical on the ESR time scale even at room temperature, consistent with a free radical rigidly attached to cyt c. H2O2 induces a Short-lived Cyt c-derived Tyrosyl Radical as Verified by the ESR Spin-trapping Technique—Barr et al. (8Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have reported that H2O2 induces tyrosyl radical(s) derived from cyt c, as detected by ESR spin-trapping techniques. However, our direct ESR spectra indicated that the H2O2-induced protein radical is stable and long-lived. To test whether the cyt c-derived tyrosyl radical as detected by MNP spin trapping is as stable as the above protein radical detected by direct ESR, we did the following experiments. First, we reacted cyt c with H2O2 in the presence of perdeuterated MNP (MNP-d9). The result was an immobilized nitroxide (Fig. 2A). Nonspecific proteolytic digestion of the immobilized nitroxide by Pronase yielded an isotropic three-line spectrum with aN = 15.6 G, indicative of a tyrosyl radical adduct (8Barr D.P. Gunther M.R.

Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). To test the stability of the assigned tyrosyl radical, the spin trap MNP-d9 was added to the reaction mixture after a 1-min incubation of cyt c with H2O2. The intensity of the immobilized nitroxide signal drastically decreased (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the cyt c-derived tyrosyl radical induced by peroxide is short-lived. We also observed an isotropic three-line spectrum with a nitrogen coupling constant of 17.1 G, which we assigned to di-tert-butylnitroxide, a decomposition product of MNP. The formation of cyt c-derived immobilized nitroxide by MNP spin trapping allows us to quantify the amount of cyt c-derived tyrosyl radical as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentration of peroxide-induced MNP adduct of cyt c is estimated to be ∼24 μm, which represents ∼4.8% of cyt c used. However, replacement of cyt c with HOCl-treated cyt c resulted in the enhancement of detected immobilized nitroxide to ∼60 μm (∼12% of HOCl-cyt c used). Spin Stabilization of Protein-derived Radical by Zinc Divalent Ion (Zn2+) Implies the Formation of ToQ. from the Reaction of Cyt c with H2O2—To gain insight into the cyt c-derived protein radical detected by direct ESR, it is necessary to evaluate the fate and consequence of the tyrosyl radical detected by spin trapping. The observation of a short-lived tyrosyl radical prompted us to hypothesize that it could be subsequently oxidized to ToQ.¯ in the absence of spin trap. It has been observed in biological systems that the ortho-semiquinone anion radical can be generated by either enzymatic or nonenzymatic pathways from certain biologically active compounds such as catechol and its derivatives (24Kalyanaraman B.

We took this approach here, using Zn2+ to test for cyt c-derived ToQ.¯ generated by H2O2. As indicated in Fig. 3A, the direct ESR spectrum from the reaction system containing cyt c and H2O2 at pH 7.4 was consistent with the published results by Barr et al. (8Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). When cyt c was reacted with 5 eq of H2O2 in the presence of an excess of Zn2+ (200 eq) at pH 5.5, the ESR spectrum revealed an enhanced signal with a peak-to-trough width of ∼6 G (Fig. 3B). The spectrum of the cyt c/H2O2/Zn2+ reaction system depended on the presence of both the protein (Fig. 3C) and peroxide (Fig. 3D), implying that Zn2+ trapped an immobilized ortho-semiquinone radical within the cyt c protein (24Kalyanaraman B.

When experiments including reaction systems of cyt c/H2O2 and cyt c/H2O2/Zn2+ were carried out at pH 5.5, ESR spectra from the initial and second scans were collected (Fig. 4). In the initial scans, an additional species with a broader line width was present (Fig. 4, A and C); this species subsequently decayed in the second scan to yield only ortho-semiquinone radical (Fig. 4B), which was stabilized and enhanced by Zn2+ trapping (Fig. 4D). The broader direct ESR spectrum is consistent with the short-lived tyrosyl radical detected"
https://openalex.org/W2090336268,"We previously described a family of five RNA-binding proteins: CUG-binding protein, embryonic lethal abnormal vision-type RNA-binding protein 3, and the CUG-binding protein and embryonic lethal abnormal vision-type RNA-binding protein 3-like factors (CELFs) 3, 4, and 5. We demonstrated that all five of these proteins specifically activate exon inclusion of cardiac troponin T minigenes in vivo via muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE) sequences. We also predicted that a sixth family member, CELF6, was located on chromosome 15. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of CELF6. Like the previously described CELF proteins, CELF6 shares a domain structure containing three RNA-binding domains and a divergent domain of unknown function. CELF6 is strongly expressed in kidney, brain, and testis and is expressed at very low levels in most other tissues. In the brain, expression is widespread and maintained from the fetus to the adult. CELF6 activates exon inclusion of a cardiac troponin T minigene in transient transfection assays in an MSE-dependent manner and can activate inclusion via multiple copies of a single element, MSE2. These results place CELF6 in a functional subfamily of CELF proteins that includes CELFs 3, 4, and 5. CELF6 also promotes skipping of exon 11 of insulin receptor, a known target of CELF activity that is expressed in kidney.

CELF6 also promotes skipping of exon 11 of insulin receptor, a known target of CELF activity that is expressed in kidney. Alternative splicing allows the production of multiple mRNA species from a single gene, which often give rise to functionally distinct protein isoforms. Regulation of alternative splicing not only produces multiple mRNAs but can also modulate the levels of these different isoforms in a tissue- or developmental stage-specific manner to meet the functional needs of the cell. Numerous examples of regulated alternative splicing have been found, but few regulatory factors that control cell-specific alternative splicing have been identified. In the best-characterized vertebrate experimental systems, alternative splicing regulation is the result of dynamic antagonism between trans-acting factors binding to positive or negative elements in the pre-mRNA and promoting or repressing the use of alternative splice sites. Some of these elements bind cell-specific splicing factors. For example, neuron-specific inclusion of alternative exons in several pre-mRNAs is mediated by binding of the activator Nova-1, which is expressed only in neurons. This neuron-specific activity is antagonized by binding of the ubiquitously expressed repressor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) in non-neuronal cells (1Grabowski P.J. Black D.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 289-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).

Muscle-specific splicing enhancers (MSEs) in cTNT pre-mRNAs regulate inclusion of exon 5 in striated muscle by binding to activators and repressors of splicing. Negative elements within MSEs upstream and downstream of exon 5 repress exon inclusion in non-muscle cells by binding PTB (2Charlet-B N. Logan P. Singh G. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This repression is antagonized in muscle cells by positive elements within MSEs downstream of exon 5 that bind members of the CUG-binding protein (CUG-BP) and embryonic lethal abnormal vision-type RNA-binding protein 3 (ETR-3)-like factor (CELF) family, promoting exon inclusion (2Charlet-B N.

The splicing of targets of CUG-BP is misregulated in myotonic dystrophy and contributes to insulin resistance (9Savkur R. Phillips A. Cooper T. Nat.

Another CELF family member, ETR-3, has also recently been implicated in the misregulation of splicing in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (11Sironi M. Cagliani R. Comi G. Pozzoli U.

Genomics. 2001; 74: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, CELF proteins are important regulators of cell-specific alternative splicing during normal development and disease. Here we describe a sixth member of the CELF family, CELF6. CELF6 is preferentially expressed in kidney, testis, and brain. Like the previously described CELF proteins, CELF6 activates exon inclusion in fibroblasts via MSEs in transient transfection assays. CELF6 can also activate inclusion via multiple copies of a single element, MSE2, placing it in a functional subfamily of CELF proteins that includes CELFs 3, 4, and 5. Finally, CELF6 promotes skipping of exon 11 in insulin receptor (IR), another known target of CELF activity. Identification and Analysis of CELF6 Sequence—CELF6 was first identified in cosmids from chromosome 15 (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and predicted from high throughput genomic sequence (Ref. 14Good P. Chen Q. Warner S. Herring D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28583-28592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar; GenBank™ accession number AF401233). CELF6 cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human adult brain cDNA (Clontech) as described previously (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Primer sequences were ATCATTTGGATCCATGGCCGCGGCGCCGGGAGGGT and AATCGATCTCGAGTCAGTAAGGCCGGTTGGCATCC. PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA3.1HisC vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the N-terminal Xpress epitope tag, and sequences were confirmed by overlapping reads of both strands. Sequence profile and phlyogenetic analyses were performed as described previously (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Northern and Dot Blots—Commercial Northern and RNA dot blots (Clontech) were hybridized against a CELF6 3′-UTR probe generated by PCR from human adult brain cDNA (Clontech) using the primers TGACCTGCTTTCACTGACCAG and AGTCCTTTGGTCCCTAAACTC. 3′-UTR probes were likewise generated for CELF3 (GTCTGGAGATCCCAGAGGAAG and AAACCCCTAATGTGGGGAAGA), CELF4 (ACGCCAATCGCCCGTACTGAG and CATCTTCTTCTTCATGTCATATATATT), and CELF5 (TGTCCTCCATCCCCCGTTTCTGTT and TAAATCACCATCGCTGTCGTC). The PCR products were cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid using the ZeroBlunt TOPO Cloning kit (Invitrogen), cut with EcoRI, and gel isolated using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). CUG-BP was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) from a CUG-BP/Nab50 plasmid provided by L. Timchenko (Baylor College of Medicine), and a 3′-UTR probe was excised with HincII and BstBI. ETR-3 was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector from a phage clone provided by Dr. C. C. Liew (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), and a 3′-UTR probe was excised with PvuII and NotI. Probes were end-labeled using Random Primed Labeling Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed at 68 °C in Express Hyb solution (Ambion). Cotransfection Experiments—R35C, RTBPSRAX, and M2/M2TB minigenes have been described previously (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 15Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). IR minigenes have been described previously (16Kosaki A. Nelson J. Webster N.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10331-10337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and were used previously to demonstrate regulation of IR alternative splicing by CUG-BP (9Savkur R. Phillips A. Cooper T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). QT35 quail fibroblasts were plated at a density of 1.8 × 106 cells/60-mm-diameter tissue culture dish in 3 ml of medium (F10 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% chick serum, 10% tryptose phosphate, and 2 mml-glutamine) and cultured overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. COS-M6 cells were plated in 3 ml of high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were transfected with 100 ng of minigene DNA, 0-3 μg of CELF6 expression plasmid, and carrier DNA to 3.1 μg of total DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Total RNA and protein were harvested 48 h after transfection and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting as described previously (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), except that the amount of oligo(dT)12-18 primer used to produce cDNA was increased to 100-300 ng/reaction. Statistical Analysis—The mean values for the extent of exon inclusion accompanying each dose of CELF6 expression plasmid were compared with the means of values obtained from the minigenes alone using a two-tailed pooled t test assuming a normal distribution. This test also assumes that the population variances are equal; to confirm that this assumption was valid, preliminary F tests were conducted where the α level was set at α = 0.2. Identification of CELF6 —We previously reported the identification of a family of five RNA-binding proteins called CELF proteins. We identified a sixth family member, CELF6, as homologous segments in cosmid sequences from chromosome 15, but no corresponding expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were available at that time (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). CELF6 (also called BRUNOL6) was also predicted from conceptual translation of a potential cDNA derived from high throughput genomic sequence (14Good P. Chen Q. Warner S. Herring D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28583-28592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To obtain the actual coding region of CELF6, we amplified full-length CELF6 from human brain cDNA by PCR using primers that contained the predicted start and stop codons based on our analysis of chromosome 15 cosmid sequences. We used the sequences of the four different cDNAs obtained (Fig. 1B) to BLAST updated EST data bases and aligned our sequences, the matching ESTs, and human genomic sequence to determine the exon structure for CELF6 (Fig. 1A). CELF6 is composed of 14 exons, including a novel exon (exon 3) not previously predicted. Coding sequence ends less than 30 nucleotides upstream of the exon 13-exon 14 junction, and most of the CELF6 3′-UTR lies within exon 14. Four CELF6 open reading frames (ORFs) generated by alternative splicing were identified (Fig. 1B). Translation of ORF1 gives rise to a full-length CELF protein that matches previously reported predicted translations (GenBank™ accession numbers AF401233 and AF425606). The domain structure of CELF6 is the same as that of other CELF family members (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar): three RNP-containing RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a 268-amino acid divergent domain separating RRM2 and RRM3. CELF6 also possesses numerous potential phosphorylation sites, a potential nuclear localization signal at the C terminus, and an alanine-rich region within the divergent domain. By retention of an intron, inclusion of an alternative exon, or use of an alternative splice site in exon 9, ORFs 2-4 contain upstream termination codons (Fig. 1B). The retention of intron 5 in ORF2, which is otherwise identical to ORF1, introduces a frameshift that truncates RRM2 upstream of RNP1, one of two highly conserved sequences required for the RNA binding activity of RRMs (17Burd C. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). ORF3 skips exon 10 but includes an upstream exon (exon 3) that contains an in-frame stop codon. ORF4 lacks exon 11 and uses an alternative 3′ splice site in exon 9 that introduces an upstream frameshift, altering the C-terminal portion of the divergent domain and removing RRM3. Previous comparative analysis of human CELF proteins suggested that the CELF family can be divided into two subfamilies, the first containing CUG-BP and ETR-3 and the second containing CELFs 3, 4, and 5 (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To determine how CELF6 is related to other CELF proteins, we compared full-length CELF6 (ORF1) with the other members of the CELF family (Fig. 2). CELF6 is more closely related to CELFs 3, 4, and 5 than CUG-BP and ETR-3, indicating that it falls within the second subfamily of CELF proteins. CELF6 and Other Members of the CELF Family Are Broadly Expressed—To examine the expression of CELF6, commercial Northern blots containing RNAs from adult human tissues were hybridized against a 3′-UTR probe. As shown in Fig. 3, CELF6 is preferentially expressed in kidney and brain. A large mRNA of approximately 7.5 kilobases (kb) is abundant in kidney, whereas a smaller mRNA of approximately 4 kb is expressed in brain and at lower levels in kidney. Both of these mRNA isoforms are detectable at very low levels in several other tissues. The differentially spliced regions in ORFs 1-4 are not large enough to explain the difference in size between the two CELF6 mRNA isoforms seen by Northern blotting. Size differences of this magnitude between different mRNA isoforms are usually attributable to differences in polyadenylation. Indeed, there are numerous human CELF6 ESTs that contain 3′-UTR sequences that extend beyond the polyadenylated 3′ end of the published CELF6 mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF401233), suggesting that a downstream polyadenylation site is sometimes used. To examine CELF6 expression in more detail, a commercial RNA dot blot containing a greater variety of human adult as well as fetal tissues was hybridized with the 3′-UTR probe (Fig. 4A). This blot confirmed that the highest levels of CELF6 expression are in adult kidney, brain, and testis. Low levels were observed in most other tissues, although expression was not detected in several cell lines. Within the brain, CELF6 expression is widespread, being observed in all regions of the brain tested (see Fig. 4A: 1, A-H; 2, A-H; and 3, B and C). In fetal tissues, CELF6 expression was highest in brain but was also detectable in kidney, although at levels lower than those seen in the adult. To develop profiles of CELF mRNA expression in these tissues, the CELF6 dot blot was compared with those of the five other CELF family members (Ref. 3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar (data not shown) and Fig. 4B herein). Like CELF6, CUG-BP, ETR-3, and CELF4 are broadly expressed. CUG-BP is strongly expressed in all adult and fetal tissues tested. ETR-3 is detectable in all tissues at some level, but ETR-3 expression is highest in brain, heart, and thymus. CELF4 is highly expressed throughout the brain and in glandular tissues; moderately expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver; and detectable at very low levels in all other tissues tested. CELF3 and CELF5 are restricted to brain, where they are expressed at varying levels in different regions (see Fig. 4B: A, 1-8; B, 1-6; D, 4; and G, 1). The patterns of CELF3 and CELF5 expression are nearly identical, except in pituitary gland, where CELF3 is strongly expressed, whereas CELF5 is almost undetectable. CELF6 Positively Regulates MSE-dependent Splicing in Vivo—We have shown previously that members of the CELF family bind to MSEs and activate cTNT exon inclusion in an MSE-dependent manner (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To determine whether the different ORFs of CELF6 can mediate cTNT exon inclusion, the four CELF6 ORFs were subcloned into expression vectors and cotransfected with the R35C minigene into QT35 quail fibroblast cells. R35C contains a heterologous alternative exon flanked by cTNT MSEs 1-4 and gives rise to predominantly exon-skipped mRNAs in fibroblasts, although exon inclusion is promoted in the presence of exogenous (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) or endogenous (2Charlet-B N. Logan P. Singh G. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) CELF proteins. Western blots probed with antibodies against the N-terminal epitope tag confirmed that ORF1, ORF2, and ORF4 constructs all expressed proteins of the expected sizes; ORF3 was not detected at any dose on Western blots (Fig. 5). The ORF3 expression construct was confirmed by sequencing both strands; therefore, we conclude that the expressed protein is unstable. All three of the CELF6 ORFs that expressed detectable protein increased the level of exon inclusion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). ORF3 did not affect the level of exon inclusion, consistent with the absence of detectable protein. To determine whether enhanced exon inclusion by CELF6 is MSE-dependent, the CELF6 expression plasmids were cotransfected with the RTBPSRAX minigene containing the same alternative exon flanked by human β-globin intron 1 sequences that lack MSEs. None of the ORFs significantly enhanced exon inclusion in the absence of MSEs (Fig. 5B). CELF6 Promotes Exon Inclusion via MSE2 Alone—CELFs 3, 4, and 5 are all able to promote exon inclusion via multiple copies of a single element, MSE2, but CUG-BP and ETR-3 cannot (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To determine whether CELF6 can promote exon inclusion via MSE2 alone, ORFs 1-4 were cotransfected with the M2/M2TB minigene, which contains a 52-nucleotide alternative exon flanked on either side by three copies of MSE2. As before, Western blots confirmed expression of ORFs 1, 2, and 4, but not ORF3, in these experiments (Fig. 6). ORFs 1, 2, and 4 all promoted exon inclusion (Fig. 6), placing CELF6 in the functional subfamily suggested by comparison of CELF protein sequences (Fig. 2A). CELF6 Promotes Skipping of IR Exon 11—In addition to regulating cTNT exon 5 inclusion, CUG-BP has been shown to promote skipping of the alternative exon 11 of IR (9Savkur R. Phillips A. Cooper T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). To determine whether CELF6 also promotes IR exon 11 skipping, ORFs 1, 2, and 4 were cotransfected with the IR-N minigene into COS-M6 cells (Fig. 7A). COS-M6 cells were used for these experiments because the basal level of IR exon 11 inclusion in QT35 cells is already <10% (data not shown). ORF3 was not included in this experiment because ORF3 protein is not expressed at detectable levels at any dose. Western blots confirmed ORF1, ORF2, and ORF4 protein expression (Fig. 7). Like CUG-BP, the full-length CELF6 ORF1 promoted IR exon 11 skipping in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). ORF4 also promoted exon skipping, although to a much lesser extent than ORF1, despite expressing protein levels at least comparable with those seen at 1 μg of ORF1 expression plasmid. ORF2, in contrast, had no effect on the level of exon inclusion at any dose. A 1.8-kb region within IR that is required for responsiveness to CUG-BP and contains a CUG-BP binding site has been identified (9Savkur R. Phillips A. Cooper T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). To determine whether reduced exon 11 inclusion by CELF6 is also dependent on this region, CELF6 ORF1, ORF2, and ORF4 expression plasmids were cotransfected into COS-M6 cells with the IR-E minigene lacking this region (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, CELF6 ORF1 and ORF4 both promote exon skipping, despite the lack of the CUG-BP regulatory region, suggesting that CELF6 acts through different sequences than CUG-BP on some substrates. The response of the IR-E minigene to ORF4 was greater than the response to ORF1, although this may be attributable to the higher level of protein expressed for ORF4 relative to ORF1 in this set of experiments. A New Member of the CELF Family—In this study, we isolated cDNAs and performed functional analysis of protein isoforms of CELF6 (also called BRUNOL6), a sixth member of the CELF family whose existence was previously only predicted (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 14Good P. Chen Q. Warner S. Herring D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28583-28592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Four CELF6 open reading frames generated by alternative splicing were found, one of which includes a novel exon, exon 3. Although ORFs 2-4 encode truncated CELF6 proteins, and the proteins from ORF2 and ORF4 regulate splicing, it is not clear whether any of these proteins are made in vivo. The premature termination codons introduced in all three ORFs lie more than 50 nucleotides upstream of an exon-intron junction and thus would likely lead to destruction of these mRNAs via the nonsense-mediated decay pathway (18Sun X. Moriarty P.M. Maquat L.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4734-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, alternative splicing of CELF6 could lead to down-regulation of its expression. The relative abundance of the four CELF6 mRNA isoforms is unknown because they were isolated by non-quantitative PCR. It is possible that CELF6 undergoes differential alternative splicing in a tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific manner as a means of regulating levels of CELF6 protein. Interestingly, two of the truncated proteins, ORFs 2 and 4, promoted MSE-dependent exon inclusion to levels similar to those promoted by the full-length CELF6 when expressed at high levels in transient transfection assays. Furthermore, ORF4 (but not the shorter ORF2) promoted exon 11 skipping in IR minigenes. Regardless of whether the truncated proteins are naturally expressed, this suggests that the C terminus is not required to influence alternative splicing. Consistent with this result, it has been reported that another CELF protein, ETR-3 (also called BRUNOL3), binds to RNA via the first two RRMs (14Good P. Chen Q. Warner S. Herring D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28583-28592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletional analysis of human ETR-3 and CELF4 indicate that the two N-terminal RRMs plus a small portion of the adjacent divergent domain are sufficient for full activity (19Singh G. Charlet-B N. Han J. Cooper T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although the C terminus of CELF6 is not required for activity, this does not mean that it does not normally contribute to its function. Deletion mutants of ETR-3 consisting of only the C-terminal RRM plus a portion of the adjacent divergent domain are also active (19Singh G. Charlet-B N. Han J. Cooper T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that the C termini of CELF proteins may also participate in splicing regulation. CELF-mediated Regulation of Alternative Splicing in Kidney and Brain—Although CELF6 can activate splicing of cTNT minigenes, CELF6 is not expressed at high levels in striated muscle and thus is unlikely to be a key regulator of endogenous cTNT alternative splicing. CELF6 also promoted exon skipping in minigenes of IR, however, which is endogenously expressed at high levels in kidney and brain (20Goldstein B.J. Mullter-Wieland D. Kahn C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The pattern of CELF6 expression suggests that it plays a role in regulating alternative splicing in kidney and brain. Members of the CELF family have distinct but overlapping patterns of expression, and every tissue examined to date has been shown to express at least one member of the CELF family (Fig. 4; Ref. 3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), suggesting that regulation of alternative splicing by CELF proteins is widespread. In the kidney, CELF6 may be the primary regulator of CELF-mediated alternative splicing events. By RNA dot blot, CELF3 and CELF5 expression is restricted to brain, and although other CELF mRNAs are detectable in kidney, by Western blot ETR-3 and CELF4 proteins are expressed at very low levels in kidney, whereas CUG-BP is not detectable at all (3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In contrast, all six known members of the CELF family are expressed in brain (Fig. 4; Ref. 3Ladd A. Charlet-B N. Cooper T. Mol. Cell"
https://openalex.org/W2160163805,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, HFA1, encodes a >250-kDa protein, which is required for mitochondrial function. Hfa1p exhibits 72% overall sequence similarity (54% identity) to ACC1-encoded yeast cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Nevertheless, HFA1 and ACC1 functions are not overlapping because mutants of the two genes have different phenotypes and do not complement each other. Whereas ACC1 is involved in cytoplasmic fatty acid synthesis, the phenotype of hfa1Δ disruptants resembles that of mitochondrial fatty-acid synthase mutants. They fail to grow on lactate or glycerol, and the mitochondrial cofactor, lipoic acid, is reduced to <10% of its normal cellular concentration. Other than Acc1p, the N-terminal sequence of Hfa1p comprises a canonical mitochondrial targeting signal together with a matrix protease cleavage site. Accordingly, the HFA1-encoded protein was specifically assigned by Western blotting of appropriate cell fractions to the mitochondrial compartment. Removal of the mitochondrial targeting sequence abolished the competence of HFA1 DNA to complement hfal null mutants. Conversely and in contrast to the intact HFA1 sequence, the signal sequence-free HFA1 gene complemented the mutational loss of cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Expression of HFA1 under the control of the ACC1 promoter restored cellular ACC activity in ACC1-defective yeast mutants to wild type levels. From this finding, it is concluded that HFA1 encodes a specific mitochondrial acetyl-CoA carboxylase providing malonyl-CoA for intraorganellar fatty acid and, in particular, lipoic acid synthesis.

Yeast contains two distinct fatty-acid synthases (FAS) 1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty-acid synthase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; RT, reverse transcriptase. 1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty-acid synthase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; RT, reverse transcriptase. acting specifically in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondrial matrix, respectively (1Lynen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic FAS is a multifunctional enzyme (type I-FAS) and synthesizes the bulk (>95%) of cellular fatty acids. In contrast, mitochondrial FAS is structurally similar to the non-aggregated FAS enzymes found in most bacteria where each component activity is represented by a distinct protein (type II-FAS) (2Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 3Harington A. Herbert C.J. Tung B. Getz G.S. Slonimski P.P. Mol.

Both FAS systems are encoded by nuclear genes. Although mutational loss of cytoplasmic FAS gives rise to a fatty acid-requiring phenotype (5Schweizer E. Werkmeister K. Jain M.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1978; 21: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), mutants defective in one of the mitochondrial FAS-encoding genes are fatty acid-prototrophic but fail to grow on non-fermentative media (2Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 3Harington A. Herbert C.J. Tung B. Getz G.S. Slonimski P.P. Mol.

In accordance with these findings, Brody et al. (2Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and Wada et al. (6Wada H. Shintani D. Ohlrogge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) working with either yeast or plant systems suggest that a major function of mitochondrial FAS refers to lipoic acid synthesis by providing the octanoylacyl-carrier protein precursor of this cofactor. Because the product spectra of both FAS systems are very similar in vitro (7Rössler H. Rieck C. Delong T. Hoja U. Schweizer E. Mol. Gen. Genomics. 2003; 269: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it remains to be shown whether, apart from octanoic acid, mitochondrially produced long-chain fatty acids serve a specific function as well. Neither octanoic nor lipoic acid is capable of healing the mitochondrial FAS defect when added to the growth medium (2Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 3Harington A. Herbert C.J. Tung B. Getz G.S. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This suggests that either the uptake or the activation of these acids is impossible for mitochondria or intact yeast cells. In all of the known FAS systems, chain extension depends on malonyl-CoA as a substrate. Thus, carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA is a key step of fatty acid synthesis. The respective enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), comprises three functional components, i.e. biotin carboxylase, biotincarboxyl-carrier protein, and transcarboxylase (8Lane D.M. Moss J. Polakis S.E. Cell. Regul. 1974; 8: 139-194Google Scholar). Depending on the organism, these components represent either three distinct proteins or they are contained as functional domains within difunctional or trifunctional ACC proteins (9Toh H. Kondo H. Tanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 15: 687-696Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In yeast, cytoplasmic ACC is a single trifunctional polypeptide of 2233 amino acids and with an approximate molecular mass of 250 kDa (10Mishina M. Kamiryo T. Tanaka A. Fukui S. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 71: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11Al-Feel W. Chirala S.S. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4534-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Hasslacher M. Ivessa A.S. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ACC-encoding gene has been isolated and was designated as ACC1 and FAS3, respectively (11Al-Feel W. Chirala S.S. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4534-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Hasslacher M. Ivessa A.S. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike fatty-acid synthase mutants, which grow upon fatty acid supplementation, ACC1 disruption is lethal and cannot be compensated by external long-chain fatty acids (12Hasslacher M. Ivessa A.S. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schneiter R. Hitomi M. Ivessa A.S. Fasch E.V. Kohlwein S.D. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7161-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This characteristic is commonly attributed to the malonyl-CoA requirement of cellular very long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis. Fatty acid elongation appears to be an essential cellular function not supplementable by exogenous very long-chain fatty acid. Other than ACC1 null mutants, however, ACC1 missense mutants are potentially viable and grow upon fatty acid supplementation. The low level of ACC activity eventually retained in some of these mutants obviously fulfills the limited malonyl-CoA requirement of very long-chain fatty acid synthesis (14Mishina M. Roggenkamp R. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These mutants therefore provide valuable tools for biochemical studies. Although Acc1p provides the malonyl-CoA used in cytoplasmic fatty acid synthesis, the origin of this substrate in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis is unclear. Mitochondrial membranes are unlikely to be permeable for malonyl-CoA. In higher plant mitochondria, malonic acid was suggested to be imported into the organelle with subsequent activation and transacylation to acyl carrier protein (15Gueguen V. Macherel D. Jaquinod M. Douce R. Bourgignon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5016-5025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). On the other hand, fatty acid synthesis in plant chloroplasts relies on a specific organellar ACC, which is distinctly different from its cytoplasmic counter-part (16Ohlrogge J.B. Jaworski J.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 17Alban C. Baldet P. Douce R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Konishi T. Shinohara K. Yamada K. Sasaki Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Similarly, identification of the unassigned yeast reading frame, HFA1, encoding a putative protein with striking similarity in its length and amino acid sequence to cytoplasmic ACC suggested the existence of a second and functionally differentiated acetyl-CoA carboxylase being present in this organism as well (19Kearsey S.E. DNA Seq. 1993; 4: 69-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For many years, however, the biochemical function of HFA1 remained elusive because hfa1Δ disruptants were, other than acc1 mutants, fatty acid-prototrophic and exhibited no obvious ACC deficiency. Accordingly, the fatty acid-requiring phenotype of ACC1 mutants was not compensated by functional HFA1 DNA (12Hasslacher M. Ivessa A.S. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schneiter R. Hitomi M. Ivessa A.S. Fasch E.V. Kohlwein S.D. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7161-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A first clue to the physiological function of HFA1 came from an observation in our laboratory that HFA1 mutants failed to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. As will be demonstrated in the present study, the HFA1 gene product is located in the mitochondria and the phenotype of HFA1 mutants conforms to that of yeast mitochondrial FAS mutants. For complementation of hfa1 null mutants, the putative mitochondrial targeting sequence of HFA1 proved indispensable. On the other hand, signal-free HFA1 DNA restored cytoplasmic ACC activity in acc1 missense mutants. From these findings, it is concluded that HFA1 encodes a mitochondrial acetyl-CoA carboxylase providing malonyl-CoA for organellar fatty acid biosynthesis. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Media—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain X2180-1A (R. Mortimer, Yeast Genetic Stock Center, Berkeley, CA) served as a haploid wild type reference. The ACC1-missense mutant acc1-318/45 was from our own collection (14Mishina M. Roggenkamp R. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) The ACC1/acc1Δ heterozygous diploid, Y25391, was obtained from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany). The diploid JS95.3 (MATa/α his3/his3 ura3/URA3 leu2/LEU2) was from H.-J. Schüller (Greifswald, Germany) and served for chromosomal disruption of HFA1. Plasmid pSE303 containing the N-terminal portion of HFA1 together with its 5′-flanking chromosomal DNA was obtained from S. E. Kearsey (20Kearsey S.E. Edwards J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 210: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Plasmid YEp6 (21Botstein D. Falco S.C. Stewart S.E. Brennan M. Scherer S. Stinchcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) was used for PCR amplification of S. cerevisiae HIS3-DNA. Plasmid p48.8.3 containing intact ACC1-DNA was isolated from a YEp24-based yeast gene bank by acc1-mutant complementation (Dr. Lilian Schweizer). For HFA1 disruption, the 2684-bp XbaI fragment of pSE303 was subcloned into pUC19 giving plasmid pRSHFA1. In pRSHFA2, the 386-bp EcoRI/SstI fragment was replaced by S. cerevisiae HIS3 DNA, which was prepared by PCR amplification from YEp6 (cf. Fig. 1). From the resulting construct, the inserted HIS3 gene together with its flanking HFA1 sequences was isolated as NcoI/SpeI fragment. Using the one-step gene disruption procedure of Rothstein (22Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar), the NcoI/SpeI fragment served for disruption of chromosomal HFA1 DNA in the diploid JS95.3 (Fig. 1). Thus, the heterozygous diploid SC1343 (MATa/α, hfa1Δ::HIS3/HFA1 his3/his3 ura3/URA3 leu2/LEU2) was obtained. The haploid HFA1 null mutant SC 1517 (MATα Δhfa1::HIS3 his3) was a meiotic segregant of SC1343. The multicopy yeast expression vector, pVT100-U, of Vernet et al. (23Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) served as a recipient of the HFA1 coding sequence in pHFA1. The latter plasmid was restituted from three different PCR fragments representing nucleotides –216 to 1974 (fragment 1), 1975–3885 (fragment 2), and 3886–6423 (fragment 3) relative to the first ATG codon in the HFA1 reading frame. In pHFA1, an in-frame ATG start codon in combination with the ADH1 promoter was contributed by the vector (cf. Fig. 2). Fragments 1–3 were flanked by HindIII/SpeI (fragment 1), SpeI/XhoI (fragment 2), and XhoI/NheI (fragment 3) restriction sites, respectively, allowing their appropriate ligation and integration into the vector. A second HFA1 expression plasmid, pMA1, was prepared accordingly but using a C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged fragment 3 (Fig. 2). Another HFA1 expression plasmid, pMA3, contained the complete HFA1 reading frame in combination with its genuine promoter sequence and a C-terminal hexahistidine-encoding nucleotide sequence. According to Fig. 2, pMA3 was obtained by inserting the XbaI fragment of pMA1 into the unique XbaI site of pMA2. In pMA2, a 589-bp PCR fragment of the HFA1 upstream region had been cloned into the yeast expression vector Yep 352 (24Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). According to Fig. 3, the HFA1 expression plasmid pUH 33.3 was constructed from pMA3 by replacing the 5′-terminal 3439-1 bp HindIII/SphI fragment of the inserted HFA1 DNA by a shorter 2779-bp PCR-generated HindIII/SphI fragment from the same region. The resulting construct, pUH32, was used for inserting the 846-bp HindIII/HindIII PCR fragment of the ACC1 promoter DNA into the unique HindIII site of pUH32 (cf. Fig. 3). The inserted DNA comprises the first 11 bp of the ACC1 reading frame together with 835 bp of its 5′-flanking upstream region.Fig. 2HFA1 constructs used for expression studies.

Respiratory competence was examined on complex medium containing, alternatively, 3% glycerol (YPG), 3% lactate (YPL), or 3% ethanol (YPE) instead of dextrose. The fatty requirement of yeast mutants was analyzed by replica plating from fatty acid containing YPDFA plates (YPD supplemented with 0.5% Tween 40 and 0.015% each of 14:0 and 16:0 fatty acids) onto YPD agar. The uracil-free (SCD/-U) or histidine-free (SCD/-H) synthetic complete medium used for selecting and identifying pHFA1 transformants and hfa1Δ disruptants, respectively, was prepared as described previously (25Harrer R. Schwank S. Schüller H.J. Schweizer E. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Amplification of HFA1-mRNA—Total RNA from yeast strain X2180-1A grown in YPD medium was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. 10-μg RNA fractions were incubated with 1 unit of RNase-free RQ1-DNase (Promega) for various time intervals ranging from 0 to 35 min. 0.5 μg of DNase-treated RNA was reverse-transcribed for 50 min at 42 °C with 1 unit of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 0.5 μmHFA1-specific primer I (cf.Fig. 4). The reaction mixture contained in a volume of 20 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. 2 μl of the cDNA synthesis mixture were subsequently applied to PCR amplification using in a total volume of 50 μl the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Sciences) and 200 nm of primers. 30 cycles of 94 °C denaturing (1.5 min), 52 °C annealing (2 min), and 72 °C extension (2 min) were run in an automated thermal cycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). The following primers were used: primer A, 5′-atcgaggcaatattcataaac-3′; primer B, 5′-aaagggaagacaattacacac-3′; primer C, 5′-ACGCGTCGACttaagggtaactggg-3′; primer D, 5′-ACGCGTCGACagtaataatagcatcattcatc-3′; primer E, 5′-ACGCGTCGACctatcgctagctttccac-3′; primer F, 5′-ACGCGTCGACgcattctgaaagtgagatag-3′; primer G, 5′-ATCAGTCGACgcgacagccaaacgaggccc-3′; primer H, 5′-ATCAGAATTCcaccgcagcaataccattg-3′; primer I, 5′-agttcgtcttgttatcgata-3′; and primer J, 5′-tattttcctttgtgaactagc-3′. Capitals letters indicate non-HFA1 sequences, HFA1 sequences are indicated in small letters, and restriction sites are underlined. 5 μl of each reaction mixture were applied to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The synthetic oligonucleotides used in this study were supplied by MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Assay—Cells were grown in 500 ml of uracil-free SCD/-U liquid medium containing 0.5% Tween 40 and 0.15% of each of the 14:0 and 16:0 fatty acids. After harvesting at early stationary phase, the wet cells (∼2 g) were resuspended in 1 volume of extraction buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing the protease inhibitors (Sigma) chymostatin (10 ng/ml), aprotinin (200 ng/ml), pepstatin A (100 ng/ml), leupeptin (50 ng/ml), antipain (250 ng/ml), p-benzamidine (50 ng/ml), and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (20 ng/ml). After cell breakage with glass beads, cell debris were removed by 5-min centrifugation at 5000 rpm. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase was precipitated from the supernatant by 30% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The protein pellet was dissolved in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and ACC activity was assayed spectrophotometrically in combination with purified fatty-acid synthase essentially as described by Matsuhashi (26Matsuhashi M. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 3-8Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In detail, the procedure was as follows. 1 ml of assay mixture contained 50 μmol of cysteine, 0.3 mg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μmol of ATP, 8 μmol of MgCl2, 0.4 μmol of NADPH, 50 μg of purified yeast fatty-acid synthase, and 10–30 μl (20–40 μg) of the ACC preparation. The reaction was started by adding 20 μmol of acetyl-CoA. Subsequently, the decrease of absorbance at 334 nm was followed. Yeast FAS was purified as described by Lynen (27Lynen F. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 17-33Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Demonstrating HFA1 Transcription and Mapping the Transcriptional Start Site—Using total RNA from S. cerevisiae wild type cells as a template, HFA1 transcription was verified by RT-PCR amplification of the HFA1 transcript (Fig. 4). Using appropriate controls, it was shown that formation of the PCR product was strictly dependent on the addition of reverse transcriptase. From this result and from the fact that product formation proved to be insensitive to DNase pretreatment, it is evident that RNA, rather than traces of residual DNA, served as a template (Fig. 4A). Using two different HFA1-specific upstream primers (A and B) in combination with the same downstream primer (J), the size difference of the resulting products was according to expectation (Fig. 4A). The cDNA thus prepared from the 5′ end of HFA1-mRNA subsequently served as a template for a series of PCR experiments. These “primer walking” experiments were designed to map the 5′ end of HFA1-mRNA. When the same downstream primer (H) was used in combination with six differently located upstream primers (B–G), only the combinations containing upstream primers B–E generated PCR products of the expected successively increasing lengths (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, the two most distal primers, G and F, were ineffective in the PCR assay (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the transcriptional initiation site of HFA1 is suggested to be located at a position between 607 (primer E) and 633 nucleotides (primer F) upstream of the first ATG in the HFA1 coding sequence (cf. Figs. 2 and 4C). This corresponds to a distance of 152–183 nucleotides upstream of the last stop codon in front of the HFA1 reading frame (Figs. 2 and 4C). HFA1 Disruptants Are Respiratory Defective and Fail to Synthesize Lipoic Acid—One of the two HFA1 alleles in the diploid strain, JS95.3, was disrupted by inserting the S. cerevisiae HIS3 gene according to the scheme depicted in Fig. 1. After sporulation of the resulting heterozygous diploid, SC1343, HFA1 disruptants were isolated by tetrad analysis and subsequently characterized both biochemically and by their growth requirements. The mutants proved to be viable on glucose-containing medium and segregated according to their histidine-prototrophic character in a regular Mendelian fashion (Fig. 5, A–C). Other than mutants of the sequentially related ACC1 gene, growth of HFA1 disruptants was independent of fatty acid supplementation (Fig. 5A). However, when cultivated on non-fermentable carbon sources such as lactate, glycerol, or ethanol, HFA1 disruptants exhibited the characteristics of respiratory-defective “petite” (Fig. 5, B, D, and E). Thus, HFA1 appears to be necessary for maintaining functional mitochondria in yeast. When different non-fermentative carbon sources were compared, growth of HFA1 mutants on lactate was strictly negative, whereas growth on ethanol was retarded although not completely abolished (Fig. 5, D and E). In this respect, HFA1 mutants differ from yeast mutants defective in one of the respiratory chain or ATP synthase functions. Instead, they rather resemble the recently described mutants of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis lacking the mitochondrial cofactor, lipoic acid (2Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To confirm the similarity between HFA1-defective and mitochondrial FAS-defective mutants further, several meiotic segregants of the hfa1Δ/HFA1 heterozygous diploid, SC1343, were analyzed for their lipoic acid content. As is indicated in Table I, cellular lipoic acid was indeed reduced drastically in hfa1Δ disruptants. This finding compares well to the lipoic acid deficiency observed in mitochondrial FAS-defective acp1Δ or ppt1Δ mutants (2Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Stuible H.P. Meier S. Wagner C. Hannappel E. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22334-22339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To definitely correlate these characteristics to the loss of HFA1 function, hfa1Δ disruptants were transformed with the multicopy HFA1 expression plasmids, pHFA1 and pMA3, respectively. For transformation, both the heterozygous diploid, SC1343, and the haploid hfa1Δ-disruptant, SC1517, were used as recipients. It turned out that the extrachromosomal HFA1 DNA of either plasmid complemented the lactate-negative phenotype of the HFA1 disruption both in haploid transformants (Fig. 8) and in the meiotic segregants of the transformed diploid (data not shown). From these findings, it is evident first that the mutant phenotype is indeed related to the loss of HFA1 function. Secondly, HFA1 was functionally expressed both with its genuine promoter and with the heterologous ADH1 promoter when the latter was fused in pHFA1 to an artificial ATG codon 220 nucleotides upstream of the first ATG codon of the HFA1 reading frame (Fig. 8). Thirdly, the respiratory-defective hfa1Δ-mutant (SC1517) used for these transformations obviously had not undergone a secondary Rho– mutation, otherwise complementation by intact HFA1 DNA would not have been observed.Table ILipoic acid content of wild type and HFA1-disrupted yeast cellsStrainCellular lipoic acid contentmg/g cellsSC1343-derived spore tetradSpore A0.44 ± 0.02Spore B0.10 ± 0Spore C0.12 ± 0.01Spore D0.55 ± 0.17X2180-1A0.50 ± 0.09 Open table in a new tab Fig. 8Complementation of hfa1Δ disruptants by intact but not by N-terminally truncated HFA1 DNA. SC 1517 cells were transformed with the indicated plasmids. Transformants were selected on uracil-free SCD/-U medium and subsequently grown for 4 days at 30 °C on either glucose (YPD) or lactate-containing (YPL) complex medium. Plasmids were as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In Vivo Expression of HFA1 and Mitochondrial Localization of Its Gene Product—The respiratory-defective phenotype of hfa1Δ mutants suggested that HFA1 controls mitochondrial function and, hence, encodes a mitochondrial protein. Inspection of the amino acid sequence immediately following the first ATG codon in the HFA1 reading frame revealed ∼90% of identical or equivalent positions compared with cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA carboxylase. No obvious mitochondrial import signal is contained in this region. However, if the additional 150 codons of the 5′-flanking and stop codon-free portion of HFA1 upstream of the first ATG triplet were included in this analysis, the characteristics of a typical yeast mitochondrial import signal became apparent within this sequence (cf. Fig. 6) (29Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Besides many hydrophobic and hydroxy amino acids, this extended N-terminal part of Hfa1p comprises 27 basic and only 3 acidic amino acids. Furthermore, a putative signal peptide cleavage site is as predicted by the algorithm of Claros and Vincens (30Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar) maps between the HFA1-specific leader and the subsequent ACC1-homologous Hfa1p sequence (cf. Fig. 6). To confirm the possible mitochondrial function of Hfa1p, we tested both the expression of HFA1 and the intracellular localization of its product biochemically. For this experiment, yeast cells were transformed with pMA3 encoding hexahistidine-tagged Hfa1p. After growth to mid-log phase, cells were broken and the homogenate was fractionated into cytoplasm and purified mitochondria. Subsequently, both cell fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of Hfa1p. As is evident from Fig. 7B, anti-pentahistidine antibodies elicited a strong signal with the mitochondrial fraction but not with the cytoplasm. The gel position of the signal conformed to a protein of a molecular mass of >250 kDa. A second signal corresponding to approximately half of this size probably represents a defined degradation product of Hfa1p. A comparable signal was not obtained with cells that had been transformed with the empty vector (Fig. 7B, lane 3). A minor band of <75 kDa observed w"

Based upon the inhibition of binding of the noncompetitive antagonist [3H]phencyclidine, azietomidate and etomidate bind with 10-fold higher affinity to nAChRs in the desensitized state (IC50 = 70 μm) than in the closed channel state.

UV irradiation resulted in preferential [3H]azietomidate photoincorporation into the nAChR α and δ subunits. Photolabeled amino acids in both subunits were identified in the ion channel domain and in the ACh binding sites by Edman degradation. Within the nAChR ion channel in the desensitized state, there was labeling of αGlu-262 and δGln-276 at the extracellular end and δSer-258 and δSer-262 toward the cytoplasmic end. Within the acetylcholine binding sites, [3H]azietomidate photolabeled αTyr-93, αTyr-190, and αTyr-198 in the site at the α-γ interface and δAsp-59 (but not the homologous position, γGlu-57). Increasing [3H]azietomidate concentration from 1.8 to 150 μm increased the efficiency of incorporation into amino acids within the ion channel by 10-fold and in the ACh sites by 100-fold, consistent with higher affinity binding within the ion channel.

At clinically relevant concentrations, most general anesthetics modulate the responses of ligand-gated ion channels in the “cystine loop” superfamily that includes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; azietomidate, 2-(3-methyl-3H-diaziren-3-yl)-ethyl 1-(phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate; Carb, carbamycholine; dTC, d-tubocurarine; EndoLys-C, endoproteinase Lys-C; etomidate, 2-ethyl 1-(phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate; GABAA receptor, γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin; TPS, Torpedo physiological saline; Tricine, N-tris-(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine; V8 protease, S. aureus endopeptidase Glu-C; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; PCP, phencyclidine. and serotonin 5-HT3 receptors, with cation-selective channels, and the GABAA and glycine receptors with anion-selective channels (1Franks N.P.

Toxicol. 2001; 41: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). General anesthetics enhance responses for submaximal concentrations of GABA and glycine, and at higher concentrations they can directly activate these receptors, whereas they noncompetitively inhibit nAChRs. Members of this superfamily contain five homologous subunits arranged about a central axis that is the ion channel (4Corringer P.-J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 5Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Each subunit has a large N-terminal domain that contributes to the receptor extracellular domain and four transmembrane segments (M1–M4), organized as a four helix bundle, with M2 segments from each subunit contributing to the lumen of the ion channel (6Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). In the muscle-type nAChR, with a subunit stoichiometry α2βγδ, the two agonist binding sites, which are in the extracellular domain at a distance 30 Å above the lipid bilayer, are at the interfaces between the α-δ and α-γ subunits. The crystal structure of the molluscan ACh-binding protein, a soluble, homopentameric homolog of the nAChR extracellular domain, provides a general description of the extracellular domain and transmitter binding sites of nAChRs and other members of this protein superfamily (7Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

R(+)-Etomidate, one of the most potent general anesthetics used clinically, acts at micromolar concentrations both as an anesthetic and as a potentiator of the responses to submaximal concentrations of GABA, whereas at concentrations above 10 μm, it inhibits GABA responses and directly activates GABAA receptors (8Tomlin S.L. Jenkins A. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Anesthesiology. 1998; 88: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and it inhibits nAChRs (9Wachtel R.E. Wegrzynowicz E.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GABAA receptors containing β2 or β3, but not β1, subunits are most sensitive to etomidate, and site-directed mutagenesis has identified a single amino acid within the M2 segment that determines etomidate sensitivity in GABAA receptors in vitro (10Belelli D.

McKernan R. Whiting P.J. Wafford K.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8608-8617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The position within βM2 conferring etomidate sensitivity corresponds to that within M2 of GABAA receptor α subunits associated with sensitivity to volatile anesthetics (13Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchines V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). In the absence of atomic resolution structures of these ligandgated ion channels in the presence of anesthetics, it is difficult to distinguish whether the positions at which substitutions alter anesthetic potency contribute directly to anesthetic binding sites or are involved in the transduction mechanism and allosterically modulate anesthetic potency. Photoaffinity labeling provides a complementary approach to identifying amino acids contributing to drug binding sites (reviewed in Refs. 14Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1995; 34: 1296-1312Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar and 15Fleming S.A. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 12479-12520Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). For the nAChR, available in high abundance from the electric organs of Torpedo, photoreactive agonist and antagonists have provided extensive identification of amino acids contributing to the transmitter binding sites and to the ion channel (16Chiara D.C.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11452-11462Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Amino acids photolabeled by 3-[3H]azioctanol, a general anesthetic containing a photoreactive diazirine, have been identified at the extracellular end of the M2 ion channel domain, in the agonist binding site, and at the lipid interface (18Pratt M.B. Husain S.S. Miller K.W. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29441-29451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Azietomidate, a diazirine derivative of etomidate, has been recently developed as a photoreactive analog to identify etomidate binding sites in GABAA receptors and nAChRs (19Husain S.S. Ziebell M.R. Ruesch D. Hong F. Arevalo E. Kosterlitz J.A. Olsen R.W. Forman S.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The two drugs are equipotent as anesthetics for tadpoles and as positive allosteric modulators of GABA responses, and azietomidate inhibits agonist activation of muscle type nAChRs with IC50 = 25 μm. In addition, [3H]azietomidate at 1 μm was shown to photoincorporate preferentially into the Torpedo nAChR α and δ subunits, with labeling of the α subunit enhanced and the δ subunit inhibited in the presence of agonist. Within the α subunit, the agonist-enhanced labeling was localized to a 20-kDa fragment containing the M1, M2, and M3 transmembrane segments, whereas labeling inhibited by agonist was localized to an 18-kDa fragment containing ACh binding site segments A and B. We now characterize the effects of azietomidate and etomidate on the binding of radiolableled drugs to the nAChR agonist sites and within the ion channel, and we use protein chemistry techniques to identify the amino acids contributing to [3H]azietomidate binding sites in the nAChR. Materials—nAChR-enriched membranes were isolated from Torpedo californica electric organ (20Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The final membrane suspensions were stored in 38% sucrose at -80 °C under argon. The membranes used here contained 1–2 nmol of [3H]acetylcholine ([3H]ACh) binding sites per mg of protein. [3H]Azietomidate (11 Ci/mmol) and nonradioactive R(+)-azietomidate were synthesized as described previously (19Husain S.S. Ziebell M.R. Ruesch D. Hong F. Arevalo E. Kosterlitz J.A. Olsen R.W. Forman S.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). [3H]Azietomidate was stored at a concentration of 1.5 μm at -80 °C in ethanol, which was removed via evaporation immediately prior to the addition of membranes or Torpedo physiological saline (TPS: 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 2mm MgCl2, 5mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0). For studies of photoincorporation at 150 μm, [3H]azietomidate stock at 11 Ci/mmol was isotopically diluted with an appropriate volume of a freshly made stock of nonradioactive azietomidate at 1 mg/ml in ethanol. This solution was then dried down prior to the addition of membranes as outlined above. R(+)-etomidate was gift from Dr. David Gemmell (Organon Labs, UK). [3H]Phencyclidine ([3H]PCP; 27 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [3H]ACh (3.6 Ci/mmol) was synthesized from choline and [3H]acetic anhydride. Staphylococcus aureus glutamylendopeptidase (V8 protease) was from ICN Biomedical Inc.; endoproteinase Lys C (EndoLys-C) was from Roche Applied Science. Trifluoroacetic acid was from Pierce, and 10% Genapol C-100 was from Calbiochem. Radioligand Binding Assays—The equilibrium binding of [3H]ACh and [3H]PCP in the presence or absence of 1 mm carbamylcholine (Carb) to Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes in TPS was measured by centrifugation in a TOMY MXT-150 microcentrifuge as described previously (21White B.H. Howard S. Cohen S.G. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21595-21607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane suspensions were pretreated with diisopropylphosphofluoridate (∼0.5 mm) for 15 min to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity. For [3H]ACh (20 nm), binding was measured using dilute membrane suspensions (1 ml, 84 μg of protein/ml, 40 nm ACh binding sites), whereas for [3H]PCP (6 nm), 200-μl aliquots at 0.7 mg of protein/ml were used. Membrane suspensions were equilibrated with [3H]ACh and [3H]PCP for 30 min and 2 h, respectively, prior to centrifugation. Non-specific binding of [3H]ACh and [3H]PCP was determined in the presence of, respectively, 1 mm Carb and 1 mm proadifen (with Carb) or 1 mm tetracaine (without Carb). Data Analysis—The concentration dependence of azietomidate or etomidate inhibition of radioligand binding and d-tubocurarine (dTC) inhibition of [3H]azietomidate labeling of nAChR subunits was fit to Equation 1, fx=f0/(1+(x/IC50)n)+fns(Eq. 1) where fx is the total [3H]ACh or [3H]PCP binding or [3H]azietomidate subunit labeling in the presence of inhibitor concentration x; f0 is the specific radioligand binding or [3H]azietomidate incorporation in the absence of inhibitor; fns is a fixed parameter defined by the nonspecific binding or labeling; IC50 is the total inhibitor concentration associated with 50% inhibition of radioligand binding or subunit photolabeling; and n is the Hill coefficient. Photolabeling of nAChR-enriched Membranes with [3H]Azietomidate—Freshly thawed nAChR-rich Torpedo membranes were diluted with TPS and pelleted, and the pellets were resuspended at 2 mg of protein/ml (∼1 μm nAChR) in TPS supplemented with 1 mm oxidized glutathione to serve as an aqueous scavenger. Membrane aliquots were combined with [3H]azietomidate and agitated for 5 min prior to the addition of other drugs as noted in the figure legends. Samples were incubated for 1 h in the dark at 4 °C in polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes after the addition of drugs. For photolabeling on an analytical scale, 200-μg aliquots were placed in a 96-well polypropylene microtiter plate (Falcon catalog no. 3911), whereas preparative photolabeling (10 mg of protein) was performed in a 2-cm glass Petri dish with a stir bar. The suspensions, on ice, were irradiated for 25 min in a horizontal photochemical chamber reactor (Rayonet RPR-200; Southern New England Ultraviolet Company, Branford, CT) using RPR-3500 bulbs that emit ∼24 watts with an intensity maximum at 365 nm. In analytical experiments, the suspensions were then diluted with 4× sample loading buffer and submitted to SDS-PAGE, whereas preparative samples were pelleted and solubilized in 1× sample buffer. In control analytical photolabeling experiments, we assessed by SDS-PAGE the dependence upon UV irradiation of the 3H incorporation into membrane polypeptides. No covalent incorporation occurred when samples were incubated for 90 min in the absence of irradiation, and no significant “dark reaction” was detected when samples were incubated in the dark for 30 min after irradiation for 15 min. When membrane suspensions containing 1 μCi were electrophoresed after incubation for 60–90 min in the absence of irradiation, a time-independent background of ∼100 cpm was associated with each gel slice, compared with the 1000–10000 cpm incorporated after irradiation in gel slices containing nAChR subunits or other membrane polypeptides. When after irradiation samples were incubated in the dark for a further 30 min before dilution in sample loading buffer, the counts in the gel slices were within 5% of the nonincubated samples. Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) with modifications (23White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The polypeptides were resolved on a 1.5-mm-thick 8% acrylamide gel and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue (0.25% (w/v) in 45% methanol and 10% acetic acid). For autoradiography, the gels were impregnated with fluor (Amplify; Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, dried, and exposed at -80 °C to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat film for various times (4–8 weeks). Incorporation of 3H into individual polypeptides was also quantified by scintillation counting of excised gel slices (20Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For fragmentation of the nAChR α subunit by “in gel” digestion with S. aureus V8 protease, following electrophoresis, the gels were briefly stained with Coomassie Blue and destained to allow visualization of the subunits. The nAChR α subunit from a preparative scale labeling was then excised and placed directly into individual wells of a 1.5-mm mapping gel, composed of a 5-cm-long 4.5% acrylamide stacking gel and a 15-cm-long 15% acrylamide separating gel (23White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. aureus V8 protease (200 μg) in overlay buffer (5% sucrose, 125 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% SDS, pH 6.8) was added to each well. The gel was run at 150 V for 2 h, and then the current was turned off for 1 h. The gel was then run at constant current overnight until the dye front reached the end of the gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the proteolytic fragments of ∼20 kDa (αV8-20), 18 kDa (α V8-18), and 10 kDa (α V8-10) were visualized and excised (23White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The excised proteolytic fragments were isolated by passive elution into 15 ml of 0.1 m NH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS, and 2.5 mm dithiotreitol. The eluate was concentrated using Vivaspin 15 Mr 5,000 concentrators (Vivascience Inc., Edgewood, NY). To remove excess SDS, acetone was added (70% final volume), and following incubation at -20 °C overnight, the polypeptides were pelleted. Proteolytic Digestions—For digestion with EndoLys-C or V8 protease, acetone-precipitated subunits or subunit fragments isolated from preparative scale labelings (10 mg of protein) were resuspended in 200 μl of 15 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.1, 0.1% SDS. For digestion of αV8-18, αV8-20, or δ subunit, EndoLys-C (0.5–1.5 units in 100 μl of water) was added, and after 14 days at room temperature, the αV8-18 and αV8-20 digests were fractionated by HPLC, whereas the δ subunit digest was fractionated on 1.5-mm-thick Tricine SDS-PAGE gels (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar, 26Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). δEKC-21 in resuspension buffer was digested with V8 protease (1 μg) at room temperature for 3–4 days before separation of fragments by HPLC. HPLC Purification—Proteolytic fragments from the nAChR α and δ subunit digests were purified by reverse phase HPLC on an Agilent 1100 binary HPLC system, using a Brownlee C4-Aquapore column (100 × 2.1 mm, 7 μm particle size) at 40 °C. Solvent A was 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 40% 2-propyl alcohol. A linear stepwise gradient at 0.2 ml/min was used (in percentage of solvent B): 0 min, 25%; 15 min, 28%; 30 min, 37%; 45 min, 52%; 60 min, 73%; 75 min 100%; 80 min, 100%; 85 min 25%; 90 min, 25%. Fractions were collected every 2 min (45 fractions/run) or 2.5 min (36 fractions/run). The elution of peptides was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm. Aliquots (2–4% by volume) from each fraction were taken to determine the 3H distribution by liquid scintillation counting. Sequence Analysis—Automated N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 494 protein sequencer with an in-line 140C PTH analyzer. Samples were usually applied directly to Biobrene-pretreated, micro-TFA glass fiber disks (Applied Biosystems catalog no. 401111). For samples resuspended in 0.1% SDS, after drying, the filters were treated with gas trifluoroacetic acid (5 min) followed by an ethyl acetate wash (4 min) to remove detergent. HPLC samples (400- or 500-μl fractions) were loaded directly onto the glass fiber disks in 20-μl aliquots, allowing the solvent to evaporate at 40 °C between loads. Because sample loading under this condition results in cleavage on the N-terminal side of Trp residues (16Chiara D.C. Trinidad J.C. Wang D. Ziebell M.R. Sullivan D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), when fragments beginning at δThr-51, which contain a Trp in cycle 7, were sequenced (Fig. 8B and Supplemental Fig. 2B), the HPLC fractions were loaded directly onto the glass fiber disk, which was then dried and treated with Biobrene. Sequencing was performed using gas phase trifluoroacetic acid to minimize possible hydrolysis. After conversion of the released amino acids to PTH-derivatives, the suspension was divided into two parts. One portion, usually one-sixth, went to the PTH analyzer, whereas the remaining five-sixths were collected for scintillation counting. For sequencing of fragments containing αM2 (Fig. 7B), two-thirds went to the PTH analyzer, and one-third was collected for scintillation counting. For these samples, the plotted 3H release and PTH-derivative release are those caclulated based for the usual one-sixth mass analysis and five-sixths 3H determination. Yield of PTH-derivatives was calculated from peak height compared with standards using the model 610A Data Analysis Program, version 2.1A. Initial and repetitive yields were calculated by a nonlinear least squares regression to the equation M = I0 × Rn, where M is the observed release, I0 is the initial yield, R is the repetitive yield, and n is the cycle number. PTH-derivatives known to have poor recovery (Ser, Arg, Cys, and His) were omitted from the fit. Details concerning the values of I0 and R for each sequencing run as well as the cpm loaded on the filters and retained after sequencing are provided in the the legends to Supplemental Figs. 1 and 2.Fig. 7Sequence analysis of [3H]azietomidate-labeled α subunit fragments isolated by HPLC from EndoLys-C digests of αV8-20 (A and B) and αV8-18 (C). For αV8-20 and αV8-18 isolated from nAChRs labeled with 1.8 μm [3H]azietomidate (Fig. 6), EndoLys-C digests were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC (Supplemental Fig. 1). Samples from the HPLC were sequenced for αV8-20 that contained the peak of 3H for the +Carb sample (A, fractions 39–43) and for the -Carb sample (B, fractions 29–31), and from αV8-18 the peak of 3H for the -Carb sample (C, fractions 21–24). Plotted are the 3H (○, •) and mass released (□, ▪) for samples labeled in the absence (○, □) or presence (•, ▪) of Carb. A, the primary sequence began at αMet-243, the N terminus of αM2, and a secondary sequence at αSer-173, the N terminus of αV8-20 (+Carb: αMet-243 I0 = 12 pmol, αSer-173 I0 = 6 pmol; -Carb: αMet-243 I0 = 8 pmol, αSer-173 I0 = 7 pmol). The 3H release in cycle 20 (2220 cpm) was consistent with agonist-dependent [3H]azietomidate incorporation into αGlu-262 (180 cpm/pmol). B, for fractions 29–31, the primary sequence began at αHis-186 and a secondary sequence began at αSer-173 (-Carb: αHis-186 I0 = 11 pmol, αSer-173 I0 = 6 pmol; +Carb: αHis-186, I0 = 13 pmol, αSer-173 I0 = 7 pmol) The 3H release in cycles 5 (340 cpm) and 13 (50 cpm) was consistent with agonist-inhibitable [3H]azietomidate incorporation into αTyr-190 (11 cpm/pmol) and αTyr-198 (4 cpm/pmol). C, for the labeled fragment from the EndoLys-C digest of αV8-18, a single sequence was detected beginning at αLys-77 (-Carb: I0 = 33 pmol; +Carb: I0 = 13 pmol). Any secondary sequences were at <5% that level. The 3H release in cycle 17 (730 cpm) was consistent with agonist-inhibitable [3H]azietomidate incorporation into αTyr-93 (17 cpm/pmol). For A–C, the primary sequence for each sample is shown on the top axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 3H incorporation into nAChR residues was quantified based on the results of sequence analysis, where the mass of that residue was calculated from the initial and repetitive yields. In most cases, the increased 3H release in that cycle (cpmn - cpm(n - 1)) was divided by 5 times the mass of that cycle, since 5 times more sample is measured for radioactivity than for mass. 3H release was divided by one-half the mass when two-thirds were analyzed for mass and one-third analyzed for 3H. In either of these calculations, the radioactivity released and the mass levels reflect only the sequenced material. In some cases, the sequencing run was interupted, and the material on the filter was treated with o-phthalaldehyde as described previously (20Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). o-Phthalaldehyde reacts with primary amines preferentially over secondary amines (i.e. proline) and can be used at any sequencing cycle to block Edman degradation of peptides not containing an N-terminal proline at that cycle (27Brauer A.W. Oman C.L. Margolies M.N. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Etomidate and Azietomidate Inhibition of [3H]PCP and [3H]ACh Binding—We tested etomidate and azietomidate as inhibitors of the binding to Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes of [3H]PCP, a positively charged, aromatic amine noncompetitive antagonist. [3H]PCP binds with high affinity (Keq = 1 μm) to a single site per nAChR in the desensitized state and more weakly (Keq = 7 μm) in the absence of agonist (28Oswald R.E. Heidmann T. Changeux J.-P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3128-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the absence or presence of agonist, azietomidate or etomidate at high concentrations inhibited the specific binding of [3H]PCP by >95% (Fig. 1). For nAChRs in the desensitized state, the concentration dependence of inhibition was fit to a single site model with IC50 equal to 70 μm for azietomidate and 130 μm for etomidate. In the absence of agonist, both drugs inhibited [3H]PCP binding with IC50 = 0.7 mm. We also characterized their effects on the equilibrium binding of [3H]ACh at a concentration sufficient to occupy ∼20% of sites, a condition that makes the assay sensitive to drugs that either increase or decrease ACh binding affinity (29Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). At concentrations between 100 and 600 μm, azietomidate increased [3H]ACh binding by 130%, with inhibition seen only at concentrations above millimolar. Etomidate also produced a similar increase and then decrease of [3H]ACh binding but at 3-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 1). In parallel assays, proadifen (100 μm), a well characterized desensitizing aromatic amine noncompetitive antagonist (29Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), also produced a maximal increase of [3H]ACh binding of 130% (data not shown). Photoincorporation of [3H]Azietomidate into nAChR-rich Membranes—The pattern of photoincorporation of [3H]azietomidate into nAChR-rich membranes was determined by incubating membranes with [3H]azietomidate at two concentrations: 1 μm (11 Ci/mmol) and 150 μm (0.073 Ci/mmol), with the isotope dilution for 150 μm chosen so that similar amounts of 3H were added to the membranes at both concentrations. Membranes were photolabeled with [3H]azietomidate in four conditions: (i) in the absence of other drugs; (ii) in the presence of proadifen, which binds to the ion channel and stabilizes nAChRs in the desensitized state without occupying the agonist sites; (iii) in the presence of the agonist Carb, which occupies the ACh sites and stabilizes the nAChR in the desensitized state; or (iv) in the presence of Carb and proadifen. After irradiation, the samples were fractionated on 8% SDS-PAGE. Samples were prepared in triplicate, with one gel prepared for fluorography (Fig. 2A) and two stained and cut into slices for determination of the 3H distribution by liquid scintillation counting (Fig. 2B). At both concentrations, [3H]azietomidate was primarily photoincorporated within the nAChR in the α and δ subunits and also in a 34-kDa polypeptide that is a mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (30Blanton M.P.

We have identified a novel interaction between ERα and the DNA repair protein 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (MPG) thereby providing a functional link between gene expression and DNA repair. Interestingly, the ERα-MPG interaction was enhanced by the presence of estrogen response element (ERE)-containing DNA. In vitro pull-down assays indicated that the interaction of ERα with MPG was direct and occurred through the DNA- and ligand-binding domains and the hinge region of the receptor. More importantly, endogenously expressed ERα and MPG from MCF-7 cells coimmunoprecipitated with ERα- and MPG-specific antibodies. The ERα-MPG interaction had functional consequences on the activities of both proteins. ERα increased MPG acetylation, stabilized the binding of MPG with hypoxanthine-containing oligos, and enhanced MPG-catalyzed removal of hypoxanthine from DNA. In turn, MPG dramatically stabilized the interaction of ERα with ERE-containing oligos, decreased p300-mediated acetylation of the receptor, and reduced transcription of simple and complex ERE-containing reporter plasmids in a dose-dependent manner. Our studies suggest that recruitment of MPG to ERE-containing genes influences transcription and plays a role in maintaining integrity of the genome by recruiting DNA repair proteins to actively transcribing DNA.

Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Like other nuclear receptor family members, ERα has a modular structure. At the amino terminus is the A/B region with its autonomous activation function 1 (6Metzger D. Ali S. Bornert J.-M. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9535-9542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Region C encompasses the DNA binding domain and is linked by the hinge domain to region E, which contains the ligand-binding domain (LBD, Ref. 7Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.-R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain has two zinc finger motifs that are involved in DNA binding. The LBD contains a hydrophobic pocket that interacts with estrogens and antiestrogens. The LBD also contains a ligand-dependent activation function 2, which is responsible for interaction of the receptor with coregulatory proteins (8Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G.

The consensus ERE is comprised of the palindromic sequence GGTCAnnnTGACC and is found in the Xenopus laevis vitellogenin A2 gene (11Klein-Hitpass L. Ryffel G.U. Heitlinger E. Cato A.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 647-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In addition to interacting with EREs, ERα modulates transcription through its interaction with components of the basal transcription machinery, regulatory proteins, and chromatin modifiers (12Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). ERα interacts with proteins in the basal transcription complex including TATA-binding protein (13Brou C. Wu J. Ali S. Scheer E. Lang C. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The coregulatory proteins steroid receptor coactivator 1, transcription intermediary factor 2, and amplified in breast cancer 1, interact with the receptor in a ligand-dependent manner and enhance estrogen responsiveness (reviewed in Refs. 12Robyr D.

Regions of the genome involved in active transcription are more susceptible to DNA-damaging agents, which are present in the environment and as by products of cell metabolism (21Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 22Marnett L.J. Burcham P.C. Chem. Res.

DNA repair systems such as base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair are involved in repair of these DNA lesions (21Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 23Lindahl T. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1995; 19: 73-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If damaged DNA is not repaired, it can lead to mutations, chromosomal aberrations, aging, or cancer (24Wood R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 135-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify novel proteins that interact with the DNA-bound ERα, we have isolated and identified the DNA repair protein 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (MPG). ERα stimulates binding of MPG to modified DNA and increases the catalytic removal of modified bases by MPG. In turn, MPG enhances the binding of ERα to the ERE and modulates estrogen-mediated transcription. Our studies provide evidence of a physical and functional link between these proteins involved in transcription and DNA repair. Pull-down Assay—Pull-down assays were carried out by adsorbing 200 pmol of annealed biotinylated oligos containing the A2 ERE or a nonspecific DNA sequence to streptavidin-agarose beads as described (25Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The immobilized DNA was incubated with 400 pmol of baculovirus-expressed, purified ERα in the presence of 1 μm 17β-estradiol (E2) for 10 min followed by addition of 500 μg of HeLa nuclear extract prepared as described (25Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Immobilized DNA was also incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts in the absence of ERα as a control for nonspecific binding. After 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed as described (25Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and silver stained. A 35-kDa band, which was observed in the presence, but not in the absence of ERα, was excised and analyzed by micro-liquid chromatography-electron spray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MS) as previously reported (26Loven M.A. Muster N. Yates J.R. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). MS/MS analysis identified three peptides, IVETEAYLGPEDEAAHSR, GPLEPSEPAVVAAAR, and AFLGQVLVR with amino acid sequences identical to that found in 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase. These three peptides comprised 14.3% of the total MPG protein. Vectors—The mammalian expression vector, pCDNA3 MPG, was created by isolating the KpnI/HindIII DNA fragment encoding MPG from pRep9-MPG (kindly provided by Timothy O'Connor, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, CA) and inserting it into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which had been cut with KpnI and XbaI. To create the GST-MPG fusion expression vector, the MPG coding region was cut from pCDNA3 MPG with KpnI/XhoI, isolated, and annealed to adapter oligos (Kpn/BamHI forward: 5′-CGTCAGGGATCCTGCGTAC-3′, Kpn/BamHI reverse: 5′-CGTGGATCCCTGACG-3′, Xho/EcoRI forward: 5′-TCGAGCGTCGAATTCCGTG-3′ and Xho/EcoRI reverse: 5′-CAGGGAATTCGACGC-3′). The MPG coding region was then cloned in-frame with GST into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), which had been digested with BamHI and EcoRI. Cell Cultures and Transfections—U2-osteosarcoma (U2-OS) cells were transfected as described (27Loven M.A. Likhite V.S. Choi I. Nardulli A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45282-45288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with 7.5 ng of the ERα expression vector CMVhERα (28Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S.

Romine L.E. Carpo C. Greene G.L. Rainish B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 694-704PubMed Google Scholar), the pS2 ERE and a TATA box (pS2 ERE-CAT, Ref. 29Nardulli A.M. Romine L.E. Carpo C. Greene G.L. Rainish B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 694-704PubMed Google Scholar), or 1.1 kb of 5′-flanking region from the pS2 gene (pS2 CAT, kindly provided by Pierre Chambon, Ref. 7Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.-R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of the MPG expression vector pCDNA3 MPG were combined with an estrogen-responsive reporter plasmid (10, 50, or 100 ng of pCDNA3 MPG with ConsERE (+10)-CAT, 10 or 40 ng of pCDNA3 MPG with pS2ERE-CAT, and 1, 10, or 100 ng of pCDNA3 MPG with pS2-CAT). β-Galactosidase activity was measured (30Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and used to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. CAT assays were performed as described in Ref. 5Loven M.A. Wood J.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, quantitated using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager, and analyzed with ImageQuant 5.0 software. At least three independent experiments were carried out in duplicate. Immunoprecipitation Assays—ERα-associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from MCF-7 nuclear extracts, which had been prepared from cells that were exposed to ethanol or 10 nm E2 for 15 min. The ERα-specific antibody sc-8005 (Santa Cruz Biologicals, Santa Cruz, CA) was cross-linked to beads using the Seize antibody immobilization kit as described by the manufacturer (Pierce) and then incubated with MCF-7 nuclear extracts in IP buffer (10 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm E2) with 100 mm NaCl and protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the beads were washed and bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western analysis was carried out using the ERα-specific antibody sc-543 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or an MPG-specific antibody (kindly provided by Timothy O'Connor, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, CA). The ERα-MPG interaction was also examined by immunoprecipitation of MPG-associated proteins using the MPG-specific antibody. The MPG antibody was adsorbed to Protein A beads and incubated with MCF-7 nuclear extracts prepared from cells that had been exposed to ethanol or 10 nm E2 for 15 min. Immunoprecipitation and Western analysis of proteins was carried out as described above except that the MPG-specific and ERα-specific antibody sc-8002 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was used for detection. Interaction of ERα with Immobilized MPG—Bacterially expressed GST-MPG was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed three times with TEG buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 500 mm NaCl and protease inhibitors. The beads were then washed and resuspended in TEG buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. Full-length and truncated receptors (ERα, AB, CD, E, EF, and 1-530), which had been transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT T7 Quick-coupled transcription translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) as described (26Loven M.A. Muster N. Yates J.R. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were then combined with immobilized GST-MPG. The 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with immobilized MPG for 1 h at 4 °C in the absence or presence of 1 μm E2 and the unbound proteins were removed by four washes with TEG buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. The bound 35S-labeled proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. For interaction studies with nuclear receptors, progesterone receptor B (PRB), thyroid receptor β, retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) were expressed as 35S-labeled proteins (26Loven M.A. Muster N. Yates J.R. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and studies were carried out using GSTMPG as described above. Pull-down assays were also used to determine whether the receptor interacted directly with MPG. Immobilized GST-MPG was combined with purified ERα in TEG buffer containing 200 mm NaCl and 1 μm E2 and samples were processed as described above. To examine the effect of DNA on ERα-MPG interaction, GST-MPG was combined with the endogenous ERα present in MCF-7 nuclear extracts, which was prepared from cells that had been exposed to 10 nm E2 for 15 min. The immobilized GST-MPG was prepared as described above and incubated with 35 μg of MCF-7 nuclear proteins in TEG buffer containing 100 mm NaCl in the absence or presence of oligos containing a nonspecific DNA sequence or the A2 ERE sequence for 1 h at 4 °C. After four washes with TEG buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western analysis was carried out using the ERα-specific antibody sc-543 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) to determine the levels of bound ERα. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Gel mobility shift assays were carried out as previously reported (25Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. To examine the effect of MPG on ERα-DNA interaction, 25 or 75 fmol of purified ERα was combined with 32P-labeled, A2 ERE-containing oligos and incubated for 5 min at 25 °C in Binding buffer A (20 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm E2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 20 mm KCl) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Increasing amounts (0.1, 1, or 10 pmol) of purified MPG were added as indicated. The protein concentration was adjusted to 10 μg with bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 10 μl. Competition experiments included 1 pmol of unlabeled oligos containing a nonspecific DNA sequence or the A2 ERE. Supershift experiments included the ERα-specific antibody sc-8002 or the MPG-specific antibody. After incubation for 10 min at 25 °C, the complexes were separated on a nondenaturing acrylamide gel, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. The film was scanned and bands were quantitated using ImageQuant 5.0 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The effect of ERα on the interaction of MPG with DNA was examined with hypoxanthine-containing oligos (HxDNA, 5′-CCTAGATTACTTCTCATGTT/Hx/GACATACTCAGATCTACC-3′ and 5′-GGTAGATCTGAGTATGTCTAACATGAGAAGTAATCTAGG-3′), which were purified on a denaturing 20% acrylamide gel, isolated, annealed, and end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP. The labeled oligos were combined with 250 or 500 fmol of purified MPG in Binding buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgOAc, 100 mm potassium l-glutamate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm E2) containing 10 μg of bovine serum albumin and 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC) per reaction in a 10-μl final volume. Increasing amounts of purified ERα (0.5, 1, or 2 pmol) were added to the reaction mixture as indicated. Protein and salt concentrations were held constant by addition of ovalbumin and/or KCl. After 10 min at 4 °C, the complexes were separated on a nondenaturing acrylamide gel. The free probe and the bound complex were quantitated using an Amer-sham Biosciences PhosphorImager and ImageQuant 5.0. Student's t tests were conducted to determine whether statistical differences existed in the binding of MPG to the HxDNA in the absence or presence of ERα. MPG Activity Assays—To determine the effect of ERα on MPG-catalyzed removal of hypoxanthine, 32P-labeled HxDNA was combined with 2 pmol of ERα, 500 fmol of MPG, or 500 fmol of MPG and increasing amounts of ERα (0.5, 1, or 2 pmol). Protein and salt concentrations were held constant by addition of ovalbumin or KCl. The binding reaction was incubated at 4 °C for 10 min to allow binding of MPG to HxDNA, followed by incubation for 2 min at 37 °C to allow MPG-catalyzed removal of hypoxanthine to occur (31Miao F. Bouziane M. O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The DNA was denatured under alkaline conditions (2 mm EDTA, 0.2 n NaOH), precipitated in the presence of 1 μg of tRNA, resuspended in formamide buffer, and separated on a denaturing 20% acrylamide gel. The wet gel was analyzed using Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and ImageQuant 5.0. Student's t tests were used to determine whether statistical differences existed between MPG assays carried out in the absence and presence of ERα. Acetylation of MPG and ERα by p300—Acetylation assays were carried out with purified p300 and 3H-labeled acetyl-CoA as described (26Loven M.A. Muster N. Yates J.R. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Purified MPG (20 pmol), ERα (1 pmol), or histones were included as indicated in the presence of 1 μm E2. Assays were conducted and quantitated using ImageQuant 5.0. Student's t tests were used to determine whether statistical differences existed in protein acetylation when both ERα and MPG were present. Interaction of Nuclear Proteins with the DNA-bound ERα—To identify novel ERα-associated proteins, we examined the ability of the ERE-bound receptor to recruit HeLa nuclear proteins in DNA pull-down experiments. Immobilized ERE-containing oligos were incubated with purified ERα and HeLa nuclear extracts. After extensive washing, the proteins associated with the DNA-bound receptor were fractionated on denaturing gels and silver-stained. A unique 35-kDa band was seen in the presence of ERα and the A2 ERE (Fig. 1, lane 4), but was absent when ERα was not included in the binding reaction (lane 3). Likewise, this band was also absent when a nonspecific DNA sequence was included in the binding reaction (lanes 1 and 2). The 35-kDa silver-stained band was excised and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. Three peptides, which contained amino acid sequences identical to that found in the MPG, demonstrated that MPG was associated with the DNA-bound ERα. MPG is a 35-kDa DNA repair protein involved in base excision repair. MPG recognizes and removes damaged bases such as 3-methylpurines leaving behind an apurinic site that is further processed by other DNA repair proteins (31Miao F. Bouziane M. O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 33Chakravarti D. Ibeanu G.C. Tano K. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15710-15715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Influence of A2 ERE-containing DNA on the ERα-MPG Interaction—To determine whether MPG could interact directly with ERα, immobilized GST-MPG was combined with purified ERα. ERα bound to the GST-MPG (Fig. 2, panel A, lane 3) demonstrating that the interaction between ERα and MPG was direct and did not require additional proteins. In contrast, ERα was not retained on the resin when GST-MPG was omitted (lanes 2). Our initial pull-down experiments suggested that ERE-containing DNA might influence the ERα-MPG interaction. To determine whether this was the case, immobilized GST-MPG was incubated with MCF-7 nuclear extracts, which contained endogenously expressed ERα. ERα was pulled down by the GST-MPG in the absence of DNA (Fig. 2, panel B, lane 3). Addition of oligos containing a nonspecific DNA sequence did not affect the amount of ERα pulled down (lane 4). However, inclusion of oligos containing the A2 ERE enhanced the amount of ERα associated with GST-MPG (lane 5) confirming that the A2 ERE enhanced the ERα-MPG interaction. Regions of ERα Required for Interaction with MPG—Because we had established that ERα could interact directly with MPG, we next sought to identify the region of the receptor responsible for this interaction. In vitro synthesized, 35S-labeled full-length or truncated ERα was incubated with immobilized GST-MPG in the absence or presence of E2. Specifically bound proteins were eluted, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. The full-length receptor (Fig. 3, ERα) and the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant (1-530) interacted with the immobilized GST-MPG in a ligand-independent manner (lanes 3 and 4). However, the amino terminus of ERα (AB) was incapable of interacting with GST-MPG. The CD, EF, and E domains of the receptor interacted with GST-MPG in the absence and presence of E2. In contrast, neither full-length nor truncated ERα was retained on the beads when GST-MPG was omitted (lane 2). Unprogrammed lysate, which contained no ERα DNA template, did not interact with GST-MPG. These data demonstrate that the DNA-binding domain, hinge region, and the LBD are involved in the ERα-MPG interaction. Interaction of Endogenous ERα and MPG—We next assessed the levels of MPG protein present in nuclear extracts from human osteosarcoma (U2-OS), cervical (HeLa), and breast cancer (MCF-7) cells using Western analysis. MPG was detected in HeLa and MCF-7 nuclear extracts, but not in U2-OS nuclear extracts (Fig. 4, panel A). Thus, MCF-7 cells, which express both MPG and ERα and are estrogen-responsive, provided an appropriate cell line to study the ERα-MPG interaction in a biologically relevant environment. When MCF-7 nuclear extracts were incubated with an ERα-specific antibody, similar levels of ERα were immunoprecipitated from ethanol and E2-treated cells (Fig. 4, panel B, lanes 4 and 5, upper bands). Probing of the same blot with an MPG-specific antibody revealed that MPG was immunoprecipitated with ERα in the absence and presence of E2 (Fig. 4, panel B, lanes 4 and 5, lower bands). Likewise when MCF-7 nuclear proteins were immunoprecipitated with an MPG-specific antibody, both ERα and MPG were present regardless of whether the cells had not or had been treated with E2 (panel C, lanes 4 and 5, upper and lower bands). In contrast, when no antibody was included in the reaction, neither ERα nor MPG was detected (lane 3). Comparable levels of ERα and MPG were detected in nuclear extracts from ethanol- and E2-treated cells (lanes 1 and 2). Thus, endogenous MPG and ERα present in MCF-7 cells interact in the absence and presence of E2. Effect of ERα on Interaction of MPG with Hypoxanthine-containing DNA—MPG recognizes and binds to damaged bases such as 3-methyladenine and hypoxanthine and brings about catalytic removal of these damaged bases (31Miao F.

When 500 fmol of purified MPG was incubated with a radiolabeled oligo containing a single hypoxanthine residue (HxDNA), a protein-DNA complex was formed (Fig. 5, panel A, MPG-HxDNA, lane 2). As expected, when the amount of MPG in the binding reaction was reduced by half (250 fmol), the formation of the MPG-DNA complex was reduced (lane 3). However, inclusion of increasing concentrations of ERα with 250 fmol of MPG elicited a dose-dependent increase in the intensity of the MPG-HxDNA complex (lanes 4-6). This increase in MPG-DNA complex formation was not because of an increase in protein concentration because total protein levels were held constant by the addition of ovalbumin. Although the presence of MPG in this complex was confirmed by supershifting the protein-DNA complex with an MPG-specific antibody, there was no change in the migration of the protein-DNA complex when an ERα-specific antibody was used (data not shown). The specificity of the protein-DNA complex formation was confirmed by the ability of unlabeled hypoxanthine-containing oligos, but not an unmodified DNA sequence, to compete for MPG binding (data not shown)"

Furthermore, the isolated C-domain of aIF2α is responsible for binding of the α subunit to γ. This binding involves an idiosyncratic loop of domain 2 of aIF2γ. Association of the C-domain of aIF2α to aIF2γ is enough to retrieve the binding affinity of tRNA for aIF2. The N-terminal and central domains of aIF2α do not interfere with tRNA binding.

In the initiation of translation, the recognition of a start codon on a mRNA involves a specialized initiator tRNA. This tRNA is always esterified with methionine. Several proteins, called initiation factors, contribute along with the ribosome to the success of the initiator tRNA-mRNA interaction. Such initiation factors differ in the three domains of life. The case of bacteria is apparently the simplest, with three initiation factors involved, IF1, 1The abbreviations used are: IF, initiation factor; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; e/aIF, eukaryotic and archaeal initiation factors; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: IF, initiation factor; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; e/aIF, eukaryotic and archaeal initiation factors; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. IF2, and IF3. Among these, IF2 ensures the carrying of f-Met-tRNAfMet toward the P site on the ribosome (1Gualerzi C.O. Brandi L. Caserta E. La Teana A. Spurio R. Tomsic J. Pon C.L. Garrett R.A.

In Eukarya, translation begins at the capped 5′ end of mRNA with a 43 S ribosomal complex containing the small 40 S ribosomal subunit, an eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAMeti complex and four initiation factors (eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4F, and eIF3) (2Merrick W.C.

Characteristics from both the bacterial and the eukaryal domains are encountered. As in bacteria, the small ribosomal subunit is prepositioned in the vicinity of the AUG start codon through pairing of 16 S rRNA with a Shine-Dalgarno sequence. In contrast to bacteria, but as in Eukarya, the methionine esterified to initiator tRNA is not formylated. Possibly in line with this property, the heterotrimeric aIF2 protein, responsible for transport of initiator tRNA, resembles eukaryal eIF2, not a bacterial IF2 (18Kyrpides N.C. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl.

A. 1998; 95: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). As in Eukarya, eIF5B, a homologue of eubacterial IF2, exists in Archaea (20Lee J.H. Choi S.K. Roll-Mecak A. Burley S.K. Dever T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4342-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Orthologs of eIF1, eIF1A, eIF5A, and eIF6 are clearly present. Orthologs of eIF4, eIF5, eIF2B, and eIF3 are not found (18Kyrpides N.C. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3726-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Kyrpides N.C. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). e/aIF2 results from the association of three subunits, α, β, and γ. The γ subunit forms the core of the heterotrimer. It interacts with both the α and β subunits. In the trimer, the α and β subunits do not interact with one another (21Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the γ subunit was recently determined in the case of the archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi. This subunit displays a GTP binding site and strongly resembles active EF-Tu (21Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This homology led to the proposal that tRNA is recognized by aIF2γ in a manner similar to that encountered in EF-Tu. aIF2β is made of two domains. The structures of these domains are known in the case of Methanococcus jannaschii aIF2β. A zinc finger in the C-terminal domain is involved in the selection of the start codon, probably through mRNA binding (22Donahue T.F. Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Valavicius B.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 23Castilho-Valavicius B. Thompson G.M. Donahue T.F. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 297-309PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain participates in the binding of the γ subunit (10Thompson G.M. Pacheco E. Melo E.O. Castilho B.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A possible role of eIF2β in the binding of tRNA remains controversial (24Mitsui K. Datta A. Ochoa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4128-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Flynn A. Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Notably, the polylysine motifs found at the N terminus side of eIF2β are absent in archaeal aIF2β. In eucarya, these motifs are essential to the association with eIF5 (8Das S. Maiti T. Das K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31712-31718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G.

Widom J. Clardy J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17057-17061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This segment comprises two of the eIF2α domains, an N-terminal β-barrel followed by a helical domain. The structure of the third domain is not known. In the β-barrel, a mobile loop harbors a serine that is the target of specific kinases in response to several conditions of stress (reviewed in Refs. 27Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hershey J.W. J. Biol.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-244Google Scholar). This serine is conserved in all eucaryal eIF2α sequences, not in the archaeal aIF2α ones. In eucarya, the eIF2α subunit is thought to play an important role in the control of the action of the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B (31Nika J. Rippel S. Hannig E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Archaea, eIF2B has no equivalent, and nucleotide exchange on aIF2 is thought to occur spontaneously. Notably, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations in the SUI2 gene encoding eIF2α were found to cause a relaxed start codon specificity in the corresponding strain. Indeed, in the mutant strain, translation of HIS4 can be initiated at a UUG codon (32Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Feng L. Donahue T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2784-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this study, to evaluate the role of each aIF2 subunit in tRNA selection, the affinities of aminoacylated tRNA for aIF2γ alone or in combination with either aIF2α or aIF2β, were measured. aIF2γ binds methionylated initiator tRNA with tight recognition of the methionyl moiety in a pocket of domain 2. Under our assay conditions, aIF2β does not participate in tRNA binding. On the other hand, the addition of aIF2α strongly reinforces the affinity of aIF2γ for methionylated initiator tRNA. We show that the C-terminal domain of aIF2α associates with a loop of aIF2γ. The addition of this C-domain to aIF2γ is enough to retrieve full tRNA binding affinity. Although it does not contribute to tRNA binding, the isolated N-terminal domain of aIF2α shows general RNA binding properties. This property suggests a role of aIF2α in rRNA or mRNA binding, which might be related to the known importance of this subunit for the selection of the start codon (32Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Feng L. Donahue T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2784-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of aIF2 Subunits—Wild-type α, β, and γ subunits of aIF2 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells from pET3a-based vectors. The proteins were purified as described (21Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Stoichiometric amounts of each subunit were mixed to obtain an αγ, βγ dimer, or αβγ trimer. Stoichiometry and proper assembly of the oligomers were verified by PAGE analysis under native and denaturing conditions. Mutants of aIF2α and aIF2γ were constructed by using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned genes (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To construct the γΔL1 gene, the sequence corresponding to residues 221–227 of aIF2γ was replaced by a glycine codon. To construct the γΔL2 gene, the sequence corresponding to residues 256–265 of aIF2γ was replaced by a glycine codon. To obtain αD1, the codon corresponding to Gln88 in the α subunit was replaced by a TGA stop codon. The DNA encoding αD1–2 was obtained by replacing the codon corresponding to Val-173 with a TGA stop codon. The DNAs coding for αD2–3 and αD3 were obtained by PCR amplification with the introduction of a start codon in position 88 or a start codon in position 173, respectively, followed by recloning of the amplification product into a pET3a derivative. Mutant aIF2γ proteins were expressed and purified as described above for the wild-type subunit. Mutants of truncated aIF2α proteins corresponding to αD1 and αD3 were purified as described for the full-length α subunit (21Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the cases of αD1–2 and αD2–3, the Mono S step was replaced by a Mono Q step, according to the acidic isoelectric point of these proteins (6.5 for both). In all cases, mutant proteins were overexpressed in soluble, thermostable form and at high levels (final yield of about 20 mg of protein per liter of culture). This indicates that all mutants were stably folded. Protection Assay—tRNAfMet, tRNAlVal, and their variants were produced in E. coli from constructed genes, as described (33Guillon J.M. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Fayat S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 34Meinnel T. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15906-15914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The gene for tRNAMeti from P. abyssi was constructed by assembly of oligonucleotides and inserted into pBSTNAV (35Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8095-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). tRNAs were purified by anion exchange chromatography (35Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8095-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Amino acid acceptor capacities were between 800 and 1400 pmol per A260 unit. Full aminoacylation with [35S]methionine (10,000 dpm/pmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was achieved using homogeneous E. coli Met547 MetRS (36Mellot P. Mechulam Y. LeCorre D. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Valylation with [3H]Val (4500 dpm/pmol, Amersham Biosciences) was performed with homogeneous E. coli ValRS (37Brevet A. Chen J. Lévêque F. Plateau P. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8275-8279Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Aminoacyl-tRNAs were precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 0.3 m NaAc, pH 5.5, and stored at –20 °C in water in small aliquots. Before use, levels of aminoacylation were systematically determined after precipitation in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Protection by aIF2 of aminoacylated tRNAs against spontaneous hydrolysis was performed as follows. Reaction mixtures (150 μl) contained 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Sciences), 5% glycerol, 1 mm Gpp(NH)p and 80 nm of the aminoacylated tRNA under consideration. Concentrations of aIF2 or of its variants were varied from 20 nm to 50 μm according to the Kd value to be measured. The mixtures were incubated at 51 °C. To determine the rate constant of deacylation, 25-μl aliquots were withdrawn at various times (5 to 30 min) and precipitated in 5% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 80 μg of yeast RNA as carrier. In all cases, the deacylation curve as a function of time could be fitted with a single exponential. Rate constants measured at variable protein concentrations were fitted to simple binding curves from which the dissociation constant of the studied protein-tRNA complexes could be deduced using the MC-Fit program (38Dardel F. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 273-275PubMed Google Scholar). Typical experiments are illustrated in Fig. 3. The concentrations of aIF2γ or of heterotrimeric aIF2 were determined by measuring the zinc content in the protein preparations by atomic absorption spectroscopy as described (21Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Indeed, aIF2γ contains one zinc ion, whereas aIF2 contains two zinc ions. The percentage of active protein was then measured by making a protection test of 1 μmMet-tRNAfMet in the presence of 0.8 μm aIF2. From the determination of the amount of protected tRNA, it was concluded that aIF2 was 100% active. This indicates in addition that our aIF2 preparations do not contain residual GDP. Native Gel Electrophoresis and Gel Shift Assay—aIF2 α, β, and γ subunits display basic isoelectric points of 8.7, 8.0, and 8.0, respectively. The isoelectric point of αD1 and αD3 is 9.6, that of αD1–2 and αD2–3is 6.5. To follow molecular assembly between subunits or their variants, acidic native gels were prepared. Each gel contained a separation part with 12% acrylamide (37.5:1, Bio-Rad) at pH 4.3 (120 mm KOH plus 72 mm acetic acid) and a stacking region composed of 4% acrylamide at pH 6.8 (120 mm KOH, 12 mm acetic acid). The gel was run in a buffer, pH 4.4, containing 133 mm acetic acid and 350 mm β-alanine during 1 h at 150 V at room temperature in a Protean II system (Bio-Rad). Proteins were revealed with Coomassie Brillant Blue. The observed migrations of the isolated subunits, of the dimers and trimer, were consistent with their molecular ratios. Gel shift assays were performed by mixing various amounts of the studied protein with E. coli tRNAMetf (4 μm final concentration) in 50 mm TBE buffer, pH 8.3, containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The volume of the applied samples was 20 μl. For competition experiments, various amounts of E. coli 16 S + 23 S rRNA (Roche Applied Sciences) were added to tRNAMetf and protein (see legend of Fig. 4). Molecular Sieving—Purified wild-type or mutant subunits (in the 10 μm range) were mixed pairwise or all three together in 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.7, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 500 mm NaCl. Each individual protein or mixture of proteins (αβ, βγ, αγ, αβγ, βγΔL1, αγΔL1, αβγΔL1, βγΔL2, αγΔL2, αD1γ, αD1–2γ, αD3γ) were chromatographed onto a TSK3000 SWXL column equilibrated in the same buffer (Tosohaas, Japan, 7.8 × 3000 mm2). Elution was performed at 0.7 ml/min. An example is shown in Fig. 6. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra of aIF2γ proteins at a concentration of 2.5 μm in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.7, plus 100 mm NaCl were recorded at 20 °C in a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter (2 nm bandwidth, 1-mm path cuvette). Binding of Initiator Met-tRNA to aIF2—Protection of aminoacylated tRNA by EF-Tu against spontaneous deacylation is well documented (39Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Krauss G. Peters F. Maass G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consequently, one expects that aIF2 can also protect archaeal Met-tRNA. To evidence such an effect, we overexpressed in E. coli a gene corresponding to the initiator tRNA of P. abyssi. The product of this gene, tRNAMeti, was purified and assayed for its ability to bind heterotrimeric aIF2 after aminoacylation with [35S]methionine. At 51 °C, Met-tRNAMeti (80 nm) deacylated spontaneously at a rate of 0.28 min–1. In the presence of aIF2 (5 μm) and of the GTP analogue Gpp(NH)p (1 mm), strong protection was observed. The measured deacylation rate was reduced to a value lower than 0.009 min–1. Upon Gpp(NH)p omission, the protection was lost. With GDP instead of Gpp(NH)p, the deacylation rate was 0.11 min–1 (5 μm aIF2 and 1 mm GDP-Mg2+). By measuring deacylation rates in the presence of various concentrations of aIF2, a dissociation constant of Met-tRNAiMet from the aIF2-Gpp(NH)p-Met-tRNAiMet complex could be deduced. The Kd value is 90 ± 30 nm (Table I, row 1). Notably, this Kd value is identical when GTP is used instead of the non-hydrolyzable Gpp(NH)p analogue. This indicates that under the assay conditions, no significant spontaneous GTP hydrolysis occurs, and suggests that efficient GTP hydrolysis by aIF2 is related to start codon selection on the ribosome, as this is the case for eukaryal eIF2 (12Huang H.K. Yoon H. Hannig E.M. Donahue T.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2396-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Table IDissociation constants of aminoacylated tRNAs from their complexes with wild-type alF2tRNA variantsKdnm1Met-tRNA iMetP. abyssi90 ± 302Met-tRNA fMet120 ± 403Met-tRNA fMet A1-U7290 ± 304Met-tRNA mMet450 ± 1005Met-tRNA 1Val CAU400 ± 1006Val-tRNA 1Val> 50,0007Val-tRNA fMet UAC> 50,0008Met-tRNA fMet G1-C72320 ± 80 Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 2, initiator tRNA from P. abyssi closely resembles that from E. coli. The sequences of the acceptor stems are identical, the only exception being a weak A1-U72 base pair in the archaeal tRNA instead of the unpaired C1-A72 bases of bacterial tRNAs. In agreement with this resemblance, when added in the protection assay, E. coliMet-tRNAfMet appeared as good a ligand of P. abyssi aIF2 as the P. abyssi initiator tRNA produced in E. coli (Table I, rows 1 and 2). Moreover, the change of the C1-A72 mismatch of E. coli tRNAMetf into a A1-U72 base pair, as in an archaeal tRNA, had no significant effect on the binding affinity to aIF2 (Table I, rows 2 and 3). We concluded that the highly conserved A1-U72 base pair of archaeal and eucaryal initiator tRNAs is not required for aIF2 binding. Finally, this comparison validates the use of E. coliMet-tRNAfMet as a model ligand to study complex formation between aIF2 and tRNA. Specificity of the assay based on deacylation of an aminoacylated tRNA was evaluated using several aminoacyl-tRNAs. First, protection against deacylation of E. coli Val-tRNAVall could not be observed, even in the presence of 50 μm aIF2 (Table I, row 6). Specificity of the factor toward the methionine moiety of the initiator Met-tRNA was established by using a tRNAMetf variant with a UAC anticodon instead of the CAU one. This variant can be aminoacylated with valine in the presence of E. coli ValRS (33Guillon J.M. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Fayat S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 40Schulman L.H. Pelka H. Science. 1988; 242: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The resulting Val-tRNAMetf UAC escapes protection against deacylation, even in the presence of up to 50 μm aIF2 (Table I, row 7). Therefore, with valine instead of methionine, the binding affinity of aminoacylated initiator tRNA appears to have been reduced by at least 2 orders of magnitude. Two other tRNAs aminoacylated with methionine, distinct from initiator tRNA, were also assayed for their resistance to deacylation in the presence of aIF2. The first one was E. coli elongator Met-tRNAMetm. The second one was a derivative of tRNAVall carrying a CAU anticodon that allows its aminoacylation by MetRS (40Schulman L.H. Pelka H. Science. 1988; 242: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although different from initiator tRNA in their nucleotide sequences, these two methionylated tRNAs are efficiently protected against deacylation (Table I, rows 4 and 5). We therefore concluded that the methionyl moiety plays a crucial role in the binding to the factor. However, the dissociation constants of the two above methionylated tRNAs are increased by a factor of 4, as compared with Met-tRNAfMet. This difference indicates some participation of the polynucleotide itself to aIF2 binding. To test this idea, an E. coli tRNAMetf variant with a G1-C72 base pair instead of the wild-type unpaired C1-A72 bases was prepared. aIF2 protects this tRNA from deacylation. However, the dissociation constant of this ligand is increased by a factor of 3 compared with that of authentic Met-tRNAfMet (Table I, rows 2 and 8). We conclude that the absence of strong base pairing at positions 1–72 as in P. abyssi tRNAMeti or in E. coli tRNAMetf contributes to optimal binding to aIF2. Finally, we observed that neither non-aminoacylated tRNAfMet (up to a concentration of 10 μm) nor free methionine (up to a concentration of 5 mm) competed with Met-tRNAfMet binding to aIF2 (data not shown). The α Subunit Reinforces the Binding of tRNA to the γ Subunit—The three-dimensional structure of the aIF2γ subunit shows a strong resemblance with EF-Tu:GTP. This similarity suggests a pivotal role of the aIF2γ subunit in the binding of tRNA. Accordingly, this subunit is active in the Gpp(NH)p-dependent protection of Met-tRNAfMet against deacylation, although the corresponding dissociation constant (5 μm, Table II row 1, and Fig. 3) is markedly higher than that measured with the complete heterotrimeric aIF2 (120 nm; Table II, row 5). On the other hand, the binding is lost if Val-tRNAfMet UAC is used as a ligand (Table II, row 2). Therefore, the γ subunit supports recognition of the methionyl group esterified on tRNA. In agreement with this idea, protection is restored by using the Met-tRNAVal CAU ligand (data not shown).Table IIDissociation constants of Met-tRNA fMet or Val-tRNA fMet UAC (80 nm) from their complexes with the indicated combinations of wild-type (wt) or mutant alF2 subunitsαβγKdnm1——wt5,000 ± 3,000aMet-tRNA fMet.2——wt>80,000bVal-tRNA fMet UAC.3—wtwt5,000 ± 3,000aMet-tRNA fMet.4wt—wt44 ± 20aMet-tRNA fMet.5wtwtwt120 ± 40aMet-tRNA fMet.6——L1>50,000aMet-tRNA fMet.7wt—L1>50,000aMet-tRNA fMet.8wtwtL2130 ± 60aMet-tRNA fMet.9wtwtG235D>50,000aMet-tRNA fMet.10D1—wt10,000 ± 4,000aMet-tRNA fMet.11D1·2—wt10,000 ± 4,000aMet-tRNA fMet.12D3—wt42 ± 20aMet-tRNA fMet.a Met-tRNA fMet.b Val-tRNA fMet UAC. Open table in a new tab The large difference between the Kd value with the γ subunit and that with the full aIF2 trimer suggests that the α and/or the β subunit participate in tRNA binding. To test this idea, Met-tRNAfMet dissociation constants were measured with either the αγ or βγ dimer. Whereas no improvement of the binding was observed with the βγ pair as compared with aIF2γ alone (Table II, rows 1 and 3), the affinity of Met-tRNAfMet for αγ was similar to that of the intact trimer (Table II, rows 4 and 5). By using aIF2α alone (up to 5 μm), no protection of Met-tRNAfMet against deacylation could be observed. However, evidence that aIF2α interacts with tRNA was obtained from a gel shift experiment. As shown in Fig. 4 (panel A, left), the α subunit alone induces retardation of tRNA migration on a polyacrylamide gel. The apparent dissocia"

Depending on the cell type, binding of ATP to its receptors can initiate important signaling events like (i) increases in intracellular calcium; (ii) activation of phospholipases; (iii) modulation of cell volume; (iv) inhibition of platelet aggregation; (v) alteration of vascular tone; (vi) neurotransmission; (vii) elevation of cardiac/skeletal muscle contractility; (viii) immune cell activation; (ix) increased ciliary beat frequency and mucus secretion; and (x) enhanced cell growth and proliferation (3Novak I. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although routes of ATP release are not well defined, cytolysis, vesicle-mediated ATP release, and ATP release via channels like ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins and connexin hemichannels may contribute (1Bodin P.

Whether extracellular ATP release occurs due to oxidative stresses like hyperoxia, and what the functional significance of this process could be is unknown. Microvascular endothelial cells are primary targets of hyperoxic lung injury (8Crapo J.D. Barry B.E. Foscue H.A. Shelburne J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1980; 122: 123-143PubMed Google Scholar) and in other forms of acute respiratory failure. Hypoxic preexposure of human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) attenuates cell death caused by subsequent hyperoxic exposure (9Ahmad S. Ahmad A. Gerasimovskaya E. Stenmark K.R. Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This is partially attributed to up-regulation of PI 3-kinase (PI3K), a component of an established cell survival pathway. Previously we showed that hypoxic (1 or 3% O2) exposure induces ATP release in HLMVEC and fetal lung fibroblasts (10Gerasimovskaya E.V. Ahmad S. White C.W. Jones P.L. Carpenter T.C. Stenmark K.R. J.

There, hypoxia and ATP act synergistically to upregulate common proliferation-inducing pathways in fibroblasts. Extracellular ATP and purinergic receptor activation play a critical role in determining the intracellular effects of key growth-regulating factors (11Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Insel P.A. J. Biol.

Narendran A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L789-800PubMed Google Scholar, 15Berra E. Milanini J. Richard D.E. Le Gall M. Vinals F. Gothie E. Roux D. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we speculated that ATP release, if present in hyperoxia, could activate important survival pathways. Using primary HLMVEC, we demonstrate that ATP is released in hyperoxia and that the presence of extracellular ATP is essential for survival of these cells. We determined the effect of extracellular ATP on glucose uptake, PI3K activity, p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation, and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation in HLMVEC. Our findings strongly support the notion that extracellular ATP, through purinergic receptors, signals these important events.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Culture—Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) were purchased from Clonetics Ltd (San Diego, CA) and cultured as per the manufacturer's protocol in 100-mm dishes (9Ahmad S. Ahmad A. Gerasimovskaya E. Stenmark K.R. Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Hyperoxic exposures were performed at sea level atmospheric pressure as described previously (16Ahmad S. White C.W. Chang L.Y. Schneider B.K. Allen C.B. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L779-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Allen C.B. Schneider B.K. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 281: L1021-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were 70–80% confluent when exposed. These cells growth arrest within 24 h in hyperoxia and, thus, cultures never exceeded 90% confluence. In order to match confluence of cells, cells in normoxia (21% O2) were studied after 24 h in culture. Fresh medium was supplied daily during hyperoxic exposures.Determination of Extracellular and Intracellular ATP Content— Total ATP content in extracellular medium was detected with a luciferase-luciferin kit (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD) using a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) (10Gerasimovskaya E.V.

Cells in 100-mm cell culture dishes were exposed to either normoxia (21% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2) or hyperoxia (95% O2, 5% CO2) at 5 liters/min flow rate at 37 °C for the indicated time periods. At the beginning of the experiment, medium was drained from cells and fresh medium that had been pre-equilibrated with the appropriate gas mixture was infused onto the cell monolayer. After incubation, 1 ml of conditioned medium was collected into chilled polypropylene tubes (Sigma) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove any cell debris. Individual 100-μl aliquots were taken and the luciferin-luciferase assay was carried out as described previously (18Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L159-164PubMed Google Scholar).2-[3H]Deoxyglucose Uptake—2-Deoxyglucose (DOG) uptake was determined as described (19Harmon A.W. Patel Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum or maintained in glucose-free DMEM in 6-well plates 24 h prior to experiments. For measuring 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake, cells were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer-phosphate-HEPES (KRP-HEPES) buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated in 950 μl of KRP-Hepes buffer for 60 min. Cells were then treated with ATP for 30 min or exposed to hyperoxia for 4 h. Glucose uptake was measured by adding 20 μl of glucose mixture (5 mm 2-deoxyglucose, 0.5 μCi of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose in KRP-HEPES buffer) to 980 μl of KRP-HEPES buffer and incubating for 20 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific glucose uptake was measured in parallel incubations in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B, which blocks transporter-mediated glucose uptake, and was subtracted from total uptake in each assay. Uptake was terminated by washing the cells three times with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were subsequently lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaOH solution containing 0.1% SDS, and the solution was rotated for 15 min. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter.Assay for PI 3-Kinase Activity—PI3K activity was assessed as described previously by the incorporation of [32P]ATP into exogenous phosphoinositide resulting in the production of PI 3-phosphate (PI3P) (9Ahmad S. Ahmad A. Gerasimovskaya E. Stenmark K.R. Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis of Cellular Extracts for Phospho-ERK-1/2 and Phospho-p70 S6 Kinase—Cells were harvested and Western blot analysis was performed for the detection of phospho-ERK and total ERK as previously reported (10Gerasimovskaya E.V.

Antibodies against phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and used at a dilution of 1:1000.Measurement of Arachidonic Acid (AA) Release—The protocol used for determining AA release was as described (20Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). HLMVEC were plated in 6-well plates at 50,000 cells/well and incubated in growth medium until they reached 60–70% confluence. Cells were then washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated with 0.5 μCi of [3H]AA/well in serum-free medium overnight. Cells were then washed to remove unincorporated [3H]AA and incubated in HBSS supplemented with 0.05% BSA. Hyperoxic exposure or incubation with ATP was performed, and the medium was collected at appropriate times. Medium was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the amount of radio-activity in the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting. Cells were scraped in 0.5 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 for determining the total cellular radioactivity.Detection of Prostaglandins—After exposure of HLMVEC to hyperoxia for the specified duration, medium was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and supernatants were collected and frozen at -70 °C. Prostaglandins pGE2 and 6-keto-pGF1α were analyzed using an EIA kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Determination of Cell Survival and Protein Concentration—Cell death in HLMVEC was assessed by using YOYO-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a plasma membrane impermeable dye that binds to DNA irreversibly (21Becker B. Clapper J. Harkins K.R. Olson J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as described before (9Ahmad S. Ahmad A. Gerasimovskaya E. Stenmark K.R. Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined using the BioRad DC protein assay kit in a 96-well plate with bovine serum albumin as a standard.Statistical Analysis—All statistical calculations were performed with JMP and SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Means were compared either by two-tailed Student's t test for comparison between two groups or one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer test for multiple comparisons of analyses involving three or more groups. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. For 2-deoxyglucose uptake experiments 2-way ANOVA was performed. Dunnett's test was used to compare levels of a factor (treatment or inhibitor) to controls within each level of the factor. This procedure was applied only if a significant interaction was observed for the 2-way ANOVA. A p value of <0.01 was considered significant.RESULTSEffect of Hyperoxic Exposure on Extracellular ATP in HLMVEC—Exposure of human lung microvascular endothelial cells to hyperoxia (95% O2) elicited an increase in extracellular ATP in a time-dependent manner (10–120 min) (Fig. 1). The experiment was performed both with and without serum to exclude any possible contribution of growth factors (medium without serum had no growth factors added) or serum. Extracellular ATP at 10 min was 0.07 ± 0.01 nm/106 cells in 21% O2 and 0.33 ± 0.02 nm/106 cells in 95% O2 in presence of serum (Fig. 1). Accumulation of ATP in the extracellular medium was maximal at 30 min, being 20.03 ± 2.00 nm/106 cells in 95% O2 as compared with 0.08 ± 0.01 nm/106 cells in 21% O2. At 60 and 120 min, extracellular ATP had diminished and at 4 and 24 h, returned to control levels (Fig. 1). There was no significant change in total intracellular ATP levels during hyperoxic exposure at these times (inset, Fig. 1).Role of Extracellular ATP in HLMVEC Survival in Hyperoxia—Although extracellular ATP can stimulate proliferation in many cell types, including endothelial cells (10Gerasimovskaya E.V.

Heppel L.A. J. Cell Physiol. 1992; 153: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), little is known about its role in modulating survival of cells in hyperoxia. To determine this, cells were treated with ectonucleotidase (a mixture of apyrase grades VI and VII, Sigma) and adenosine deaminase (ADA). Actions of both enzymes can eliminate extracellular ATP and its degradation product adenosine (2Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Cells exposed to hyperoxia (4 days) in the presence of apyrase (2 units/ml) had a significant decrease in viability compared with untreated, hyperoxia-exposed cells (Fig. 2). A nonsignificant further decline in surviving cells was observed when ADA (2 units/ml) was included with apyrase (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Role of extracellular ATP in survival of HLMVEC in hyperoxia. To eliminate extracellular nucleotides, cells were treated with apyrase (2 units/ml), with or without ADA (2 units/ml), for 30 min before hyperoxic exposure, and enzymes were included throughout exposure. Cell viability was analyzed (72 h) using YOYO-1 dye. Results are mean ± S.E. (*, p < 0.05 compared with normoxic controls). Data represent one experiment (n = 3 per condition).

Results obtained in the same cells indicated enhanced preservation of intracellular ATP with frequent glucose supplementation in hyperoxia (18Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L159-164PubMed Google Scholar). We measured 2-deoxyglucose uptake as an indicator of glucose consumption in HLMVEC as a function of hyperoxia or increased ATP in the extracellular medium. In addition, using HLMVEC, we determined if hyperoxic exposure or addition of extracellular ATP increases the rate of glucose transport by measuring cytochalasin B-inhibitable 2-[3H] deoxyglucose uptake. Table I shows that glucose uptake was increased ∼1.6-fold by hyperoxia (95% O2 for 4 h) and ∼1.8-fold by 100 μm extracellular ATP (30 min). ATP-mediated uptake of glucose was inhibitable by two purinergic antagonists, suramin (a nonspecific P2 receptor inhibitor), or Cibacron blue (a specific P2Y receptor antagonist). These inhibitors of P2 receptor similarly affected hyperoxia-mediated glucose uptake. Including apyrase or a combination of apyrase and adenosine deaminase in medium during exposures also abolished the ATP-as well as hyperoxia-mediated increases in glucose uptake. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), was most effective in inhibiting the hyperoxia-mediated elevation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in HLMVEC.Table IEffect of various inhibitors on increased glucose uptake in HLMVEC due to ATP or hyperoxiaInhibitors2-[3H]DOG uptake ± S.

A substantial increase in lung RNA and protein occurs during adaptation to hyperoxia (18Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L159-164PubMed Google Scholar).

In the present study, the observation of inhibition of ATP-induced glucose uptake by rapamycin prompted us to determine the effect of ATP on p70 S6 kinase. A time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase was observed upon ATP treatment of HLMVEC (Fig. 3, panel A). ATP-induced phosphorylation was sensitive to rapamycin, as it was completely abolished by preincubating the cells for 30 min with rapamycin (100 nm) before ATP treatment (Fig. 3, panel B). These results confirm that extracellular ATP levels influence mTOR and its downstream target p70 S6 kinase.Fig. 3Effect of extracellular ATP on phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, a target of mTOR. Serum-starved HLMVECs were incubated with ATP (100 μm) for 0–15 min (panel A). Whole cell extracts were probed by Western blot using antibodies specific for phosphorylated p70 S6K. Cells also were preincubated with 100 nm rapamycin for 30 min before stimulation with ATP for 15 min (panel B).

To determine if extracellular ATP, via modulation of mTOR, affects survival of HLMVEC during hyperoxic exposure, cells were treated with rapamycin (50 and 100 nm) for 30 min and then exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2, 5% O2) at sea level pressure for 6 days. Appropriate controls having equal dilutions of dimethyl sulfoxide, solvent vehicle for rapamycin, also were included. Fresh media were supplied daily. After exposure, cell death was determined using YOYO-1 staining. Cell death was 24 ± 4% at 6 days of hyperoxic exposure in untreated HLMVEC (Fig. 4). Cell death was similar in cells treated with Me2SO prior to exposure. Treatment with rapamycin (50 nm) along with hyperoxia resulted in 31 ± 8% cell death. A further increase was observed when cells were treated with a higher concentration of rapamycin (40 ± 8% in hyperoxia versus 13 ± 4% in normoxia at 100 nm rapamycin). These data, reflecting the percentage of surviving cells among those which remained adherent after hyperoxic exposure, indicate that a rapamycin-sensitive signal is important in cell survival under these conditions.Fig. 4Effect of rapamycin on cell death of HLMVEC in hyperoxia. Rapamycin (50 and 100 nm) was added to medium, and cells were exposed to hyperoxia after 30 min. Medium were changed daily and fresh inhibitor was added. Results are mean ± S.E.

PI3K activity was increased by more than ∼2-fold after treatment with ATP for 5 min. Activity was maximal at 15 min, but additional incubation time did not further increase PI3K activity (Fig. 5, upper panel). Interestingly, various analogs of ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine also were effective in increasing PI3K activity (Fig. 5, lower panel). Adenosine, AMP, and UDP were most effective, causing ∼3–4-fold increases. ATP, ADP, and their stable analogs ATPγS and ADPβS increased PI3K activity ∼2-fold.

https://openalex.org/W2006464961,"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) plays an essential role in Ca2+ signaling during lymphocyte activation. Engagement of the T cell or B cell receptor by antigen initiates a signal transduction cascade that leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R by Src family nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, including Fyn. However, the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on the IP3R and subsequent Ca2+ release is poorly understood. We have identified tyrosine 353 (Tyr353) in the IP3-binding domain of type 1 IP3R (IP3R1) as a phosphorylation site for Fyn both in vitro and in vivo. We have developed a phosphoepitope-specific antibody and shown that IP3R1-Y353 becomes phosphorylated during T cell and B cell activation. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R1 increased IP3 binding at low IP3 concentrations (<10 nm). Using wild-type IP3R1 or an IP3R1-Y353F mutant that cannot be tyrosine phosphorylated at Tyr353 or expressed in IP3R-deficient DT40 B cells, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr353 permits prolonged intracellular Ca2+ release during B cell activation. Taken together, these data suggest that one function of tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R1-Y353 is to enhance Ca2+ signaling in lymphocytes by increasing the sensitivity of IP3R1 to activation by low levels of IP3.

We have identified tyrosine 353 (Tyr353) in the IP3-binding domain of type 1 IP3R (IP3R1) as a phosphorylation site for Fyn both in vitro and in vivo. We have developed a phosphoepitope-specific antibody and shown that IP3R1-Y353 becomes phosphorylated during T cell and B cell activation. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R1 increased IP3 binding at low IP3 concentrations (<10 nm). Using wild-type IP3R1 or an IP3R1-Y353F mutant that cannot be tyrosine phosphorylated at Tyr353 or expressed in IP3R-deficient DT40 B cells, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr353 permits prolonged intracellular Ca2+ release during B cell activation. Taken together, these data suggest that one function of tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R1-Y353 is to enhance Ca2+ signaling in lymphocytes by increasing the sensitivity of IP3R1 to activation by low levels of IP3. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; TCR, T cell receptor; BCR, B cell receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; TCR, T cell receptor; BCR, B cell receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. is an intracellular calcium (Ca2+) release channel located on the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells. IP3Rs belong to a family of intracellular Ca2+ release channels that include three major isoforms (IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3) as well as the three forms of the related ryanodine receptors (RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3). Hydrolysis of the minor membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C (PLC) results in the production of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). IP3 binds to the N-terminal portion of IP3Rs (2Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 328-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and causes Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum via a nonselective cation pore in the C-terminal portion of the channel (3Boehning D. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13509-13512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Earlier work from our laboratory has demonstrated that IP3R is required for mobilization of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores and Ca2+-dependent antigen-specific T cell proliferation via interleukin-2 production in the Jurkat T cell lymphoma line (4Jayaraman T. Ondriasova E. Ondrias K. Harnick D. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Following the engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) by antigen-presenting complexes, a cascade of tyrosine kinase activation is initiated. The kinases involved include the Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn, which phosphorylate the TCR (5Kennedy J.S. Raab M. Rudd C.E. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recruitment of other kinases and adaptor proteins by the phosphorylated TCR ζ-chain leads to the phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ1 to produce IP3 (6Koretzky G.A. Myung P.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). During T cell activation, Fyn regulates PLC-γ1 activity via these down-stream events and phosphorylates IP3R1 in T lymphocytes (7Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation increases IP3R1 open probability by reducing Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the channel (7Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, T cells from Fyn knockout mice show reduced Ca2+ release (8Appleby M.W. Gross J.A. Cooke M.P. Levin S.D. Qian X. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 751-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and reduced IP3R1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TCR ligation (7Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic effects of Fyn on the Ca2+ signaling cascade are complex, and the precise contribution of IP3R1 tyrosine phosphorylation to the Ca2+ signaling events that result in T cell activation and proliferation has not been defined.We have now identified a Fyn-phosphorylated tyrosine residue in IP3R1 (Tyr353) and shown that phosphorylation of Tyr353 increases the binding affinity of IP3 to the IP3R at low levels of IP3 (<10 nm), consistent with the previously reported increases in IP3-activated channel activity in response to Fyn phosphorylation (7Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). DT40 IP3R-deficient B cells stably expressing a Tyr353-nonphosphorylatable IP3R1 mutant (IP3R1-Y353F) demonstrated altered Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in response to B cell receptor activation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection—Chicken DT40 B cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. For transfection, 2 × 107 cells in logarithmic phase growth were mixed with 30 μg of linearized plasmid cDNA in 400 μl of cytomix medium (9Cui J. Bian J.S. Kagan A. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47175-47183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Electroporation was performed in a 4-mm cuvette using Gene Pulser II apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 350 V, 975 microfarads. For selection of stably transfected clones, 2 mg/ml G418 was added into the culture medium 48 h after transfection, and the cells were incubated for 10–14 days without disturbance. JE6.1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK293 cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with plasmid cDNA as described (10Cui J. Kagan A. Qin D. Mathew J. Melman Y.F.

Jayaraman T. Go L. Ma Y. Mulieri P. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2833-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(-) vector using XhoI/KpnI sites. All mutants were generated by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The human T cell Fyn was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total RNA from the Jurkat-TAG cell line and the following primers with EcoRI/BamHI sites: 5′-GGGGAATTCAGGCTGTGTGCAATGTAAGG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACAGGTTTTCACCAGGTTGG-3′. The cDNA was cloned into p3×FLAG-CMV-10 vector (Sigma) to provide an N-terminal FLAG epitope. Fusion of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) with the N terminus of IP3R1 was obtained by introducing the XhoI/SacII IP3R1 fragment from pcDNA3.1(-) into the pEGFPC3 vector. A series of GST fusion constructs that include different regions of IP3R1 was created by PCR and cloned in-frame into the pGEX-4T1 vector. Purification of the GST fusion proteins was conducted using methods recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). All constructs were verified by automated fluorescent DNA sequence analysis.Cell Stimulation, Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting— 2 × 108 Jurkat cells were stimulated with 3 μg/ml anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT-3) on ice for 10 min, followed by 15 μg/ml goat antimouse IgG for 3 min at 37 °C. DT40 cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml anti-chicken IgM monoclonal antibody (M-4) for 2 min at 37 °C. The cells used for immunoprecipitation were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer: 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% deoxycholic acid, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF. Lysates were incubated with antibodies for 2 h, and the immune complex was isolated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitated proteins were then eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies.[3H]IP3 Binding and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Binding studies were performed at 4 °C in a total volume of 100 μl. Immunoprecipitated IP3R1 bound to protein A-Sepharose beads was washed once with binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA and incubated with 9 nm [3H]IP3 and varying amounts of unlabeled IP3 for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by centrifugation, washed twice with binding buffer, and suspended in scintillation fluid for determination of bound [3H]IP3. The specific binding was defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding that was measured in the presence of 0.01 and 1 μm unlabeled IP3. Equilibrium competition binding curves were fitted assuming a single class of binding site using nonlinear curve fitting equations (Origin Software). For in vitro Fyn phosphorylation, GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose or immunoprecipitates bound to protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 20 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm MgATP) in the presence of 5 units of active Fyn (Upstate Biotechnology) with or without 10% [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction products were analyzed by autoradiography or immunoblotting using antibodies against phosphotyrosine.Cytosolic Ca2+Measurement—2 × 106 cells were loaded for 30 min at 37 °C with 2 μm Fura-2-acetylmethoxy ester and 0.05% Pluronic F-127 in 400 μl of growth medium. The cells were washed twice and resuspended in 2 ml of calcium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES, and 0.03% bovine serum albumin. Fluorescence of the stirred cell suspension was measured ratiometrically at 25 °C by emission at 510 nm and excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm using a fluorospectrophotometer (PTI). Data were fitted to pulse equations using Origin software, from which the first derivative was determined.Antibodies—The following peptides were used to generate specific antibodies against the C terminus of IP3R1 and phospho-Tyr353 IP3R1, respectively: (C)-RIGLLGHPPHMNVNPQQPA (12Wojcikiewicz R.J. Luo S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5670-5677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and (C)-QEKM-VpYSLVS. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were generated at Zymed Laboratories Inc. using the PolyQuik protocol followed by affinity chromatography against epitope peptides. The antibody against the C terminus of IP3R1 is specific for IP3R1; it does not react with either recombinant IP3R2 or recombinant IP3R3 (data not shown). The following commercial antibodies were also used for immunoblotting and stimulation purposes: mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-GFP (BD Biosciences), mouse anti-chicken IgM M-4 (Southern Biotech), anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), and monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody OKT-3 (Ortho Biotech).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFyn Phosphorylates IP3R1 at Tyr353 in Vitro—We have demonstrated previously that IP3R1 is phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase Fyn during T cell activation (7Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We initially studied two predicted phosphorylation sites for Src family tyrosine kinases, based on a consensus motif for these kinases, (R/K)X2,3(D/E)X2,3Y (13Songyang Z. Carraway K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). These sites were Tyr482 (in the IP3-binding domain) and Tyr2617 (in the C-terminal cytosolic domain) (11Harnick D.H. Jayaraman T. Go L. Ma Y. Mulieri P. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2833-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutation of either site or both sites to phenylalanine, however, had no significant effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern in response to Fyn of either full-length recombinant IP3R1 containing these mutations or of GST fusion protein fragments of IP3R1 encompassing these residues (data not shown). To find an authentic tyrosine phosphorylation site, fragments of IP3R1 (other than those encompassing transmembrane domain regions) were fused to GST, and the purified fusion proteins were used as substrates for in vitro Fyn phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Fragment 305–447 showed the strongest phosphorylation signal. According to the consensus sequence given above, this fragment contains a potential site for Src kinase family phosphorylation, Tyr353. Mutagenesis of tyrosine to phenylalanine showed that Tyr353 is the only site in this fragment phosphorylated by Fyn. The Y353F mutant eliminated the phosphorylation signal detected either by autoradiography using radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP or by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Fig. 1B). Tyr353 is located in the IP3-binding domain and is conserved throughout all three types of IP3R (data not shown). Based on the 2.2-Å crystal structure of the IP3-binding core of mouse IP3R1 (14Bosanac I. Alattia J.-R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), Tyr353 is located at the beginning of the β7 β-strand, immediately adjacent to the SI splice variant region (see Fig. 6). The structure indicates that Tyr353 is highly likely to be present on the exposed surface of the IP3-binding core, suggesting that Tyr353 is capable of being phosphorylated by cytosolic tyrosine kinases.Fig. 6Location of Tyr353 in the IP3-binding core region of IP3R1. The 2.2-Å crystal structure of the IP3-binding core of mouse IP3R1 in complex with IP3 is shown as published previously by Bosanac et al. (Fig. 2A of Ref. 14Bosanac I. Alattia J.-R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The IP3 molecule (shown in purple) is bound at the interface between the α-domain (green) and the β-domain (olive), and the locations of residue Tyr353, the SI splice region, the CaI-Ca2+-binding region, and IP3 are marked.

The Y353F mutant, however, was still tyrosine-phosphorylated by Fyn in vitro, although the signal was reduced (Fig. 1C). Thus, in full-length IP3R1, other tyrosine residues besides Tyr353 can also be phosphorylated by Fyn in vitro. However, Fyn phosphorylation of the GST fusion protein fragment of IP3R1 containing Tyr353 was much stronger than that of any other fragments, suggesting that Tyr353 may be preferentially Fyn phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 1A).Fyn Phosphorylates IP3R1 at Tyr353 in Vivo—To analyze tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R1 in vivo, we prepared mutants of T cell Fyn with defective kinase activity (K296M) or with constitutive kinase activity (Y528F) (15Fusaki N. Semba K. Katagiri T. Suzuki G. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and co-expressed these active Fyn (Fyn(+)) or inactive Fyn (Fyn(-)) constructs with IP3R1 in HEK293 cells. Fig. 2A shows that when coexpressed with Fyn(+), the N-terminal (1–611) portion of wild-type IP3R1 is tyrosine phosphorylated, but the phosphorylation of the Y353F N-terminal mutant is undetectable. Fig. 2B shows that both wild-type and Y353F full-length IP3R1 are phosphorylated by Fyn in vivo, consistent with our in vitro data in Fig. 1. To determine whether Tyr353 is phosphorylated in full-length IP3R1, we generated a phosphoepitope-specific antibody (anti-IP3R1-pY353). Anti-IP3R1-pY353 only recognized wild-type full-length IP3R1 when co-expressed with Fyn(+). IP3R1-Y353F co-expressed with Fyn(+), wild-type IP3R1, or IP3R1-Y353F co-expressed with Fyn(-) could not be detected by anti-IP3R1-pY353 antibody (Fig. 2C). These results confirmed that Tyr353 is an authentic site of phosphorylation by Fyn but not the only site in full-length IP3R1 phosphorylated by Fyn.Fig. 2In vivo phosphorylation of Tyr353 of IP3R1 by co-expression with constitutively active Fyn (Fyn(+)) or inactive Fyn (Fyn(-)) in HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitates (IP) were analyzed by immunoblotting with general anti-P-Tyr antibody 4G10 (A and B) or antibody specific for phosphorylated Tyr353 of IP3R1 (p-Y353) (C).

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The anti-IP3R1-pY353 antibody was next used to determine whether Tyr353 was phosphorylated in antigen-stimulated lymphocytes. The pY353 level in JE6.1 Jurkat T cells and DT40 B cells were detected by activating cells through ligation of the TCR or B cell receptor (BCR), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, Tyr353 of IP3R1 was phosphorylated in both activated T and B lymphocytes; in contrast, only very weak signals were detected in the nonstimulated control cells. We have observed that IP3R1 immunoprecipitated from activated and nonactivated lymphocytes and subsequently immunoblotted with general antiphosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) shows no significant increase in total phosphotyrosine content (data not shown). This suggests that other tyrosine residues on IP3R1 (Fig. 1A) are not specifically phosphorylated in response to antigen-induced lymphocyte activation. Although these studies do not exclude the possibility that other tyrosine residues on IP3R1 are regulated by signaling mechanisms, our experiments using anti-IP3R1-pY353 antibody show that Tyr353 is phosphorylated during activation via TCR or BCR ligation.Fig. 3Tyr353 is phosphorylated in response to TCR or BCR stimulation. JE6.1 cells or DT40 cells were stimulated by 3 μg/ml OKT-3 or 10 μg/ml M-4 for 2–3 min at 37 °C, respectively. IP3R1 was immunoprecipitated by antibody against the C terminus of IP3R1 and detected by specific antibody against phospho-Tyr353 of IP3R1 (upper panel). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-IP3R1 antibody (lower panel). The graph shows the relative phosphorylation level at Tyr353 in activated versus nonactivated lymphocytes, which was determined by densitometric quantitation of the anti-phospho-Tyr353 immunoblot signal normalized to the anti-IP3R1 signal. The IP3R1-Y353 phosphorylation level of activated JE6.1 cells was taken as 100%. In comparison, nonactivated JE6.1 cells had 31%, activated DT40 cells had 120%, and nonactivated DT40 cells had 14% phosphorylation of IP3R1-Y353.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphorylation of Tyr353 Modulates Affinity of IP3 Binding to the IP3R—Because Tyr353 is located in the IP3-binding domain of IP3R1, we investigated the effects of phosphorylation of Tyr353 on IP3 binding. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated proteins from transfected HEK293 cells (measured by immunoblotting) were used in an equilibrium [3H]IP3 competition binding assay (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B compares the [3H]IP3 specifically bound to phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated IP3R1 at an IP3 concentration of 9.1 nm. Phosphorylation of Tyr353 on IP3R1 (via co-transfection of constitutively active Fyn with IP3R1) significantly increased the affinity of IP3 binding. As shown in Fig. 4C, Fyn-phosphorylated IP3R1 exhibited increased [3H]IP3 binding at low unlabeled IP3 concentrations (less than 10 nm), whereas when the unlabeled IP3 concentration in the assay was above 100 nm, no significant differences were observed between phosphorylated wild-type IP3R1, the IP3R1-Y353F mutant, or nonphosphorylated wild-type IP3R1. In the case of phosphorylated wild-type IP3R1, for IP3 binding, the EC50 = 8.45 ± 1.36 nm (n = 7, p < 0.05 compared with nonphosphorylated wild-type IP3R1 or phosphorylated IP3R1-Y353F). The EC50 values of nonphosphorylated wild-type IP3R1 or phosphorylated IP3R1-Y353F were 19.34 ± 1.55 nm (n = 7) and 14.44 ± 1.22 nm (n = 5), respectively. These results are comparable with published Kd values for IP3 binding for native or recombinant IP3R1 (16Riley A.M. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Correa V. Potter B.V.L. Taylor C.W. J. Biol.

These data suggest that the channels are more sensitive to low levels of IP3 when Tyr353 is phosphorylated. According to the known structure of the IP3-binding domain, Tyr353 is located in one of the regions required to form the IP3-binding site, although it is not one of the residues that directly interacts with IP3 (2Yoshikawa F.

Phosphorylation at Tyr353 could influence the conformation of the IP3-binding region in an allosteric manner. Another possibility is that phosphorylation of Tyr353 may regulate channel activity by modification of the coupling between IP3 and Ca2+ binding to the channel, as Tyr353 is also situated in close proximity to two known sites of Ca2+ binding to the IP3R (14Bosanac I. Alattia J.-R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M.

We generated DT40 B cell lines that express only wild-type IP3R1 or IP3R1-Y353F using the triple IP3R-deficient DT40 cell line, which lacks all three types of IP3R (20Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant IP3R1 at levels comparable with that of IP3R1 in wild-type DT40 cells was shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). Fura-2-loaded cells were stimulated with anti-chicken IgM, M-4, and the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured using an extracellular solution of 1 mm EGTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution as a Ca2+-free buffer. As shown in Fig. 5B, the initial rising phase of the Ca2+ transient was similar between wild-type and IP3R1-Y353F cells. However, the decay of the Ca2+ transient in wild-type IP3R1 cells was significantly slower than that in IP3R1-Y353F cells. To compare the Ca2+ release of wild-type IP3R1 cells and IP3R1-Y353F cells, the fluorescent ratio data were fitted to a curve and normalized. The inset of Fig. 5B shows that the increased duration of the Ca2+ transient in wild-type IP3R1 cells is caused by a prolonged decay phase. The first derivative of the Ca2+ transient is shown in Fig. 5C. In external Ca2+ conditions that preclude store-operated Ca2+ entry, the first derivative reflects the kinetics of IP3R1 channel activity and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release. The maximum rate of release is determined primarily by the kinetics of channel activation, whereas the maximum rate of decay reflects the kinetics of channel inactivation. The first derivative reveals that the main difference between wild-type and IP3R1-Y353F mutant channels is enhanced inactivation of the channel in the tyrosine phosphorylation-deficient mutant (time constant = 0.135 ± 0.011 for wild-type IP3R1, 0.266 ± 0.020 for IP3R1-Y353F, p < 0.01, n = 4). This suggests that one role of tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R1 at Tyr353 is to decrease inactivation of the channel, particularly as IP3 levels are falling following the initial activation of the channel. This finding is consistent with our results showing that tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R1-Y353 enhances IP3 binding when [IP3] < 10 nm. Indeed, the inset of Fig. 5C shows that the maximum rate of decay of IP3R1-Y353F is significantly faster than that of wild-type IP3R1.Fig. 5Effects of the Y353F mutation of IP3R1 on intracellular Ca2+ release by BCR-induced B cell activation.A, expression level of IP3R1 in wild-type DT40 cells; triple IP3R-deficient DT40 cells and triple IP3R-deficient DT40 cells stably transfected with wild-type IP3R1 or IP3R1-Y353F.

https://openalex.org/W1970841754,"The c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb) regulates proliferation of hematopoietic cells by inducing the transcription of a group of target genes. Removal or mutations of the negative regulatory domain (NRD) in the C-terminal half of c-Myb leads to increased transactivating capacity and oncogenic activation. Here we report that TIF1β directly binds to the NRD and negatively regulates the c-Myb-dependent trans-activation. In addition, three corepressors (Ski, N-CoR, and mSin3A) bind to the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb together with TIF1β and recruit the histone deacetylase complex to c-Myb. Furthermore, the Drosophila TIF1β homolog, Bonus, negatively regulates Drosophila Myb activity. The Ski corepressor competes with the coactivator CBP for binding to c-Myb, indicating that the selection of coactivators and corepressors is a key event for c-Myb-dependent transcription. Mutations or deletion of the NRD of c-Myb and the mutations found in the DNA-binding domain of v-Myb decrease the interaction with these corepressors and weaken the corepressor-induced negative regulation of Myb activity. These observations have conceptual implications for understanding how the nuclear oncogene is activated.

The level of c-myb expression is high in immature hematopoietic cells, and its expression is turned off during terminal differentiation (3Gonda T.J. Metcalf D. Nature. 1984; 310: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). c-myb-deficient mice show a defect in definitive hematopoiesis in the fetal liver due to a severe reduction in the number of progenitor cells, indicating that c-myb is essential for the proliferation of immature hematopoietic cells (4Mucenski M.L.

Analysis of homozygous null c-myb/Rag1 chimeric mice indicates that c-myb is also essential for early T-cell development (5Allen III, R.D. Bender T.P. Siu G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The myb gene is well conserved not only in vertebrates but also in other species. Drosophila melanogaster has one myb gene (dmyb), which is required in diverse cellular lineages throughout the course of development (6Katzen A.L. Jackson J. Harmon B.P. Fung S.M. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The c-myb gene product (c-Myb) is a transcriptional activator that recognizes the specific DNA sequence 5′-AACNG-3′ (7Biedenkapp H. Borgmeyer U. Sippel A.E. Klempnauer K.-H. Nature. 1988; 335: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 8Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Some of the c-Myb target genes, including c-myc, are required for the G1/S transition in the cell cycle (11Nakagoshi H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sawazaki T. Mizuguchi G. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1233-1240PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schmidt M. Nazarov V. Stevens L. Watson R. Wolff L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1970-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, dmyb is required for the G2/M transition (6Katzen A.L. Jackson J. Harmon B.P. Fung S.M. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and cyclin B expression is directly regulated by dMyb (13Okada M. Akimaru H. Hou D.-X. Takahashi T. Ishii S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Several other target genes, including mim-1, GBX2, and bcl-2, are involved in lineage commitment in differentiation and blockage of apoptosis (10Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 14Kowenz-Leutz E. Herr P. Niss K. Leutz A.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2732-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). c-Myb has three functional domains that are responsible for DNA binding, transcriptional activation, and negative regulation (8Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain (DBD) in the N-terminal region of c-Myb consists of three imperfect tandem repeats of 51-52 amino acids, each containing a helix-turn-helix variation motif. Repeats 2 and 3 (R2 and R3) are sufficient for binding to the target DNA sequence (17Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation domain is adjacent to the DBD, to which the transcriptional coactivator CBP binds (18Dai P. Shinagawa T. Nomura T. Harada J. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Khan M.M. Akimaru H. Sasaki H. Colmenares C. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2843-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Analysis of various oncogenically activated myb genes suggests that truncation of either the N or C terminus of c-Myb can cause oncogenic activation. For example, the v-Myb protein encoded by AMV is N- and C-terminally truncated versions of c-Myb (1Klempnauer K.-H. Gonda T.J. Bishop J.M. Cell. 1982; 31: 453-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Deletion of the negative regulatory domain (NRD) located in the C-terminal portion of the molecule increases both the trans-activation and transformation capacity of c-Myb, implying that the NRD normally represses c-Myb activity (8Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 19Gonda T.J. Buckmaster C. Ramsay R.G.

Whittaker L.J. Eltman J.T. Lipsick J.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2524-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The v-Myb encoded by AMV lacks the C-proximal region of the NRD. In addition, the mutations of only the leucine-rich region in the NRD result in oncogenic activation of c-myb (22Kanei-Ishii C. MacMillan E.M. Nomura T. Sarai A. Ramsay R.G. Aimoto S. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3088-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, the NRD appears to contain multiple subdomains, and the deletion of any of these may result in the oncogenic activation of c-myb. However, the mechanism by which c-Myb is regulated by NRD still unclear. The ski gene is also a nuclear oncogene. The products of the c-ski proto-oncogene and its related gene sno (ski-related novel) (c-Ski and Sno) directly bind to two other corepressors, N-CoR/SMRT and mSin3A, and act as transcriptional corepressors (23Nomura T.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). mSin3A and N-CoR/SMRT also interact with each other (24Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.-M. Söderström M. Laherty C.D.

All three corepressors (Ski/Sno, mSin3A, and N-CoR/SMRT) are required for transcriptional repression by Mad and non-liganded thyroid hormone receptor β (30Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T.

Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), suggesting that different corepressor-HDAC complexes interact with each other and mediate transcriptional repression together. c-Ski also directly binds to other multiple transcription factors, including Smads and Gli3, and mediates transcriptional repression or inhibits transcriptional activation (31Sun Y Liu X.

Here, we demonstrate that four corepressors, including c-Ski, directly bind to c-Myb via multiple domains in the c-Myb molecule to negatively regulate c-Myb activity. Deletions or mutations of the NRD or the point mutations found in v-Myb reduces the affinity with these corepressors, leading to increased c-Myb activity. Thus, our results suggest that selection of coactivators or corepressors is a key event for oncogenic activation of c-Myb. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and in Vitro Binding Assays—The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the mouse embryonic cDNA library as described previously (23Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmanares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The protein containing the C-terminal 312 amino acids of mouse c-Myb was used as bait. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (23Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmanares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To increase the solubility of GST fusion proteins expressed in bacteria, the thioredoxin coexpression system (34Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25328-25331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) was used. The binding buffer used for most of the experiments consists of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 mm KCl (for interactions between Myb and mSin3A or N-CoR) or 150 mm KCl (for interactions between Myb and c-Ski). The binding buffer used for the experiments with the R23 fragment consists of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm KCl. Coimmunoprecipitation and HDAC Assay—For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, lysates were prepared from Molt-4 cells by mild sonication in NET buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture) containing 150 mm NaCl. Anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibody 1-1, the rabbit anti-N-CoR antibody (23Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmanares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), the anti-mSin3A antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, AK-11), or normal rabbit IgG were used for immunoprecipitation. The immunocomplexes were used in Western blotting with rabbit anti-TIF1β polyclonal antibodies raised against GST-TIF1βC, anti-c-Ski monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-mSin3A antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, AK-11), or anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibody 1-1. To study the interaction between c-Ski and various forms of c-Myb, 293 cells were cotransfected via the CaPO4 method with the c-Ski expression plasmid pact-Ski (10 μg) and the c-Myb expression plasmid pact-FLAG-c-Myb (10 μg). Forty hours after transfection, cells were lysed as described (23Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmanares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, Sigma). Western blotting was performed using the anti-c-Ski monoclonal antibody. Assays for HDAC activity were performed essentially as described (23Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmanares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) using lysates prepared from 293 cells that were transfected with 10 μg of the c-Myb expression plasmid. Analysis of Repressor Domains in c-Myb—The cytomegalovirus promoter was used to express the Gal4-c-Myb fusion proteins consisting of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to various portions of c-Myb. CV-1 cells were transfected with a mixture of 3 μg of the luciferase reporter containing the TK promoter and six Gal4-binding sites, 0.33 μg of the Gal4-c-Myb or Gal4 expression plasmids, and 1 μg of the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (Promega). The luciferase assays were performed using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega). Subcellular Localization of c-Myb and Corepressors—CV-1 cells were transfected with a mixture of 1.5 μg of the FLAG-c-Myb expression plasmid and 1.5 μg of the plasmids that express c-Ski, mSin3A, or N-CoR. Forty hours after transfection, cells were fixed and stained as described (23Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmanares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) with anti-c-Myb, anti-c-Ski, and anti-FLAG antibodies. The signals for the different proteins were visualized by rhodamineand fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—The retroviral expression plasmids for wild-type c-Myb or CT3 were constructed using the MSCV (murine stem cell virus)-based retroviral vector, and viruses were prepared as described (35Shinagawa T. Nomura T. Colmenares C. Ohira M. Nakagawara A. Ishii S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8100-8108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To generate M1 cell clones that express c-Myb together with the neomycin resistance gene, M1 cells were infected with viruses and then grown in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml). ChIP assay was carried out essentially by using the method of Weinmann and Farnham (36Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In brief, 1.5 × 107 M1 cells were fixed with 1% formal-dehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Nuclei were isolated and suspended in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitors) and sonicated. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted with IP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) and treated with antibody against each corepressor. The immunocomplex was collected and was incubated at 65 °C with IP elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS) to release the proteins and DNA complex. DNA was extracted and used for PCR. PCR reaction (94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min) was carried out with [32P]dCTP for 30 cycles. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. The primers used for the amplification of myc promoter were as follows: 782GTGCCCAGTCAACATAACTGTACG805 and 1101GGCGTATTGTGTGGAGCGAGGCAG1124. Luciferase Reporter Assays—In the experiments using the reporter containing multiple Myb-binding sites, CV-1 cells (2 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish) were cotransfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) with the 6MBS-I-SV40-luc reporter (0.2 μg), the c-Myb expression plasmid (0.03 μg), the corepressor expression plasmid (0.5 or 1 μg), and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (0.05 μg), followed by luciferase assays. The chicken β-actin promoter was used to express c-Myb and various corepressors. In the case of assays using the 6MBS-I-TK-luc reporter (1 μg), the plasmid to express c-Myb (0.1 μg), or the v-Myb (0.03 μg) was used together with the same amounts of other plasmids as described above. The dominant negative form of the TIF1β expression plasmid was constructed by inserting the DNA fragment encoding the RBCC motifs and the artificial nuclear localization signal into the β-actin promoter-based vector. In the experiments using the reporter containing the c-myc promoter, CV-1 cells (4 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish) were cotransfected by the CaPO4 method with the myc-CAT reporter (4 μg) (11Nakagoshi H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sawazaki T. Mizuguchi G. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1233-1240PubMed Google Scholar), the c-Myb expression plasmid (4 μg), the corepressor expression plasmid (0.5 or 2.5 μg), and the internal control plasmid pact-β-gal (0.3 μg), followed by luciferase assays. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 12 μg by adding the control plasmid DNA lacking the cDNA. Genetic Interaction between Bon and dMyb—Two alleles of dmyb mutants were described previously (13Okada M. Akimaru H. Hou D.-X. Takahashi T. Ishii S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The bon241 and bon487 mutants (37Beckstead R. Ortiz J.A. Sanchez C. Prokopenko S.N. Chambon P. Losson R. Bellen H.J. Mol.

The offspring were grown at 25 °C, and the males of third instar larvae hemizygous for dmyb and the FM7c balancer were selected by the size of the gonads embedded in the opaque fat body. Furthermore, the male larvae were separated by the presence or the absence of the y+ cuticular phenotypes. The bon21B chromosome was isolated by the absence of the Tb phenotype. The viability was calculated as a standard value from the number of male larvae hemizygous for FM7c/Y or FM7c/Y; bon21B/+. TIF1β Binds to the NRD of c-Myb—To identify putative inhibitors that bind to the NRD of c-Myb, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using the NRD of mouse c-Myb as bait. This resulted in the identification of clones encoding TIF1β (also called as KAP-1). TIF1β, which contains a RING finger, B boxes, a coiled-coil region, and a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, was originally identified by two groups as a protein that binds to the heterochromatin protein-1 (HP-1) (38Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) or to the KRAB repression domain (39Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). TIF1β was subsequently found to act as a corepressor that associates with the HDAC complex and HP-1 (40Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A. You J. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Khechumian R. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6385-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 41Ryan R.F. Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Singh P.B. Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4366-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The TIF1β clones isolated in our screening encoded the 92-amino acid region that includes the B1 box (Fig. 1A). In vitro translated c-Myb efficiently bound to the GSTTIF1βN protein containing the N-terminal half of TIF1β, but not to the GST-TIF1βC protein that contains the C-terminal half of TIF1β (Fig. 1A, lower middle panel). The bacterially expressed recombinant NRD also bound to the GST-TIF1βN protein (Fig. 1A, lower right panel). We then performed GST pull-down assays using in vitro translated TIF1β and GST-NRD fusion proteins that contain the NRD of c-Myb. TIF1β efficiently bound to the GST-NRD, but mutation of the leucine-rich region (L34P) dramatically decreased but did not completely abrogate the affinity with TIF1β (Fig. 1B, lower left panel, see also Supplementary Fig. 1B for GST-NRD proteins). We also performed GST pull-down assays using GST-TIF1βN and a series of in vitro translated C-terminally truncated forms of c-Myb bearing the mutation L34P in the leucine-rich region. The c-Myb protein truncated up to amino acid 500 still retained the capacity to interact with TIF1β, but truncation up to amino acid 444 completely abrogated binding, indicating that TIF1β binds to the region between amino acids 444 and 500 (Fig. 1B, lower right panel). Thus, TIF1β interacts with c-Myb at both the leucine-rich region and a C-terminal region in the NRD. Supporting this is that TIF1β binds to AMV-v-Myb, which lacks the C-terminal region of the NRD, with lower affinity than to c-Myb (Fig. 1B). Binding of c-Myb with Multiple Corepressors—A recent study on corepressors demonstrates that multiple corepressors bind to the same transcriptional factor. This raises the possibility that several other corepressors may bind to c-Myb together with TIF1β. To investigate this, we analyzed the interaction between c-Myb and three other known corepressors, c-Ski, N-CoR, and mSin3A. All three in vitro translated proteins bound to GST-c-Myb (Fig. 2A). In vitro translated mSin3A and c-Ski also bound to GST-TIF1βN (Fig. 2A). We previously demonstrated that c-Ski binds to both N-CoR and mSin3A (23Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmanares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, N-CoR, mSin3A, and TIF1β can all bind to c-Ski. Given that the four corepressors can interact with each other, these results suggest that these corepressors bind to c-Myb simultaneously or sequentially (see “Discussion”). To investigate the in vivo interaction between c-Myb and the corepressors, we performed the coimmunoprecipitation experiments using Molt-4 cell lysates (Fig. 2B). The anti-Myb antibody precipitated TIF1β, c-Ski, and mSin3A. Furthermore, c-Myb and TIF1β were coprecipitated using the anti-N-CoR antibodies. The control IgG precipitated none of the corepressors or c-Myb. We then asked whether the c-Myb complex contains HDAC activity. We used anti-Myb to generate the immunocomplexes from 293 cells that had been transfected with the c-Myb expression plasmid and assessed their HDAC activity. A significant level of HDAC activity was observed compared with the immunocomplexes prepared with control IgG (Fig. 2C). The immunocomplexes of the c-Myb mutant containing the mutated leucine-rich region in the NRD (L34P) had slightly lower HDAC activity than those containing wild-type c-Myb (Fig. 2C). These observations are consistent with the fact that TIF1β only partly interacts with c-Myb through the leucine-rich region. Using various forms of in vitro translated c-Myb, we determined which of the one or more regions of c-Myb is bound by c-Ski (Fig. 3A). The results obtained using GST-Ski fusion proteins indicate that c-Ski binds to the DBD of c-Myb (CT5), but not to the mutant lacking the DBD (ΔDB) (Supplementary Fig. 1, data are summarized in Fig. 3A). The region containing only R2 and R3 (R23) was sufficient for c-Ski interaction. Interestingly, removal of the NRD (CT3) or mutations in the leucine-rich region (L34A and L34P) almost completely abrogated the interaction with c-Ski, although c-Ski does not bind to NRD. It may be that the mutations or removal of NRD alters the conformation of some of the regions such as the transactivating domain, which then blocks access to c-Ski. We then performed GST pull-down assays using various forms of in vitro translated c-Myb and GST-mSin3A-NCT. The latter protein contains the central region of mSin3A bearing the second and third putative paired amphipathic helical domains (PAH2 and PAH3). This is the region responsible for binding to c-Myb (Supplementary Fig. 2A). As with c-Ski, mSin3A binds to R2 and R3 of c-Myb (Supplementary Fig. 2B, and data are summarized in Fig. 3A). The mutations of leucine-rich region of the NRD (L34A and L34P) also partly decrease the affinity with mSin3A, but removal of the NRD (CT3) does not affect the affinity with mSin3A. To determine which region of c-Myb interacts with N-CoR, similar assays were performed. c-Myb binds to the N-terminal 427-amino acid region of N-CoR (Supplementary Fig. 3A), and when GST-N-CoR, which contains this region, was used in GST pull-down assays, N-CoR was found to interact with R2 and R3 of c-Myb (Supplementary Fig. 3B, and data are summarized in Fig. 3A). However, the loss of NRD (CT3) or mutations o"

At pH 8.8, where the redox potential of the iron-sulfur protein is ∼200 mV and in a bc1 complex with a mutated iron-sulfur protein of equally low redox potential, the amount of cytochrome c1 reduced by several equivalents of decyl-ubiquinol in the presence of antimycin corresponded to only half of that present in the bc1 complex. Similar experiments in the presence of several equivalents of cytochrome c also showed only half of the bc1 complex participating in quinol oxidation. The extent of cytochrome b reduced corresponded to two bH hemes undergoing reduction through one center P per dimer, indicating electron transfer between the two cytochrome b subunits. Antimycin stimulated the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity of the bc1 complex at low inhibitor/enzyme ratios. This stimulation could only be fitted to a model in which half of the bc1 dimer is inactive when both center N sites are free, becoming active upon binding of one center N inhibitor molecule per dimer, and there is electron transfer between the cytochrome b subunits of the dimer. These results are consistent with an alternating half-of-the-sites mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation in the bc1 complex dimer.

These results are consistent with an alternating half-of-the-sites mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation in the bc1 complex dimer. The cytochrome bc1 complex transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c by the protonmotive Q cycle mechanism (1Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) in which there are two substrate-binding sites where ubiquinol is oxidized (center P) and ubiquinone is re-reduced (center N). Crystal structures of the bc1 complexes obtained from various sources (2Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xian J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J.

Crystal structures from the yeast bc1 complex show ubiquinone at center N of only one monomer and cytochrome c also in only one monomer, suggesting a functional asymmetry in the dimer (5Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).Some center P inhibitors have been shown to completely block bc1 complex activity upon binding to only half of the dimeric complex (6Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting anti-cooperative interaction between the ubiquinol oxidation sites in the dimer. Antimycin, a center N inhibitor, binds to only one center N of the dimeric enzyme in a mutant where the iron-sulfur cluster cannot be inserted into the Rieske protein, suggesting conformational interaction between centers P and N of different monomers (7Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50703-50709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, it has long been observed that titration of the cytochrome c reductase activity of the enzyme with antimycin yields non-linear curves (8Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 301: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), which is unexpected for a tightly bound inhibitor. This anomalous behavior has been attributed to rapid mobility of the inhibitor between the two center N sites in the dimer (10Bechmann G. Weiss H. Rich P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), although an alternate explanation could be equilibration of electrons between the cytochrome b subunits (6Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).In this work, we have analyzed the pre-steady and steady state kinetics of the isolated yeast bc1 complex in the presence of antimycin under conditions where the simultaneous detection of both electrons coming from the first ubiquinol oxidation at center P is possible. The results show that the number of center N sites blocked in the dimer determines whether ubiquinol oxidation can occur in one or both of the monomers, and that electron communication exists between cytochrome b subunits of the two monomers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Yeast nitrogen base (YNB) 1The abbreviations used are: YNB, yeast nitrogen base; DBH2, decyl-ubiquinol. without amino acids and with ammonium sulfate was obtained from U.S. Biological.

Antimycin and decyl-ubiquinol were quantified by UV-spectroscopy (6Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using extinction coefficients of 4.8 mm-1 cm-1 at 320 nm (12Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and 4.14 mm-1 cm-1 at 289 nm (13Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), respectively.Purification of Cytochrome bc1 Complexes—Wild-type bc1 complex was isolated from Red Star cake yeast as described previously (14Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The bc1 complex with a Y185F mutation in the iron-sulfur protein was isolated from the iron-sulfur protein deletion strain JPJ1 (16Beckmann J.D. Ljungdahl P.O. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3713-3722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) complemented with the single-copy plasmid pEDRIP1-Y185F encoding iron-sulfur protein with the Y185F mutation (17Denke E.

This strain was grown on synthetic dropout medium containing 0.7% YNB, 0.14% amino acid mix lacking tryptophan, and 2% dextrose as previously described (18Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Zwicker K. Nett J.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13637-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The bc1 complex was purified by the same procedure as used with the wild-type enzyme (14Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Quantification of the bc1 complexes was performed as described previously (6Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), using extinction coefficients of 17.5 mm-1 cm-1 at 553–539 for cytochrome c (19Yu C.A. Yu L. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1012-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 25.6 mm-1 cm-1 at 563–578 for cytochrome b heme (8Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Pre-steady State Reduction of bc1 Complexes—Pre-steady state reduction of the cytochrome bc1 complexes was followed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS Rapid Scanning Monochromator as described before (15Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When using the wild-type bc1 complex, reactions were started by rapid mixing of 3 μm enzyme in assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20 against an equal volume of the same buffer containing different concentrations of decyl-ubiquinol. For measurements using the bc1 complex with the Y185F mutation in the iron-sulfur protein, Tris was replaced by 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, in the assay medium.For each experiment, 6–8 data sets were averaged, and the oxidized spectrum was subtracted. The time course of absorbance change at 539, 554, 563, and 578 nm was extracted using software from OLIS and exported to the Origin 5.0 program (OriginLab Corp.). By comparing the dithionite and ascorbate-reduced spectra of the yeast bc1 complex, it was determined that cytochrome b reduction results in a 30% increase in the absorbance change at 554–539 nm used for monitoring cytochrome c1 reduction, as shown in Fig. 1. A similar value was obtained by deconvoluting the dithionite-reduced spectra into two components by fitting to a double Lorentzian function (not shown). Considering that the final concentration of cytochrome c1 in the pre-steady state experiments was 1.5 μm and that the path length of the mixing chamber is 2 cm, complete reduction of cytochrome b would induce an extra 0.016 absorbance change at 554–539. Therefore, since the absorbance at 563 nm of fully reduced cytochrome b would be 0.154, a correction factor of (ΔA 563–578 nm/0.154) × 0.016 was subtracted from ΔA 554–539 nm at each time point to obtain the absorbance change attributable to cytochrome c1. The contribution of cytochrome c1 at the wavelengths used for cytochrome b calculation (563–579 nm) was considered to be negligible from a comparison of the dithionite-reduced and the dithionite minus ascorbate-reduced spectra (Fig. 1). The absorbance changes of cytochrome c1 and b were fitted to either a monophasic or a biphasic exponential function in the Origin program.Pre-steady State Reduction of Exogenous Cytochrome c—The same procedure was followed as described above for the isolated bc1 complex except that 18 μm horse heart cytochrome c and 1 mm KCN were added to the assay buffer containing the bc1 complex before rapid mixing. The time course of absorbance change at 550–539 nm was not corrected for cytochrome b reduction as judged by the negligible contribution of the b hemes at this wavelength pair (see Fig. 1). The absorbances for cytochrome c and b were fitted in the Origin program to a monophasic or biphasic exponential function. Cytochrome c reduction was quantified using an extinction coefficient of 21.5 mm-1 cm-1 at 550–539 nm (20Margoliash E. Walasek O.F. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 339-348Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar).Ubiquinol-Cytochrome c Reductase Activity Assays—Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity was measured by stopped flow spectroscopy using the OLIS Rapid Scanning Monochromator as described elsewhere (6Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Antimycin was added incrementally to a 1 mm bc1 complex solution in assay buffer containing 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20 at 4°. After 4 min, the antimycin-bc1 complex mixture was diluted to a concentration of 100 nm of enzyme in assay buffer at room temperature with 1 mm potassium cyanide and 40 μm decyl-ubiquinol. After two more minutes, the reaction was started by mixing against an equal volume of 60 μm cytochrome c in assay buffer. The non-enzymatic rate of reduction of cytochrome c by decyl-ubiquinol was obtained by mixing equal volumes of 60 μm cytochrome c in assay buffer against 40 μm decyl-ubiquinol in assay buffer, and was found to be negligible. The reaction was followed for 2 s. For each inhibitor concentration, six data sets were obtained, and the time course of cytochrome c reduction was extracted using the OLIS software. The rate of cytochrome c reduction was calculated from the absorbance increase at 550–539 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 21.5 mm-1 cm-1 (20Margoliash E. Walasek O.F. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 339-348Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar).Kinetic Modeling—For simulations of pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome c1, cytochrome b, and exogenous cytochrome c, the Dynafit program (Biokin Ltd.) was used (21Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Dynafit allows simulation and fitting of either the initial velocities or the time course of enzyme reactions to different molecular mechanisms represented symbolically by a set of chemical equations. Rate constants and concentrations of enzyme and ligands can be allowed to vary during iterative fitting in order to obtain adjusted values. The scripts used for simulations are provided as Supplemental Data.Forward and reverse rate constants were assigned to each equation representing a reversible partial reaction. The slowest rate constant was assigned to the ubiquinol oxidation reaction at center P, while all other constants were assumed to be several orders of magnitude faster (17Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This rate constant was determined by iterative fitting allowing only this parameter along with the off rate constants for decyl-ubiquinol binding to vary. Although the precise values of the individual non-rate-limiting constants are irrelevant to the result of the simulation or fitting, the ratio of the reverse/forward rates was chosen to correspond to the equilibrium constants calculated to exist under the experimental conditions used.For experiments with wild-type bc1 complex at pH 8.8 in the presence of excess antimycin, the redox potential (Em) of decyl-ubiquinol was calculated to be -16 mV assuming a ΔEm of 59 mV/pH unit with respect to an Em7 of 90 mV. The iron-sulfur protein Em was calculated to be 200 mV using the known ΔEm of the Rieske cluster as a function of pH (22Link T.A. Hagen W.R. Pierik A.J. Assmann C. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), taking as a reference an Em7 of 285 mV (23Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Assuming a pH-independent Em of 65 mV for bH (23Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), an average Em value of 132.5 mV is obtained for the electron acceptors in a concerted ubiquinol oxidation reaction (the electron transfer between bL and bH was obviated to simplify the mechanism). With a ΔEm of 148.5 mV between decyl-ubiquinol and the redox acceptors, an equilibrium constant of 18 was calculated for the first turnover at center P according to the Nernst equation. Using a Em of -20 mV for heme bL (23Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), Keq for the second turnover at center P is 8 in the presence of antimycin and assuming no electron equilibration between monomers. For simulations with the bc1 complex with a Y185F mutation in the iron-sulfur protein, Em7 values of 215 mV for iron-sulfur protein (17Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and of 90 mV for decyl-ubiquinol were used, yielding Keq values of 2.2 and 1 for the first and second turnovers at center P without electron crossover between cytochrome b subunits. For electron transfer between iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1 (Em = 270 mV, Ref. 23Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a Keq of 4 was used. Electron transfer between cytochrome c1 and horse heart cytochrome c was assumed to occur with Keq = 1.For decyl-ubiquinol and decyl-ubiquinone binding, the on rate constants were fixed arbitrarily to the same value. Iterative fitting allowing the off rate constants to vary while all other parameters were fixed resulted in 2-fold higher values for decyl-ubiquinol than for decyl-ubiquinone. For simulations in the presence of exogenous cytochrome c, extra steps were included in the mechanism to account for a slow antimycin insensitive rate of cytochrome c reduction. The reactions included assume the formation of semiquinone upon reduction of iron-sulfur protein, dissociation of the semiquinone and dismutation to decyl-ubiquinone. The rate of dismutation was arbitrarily fixed to a very high rate, and the reverse reaction of semiquinone formation at center P was also set to yield a Keq of 0.001.The rate constant for semiquinone dissociation from center P was then determined by iterative fitting. The values obtained were ∼4 times lower than the off-rate constant for decyl-ubiquinone. However, the fitted dissociation rate constant for semiquinone became larger if Keq for semiquinone formation was set to an even lower value, or if the dismutation rate was increased. Therefore, the actual affinity for semiquinone at center P cannot be determined independently of the two other parameters that influence the stability of semiquinone. Nevertheless, the chosen parameters resulted in good fitting of the antimycin-insensitive rate of cytochrome c reduction. For cytochrome c binding, a Kd of 30 μm was chosen, and the individual on and off rate constants were arbitrarily set.Simulation of the relative concentrations of free enzyme and enzyme-inhibitor complexes as a function of antimycin/bc1 complex ratios was performed in Dynafit assuming no cooperativity in the binding of the inhibitor to the second monomer in the dimer. The Kd for antimycin was arbitrarily set to 0.2 nm, based on apparently stoichiometric binding of the inhibitor to the yeast bc1 complex in assays with the enzyme concentration at 2 nm (6Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B.

The initial rates of cytochrome c reduction as a function of antimycin concentration were also fitted to different models using Dynafit scripts included as Supplemental Data.RESULTSPre-steady State Reduction of Cytochrome c1 by Decyl-ubiquinol in the Presence of Antimycin—At pH 7 the Em of the iron-sulfur protein in the bc1 complex from wild-type yeast is ∼15 mV higher than that of cytochrome c1. Consequently, oxidation of ubiquinol at center P does not result in more that 40% cytochrome c1 reduction during the first turnover of the enzyme, since the electron that is transferred from the quinol to the high potential acceptors, iron-sulfur protein, and cytochrome c1, equilibrates primarily to the former. However, at pH 8.8, the Em of the iron-sulfur protein is about 70 mV lower than that of cytochrome c1. Therefore, at pH 8.8 a first turnover of ubiquinol oxidation at center P should result in the reduction of ∼80% of the total content of cytochrome c1. However, in the presence of antimycin, as shown in Fig. 2, no more than 50% of the total cytochrome c1 underwent reduction even in the presence of 4 equivalents of decyl-ubiquinol. When one equivalent of substrate was available, only ∼40% of cytochrome c1 was reduced in a single phase, while kinetic simulations (dashed lines in Fig. 2) show that a 65% reduction level is expected. With 2 and 4 equivalents of decyl-ubiquinol, after the reduction of 40%, an additional 10% of c1 was reduced with a slower rate. In contrast, kinetic modeling showed that over 90% of c1 should be reduced, assuming that all of the bc1 complex present is active. Interestingly, the reduction levels of c1 could be accurately simulated assuming that only half of the bc1 complex is participating in decyl-ubiquinol oxidation (solid lines in Fig. 2).Fig. 2Pre-steady state reduction kinetics of cytochrome c1 by decyl-ubiquinol in cytochrome bc1 complex from wild-type yeast in the presence and absence of antimycin at pH 8.8. The bc1 complex was suspended at 1.5 μm and reduced with 0.75 μm (A), 1.5 μm (B), 3 μm (C), and 6 μm (D) decyl-ubiquinol. Antimycin (anti) was present at a concentration of 3 μm where indicated. Traces show cytochrome c1 absorbance at 554–539 nm after correction for cytochrome b spectral overlap. Rates and reduction extent (%) are indicated for each trace. Absorbance changes corresponding to 50 and 100% reduction and calculated for a path length of 2 cm are shown as horizontal bars. Simulated cytochrome c1 reduction kinetics assuming a concentration of active enzyme of 0.75 μm (solid curves) or 1.5 μm (dashed curves) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the absence of antimycin, up to 80% reduction of c1 is observed with 2 equivalents of decyl-ubiquinol (Fig. 2C), indicating that the proportion of permanently inactive bc1 complex due to denaturation is not more than 20%. The fact that complete reduction of c1 was not observed at any decyl-ubiquinol concentration is probably due to decyl-ubiquinol binding to center N, thereby reducing heme bH or blocking its reoxidation. This was confirmed by monitoring the reduction level of cytochrome b in the absence of antimycin, which showed a complete inhibition of the reoxidation phase at concentrations above 2 equivalents of decyl-ubiquinol (data not shown).Even in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of decyl-ubiquinol, only 55% of cytochrome c1 was reduced after several minutes in the presence of antimycin (Fig. 3B), in contrast with the more than 90% reduction level reached in the absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 3A). The kinetics of c1 reduction without antimycin showed that most of this cytochrome c1 was reduced in the second slow phase (data not shown), indicating that inhibition of cytochrome b reoxidation at center N by decyl-ubiquinol becomes considerable at this high substrate concentration.Fig. 3Spectra of cytochrome bc1 complex reduced by decyl-ubiquinol in the absence or presence of antimycin. Cytochrome bc1 complex from wild-type yeast was suspended at 1.5 μm in assay buffer at pH 8.8 and reduced with 15 μm decyl-ubiquinol in the stopped flow mixing chamber in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 3 μm antimycin, and spectra were recorded after 2 min. A spectrum of the same amount of oxidized bc1 complex mixed with buffer lacking decyl-ubiquinol was subtracted. The absorbance in the reduced-oxidized spectra (solid lines) was normalized to zero at the reference wavelengths of 539 nm and 579 nm before deconvolution to obtain cytochrome c1 (dashed curve) and cytochrome b (dotted curve) spectral contributions using a Lorentzian function with two components.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar results were obtained using the bc1 complex with a Y185F mutation in the iron-sulfur protein (Fig. 4). The iron-sulfur protein Em in this bc1 complex has a value of 215 mV at pH 7 (17Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), almost the same as that of the iron-sulfur protein in the wild-type enzyme at pH 8.8. Consequently, 80% of cytochrome c1 is expected to be reduced, assuming every center P is able to turn over once. This should occur with 2 or more equivalents of decyl-ubiquinol, according to kinetic modeling (Fig. 4, dashed lines). However, not even a 4-fold excess of substrate resulted in the reduction of more than ∼40% of the c1, in agreement with simulations that assume that only half of the bc1 complex is active in the presence of antimycin (solid lines). As in the case of the bc1 complex from wild-type yeast, over 80% of the enzyme with the Y185F mutation in the iron-sulfur protein was active in the absence of inhibitor, according to the level of c1 reduction with 1 and 2 equivalents of decyl-ubiquinol (Fig. 4, B and C). Since at pH 7 the Em of decyl-ubiquinol is over 100 mV higher than at pH 8.8, reduction of heme bH by the quinol through center N was decreased (data not shown), resulting in a greater amount of c1 reduction in the bc1 complex with the Y185F iron-sulfur protein at pH 7.0 at low substrate concentrations as compared with wild-type enzyme at pH 8.8. In addition, only monophasic reduction kinetics were observed in the presence of antimycin, indicating that only one turnover per active center P occurred with up to 4 substrate equivalents.Fig. 4Pre-steady state kinetics of cytochrome c1 reduction by decyl-ubiquinol in the presence and absence of antimycin at pH 7 in a bc1 complex with a Y185F iron-sulfur protein mutation. Cytochrome bc1 complex with a Y185F mutation in the iron-sulfur protein was suspended at 1.5 μm and reduced with 0.75 μm (A), 1.5 μm (B), 3 μm (C), and 6 μm (D) decyl-ubiquinol in the absence or presence of 3 μm antimycin (anti). The traces show cytochrome c1 absorbance at 554–539 nm after correction for cytochrome b spectral overlap. Rates and reduction extent (%) are indicated for each trace. Absorbance changes corresponding to 50 and 100% reduction and calculated for a path length of 2 cm are shown as horizontal bars.

Furthermore, the extinction coefficients of each of the two b hemes are different; bH reduction contributes 70% of the total absorbance change when cytochrome b is completely reduced, and bL the remaining 30% (24Rich P.R. Jeal A.E. Madgwick S.A. Moody A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The equilibrium constant of electron sharing between the two b hemes is largely displaced toward bH due to a ΔEm >90 mV between the two redox centers (23Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This implies that when cytochrome b reoxidation through center N is prevented, the first ubiquinol oxidation in a monomer would reduce heme bH almost exclusively, and a second turnover would reduce bL. This makes it possible to distinguish spectroscopically between one monomer oxidizing two ubiquinol molecules at center P (resulting in 50% of the absorbance change that would result from total cytochrome b reduction) and two monomers turning over once (resulting in 70% of the maximum possible absorbance change) by using differe"
https://openalex.org/W1999192371,The evolution of complexity relies on changes that result in new gene functions. Here we show that the unique morphological and functional features of the excretory duct cell in C. elegans result from the gain of expression of a single gene. Our results show that innovation can be achieved by altered expression of a transcription factor without coevolution of all target genes.
https://openalex.org/W2046185737,"Age-related changes in protein-protein interactions in the lens play a critical role in the temporal evolution of its optical properties. In the relatively non-regenerating environment of the fiber cells, a critical determinant of these interactions is partial or global unfolding as a consequence of post-translational modifications or chemical damage to individual crystallins. One type of attractive force involves the recognition by α-crystallins of modified proteins prone to unfolding and aggregation. In this paper, we explore the energetic threshold and the structural determinants for the formation of a stable complex between α-crystallin and βB2-crystallin as a consequence of destabilizing mutations in the latter. The mutations were designed in the framework of a folding model that proposes the equilibrium population of a monomeric intermediate. Binding to α-crystallin is detected through changes in the emission properties of a bimane fluorescent probe site-specifically introduced at a solvent exposed site in βB2-crystallin. α-Crystallin binds the various βB2-crystallin mutants, although with a significantly lower affinity relative to destabilized T4 lysozyme mutants. The extent of binding, while reflective of the overall destabilization, is determined by the dynamic population of a folding intermediate. The existence of the intermediate is inferred from the biphasic bimane emission unfolding curve of a mutant designed to disrupt interactions at the dimer interface. The results of this paper are consistent with a model in which the interaction of α-crystallins with substrates is not solely triggered by an energetic threshold but also by the population of excited states even under favorable folding conditions. The ability of α-crystallin to detect subtle changes in the population of βB2-crystallin excited states supports a central role for this chaperone in delaying aggregation and scattering in the lens."
https://openalex.org/W1973422952,"A feature of the rat brain γ-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT1, and other members of the neurotransmitter transporter family, is its regulated redistribution between intracellular locations and the plasma membrane. Recent studies have focused upon defining the signaling molecules that facilitate this redistribution. Agents that promote direct tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 promote a relative increase in surface GAT1 levels, and this results from a slowing of the transporter internalization rate. Agents that act to increase protein kinase C (PKC) activity promote a relative decrease in surface GAT1 levels; whether this effect is caused by direct transporter phosphorylation is unknown. The opposing actions of tyrosine kinase activity and PKC activity raise the possibility that the subcellular distribution of GAT1 is associated with mutually exclusive transporter phosphorylation events. The present experiments show that GAT1 is phosphorylated on serine residues in a PKC-dependent manner, but this state is only revealed when GAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation is eliminated or greatly reduced. The relative levels of serine phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation are negatively correlated. The amount of serine phosphorylation is regulated by agents that affect tyrosine phosphorylation, and vice versa. In addition, the ability of agents that affect tyrosine kinase activity to regulate GAT1 serine phosphorylation requires a change in its tyrosine phosphorylation state. These data support the ideas that GAT1 can exist in either of two mutually exclusive phosphorylation states and that the relative abundance of these states determines in part the relative subcellular distribution of the transporter.

Neurotransmitter transporters are integral membrane proteins, expressed at or near the synapse on neurons and glia, that function by coupling the uptake of neurotransmitter to the movement of co-transported ions down their electrochemical gradients. Homologous recombination experiments in which various neurotransmitter transporter genes have been manipulated demonstrate a critical role for these transporters in maintaining appropriate levels of transmitter in the synaptic cleft and the importance of this maintenance on behavior (1Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar, 2Tanaka K. Watase K. Manabe T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Takahashi K. Iwama H.

Psych. 2002; 7: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Studies such as these raise the likelihood that neurons and glia have developed means by which to rapidly regulate transporter function to control these extracellular transmitter levels. Recent evidence suggests this to be true. Transporter function can be altered by a variety of triggering factors and signal transduction cascades (for review, see Refs. 4Gegelashvili G. Schousboe A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 5Beckman M.L. Quick M.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Blakely R.D.

In general, this functional regulation occurs either by changing the rate of substrate translocation through the transporter, or by changing the number of functional cell surface transporters. A recurring theme in transporter regulation is the rapid redistribution of the transporter between intracellular locations and the plasma membrane. This modulation occurs in part through activation of second messengers such as kinases, phosphatases, arachidonic acid, and pH. These factors may act directly on the transporter protein (e.g. by phosphorylation; see Refs. 9Casado M. Bendahan A. Zafra F. Danbolt. N.C. Aragón C. Giménez C. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Epilepsy Res. 1995; 21: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Much is known about the characteristics of GAT1's regulated trafficking. Intracellularly localized GAT1 resides on a small (50 nm), clear vesicle that recycles on and off the plasma membrane of hippocampal neurons on a time scale of seconds to minutes in a calcium- and activity-dependent manner (20Deken S.L. Wang D. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GAT1 associates with, and is regulated by (21Beckman M.L. Bernstein E. Quick M.W. J.

Biol. 2001; 18: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GAT1 internalization is associated with clathrin- and dynamin-dependent processes (20Deken S.L. Wang D. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ∼5% of surface-localized GAT1 is internalized each minute in the basal state (25Whitworth T.L. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, a balance of recurrent exocytosis and endocytosis determines GAT1 expression. In cultures of hippocampal neurons that endogenously express GAT1, the relative subcellular distribution of the transporter in the basal state is ∼60% surface to 40% intracellular (26Bernstein E.M.

In contrast, agents that promote tyrosine phosphorylation cause a relative increase in surface localized protein (27Law R. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This effect is caused by direct phosphorylation of GAT1 residues Y107 and Y317, and the relative increase in surface expression results from a slowing of the rate of transporter internalization (25Whitworth T.L. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The serotonin transporter is directly phosphorylated by PKC (33Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and it is hypothesized that this event tags the transporter for internalization (34Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest a hypothesis in which GAT1 is phosphorylated either on tyrosine residues or on serine/threonine residues, and that the relative abundance of these states determines the relative subcellular distribution of the transporter. Cell Culture and GAT1 Mutagenesis—Hippocampal cultures were prepared from rats aged from postnatal day 0 to 3 (32Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed after 10–14 days in vitro. CHO cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Serum-deprived neuronal cultures were maintained in neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen). Two GAT1 tyrosine residue mutants that are refractory for tyrosine phosphorylation were made using Altered Sites I (Promega). In GAT1–5YA, all five putative intracellular tyrosine residues (Tyr-107, Tyr-317, Tyr-412, Tyr-481, and Tyr-598) are mutated to alanine (27Law R. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol.

Quick M.W. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. All constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for subsequent transfections. Transfections were carried out using FuGene 6 (Roche) in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). [3H]GABA Uptake Assays—Pre-assay drug incubations were performed in HEPES-buffered saline. After incubation, cells were rinsed three times in 1× HEPES-buffered saline solution and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min in the final wash. Buffer was then exchanged with control HEPES-buffered saline or drug-containing HEPES-buffered saline. GABA was added to initiate the assay. The final [3H]GABA concentration of the assay solution was 40 nm; the total GABA concentration of the assay solution was 30 μm. The assay was terminated by rapidly rinsing the cells three times with HBSS, followed by solubilization in 300 μl of 0.001% SDS at 37 °C for 2 h. Aliquots were used for scintillation counting and to determine protein concentrations. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (SPSS Inc.). Two-sample comparisons were made using t tests; multiple comparisons were made using one-way analyses of variance followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc test. Surface Biotinylation—Biotinylation experiments were performed essentially as described previously (34Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J.

The cells were rinsed twice with 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline/calcium/magnesium buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 9.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cells were next incubated with 2 ml of a solution containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline/calcium/magnesium buffer for 20 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The biotinylation solution was removed by two washes in phosphate-buffered saline/calcium/magnesium buffer plus 100 mm glycine and quenched in this solution by incubating the cells at 4 °C for 45 min with gentle shaking. The cells were lysed with 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 60 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. The supernatant fractions (300 μl) were incubated with an equal volume of Immunopure Immobilized Monomeric Avidin beads (Pierce) for 60 min. The beads were washed three times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and adsorbed proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for 30 min. Analysis was performed on aliquots 1) taken before incubation with beads (total cell lysate), 2) of the supernatant fraction after adsorption and centrifugation (intracellular fraction), and 3) of the bead eluate (biotinylated fraction). Western blotting was then performed using anti-GAT1 antibody 346J (29Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-actin antibodies (Sigma) were used to verify that biotin was not labeling intracellular proteins. Immunoprecipitation—After treatment with particular drugs, cells were lysed in buffer (9.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.7 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm activated sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were precleared with 10 μl of protein A-agarose conjugate (Sigma), followed by immunoprecipitation of GAT1 using anti-GAT1 antibody 346J and protein A agarose. The product was washed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, run on a 10% acrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed using anti-GAT1 antibody 346J, anti-phosphotyrosine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphoserine (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or anti-phosphothreonine (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) antibodies. Phosphorylation—Experiments were performed essentially as described previously (11Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 1 h to equilibrate the intracellular ATP pools. Various drugs or control solutions were then added. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl/well ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 μm okadaic acid) for 1 h at 4 °C. Extracts were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described above using anti-GAT1 antibody 346J and protein A-agarose. Radiolabeled proteins were detected and quantified by direct imaging (Alpha Innotech). Previous data showed that agents that promote tyrosine kinase activity (and tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1) are associated with increased surface GAT1 expression (25Whitworth T.L. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Law R. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and agents that promote PKC activity are associated with decreased surface GAT1 expression (21Beckman M.L. Bernstein E. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How do these two activities interact? To begin to address this question, subcellular GAT1 expression and GAT1 function were assessed in CHO cells stably expressing GAT1 (Fig. 1). As shown previously, in untreated cultures, ∼50–60% of GAT1 was found on the cell surface based upon biotinylation with an impermeant biotinylating reagent (Fig. 1A). Two control experiments supported these findings: first, the intracellular cytoskeletal protein actin was not labeled by the biotinylating reagent, suggesting that only surface proteins were being labeled. Second, immunoreactive bands were not seen in parental CHO cells immunoblotted with GAT1 antibody (data not shown). In cultures treated with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate and the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide, more than 80% of GAT1 protein was found in surface fractions, as expected given that tyrosine kinase activity should dominate in this treatment condition. In addition, as expected given that PKC activity should dominate, when cells were treated with the PKC activator PMA and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a, more than 80% of GAT1 was found in intracellular fractions. When cultures were treated such that both tyrosine kinase and PKC activities were probably inhibited (using k252a and bisindolylmaleimide), or when tyrosine phosphatases were inhibited and phorbol esters were activated (using pervanadate and PMA), subcellular distribution of GAT1 was indistinguishable from untreated cultures. These results are consistent with the idea that the relative balance of these two activities is associated with the subcellular distribution of the transporter rather than the absolute activities associated with either or both pathways. In addition, the level of GAT1 surface expression correlated highly with GABA uptake in cultures treated in parallel, suggesting that these signaling pathways regulate function at least in part via subcellular transporter redistribution (Fig. 1B). In general, this balance of activities that regulate transporter expression and function could be managed in one of two ways. Each activity could be independent of the other, or the activity of one pathway could regulate the activity of the other. To examine these possibilities, CHO cells expressing wild-type GAT1 were examined for levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of increasing concentrations of PMA (Fig. 2). As the PMA concentration increased, the relative amount of GAT1 that was recognized by a phosphotyrosine antibody decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. This was probably a result of PKC activation by PMA, because a non-active phorbol ester analog of PMA (4αPDD) did not alter the amount of GAT1 recognized by the phosphotyrosine antibody and because co-application of the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide eliminated the PMA-mediated effect. The concentration range over which PMA exerted its effects was comparable with that associated with redistribution of GAT1 to intracellular locations (21Beckman M.L. Bernstein E. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and correlated with a decrease in GAT1 function (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that PKC activity regulates GAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. An attractive model resulting from the above data is that GAT1 can exist in either a PKC-phosphorylated state or a tyrosine kinase-phosphorylated state, and the relative abundance of these states determines the subcellular distribution of the transporter. One problem with this hypothesis is that although direct tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 has been shown (25Whitworth T.L. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), direct PKC-mediated phosphorylation has not. PKC-mediated effects on GAT1 subcellular distribution and GAT1 function are present even in GAT1 mutants in which consensus serine and threonine phosphorylation sites have been removed (29Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, several considerations prompted revisiting this possibility. First, direct PKC-mediated phosphorylation occurs for another member of this transporter family (11Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Second, phosphorylation often occurs at non-consensus sites. Third, the data from Fig. 2 showing that PMA reduced tyrosine phosphorylation raised the possibility for the opposite effect (i.e. that PKC-mediated phosphorylation might be obscured by tyrosine kinase activity). Therefore, to increase the probability of detecting PKC-mediated GAT1 phosphorylation, experiments were carried out using two different GAT1 mutants that are refractory for tyrosine phosphorylation: GAT1–5YA (27Law R. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Tyr-107,Tyr-317 (24Horton N. Quick M.W. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). CHO cells stably expressing these mutants were incubated with PMA, the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, and [32P]orthophosphate and subjected to subsequent immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A). Precipitation with a GAT1-specific antibody revealed a radioactive band of the size expected for GAT1 protein. This band was not present when the antibody was pre-adsorbed by a GST fusion protein containing the antibody recognition site, when using pre-immune sera for the precipitation, or in parental CHO cells. A nonspecific signal was present in all experimental conditions, although the source of this signal is unknown. To confirm this phosphorylation event, experiments were performed using antibodies that specifically recognize phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues. CHO cells stably expressing GAT1–5YA were subjected to immunoprecipitation using each phospho-specific antibody and subsequently immunoblotted using a GAT1-specific antibody (Fig. 3B). GAT1 immunoreactivity was present in the phosphoserine-precipitated lysates but not in phosphothreonine-precipitated lysates or in parental CHO cell lysates. Taken together, these data suggest that GAT1 is a serine-mediated phosphoprotein. To further characterize this phosphorylation event, CHO cells stably expressing GAT1–5YA were treated with agents that enhance or diminish PKC activity, subjected to immunoprecipitation using a GAT1 antibody, and then evaluated for the relative amount of GAT1–5YA that was recognized by the phosphoserine antibody (Fig. 4A). Compared with the untreated condition, the amount of GAT1–5YA recognized by the phosphoserine antibody was significantly reduced by bisindolylmaleimide, whereas okadaic acid and PMA both significantly increased the amount of GAT1–5YA recognized by the phosphoserine antibody. PMA concentration-response experiments (Fig. 4B) revealed that the concentration range over which PMA exerted its effects was comparable with that required to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation (see Fig. 2) and to redistribute GAT1 to intracellular locations (21Beckman M.L. Bernstein E. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PMA effect was probably caused by PKC activation, because 4αPDD did not alter the amount of GAT1 recognized by the phosphoserine antibody and because co-application of the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide eliminated the PMA-mediated effect. These data suggest that, at least in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation sites, GAT1 is a PKC-regulated phosphoprotein. The data to this point indicated that GAT1 can be both tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 2) and serine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3) and that the PKC activator PMA can reduce the amount of GAT1 that is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These results suggested a model in which tyrosine kinase and PKC compete to phosphorylate GAT1. If true, there should be a negative correlation between tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and PKC phosphorylation. To test this prediction, CHO cells expressing wild-type GAT1 were treated with various inhibitors and enhancers of tyrosine kinase, tyrosine phosphatase, and PKC activities, subjected to immunoprecipitation with a GAT1 antibody, and then probed for total GAT1 protein and the relative amount of GAT1 protein recognized by the phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine antibodies (Fig. 5A). Compared with the untreated condition, application of K252a to the cultures reduced the relative amount of GAT1 recognized by the phosphotyrosine antibody and increased the relative amount of GAT1 recognized by the phosphoserine antibody; the addition of PMA further increased this effect. The phosphoserine antibody did not detect any GAT1 in cultures treated with pervanadate, but the amount of GAT1 recognized by the phosphotyrosine antibody was increased over the untreated condition. The inclusion of bisindolylmaleimide had no additional effect (Fig. 5B). Another approach to examine this relationship was to hold PKC activity constant and vary relative tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 5C). Compared with untreated cultures, application of PMA increased the relative amount of GAT1 recognized by the phosphoserine antibody and decreased the relative amount of GAT1 recognized by the phosphotyrosine antibody. The addition of pervanadate reversed this effect. The data in Fig. 5 are consistent with the idea that there is competition between the states of GAT1 tyrosine and GAT1 serine phosphorylation: first, GAT1 exhibited reciprocal phosphorylation; as the relative amount of tyrosine phosphorylation increased, the relative amount of serine phosphorylation decreased and vice versa. Second, tyrosine kinase inhibitors not only reduced tyrosine phosphorylation but also increased serine phosphorylation; tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors had the opposite effect. Third, PKC activators not only increased serine phosphorylation but also decreased tyrosine phosphorylation. The ability of K252a, for example, to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation and increase serine phosphorylation is consistent with a model in which the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 is necessary to permit serine-mediated phosphorylation. However, another possibility is that the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation is not required to permit serine phosphorylation; rather, the actions of K252a on each pathway are separate. To examine this idea in more detail, CHO cells expressing GAT1–5YA were treated with K252a or pervanadate and then examined for the relative amount of GAT1 that was recognized by the phosphoserine antibody (Fig. 6). Unlike in wild-type GAT1, neither pervanadate nor K252a affected the relative amount of GAT1–5YA recognized by the phosphoserine antibody. Thus, changes in serine phosphorylation induced by agents that affect tyrosine kinase activity occur only when the tyrosine phosphorylation state of GAT1 changes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the two phosphorylation states are mutually exclusive. In hippocampal neurons that endogenously express GAT1, direct tyrosine phosphorylation is observed (25Whitworth T.L. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In an attempt to reveal endogenous serine-mediated phosphorylation of GAT1 previously not seen, conditions were chosen that increased PKC activity and decreased tyrosine kinase activity. Hippocampal cell cultures were treated with PMA, okadaic acid, and K252a and then immunoprecipitated with a phosphoserine antibody. Subsequent immunoblotting with a GAT1 antibody revealed faint immunoreactivity (Fig. 7A). This band was absent in cultures treated to enhance PKC activity alone or to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity alone. These data are comparable with the results seen in CHO cells stably expressing GAT1 and suggest that similar phosphorylation-dependent events may be occurring in neurons that endogenously express the transporter. To examine this possibility in more detail, neuronal cultures were treated in ways that modulated GAT1 function via endogenous PKC and tyrosine signaling pathways (27Law R. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These included placing the cultures in serum-free medium to reduce brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor-mediated tyrosine kinase activity (27Law R. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and applying the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, which leads to activation of PKC (32Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once again, under conditions in which both relative tyrosine kinase activity is reduced and PKC activity is increased, faint immunoreactivity could be observed (Fig. 7B). Based upon electrophysiological analysis using GABA transport antagonists, GAT1 can regulate both the magnitude and time course of GABAA and GABAB receptor signaling at particular synapses (15Isaacson J.S. Solis J.M. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 16Dingledine R. Korn S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 366: 387-409Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Solis J.M. Nicoll R.A. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3466-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, estimates of the rate at which individual GABA transporters can translocate GABA are approximately tens of molecules per second (36Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M.W. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 37Hilgemann D.W. Lu C.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 459-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which is likely to be several orders of magnitude too slow to regulate synaptic transmission, at least at synapses containing GABAA receptors. This observation, as well as experiments examining glutamate transporter function (38Tong G. Jahr C.E. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1195-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), has led to the idea that a significant portion of the action of transporters on cell signaling arises from the transporters acting as transmitter sinks, essentially binding transmitter away from receptor sites. Estimates of the number of GAT1 molecules present at some nerve terminals are as high as 1,000–2,000 per square micron (39Chiu C-S. Jensen K. Sokolova I. Wang D. Li M. Deshpande P. Davidson N. Mody I. Quick M.W. Quake S.R. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10251-10266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus providing ample sites for transmitter sequestration. If the number of GABA transporter binding sites is a crucial determinant of GABA-ergic transmission, then modulating the number of these sites via transporter trafficking will be important physiologically, not only by controlling synaptic GABA signaling but also potentially by regulating spillover of GABA onto neighboring synapses (40Ichinose T. Lukasiewicz P.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3285-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present data show that the relative distribution of GAT1 protein between surface pools and intracellular pools is regulated by reciprocal phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine residues on GAT1. These results support the idea that GAT1 exists in either of two mutually exclusive phosphorylated states and that the relative abundance of these states acts to determine the relative subcellular distribution of the transporter. Initial experiments on PKC regulation of GAT1 (29Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Osawa I. Saito N. Koga T. Tanaka C. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 19: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Sato K. Betz H. Schloss P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showed that drugs that alter PKC levels in cells had a dose-dependent effect on radiolabeled GABA uptake that occurred on a time scale of minutes. However, elimination of the consensus serine and threonine phosphorylation sites on GAT1 failed to eliminate the PKC effect (29Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that PKC-mediated phosphorylation was occurring on non-consensus sites, that the PKC effect was indirect, or both. Indeed, PKC regulates the interaction of GAT1 and syntaxin 1A via phosphorylation of the syntaxin 1A binding partner Munc-18 (21Beckman M.L. Bernstein E. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Munc-18, which inhibits its binding to syntaxin 1A, promotes inhibition by syntaxin 1A of GAT1 function. The present data show that PKC also exerts effects on GAT1 via direct phosphorylation. Identification of the serine residue(s) in GAT1 responsible for this effect is presently under investigation. Based upon secondary structure predictions, 12 intracellular serine residues could be responsible. Of particular interest are two serine residues located near Y107 and Y317 known to be phosphorylated in GAT1 (25Whitworth T.L. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An increase in the relative amount of GAT1 that is tyrosine-phosphorylated correlates with a relative increase in GAT1 surface expression; an increase in the relative amount of GAT1 that is serine-phosphorylated correlates with an accumulation of intracellular GAT1. Thus, one possibility is that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for externalizing GAT1 or maintaining GAT1 surface expression, whereas PKC-mediated phosphorylation is required to internalize the transporter or maintain it in an intracellular pool. However, this is probably not the case. In the presence of both tyrosine kinase inhibitors and PKC inhibitors, GAT1 expresses functionally on the plasma membrane similar to that seen in the absence of these inhibitors. In addition, a GAT1 mutant that cannot be tyrosine-phosphorylated still expresses functionally on the surface and recycles, although the rate at which it internalizes is slowed (25Whitworth T.L. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is more likely that phosphorylation states of the transporter modulate basal trafficking rates that are phosphorylation-independent. Thus, the following model is proposed: Vesicles containing GAT1 are inserted into the membrane in a calcium-dependent manner and internalized via a clathrin-dependent manner (20Deken S.L. Wang D. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation places the transporter in a conformation that disfavors tyrosine phosphorylation and favors interactions with internalization machinery, thus speeding endocytosis and increasing the size of the intracellular GAT1 pool. Tyrosine phosphorylation would have the opposite effects. This model suggests one role for multiple transporter phosphorylation states (i.e. in regulating the availability of the transporter to be internalized); thus phosphorylation is presumed to be occurring on surface-bound GAT1. This may be true, given that the data show a correlation between the amount of GAT1 on the cell surface and the amount of GAT1 that is in either of the two phosphorylated states. Experiments are presently under way to determine whether these two phosphorylation states exist only for surface-bound GAT1. We thank T. Whitworth for technical assistance."

Etheno(ϵ)-adducts are also formed by reaction with epoxides that result from the metabolism of various industrial pollutants such as vinyl chloride and vinyl carbamate (4Barbin A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). E-adducts are ubiquitous, and highly variable background levels of ϵA and ϵC were found in asymptomatic tissue DNA under normal physiological conditions. It was shown that the level of ϵC present in 10 different human liver DNA samples averaged 28 ± 9 ϵC/108 bases (5Marnett L.J. Burcham P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 771-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), whereas in leukocytes, pancreas, and colon DNA samples isolated from healthy volunteers, it ranged from 0.1 to 11 ϵC/108 parent bases (6Nair J. IARC Sci. Publ. 1999; 150: 55-61Google Scholar). Based on these numbers, we estimate that the molar concentration of ϵC within the nucleus in human cells ranges from 0.2 to 40 nm. The low density lipids that transport cholesterol in the bloodstream are extremely susceptible to oxidation (7Mertens A. Verhamme P. Bielicki J.K. Phillips M.C. Quarck R. Verreth W. Stengel D. Ninio E. Navab M. Mackness B. Mackness M. Holvoet P. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and it was speculated that this may account for the highly variable background levels of ϵ-adducts found in the DNA from normal human tissues (1Nair J. Barbin A. Guichard Y. Bartsch H. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The increasing interest in exocyclic DNA adducts has been triggered by the observation that they are highly mutagenic. During DNA replication in Escherichia coli and simian kidney cells, ϵC mostly produces ϵC·G to A·T transversions and ϵC·G to T·A transitions (8Basu A.K. Wood M.L. Niedernhofer L.J. Ramos L.A. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12793-12801Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Moriya M. Zhang W. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In a single-stranded shuttle vector containing a single ϵC residue, the targeted mutation frequency yield was 81% in simian kidney cells (9Moriya M. Zhang W. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The ϵA residues are also highly mutagenic in mammalian cells, where they lead mainly to ϵA·T to T·A transversions (10Pandya G.A. Moriya M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11487-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11Levine R.L. Yang I.Y. Hossain M. Pandya G.A. Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4098-4104PubMed Google Scholar) but are weak mutagens in E. coli. Therefore, the processes preventing mutations caused by ϵ-adducts in the genome upon cell division should play a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the genetic information. When present in DNA, ϵC residues are eliminated by the base excision repair (BER) pathway initiated in human cells by mismatch-specific thymine-DNA glycosylase (hTDG) (12Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Hang B. Medina M. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Singer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13561-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, excision efficiency of ϵC by hTDG is rather poor (12Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, two additional enzymes that excise ϵC, have been identified in human cells: the methyl-CpG binding domain protein (MBD4/MED1) (14Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Genuardi M. Karbowski M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Bellacosa A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and single-strand monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase (SMUG1) (15Kavli B. Sundheim O. Akbari M. Otterlei M. Nilsen H.

The human alkyl-N-purine-DNA glycosylase (ANPG) excises ϵA and a variety of damaged bases including alkylated purines, hypoxanthine (Hx) and 1,N2-ethenoguanine (1,N2-ϵG), but it does not excise ϵC (reviewed in Ref. 16Gros L. Saparbaev M.K. Laval J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8905-8925Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Rat and murine homologs of ANPG have also been characterized (17O'Connor T.R. Laval F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3337-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 18Engelward B.P. Boosalis M.S. Chen B.J. Deng Z. Siciliano M.J. Samson L.D. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Studies using ANPG-deficient mice (Aag) suggest that ANPG could be an important determinant of cellular sensitivity to alkylating agents. Aag-/- mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts show an increased sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate and antitumor agents such as mitomycin C and N-methylnitrosourea (19Engelward B.P. Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Engelward B.P. Weeda G. Wyatt M.D. Broekhof J.L. de Wit J. Donker I.

Moreover, Aag-/- splenic T lymphocytes show a significant increase in methyl methanesulfonate-induced mutations when compared with the wild type (21Elder R.H. Jansen J.G. Weeks R.J. Willington M.A. Deans B. Watson A.J. Mynett K.J. Bailey J.A. Cooper D.P. Rafferty J.A. Heeran M.C. Wijnhoven S.W. van Zeeland A.A. Margison G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5828-5837Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly, Aag-/- myeloid progenitor bone marrow cells show an unexpected resistance to alkylation damage (22Roth R.B. Samson L.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 656-660PubMed Google Scholar), and pancreatic β cells of Aag null mice exhibit a markedly decreased susceptibility to necrosis induced by streptozotocin (23Cardinal J.W. Margison G.P. Mynett K.J. Yates A.P. Cameron D.P. Elder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5605-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, in particular cell types, sensitivity to alkylating agents could be related to ANPG status. The ANPG protein in normal human breast cells is localized in the nucleus as shown by immunofluorescent staining (24Cerda S.R. Turk P.W. Thor A.D. Weitzman S.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In human cells, ANPG could be present as several alternatively spliced forms, including a truncated version (25Vickers M.A. Vyas P. Harris P.C. Simmons D.L. Higgs D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3437-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Pendlebury A. Frayling I.M. Santibanez Koref M.F. Margison G.P. Rafferty J.A.

Commun. 1991; 176: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); consequently, it has been concluded that the non-conserved, N-terminal region apparently contributes little to the damage recognition and N-glycosylase activity (28O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, we have recently demonstrated that the first N-terminal 80 amino acids of ANPG are essential for 1,N2-ϵG-DNA glycosylase activity (29Saparbaev M. Langouet S. Privezentzev C.V. Guengerich F.P. Cai H. Elder R.H. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26987-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Previous reports have indicated that ANPG can recognize some modified bases without excising them. Based on gel retardation assays, ANPG was found to interact with a pyrrolidine abasic site analog (30Scharer O.D. Nash H.M. Jiricny J. Laval J. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8592-8597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and a phenotypic complementation study suggested that it could interact with 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) (31Bessho T. Roy R. Yamamoto K. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Tano K. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8901-8904Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), although the pure protein does not excise 8-oxoG. Moreover, it has been shown that ANPG recognizes cisplatin-DNA adducts in a reconstituted system with mild affinity (KD 71-144 nm) and may shield these adducts from repair by blocking the access to other proteins (32Kartalou M. Samson L.D. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8032-8038Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Current methods to measure the DNA glycosylase activities are indirect and time-consuming. To overcome these limits, we developed a method based on molecular beacons containing modified bases that allows direct and high throughput DNA glycosylase assay in reconstituted systems and in cultured cells. The molecular beacon is a single-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing a sequence complementary to the target that is flanked by self-complementary termini, and it carries a fluorophore and a quencher at the 5′-and 3′-ends (33Tyagi S. Kramer F.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (3644) Google Scholar). In the absence of the DNA target, these molecules form a stem-loop structure in which the 5′-fluorophore and 3′-quencher are in close proximity to each other, causing the fluorescence of the fluorophore to be quenched by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (34Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). Here, we report that excision of modified bases present in molecular beacon by a DNA glycosylase can be detected by increase in fluorescence. In the present work, a search for specific inhibitors of ANPG revealed that the human and rat proteins bind specifically to ϵC residues present in either duplex or single-stranded oligonucleotides. This abortive interaction between ANPG and ϵC residues strongly inhibits Hx and ϵA-DNA glycosylase activity in the reconstituted systems. Furthermore, using a modified molecular beacon, we demonstrated that short oligonucleotide duplex containing a single ϵC residue inhibits ANPG activity in cultured human and mouse cells. In addition, the ϵC·ANPG complex strongly inhibits both ϵC excision by hTDG and DNA synthesis by Klenow fragment in primer extension assays. Taken together, these results suggest that hijacking of ANPG in the ϵC·ANPG complex may lead to the persistence of ϵC in vivo and could result in replication fork arrest. The importance of the present observation is underlined by the fact that hijacking of cellular proteins by DNA damage has been implicated in the action of cisplatin drugs (35Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Mutat. Res. 2001; 478: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and the expansion of trinucleotide repeats in Huntington disease (36Kovtun I.V. Goellner G. McMurray C.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we propose a model of enhanced genotoxicity of the ϵC adduct. The possible implications of the ϵC·ANPG interaction for LPO-induced cytoxicity and genome instability are discussed. Oligonucleotides—All oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) and Genset (Evry, France) including the following oligonucleotides: modified, ϵA, d(AATTGCTATCTAGCTCCGC-ϵA-CGCTGGTACCCATCTCATGA)-biotin; ϵA2, d(AATTACATCGTCACCTGGG-ϵA-CATGTTGCAGATCCATGCAC); ϵC40, d(AATTGCTATCTAGCTCCGC-ϵC/C-CGCTGGTACCCATCTCATGA)-biotin; M13-ϵC or M13-C, d(CTATTAACGCCAGCTGG-ϵC/C-AAATGGGGGATGTGCTGCAAGGCG); ϵC- or C-hairpin d(TGGG-ϵC/C-CATGCATGGCCCA); X, d(AAATACATCGTCACCTGGG-X-CATGTTGCAGATCC), where X is cytosine (C), mismatched thymine (T), uracil (U), ϵA, ϵC, tetrahydrofuran, an abasic site analog (THF), 8-oxoG, 5,6-dihydrouracil (DHU), 5,6-dihydrothymine (DHT), inosine (I), or 5-hydroxyuracil (5ohU); molecular beacons, 35F-control, FITC-d(GCACTTAAGAATTCACGCCATGTCGAAATTCTTAAGTGC); 35FD-control, FITC-d(GCACTTAAGAATTCACGCCATGTCGAAATTCTTAAGTGC)-dabcyl, where FITC is fluorescein isothiocyanate and dabcyl is 4-(4′-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid; non-modified, PR-13, d(CGCCTTGCAGCAC); FLAP 7.6, d(TAGAGGCCATTTGCCAGCTGGCGTAATAG); complementary oligonucleotides, containing dA, dG, dC, or T opposite to modified base. Molecular beacon oligonucleotide, inosine-FD, FITC-d(CGCITCIACICIT-(CH2)18-ACICITCIACICG)-dabcyl, was a gift from Dr Y. Alekseev. To obtain duplex DNA, a modified oligonucleotide was hybridized to its complement, and the resulting oligonucleotide duplexes are referred to as X·C(G,A,T), respectively, where X is a modified base. The sequence contexts were used previously to study the repair of ϵ-adducts and hypoxanthine (29Saparbaev M. Langouet S. Privezentzev C.V. Guengerich F.P. Cai H. Elder R.H. Laval J. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were 5′-end labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, OZYME, Saint Quentin Yvelines, France) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol, ICN Biomedicals, S.A.R.L., Orsay, France). Cell Lines and Culture—Lich cells are derived from a human hepatoma (38Lefebvre P. Zak P. Laval F. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Lich, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cells were respectively grown in minimum essential medium and in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Culture media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cell-free extracts were prepared as described (38Lefebvre P. Zak P. Laval F. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Enzymes—Purification of the E. coli UDG (uracil-DNA glycosylase), TagI (3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase I), AlkA (3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase II), MUG (mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase), Fpg (formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase), Nth (endonuclease III), Nfo (endonuclease IV), hTDG (human mismatch-specific thymine-DNA glycosylase), hOGG1 (human 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase), ANPG70, ANPG60, ANPG40, and ANPG80 proteins was performed as described (29Saparbaev M.

Purification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Apn1 (apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease 1) and human AP endonuclease 1 (Ape1) proteins was performed as described (39Ishchenko A.A. Sanz G. Privezentzev C.V. Maksimenko A.V. Saparbaev M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6344-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Human Nth1 (human endonuclease III) protein was generously provided by Dr. R. Roy (American Health Foundation, Valhalla, NY). The activity of the various proteins was tested using their principal substrates and was checked just prior to use. Enzyme Assays—The release of ϵA, ϵC, and thymine residues was measured by the cleavage of an oligonucleotide containing a single lesion at a defined position. The standard assay for ϵC and thymine excision activity (20 μl) contained 0.2 pmol of the 5′-32P-end labeled oligonucleotide duplex, 70 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml BSA, and limiting amounts of enzyme, unless otherwise stated. The reaction mix for ϵA excision activity was supplemented with 100 mm KCl. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C except for hTDG, which was at 30 °C. The abasic sites were revealed by light piperidine treatment (10% piperidine at 37 °C for 15 min) (40Ye N. Holmquist G.P. O'Connor T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and reaction products were analyzed as described (39Ishchenko A.A. Sanz G. Privezentzev C.V. Maksimenko A.V. Saparbaev M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6344-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The gels were exposed to a Storm 840 Phosphor Screen, and the amounts of radioactivity in the bands were quantified using ImageQuaNT™ software. The standard enzyme assay with molecular beacon was performed at 37 °C with 5-35 nm oligonucleotides and a limited amount of protein, in the respective reaction buffer. Reactions were performed in a quartz cuvette (final volume, 0.4 ml), and fluorescence was measured using an SFM 25 Kontron fluorimeter and real-time computed with the attached software WIND25 1.50. Excitation was at 488 nm, and emission was at 515 nm. Fluorescence was expressed as response units. At the end of the reaction, to compare the fluorescence of the reaction product with that of the reaction mixture without enzyme, emission spectra of the reaction product and the reaction mixture without enzyme were obtained between 500 and 550 nm and with an excitation at 488 nm. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The standard binding reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 70 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20-200 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide duplex, limiting amounts of protein, and non-labeled competitor oligonucleotide, unless otherwise stated. The mixture was incubated for 20 min on ice, after which an aliquot was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) using 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 mA/100 V for 14 h at +4 °C. The gels were analyzed as described above. Surface Plasmon Resonance Techniques—Kinetics of interaction were determined using a BIAcore 1000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Pre-annealed, biotinylated oligonucleotide duplex ϵC40·G (0.1 ng/μl in Hepes buffered saline-EDTA polysorbate buffer containing: 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20) was injected at flow rate of 2 μl/min onto a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (SA sensor chip, BIAcore). To remove non-specifically bound material, 30 μl of 0.05% SDS was pulsed. The amount of immobilized ligand was found to be about 600-900 response units. To determine dissociation equilibrium constants (KD) using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), the 40-mer duplex containing ϵC was immobilized onto the sensor chip surface as described, and then different concentrations of ANPG40 were injected in low salt Hepes buffered saline-EDTA polysorbate buffer containing only 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate 30 μl/min. At the end of the association time, dissociation was achieved by injecting the same buffer. Analysis of the sensorgrams and KD values were performed using BIAevaluation software. DNA Repair Assay in Cultured Cells—HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were grown in 6-well plates. Cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, and culture medium was replaced by 1 ml of OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen) before transfection. 200 pmols of each oligonucleotide and 2 μg of Cytofectin GSV (Glen Research, Sterling, VA) were diluted separately in 50 μl of solution A (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and then mixed together. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, cytofectine·DNA complexes were added drop by drop to the cells, which were grown for 5 h and then fixed with a 4% formal-dehyde solution for 20 min at 4 °C before examination in a fluorescence microscope. Primer Extension Assay—To generate a double-stranded matrix for DNA synthesis, a 41-mer oligonucleotide template containing either ϵC (M13-ϵC) or C (M13-CC) at position 17 was annealed to a 5′-32P-labeled 13-mer primer (PR13) and a partially complementary 29-mer (Flap 7.6) oligonucleotide at a 1:1.2 molar ratio by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and slow cooling. The standard reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 10 nm 5′-32P primer/template, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitiol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm each of dNTP and 1 unit of Klenow fragment. Where stated, 20-500 nm ANPG80 and/or ANPG70 were added. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 5 min, and products were analyzed as described above. Effect of Duplex Oligonucleotides Containing Single Modified Base upon ϵA-DNA Glycosylase Activity of ANPG—In a search for specific inhibitors of ANPG, we measured the ϵA-DNA glycosylase activity of ANPG in the presence of a competitor duplex oligonucleotide containing specific base modifications. The 5′-32P-labeled ϵA·T was incubated with purified ANPG70 protein in the absence or presence of a molar excess of the following non-labeled duplex oligonucleotides: C·G, G·T, G·U, ϵA·T, ϵC·G, THF·G, 8-oxoG·C (Fig. 1A) and 8-oxoG·A, DHU·G, DHT·A, I·T 5ohU·G (data not shown) at 37 °C for 20 min. As shown in Fig. 1A, when ϵA·T is treated with ANPG70 followed by light piperidine, in order to reveal abasic sites generated by ANPG, about 70% of the oligonucleotide was incised (lane 2). Equimolar amount of non-labeled (cold) ϵA·T and I·T oligonucleotides had a very slight, if any, inhibition effect (lane 9 and data not shown). However, an 8-fold molar excess of ϵA·T lead to a 4-fold reduction of ϵA excision (lane 10). The weak inhibition by ϵA·T and I·T might be due to the high Km value of ANPG for these substrates (24 and 69 nm, respectively) (41Saparbaev M. Kleibl K. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3750-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 42Asaeda A. Ide H. Asagoshi K. Matsuyama S. Tano K. Murakami A. Takamori Y. Kubo K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). No significant effect on ϵA-DNA glycosylase activity of ANPG was detected in the presence of C·G, G·T, G·U, THF·G, 8-oxoG·C, 8-oxoG·A, 5ohU·G, DHU·G, DHT·A, and I·T oligonucleotides, even at 8-fold molar excess (lanes 3-8, lanes 13-16, and data not shown). 2- and 20-fold reductions of the incision were observed in the presence of 1- and 8-fold molar excess of ϵC·G, respectively (lanes 11-12), indicating that ϵC is a more efficient inhibitor than ϵA (or Hx) (lanes 10 and 12). Similar results were obtained when the truncated ANPG40 and rat APDG60 were used, indicating that the non-conserved N-terminal region does not contribute to the substrate specificity (not shown) and that both the human and the rat ANPG proteins can form a specific interaction with ϵC. Identical patterns of inhibition were obtained with ϵA2·T oligonucleotide duplex, which has different sequence context than ϵA·T, indicating that the ϵC·G effect is not sequence-specific. Furthermore, the Hx- and 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase activities of ANPG were also strongly inhibited in the presence of a 3- and 6-fold molar excess of ϵC·G (see Supplemental data, Fig. 1, and data not shown). Altogether, the data suggest that human and rat ANPG interact specifically with ϵC residues among all other DNA modifications tested. Because ANPG is the only known DNA glycosylase that removes ϵA residues in mammalian cells, we investigated whether ϵC·G could inhibit ANPG in human cell-free extracts. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1B, the addition of non-labeled ϵC·Gto Lich cells extract completely inhibits ϵA excision (lanes 9 and 10), and again, it was more efficient than ϵA·T (lanes 3-4). A 25-fold molar excess of non-labeled A·T or 8-oxoG·C had no effect on ϵA excision (lanes 6 and 8). This result suggests that ϵC residues, when present in DNA, inhibit ϵA-DNA glycosylase activity in the cell. Binding of Various DNA Repair Proteins to ϵC·G Oligonucleotide—We proposed that the observed inhibition of ANPG-dependent DNA glycosylase activities in the presence of ϵC·G could result from tight and specific binding of ANPG to ϵC. Therefore, the interaction of 5′-32P-labeled ϵC34·G with various BER proteins was examined using an EMSA. To avoid non-specific interactions, the standard binding mixture contained a 17-fold excess of BSA and a 10-fold excess of cold, non-modified 34-mer C34·G duplex oligonucleotide over labeled ϵC34·G. The E. coli MUG and human TDG proteins are ϵC-specific DNA glycosylases (12Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and, as shown in Fig. 2A, MUG interacts in a highly specific manner with ϵC34·G, with more than 90% of the labeled DNA present in bound form (lane 4). In contrast, under the conditions used, GST-hTDG did not interact with ϵC34·G (lane 8). However, in agreement with our initial observations, the truncated human ANPG40 and rat APDG60 form a specific complex with ϵC34·G (lanes 9-10). Of the other enzymes tested, UDG, Nth, hNTH1, Ape1, and TagI proteins did not form any complex with ϵC34·G (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 5, 11, 13, and 15). However, although AlkA, Fpg, Nfo, hOGG1, and Apn1 do not excise ϵC, they were found to bind weakly to ϵC34·G (Fig. 2A, lanes 3, 6, 7, 12, and 14). Using cold competitor binding reactions, in contrast to MUG, ANPG, and APDG60, the interaction observed for AlkA, Fpg, Nfo, hOGG1, and Apn1 was found to be rather non-specific (data not shown). In conclusion, the results show that among the DNA repair proteins tested, MUG, ANPG40, and APDG60 bind to ϵC in a specific manner. Affinity of ANPG Isoform"
https://openalex.org/W1970196869,"Two small conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels (SK channels), SK2 and SK3, have been shown to contribute to the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and to shape the firing behavior in neurons for example in the hippocampal formation, the dorsal vagal nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the cerebellum. In heterologous expression systems, SK2 and SK3 currents are blocked by the bee venom toxin apamin, just as well as the corresponding neuronal AHP currents. However, the functional role and pharmacological profile of SK1 channels from rat brain (rSK1) is still largely unknown, as so far rSK1 homomeric channels could not be functionally expressed. We have performed a domain analysis to elucidate the pharmacological profile and the molecular determinants of rSK1 channel expression by using channel chimeras in combination with immunocytochemistry, immunoblot analysis, and electrophysiology. Our results reveal that the rSK1 subunit is synthesized in cells but does not form functional homomeric channels. Exchanging the carboxyl terminus of rSK1 for that of hSK1 or rSK2 is sufficient to rescue the functional expression of rSK1 channels. Additionally, transplantation of both amino and carboxyl termini of rSK1 onto hSK1 subunits, normally forming functional homomeric channel, hinders their functional expression, while hSK1 channels containing only the rSK1 carboxyl terminus are functional. These results suggest that the lack of functional expression of rSK1 channels is probably due to problems in their assembly and tetramerization but not in their calmodulin-dependent gating. Finally, we show that chimeric channels containing the core domain (S1–S6) of rSK1, unlike hSK1, are apamin-insensitive.

The more pronounced the AHPs, the less the neuron fires and the stronger is SFA (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar).SFA and the underlying AHP show two temporally distinct phases in cortical neurons (2Sah P. Faber E.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The medium AHP (mAHP), lasting 100–300 ms, can be observed after single or bursts of action potentials (3Storm J.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 409: 171-190Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 4Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Different K+ currents underlie the mAHP, among which a prominent role is played by the Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) current IAHP (4Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). IAHP is activated by Ca2+ entering the neurons during action potentials and hyperpolarizes the membrane, thereby generating the early phase of SFA and regulating the tonic firing frequency of neurons (4Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This current is selectively blocked by the toxins apamin, scyllatoxin, and tamapin (4Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 5Pedarzani P. D'hoedt D. Doorty K.B. Wadsworth J.D. Joseph J.S. Jeyaseelan K. Kini R.M. Gadre S.V. Sapatnekar S.M. Stocker M. Strong P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46101-46109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The slow AHP activates and deactivates around 10-fold slower compared with the mAHP. sAHP is also mediated by a KCa current termed sIAHP, which is not blocked by apamin or any other known K+ channel blockers in brain slices (2Sah P. Faber E.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The suppression of sIAHP by a number of neurotransmitters leads to a drastic reduction of late SFA and an enhancement of neuronal excitability (2Sah P. Faber E.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).Three small conductance KCa channel subunits (rSK1, rSK2, and rSK3) are expressed in the rat central nervous system and have been proposed to generate the two distinct currents IAHP and sIAHP, which underlie the mAHP and sAHP, respectively (6Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). rSK2 and rSK3 subunits form homomeric channels that open upon binding of intracellular calcium to calmodulin (CaM), which is constitutively bound to the COOH-terminal region of each channel subunit (7Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Bee and scorpion toxins have been used as reliable tools to correlate KCa channels to native currents, revealing for example that the highly apamin-sensitive SK2 channels mediate IAHP in hippocampal neurons (4Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 8Sailer C.A. Hu H. Kaufmann W.A. Trieb M. Schwarzer C. Storm J.F. Knaus H.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9698-9707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the less sensitive SK3 channels mediate IAHP in dorsal vagal, superior cervical ganglion, and midbrain dopaminergic neurons (9Pedarzani P. Kulik A. Muller M. Ballanyi K. Stocker M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 283-290Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Hosseini R. Benton D.C. Dunn P.M. Jenkinson D.H. Moss G.W. J. Physiol.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3443-3456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Currently little is known about the function and no pharmacological data are available for the rat SK1 channel. We have used a domain analysis approach to investigate the functional expression and toxin sensitivity of the SK1 channel cloned from rat brain (rSK1).MATERIALS AND METHODSDNA Constructs—The coding regions of hSK1, rSK1, and rSK2 were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). In the chimera rSK1NSK2-CSK2 aa 1–88 of the NH2 terminus and aa 373–536 of the COOH terminus of rSK1 were replaced by aa 1–121 of the NH2 terminus and aa 406–580 of the COOH terminus of SK2. In the chimera hSK1NrSK1-CrSK1 aa 1–92 of the NH2 terminus and aa 377–543 of the COOH terminus of hSK1 were replaced by aa 1–88 of the NH2 terminus and aa 373–536 of the COOH terminus of rSK1. In the chimera rSK1NSK2, rSK1CSK2, hSK1NrSK1, hSK1CrSK1, rSK1NhSK1, and rSK1ChSK1 only the corresponding NH2 or COOH terminus was replaced. All modified sequences were verified by sequencing with a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI3100 Avant Genetic-Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).Antibody Production and Purification—The rSK1 (GenBank™ accession number AF000973) NH2 terminus (aa 7–69) was expressed as a glutathion S-transferase fusion protein used to raise the anti-NSK1 antibody (Biogenes). The peptide anti-CSK2 antibody (12Cingolani L.A. Gymnopoulos M. Boccaccio A. Stocker M. Pedarzani P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4456-4467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was affinity-purified on a Sulfolink column (Pierce) coupled to the immunizing peptide. Generation and characterization of the anti-NSK2 antibody have been described previously (12Cingolani L.A. Gymnopoulos M. Boccaccio A. Stocker M. Pedarzani P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4456-4467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air) at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells used for Western analysis were transfected using the CaPO4 method and harvested 24–48 h after transfection. Cells used for electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry were transfected using LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen). For electrophysiological recordings, a plasmid of rSK1, hSK1, or chimeras (1.5 μg) was co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pEGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein)-C2.Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5% (w/v) lithium dodecyl sulfate, sonicated for 30 s, and solubilized at 4 °C for 15 min. Samples (0.5–5 μg of protein, estimated by the DC Protein assay, Bio-Rad) were denatured and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (12Cingolani L.A. Gymnopoulos M. Boccaccio A. Stocker M. Pedarzani P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4456-4467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Immunocytochemistry—HEK293 cells expressing the indicated channel or chimera were processed for immunocytochemistry as described in Ref. 12Cingolani L.A. Gymnopoulos M. Boccaccio A. Stocker M. Pedarzani P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4456-4467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Primary antibody dilutions were 1:500: anti-NSK1 and anti-CSK2 or 1:1000: anti-NSK2. The secondary Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used at 1:600 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunostaining was visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Zeiss), and pictures were taken with a CCD camera (Micropublisher, QImaging).Electrophysiology—Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of HEK293 cells transiently transfected or stably expressing rSK2 channels (5Pedarzani P.

Channels were activated by dialyzing the cells with a pipette solution containing (in mm): 130 KCl, 10 Hepes, 10 EGTA, at pH 7.2, and MgCl2 and CaCl2 adjusted to obtain a free calcium concentration of 1 μm (up to 10 μm for hSK1NrSK1-CrSK1 and rSK1NhSK1) using EqCal (Biosoft). Borosilicate glass pipettes had a resistance of 2–3 megaohms. After gigaseal formation, the capacitive transients were automatically compensated. Currents were elicited by application of 400-ms voltage ramps from –100 to +40 mV, repeated every 10 s. Alternatively, 30-ms-long voltage steps from –100 to +40 mV with increments of 20 mV were applied. Data were acquired with the Pulse/Pulsefit software (HEKA Elektronik) and analyzed with Igor (WaveMetrics). Values are given as mean ± S.E.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWithin the SK channel family, the primary sequences of the rat and human SK2 subunits present 97.6% identity (6Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T.

Similarly, the amino acid sequences of the SK3 subunit from the two species display 94.4% identity (13Joiner W.J. Wang L.Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The hSK1 subunit forms homomeric channels with a sensitivity to apamin that varies depending on the heterologous expression system of choice (IC50: 3.3–12 nm in mammalian cell lines (17Strobaek D.

No information is instead available on the functional and pharmacological properties of rSK1 channels.To characterize rSK1 channels, we performed a set of immunocytochemical experiments on HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the rSK1 subunit. rSK1 protein was detected with a specific antibody generated against a portion of the rSK1 NH2-terminal region (anti-NSK1). Fig. 2B shows a typical result of an immunofluorescence obtained on rSK1 transfected cells. The anti-NSK1 antibody detected rSK1 protein distributed throughout the cell, with a higher concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2B). The anti-NSK1 antibody did never result in any signal when applied to non-transfected cells (Fig. 2C1) or to cells expressing rSK2 channels (Fig. 2C2), thereby demonstrating its subunit specificity. To assess the functional properties of rSK1 channels, we performed electrophysiological recordings in the whole-cell configuration. The channels were activated by 1 μm free Ca2+ present in the pipette solution, conditions that reliably activated hSK1, rSK2, rSK3, and IK (5Pedarzani P. D'hoedt D. Doorty K.B. Wadsworth J.D.

Despite the presence of rSK1 protein as detected by immunofluorescence and in the immunoblot (Fig. 3), no current above background could be measured in rSK1 transfected cells (Fig. 2, D and Q; current density: 13.2 ± 6.3 pA/pF; n = 6). By contrast, cells transfected with rSK2 not only showed clear immunofluorescence signals, as detected with SK2 specific antibodies against its NH2-terminal (anti-NSK2; Fig. 2F) and COOH-terminal region (anti-CSK2; Fig. 2G), but also displayed K+ currents activated by Ca2+ (Fig. 2H, see also Ref. 5Pedarzani P.

The same antibody did not detect any bands when tested on lysate from HEK293 cells or cells transfected with rSK2, thereby confirming its specificity. rSK1CSK2, rSK1ChSK1, hSK1NrSK1, and hSK1NrSK1-CrSK1 were detected by the anti-NSK1 antibody and, for rSK1CSK2, also by the anti-CSK2 antibody as a single band. The anti-NSK2 antibody did not cross-react with rSK1 and was used to detect the rSK1NSK2-CSK2 and rSK1NSK2 chimeras. Similar results were obtained in Western analysis experiments of three independent transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The biggest differences in the primary sequences of rSK1 and rSK2 subunits lie in their NH2- and COOH-terminal regions. To identify molecular determinants responsible for the lack of rSK1 functional expression, we generated a chimeric rSK1 subunit carrying the NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences of rSK2 (rSK1NSK2-CSK2; Fig. 2I). After transfection, rSK1NSK2-CSK2 protein was detected by immunofluorescence with the anti-NSK2 (Fig. 2J) and anti-CSK2 (Fig. 2K) antibodies. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that the rSK1NSK2-CSK2 chimera assembled and formed functional KCa channels, as shown by the K+ currents recorded in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2, L and Q; current density: 176.5 ± 25.6 pA/pF; n = 11). To narrow down the region responsible for the lack of rSK1 functional expression, we generated a second chimeric subunit where only the COOH-terminal region of rSK1, necessary for the binding of CaM, was exchanged with that of rSK2 (rSK1CSK2; Fig. 2M). When expressed in HEK293 cells, the rSK1CSK2 protein was synthesized and could be detected by immunofluorescence using the anti-NSK1 (Fig. 2N) and the anti-CSK2 antibodies (Fig. 2O). Like rSK1NSK2-CSK2, rSK1CSK2 assembled into functional K+ channels as demonstrated by the K+ currents elicited in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2, P and Q; current density: 100.7 ± 21.6 pA/pF; n = 19). Similarly, functional expression could be obtained when the COOH-terminal region of rSK1 was replaced by that of the human homologue, hSK1 (Fig. 2Q; rSK1ChSK1 current density: 98.5 ± 15.9 pA/pF; n = 17). Conversely, the replacement of the NH2-terminal region of rSK1 by that of rSK2 (Fig. 2Q; rSK1NSK2 current density: 44.9 ± 11.6 pA/pF; n = 8) or hSK1 (Fig. 2Q; rSK1NhSK1 current density: 36.7 ± 12.9 pA/pF; n = 6) did not yield a rescue of rSK1 functional expression.In the attempt to elucidate whether the COOH terminus of rSK1 is per se capable of hindering the formation of functional channels when attached to normally expressing subunits, we exchanged the COOH-terminal region of hSK1 with that of rSK1 (Fig. 2Q). Surprisingly, hSK1CrSK1 subunits formed functional channels in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2Q; current density: 293.3 ± 64.5 pA/pF; n = 11). Similarly, replacing the NH2 terminus of hSK1 by that of rSK1 led to the formation of functional channels (Fig. 2Q; current density: 372.4 ± 101.3 pA/pF; n = 3). By contrast, functional expression was hindered when both rSK1 NH2 and COOH termini substituted the corresponding regions in hSK1 (Fig. 2Q; current density: 17.2 ± 4.6 pA/pF; n = 11). The CaM-binding region (ABC or Ct1 region (7Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P.

Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CaM-binding region of rSK1 is very similar to the one of hSK1 (Fig. 1), presenting only five different amino acids. The gating of hSK1CrSK1 channels argues against an impairment of CaM binding and gating solely due to the rSK1 COOH terminus. This view is supported by three further lines of evidence. First, the two residues that are critical for the constitutive binding of CaM to the COOH terminus of rSK2 and its surface expression (Arg464 and Lys467; Refs. 24Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L.

Second, the amino acids forming α-helices important for constitutive CaM binding, as shown by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography (26Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 27Wissmann R. Bildl W. Neumann H. Rivard A.F. Klocker N. Weitz D. Schulte U. Adelman J.P. Bentrop D. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4558-4564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), are conserved in rSK1. Third, the region comprising the proximal part of the COOH-terminal domain (up to aa 370 in rSK1), S6, and the pore domain around the selectivity filter, which have been analyzed in rSK2 by substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis to identify the SK channel gate (28Bruening-Wright A. Schumacher M.A. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6499-6506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is identical in all rSK subunits and thus cannot be responsible for the lack of functional expression of rSK1.The expression of both rSK1 and of the different chimeric proteins used for the domain analysis was further confirmed by Western analysis. Fig. 3 shows that HEK293 cells transfected with the rSK1 subunit and probed with the NH2-terminal antibody anti-NSK1 yielded a band corresponding to a molecular weight of 51 kDa (Fig. 3), which is in good agreement with the predicted molecular weight of the rSK1 subunit. The anti-NSK1 antibody was specific as it did not detect any protein in non-transfected HEK293 cells or in cells transfected with rSK2 (Fig. 3). Similarly, the anti-NSK2 antibody and the anti-CSK2 antibody were specific, as they recognized only a single band corresponding to the rSK2 channels in transfected but no proteins in non-transfected HEK293 cells (12Cingolani L.A. Gymnopoulos M. Boccaccio A. Stocker M. Pedarzani P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4456-4467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in cells expressing rSK1 (Fig. 3). Finally, by using the appropriate antibody on lysates from transfected HEK293 cells, we showed the expression of all chimeric proteins at molecular weights close to their predicted values (Fig. 3), confirming that both rSK1 and the chimeric subunits used for our domain analysis were expressed in full length, although only some of them displayed functional expression.The analysis of rSK1 chimeras shows first of all that the substitution of the rSK1 COOH terminus by the rSK2 or the hSK1 COOH termini, but not the substitution of the corresponding NH2 termini, is per se sufficient to obtain its functional expression. Additionally, transplantation of both NH2 and COOH termini of rSK1 onto hSK1 subunits, normally capable of forming functional homomeric channel, hinders their functional expression, in agreement with previous evidence that both the NH2 and the COOH termini of SK channels are important for the SK channel assembly and tetramerization (22Joiner W.J.

https://openalex.org/W2030084701,"Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family member that plays a central role in cytokine- and stress-induced apoptosis by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 signaling cascades. ASK1-induced apoptotic activity is up-regulated by two cellular factors, Daxx and TRAF2, through direct protein-protein interactions. Daxx and TRAF2 are death receptor-associated proteins in Fas and tumor necrosis factor-α pathways, respectively. Recent studies suggest that calcium signaling may regulate ASK1 pathway. Here we report that human D53L1, a member of the tumor protein D52 family involved in cell proliferation and calcium signaling, up-regulates the ASK1-induced apoptosis. The human D53L1 physically interacts with the C-terminal regulatory domain of ASK1 and promotes ASK1-induced apoptotic activity by activating caspase signaling in mammalian cells. In luciferase reporter assays, hD53L1 activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase-mediated transactivation in the presence of ASK1. Expression of hD53L1 enhances autophosphorylation and kinase activity of ASK1 but has no effect on ASK1 oligomerization that is necessary for kinase activity and on binding of ASK1 to MKK6, a downstream factor of ASK1. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of ASK1 by hD53L1 may provide a novel mechanism for ASK1 regulation.

Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that controls normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms (1Cohen J.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar, 2Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar). The inability to control the tightly regulated apoptosis causes many human diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and various neurodegenerative disorders (3Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar). Extensive studies in recent years have revealed that apoptotic cell death occurs through an orchestrated sequence of intracellular signaling cascades. In particular, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; Trx, thioredoxin; Grx, glutaredoxin; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; Trx, thioredoxin; Grx, glutaredoxin; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. signaling pathways have been known as highly conserved cascades for regulation of cell death and survival from yeast to humans (4Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-104PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). There are at least six independent MAPK signaling units in mammalian systems (6Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 7Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). Three of them, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK; also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)) pathway, and the p38 pathway, have been extensively characterized. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway is often stimulated by mitogens, whereas the JNK/SAPK and the p38 signaling pathways are responsive to proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α and interleukin-1) and environmental stress-related stimuli, including UV irradiation, H2O2, ischemia and reperfusion, and removal of growth factors. Several lines of evidence suggest that the JNK/SAPK signaling cascade plays a role in apoptotic cell death induced by stress-related stimuli (4Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-104PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar, 8Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J.

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a key MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) that activates both the JNK/SAPK and the p38 signaling cascades by directly phosphorylating and, therefore, activating MKK4 and -7 (SAPK pathway) and MKK3 and -6 (p38 pathway) (10Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. K. Miyazono Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ASK1 induced apoptotic cell death, and a dominant negative mutant of ASK1 reduced TNF-α- and Fas-induced apoptosis, indicating the involvement of ASK1 in TNF-α and Fas-induced apoptotic pathways (10Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. K. Miyazono Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 11Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Functional activations of ASK1 by TNF-α and Fas signals are mediated by bindings of ASK1 to TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and the Fas-associated protein Daxx, respectively (11Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 12Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The Daxx- or TRAF2-induced ASK1 activation leads to apoptotic cell death through the activation of the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway (11Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 13Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). There are several antagonistic cellular partners for ASK1 including thioredoxin (Trx), glutaredoxin (Grx), 14-3-3 proteins, and protein serine/threonine phosphatase 5. Thioredoxin (Trx) was identified as a negative regulator of the ASK1-JNK/p38 pathway through yeast two-hybrid screening for ASK1-binding proteins (14Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2044) Google Scholar). In resting cells, ASK1 constantly forms an inactive complex with Trx, but upon treatment of cells with TNF-α or reactive oxygen species such as H2O2, ASK1 is dissociated from Trx and activated by subsequent modifications, including oligomerization and auto- and/or cross-phosphorylation (10Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. K. Miyazono Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 14Saitoh M. Nishitoh H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that 14-3-3 proteins and Grx directly bind to ASK1, and that overexpression of 14-3-3 and Grx proteins blocked ASK1-induced apoptosis and JNK1 activity, respectively (16Song J.J. Rhee J.G. Suntharalingam M. Walsh S.A. Spitz D.R. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46566-46575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In addition, protein serine/threonine phosphatase 5 was identified as a negative regulator of the activated ASK1. Protein serine/threonine phosphatase 5 binds to and dephosphorylates ASK1 in response to H2O2, enabling inactivation of ASK1 by negative feedback (18Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Moreover, intramolecular interaction, probably between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of ASK1, may be required to maintain the inactive form of ASK1 (11Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Thus, ASK1 is associated with the mechanism for apoptotic cell death. As a result, execution of apoptosis induced by ASK1 must be strictly regulated by intracellular partners. However, the molecular mechanism by which ASK1 activity is regulated in cells is not understood completely. To better understand the mechanism for the regulation of the ASK1 activity, we searched for its binding partners using the yeast two-hybrid screening method. Among several positive clones, we have identified one of them as hD53L1, a novel hD53 splicing variant encoding 131 amino acids. The hD52 gene was originally identified through its elevated expression in human breast carcinoma. The hD52 gene encodes a 184-amino acid polypeptide including a potential glycosylation site and several potential phosphorylation sites (19Byrne J.A. Mattei M.G. Basset P. Gunning P. Cytogenet Cell Genet. 1998; 81: 199-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of hD52 homologues from other species have indicated that hD52 may play roles in calcium-mediated signal transduction and cell proliferation (20Byrne J.A. Mattei M.G. Basset P. Genomics. 1996; 35: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Two homologues of hD52, hD53 and hD54, have also been identified, demonstrating the existence of a novel protein family (21Nourse C.R. Mattei M.G. Gunning P. Byrne J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The hD52-like protein sequences are all predicted to contain a coiled-coil domain, which is responsible for homo- and heteromeric interactions. Yeast two-hybrid screening showed that hD52 could specifically interact with hD52 as well as its family members (22Byrne J.A. Nourse C.R. Basset P. Gunning P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, D52-like proteins appear to exert and regulate their activities through specific interactions with other hD52-like proteins (23Sathasivam P. Bailey A.M. Crossley M. Byrne J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that hD53L1 physically interacts with ASK1 and acts as a positive regulator of ASK1. Activation of ASK1 by hD53L1 leads to the activation of the caspase-3-dependent apoptosis pathway. Expression of hD53L1 induces ASK1 autophosphorylation and JNK/p38 activation but has no effect on ASK1 self-oligomerization and binding to MKK6. The ASK1-activating action of hD53L1 appears to be a novel function of this tumor protein. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293, 293T, and BOSC 23 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.238% HEPES (Invitrogen), 0.375% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For hydrogen peroxide treatment or apoptosis activation, media were replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. For transient transfection, 1.4 × 106 cells were plated in each 60-mm cell culture plate, grown overnight, and transfected with DNA using either LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or calcium phosphate. Plasmid Constructions—HA-ASK1 and ASK1K709R expression plasmids were generous gifts from Dr. Hidenori Ichijo. HA-ASKK, HA-ASKKC, and HA-hD53L1 were generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pcDNA3. FLAG-ASK1, FLAG-ASKK, FLAG-ASKKC, and FLAG-hD53L1 were constructed in pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma). GST-tagged hD53L1 was constructed in pEBG and pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) plasmids for protein expressions in mammalian cells and Escherichia coli, respectively. The luciferase reporter plasmid (pFR-Luc) and pFA-c-Jun were purchased from Stratagene. Antibodies—GST-tagged hD53L1 protein was overexpressed in E. coli and bound to glutathione Sepharose 4B beads. The bound GST-fused protein was treated with thrombin to elute hD53L1 from the beads. The eluted hD53L1 protein was used to immunize mice. In Vivo and in Vitro Binding Assays—HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with ASK1 and hD53L1 expression plasmids. After 48 h of transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min (24Cho S. Choi Y.J. Kim J.M. Jeong S.T. Kim J.H. Kim S.H. Ryu S.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The soluble fractions were incubated with 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) or 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for5hat4 °C with rotation. After binding, the beads were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 1 min and washed five times in the lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with the SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:2000 dilution; Sigma), an anti-GST antibody (1:2000 dilution; Sigma), or an anti-HA antibody (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The protein bands were visualized by the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). To examine interaction between the endogenous proteins, cell lysates were prepared from HEK 293 or HeLa cells as described above and subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse preimmune IgG-agarose, mouse anti-ASK1-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse preimmune serum, or mouse hD53L1-specific antiserum for 5 h at 4 °C. The bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblot probed with anti-ASK1 antibody or hD53L1-specific antiserum. The in vitro binding effect of ASK1 to MKK6 was analyzed by incubating the immunoprecipitated FLAG-ASK1 with GST-MKK6 protein purified from E. coli, followed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-GST antibody. ASK1 Oligomerization and Phosphorylation Assays—To examine the effect of hD53L1 on the oligomerization of ASK1, HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids producing FLAG-ASK1 and HA-ASK1 along with HA-hD53L1. After 48 h of transfection, cell lysate was prepared as described above. The supernatants were incubated with 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) for 5 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, followed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-HA antibody. For phosphorylation assays, BOSC 23 cells were transfected as described above. After 48 h of transfection, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 beads. The beads were washed once with the lysis buffer, twice with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then once with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 20 mm MgCl2. The beads were then resuspended in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 20 μm ATP and 0.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with or without 2 μg of GST-MKK6 for 30 min at 30 °C. The phosphorylation reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Determination of Cell Viability—Cell viability of transfected HEK 293 cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in 0.2% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline, and the proportion of living cells was counted. The relative number of surviving cells was determined by estimating the value of mock-transfected cells as 100%. Measurement of Caspase-3 Activity—Caspase-3 activity was measured by an ApoProbe-3 caspase-3 fluorescent assay kit (Peptron) according to the manufacturer's instructions, in which a fluorogenic synthetic peptide DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was used as a substrate. Approximately 2 × 106 HEK 293 cells were transfected with both HA-ASK1 and FLAG-hD53L1 expression plasmids. After 24 h, transfected cells were exposed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 μl of chilled lysis buffer including 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin on ice for 20 min, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of 2× reaction buffer with freshly added 10 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was incubated with 2 μl of 2.5 mm fluorogenic substrate at 37 °C for 40 min. The fluorescence of the released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Detection of Active Caspase-3 and Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP)—For immunoblotting analysis, HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids producing HA-ASK1 along with FLAG-hD53L1. Cell lysate was prepared as described above and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After incubation with human anti-caspase-3 (1:2000; Calbiochem) and human anti-PARP (1:2000; BD Pharmingen), the membranes were developed by the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Apoptotic DNA Laddering Assay—The apoptotic DNA laddering assay was performed with the protocol described by Duke (25Duke R.C. Chervenak R. Cohen J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6361-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Approximately 8 × 106 cells were lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100 on ice for 20 min. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at room temperature for 5 min. The lysate was incubated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 20 min. DNA was purified by standard phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Dry DNA pellets were then resuspended in 20 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.02 mg/ml RNase A. Samples were loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Luciferase Reporter Assay—293T cells were grown to 50–80% confluence in 60-mm plates and transfected with 1 μg each of pFR-Luc and 0.5 μg of pCMV/β-gal along with the appropriate plasmids as indicated. Total amounts of DNA were equalized with empty plasmids. After 5 h of transfection in 2 ml of serum-free medium, an equal volume of medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 17 h. Medium was then changed with medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and incubated for another 24 h before harvesting. The luciferase activity was determined using an assay system (Promega) with a luminometer. The relative -fold induction of luciferase activity was determined and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. All transfections were repeated at least three times. ASK1 Physically Interacts with hD53L1—In order to identify a new binding partner of ASK1, we carried out yeast two-hybrid screening with a HeLa cDNA library using the C-terminal domain (residues 649–1375) of ASK1 as a bait (26Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). The C-terminal part contains a kinase domain (residues 649–940) and a regulatory domain (residues 941–1375). We have obtained and identified positive clones, some of which (e.g. MAP-KKK6 and 14-3-3 proteins) have already been reported to interact with ASK1 (17Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 27Wang X.S. Diener K. Tan T.H. Yao Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One of the de novo positive clones was identified as a full-length protein that is a splicing variant of tumor protein D53 and termed as human D53-like 1 (hD53L1) (GenBank™ accession number AF208012). Sequence alignment of hD53L1 to hD53 shows that the C-terminal 76 amino acids of hD53 protein were deleted due to alternative splicing. To confirm the interaction between ASK1 and hD53L1, we carried out interaction assays with transfected mammalian cell extract. HEK 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with FLAG-ASK1 and GST-hD53L1 expression plasmids. GST-hD53L1 protein was pulled down by glutathione beads, followed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies to detect ectopically expressed ASK1 in the pulled-down hD53L1 complexes (Fig. 1A). ASK1 was detected in the pulled-down hD53L1 complexes, whereas GST alone did not form a complex with ASK1. We also performed co-immunoprecipitation assays with expressed HA-ASK1 and FLAG-hD53L1 proteins and found HA-ASK1 in the immunoprecipitated FLAG-hD53L1 complex (data not shown), suggesting that ASK1 and hD53L1 interact each other, regardless of tags used. To test whether ASK1 could bring down hD53L1 in a reciprocal way, HA-hD53L1 and FLAG-ASK1 were expressed and ASK1 was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG beads, followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. HA-hD53L1 protein was detected in the pulled-down ASK1 complexes (Fig. 1B). The results showed that these two proteins interact with each other. To examine the interaction between the two endogenous proteins, we produced antiserum specific to hD53L1. The specificity of the antiserum was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis using cell extract from HEK 293 transfected with pFLAG-hD53L1 expression plasmid (data not shown). The two endogenous proteins, ASK1 and hD53L1, were detected in HEK 293 cells by immunoblotting with anti-ASK1 and anti-hD53L1 antibodies. Their interaction was examined by coimmunoprecipitation with either preimmune IgG-agarose or anti-ASK1-agarose, followed by immunoblotting with hD53L1-specific antiserum (Fig. 1C). We also detected hD53L1 in immunoprecipitated ASK1 complex from HeLa cell lysates, suggesting that the interaction is not cell type-specific (Fig. 1C). Immunoprecipitation of hD53L1 by hD53L1-specific antiserum and then immunoblotting with anti-ASK1 antibody also confirmed the interaction of the two endogenous proteins (Fig. 1D). In a subsequent experiment, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to determine which domain of ASK1 binds to hD53L1 in vivo. The C-terminal regulatory domain (residues 941–1375) of ASK1 was found to be responsible for the binding to hD53L1, whereas the kinase (residues 649–940) domain showed no affinity to hD53L1 (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these data suggest that ASK1 specifically interacts with hD53L1 through its C terminus in mammalian cells. Expression of hD53L1 Protein Potentiates ASK1-induced Apoptosis—Since hD53L1 interacts with ASK1, we next examined whether it could regulate ASK1-induced cell death. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with ASK1 and hD53L1 expression plasmids. When cell death was determined by a trypan blue exclusion assay, ASK1-induced cell death was increased in the presence of hD53L1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A), suggesting that hD53L1 is involved in the ASK1-induced cell death. Whereas overexpression of hD53L1 alone induced cell death only slightly, co-expression of hD53L1 and ASK1 significantly enhanced ASK1-mediated cell death. Based on the above observation, we further examined whether the hD53L1-ASK1 signal is accompanied by apoptotic features such as DNA fragmentation and induction of caspase-3 activity. DNA fragmentation is a process that appears in the later stage of apoptosis and results from the activation of endonucleases during the apoptotic program. These endonucleases degrade chromatin into 200-bp laddering of DNA fragments (28Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA samples were prepared from HEK 293 cells co-transfected with appropriate expression plasmids and were analyzed by electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2B, DNA fragmentation was not detected in samples from mock-transfected, hD53L1-transfected, and catalytically inactive ASK1K709R mutant-transfected cells, whereas ASK1-transfected and H2O2-treated cell samples displayed the apoptotic DNA laddering feature. Co-expression of ASK1 and hD53L1 gave strong laddering intensity in preference to ASK1 expression alone. Also, increasing concentration of hD53L1 elevated DNA fragmentation. On the other hand, expression of the catalytically inactive ASK1K709R mutant failed to induce DNA fragmentation in the presence of expressed hD53L1, suggesting that a phosphorylation event is necessary for the apoptosis. These findings indicate that overexpression of ASK1 effectively induces apoptosis in HEK 293 cells through MAPK pathways and that ASK1-mediated apoptosis can be enhanced by the addition of hD53L1. These results, therefore, suggest that hD53L1 may contribute to activation of the proapoptotic activity of ASK1 by partly, if not completely, enhancing kinase activity of ASK1. Overexpression of hD53L1 Activates Caspase-3 in an ASK1-dependent Manner—To directly test whether hD53L1 can regulate the apoptotic activity of ASK1, we measured the ASK1-induced caspase-3 activity in the presence of transiently expressed hD53L1. Caspase-3 has been implicated as a key protease activated during the early stage of apoptosis (29Patel T. Gores G.J. Kaufmann S.H. Faseb J. 1996; 10: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Active caspase-3, found in cells undergoing apoptosis, consists of a heterodimer of 17- and 12-kDa subunits that are derived from the inactive 32-kDa proenzyme. Active caspase-3 proteolytically cleaves and activates other caspases. Since members of the caspase family are crucial mediators of apoptosis (30Harvey N.L. Kumar S. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 62: 107-128PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), we examined the requirement of caspase-3 activities for ASK1-induced apoptosis using DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin as a substrate. Previous studies showed that caspase signaling is responsible for ASK1-induced apoptosis (32Hatai T. Matsuzawa A. Inoshita S. Mochida Y. Kuroda T. Sakamaki K. Kuida K. Yonehara S. Ichijo H. Takeda K.

HEK 293 cells were transfected with HA-ASK1 and FLAG-hD53L1 expression plasmids, followed by serum deprivation after 24 h of transfection. Following 16 h of serum starvation, ASK1-induced caspase-3 activity was measured in vitro (Fig. 3A). Whereas hD53L1-transfected cells gave no significant increase of caspase-3 activity, ASK1-expressing cells showed an apparent increase of caspase-3 activity. Cells co-t"

In the E820Q mutant this salt bridge is no longer possible, and the head group of Lys791, together with a water molecule, fills the position of the K+ ion and apparently mimics the K+-filled cation binding pocket.

The model is strongly supported by a series of reported mutagenesis studies on charged and polar amino acid residues in the membrane domain. To further test this model, Lys791 was mutated alone and in combination with other crucial residues. In the K791A mutant, the K+ affinity was markedly reduced without altering the E2 preference of the enzyme. The K791A mutation prevented, in contrast to the K791R mutation, the spontaneous dephosphorylation of the E820Q mutant as well as its conformational equilibrium change toward E1. This indicates that the salt bridge is essential for high-affinity K+ binding and the E2 preference of H,K-ATPase. Moreover, its breakage (E820Q) can generate a K+-insensitive activity and an E1 preference. In addition, the study gives a molecular explanation for the electroneutrality of H,K-ATPases.

Moreover, its breakage (E820Q) can generate a K+-insensitive activity and an E1 preference. In addition, the study gives a molecular explanation for the electroneutrality of H,K-ATPases. In the transmembrane domain of P-type ATPases there are a number of charged and other polar amino acid residues that are involved in cation binding and transport. Such a role was made likely by a large number of site-directed mutagenesis studies and confirmed by the crystal structure of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). In gastric H,K-ATPase, most attention has been paid to a number of negatively charged residues present in transmembrane helices 4, 5, and 6. The central theme in studies with this enzyme was the binding site for K+, which ion stimulates the hydrolysis of the phosphorylated intermediate. Studies up to now suggest roles in K+ activation for at least Glu820 in M6 (2Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. De Boer M. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol.

Gln could replace Glu795 without much change in properties. However, replacement of Glu795 by an Asp or Asn residue had marked effects on K+ affinity, suggesting that it is not the charge but the side-chain geometry of this residue that is important. Replacement of Glu343 by a Gln residue reduced the apparent K+ affinity by a factor of 10 (8Asano S. Furumoto R. Tega Y. Matsuda S. Takeguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol.

Most interesting were mutations of Glu820. Replacement of this residue by an Asp had only minor effects, but replacement by a neutral amino acid abolished or markedly reduced the K+ affinity (3Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The latter mutations resulted, surprisingly, in enzymes with a large K+-independent (constitutive) ATPase activity that could be inhibited by the specific H,K-ATPase inhibitor SCH 28080 1The abbreviation used is: SCH 28080, 8-benzyloxy-3-cyanomethyl-2-methyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetonitrile. (10Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The E1/E2 conformational equilibrium of the wild type enzyme and mutants with K+-stimulated ATPase activity is in the direction of the E2 conformation. This can be concluded from the low concentrations of either vanadate or the specific inhibitor SCH 28080, needed to inhibit the ATPase activity (11Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Wassink L. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6527-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All mutants with K+-independent ATPase activity, however, had a preference for the E1 conformation (9Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6527-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), as shown by the high vanadate concentration needed to inhibit the ATPase activity. This preference for the E1 form also explained why pre-incubation with the specific inhibitor SCH 28080 did not prevent ATP-phosphorylation or, in some cases, even enhanced the phosphorylation level of these mutants (12Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we used the information of molecular models of the E1 and E2 forms of the catalytic subunit of H,K-ATPase to investigate how the E820Q mutant can induce K+-independent ATPase activity. The model for the wild type enzyme predicts the presence of a salt bridge between the Glu820 and Lys791 exclusively in the E2 form of the wild type enzyme. Because of this salt bridge, there is only space for a single K+-binding site in the wild type enzyme. The model for the E820Q mutant explains its K+-independent ATPase activity. Mutational analysis of Lys791 confirmed the importance of the salt bridge and showed that, in the E820Q mutant, the presence of a positive charge at this position is necessary for the E1 preference of the E820Q mutant. The presence of a salt bridge also gives a molecular explanation for the electroneutrality of H,K-ATPases, in line with recent findings of Burnay et al. (13Burnay M. Crambert G. Kharoubi-Hess S. Geering K. Horisberger J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19237-19244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling of H,K-ATPase—Initial alignments of the gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit sequence (Swiss Prot accession number P09626) to the known structures of the rabbit fast twitch skeletal muscle sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a) (Protein Data Bank identifications 1EUL for the E1-state and 1IWO for the E2-state to which thapsigargin was bound) were obtained from the 3D-PSSM fold recognition server (14Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunits of Ca2+-ATPase and gastric H,K-ATPase show similar hydropathy plots and share 31% sequence identity in the aligned regions, which makes it practically certain that both adopt the same fold. This allows us to safely predict the structure of the latter using homology modeling techniques (15Rost B. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Gastric H,K-ATPase needs a β-subunit, but the interaction of this subunit with the catalytic subunit takes place in the M7/M8 region (16Melle-Milovanovic D. Milovanovic M. Nagpal S. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and is assumed to have not much influence on structure of the cation binding sites. The WHAT IF program (17Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3370) Google Scholar) was used to mutate the amino acid side chains based on a backbone-dependent rotamer library (18Chinea G. Padron G. Hooft R.W. Sander C. Vriend G. Proteins. 1995; 23: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Then the two models (E1 and E2) were refined with YASARA, which was shown to increase accuracy (19Krieger E. Koraimann G. Vriend G. Proteins. 2002; 47: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Apart from a manual alignment correction at helix M7, the models were built fully automatically. The salt bridge between Lys791 and Glu820, shown in Fig. 1, was thus predicted in the absence of any additional data. The quality of the final models was evaluated using WHAT_CHECK (20Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar), which compares structural features of the model to a data base of high resolution x-ray structures. The models were found to have about the same quality as the initial templates 1EUL and 1IWO. Coordinate files are available from the authors upon request. Identification of Potassium Binding Sites—Valence calculations were done with YASARA on a grid with 0.2 Å spacing using an empirical formula (21Brown I.D. Wu K.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1976; 32: 1957-1959Crossref Google Scholar) that has been applied to proteins previously (22Nayal M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The parameters used to identify potassium sites were 2.276 Å for the valence distance and -9.1 for the exponent. Because the initial model was built without K+ ions present, the modeled side chains did not always have the optimum conformation for binding. Visual inspection showed two small clusters with high valences in the transmembrane region covering ∼10 grid points each. K+ ions were therefore placed at these points, and the structure was minimized with a fixed backbone and the AMBER force field (45Wang J. Cieplak P. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 2000; 21: 1049-1074Crossref Scopus (3505) Google Scholar). This procedure yielded one clear binding site covering ∼50 grid points, whereas no improvement was found in the second case. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Generation of Recombinant Viruses— The cDNAs of the rat gastric H,K-ATPase α- and β-subunits were cloned in the pFastbacdual vector (Invitrogen) (23Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwé G.L.J. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis on Lys791 was performed, and the mutants were checked by sequence analysis. All DNA manipulations, transformation of the vector, transfection into Sf9 cells, and harvesting of viruses were carried out as described previously (24Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation and Characterization of Sf9 Membranes—Growth of Sf9 cells, isolation of membranes, protein quantification, and immunoblotting were performed according to Swarts et al. (9Swarts H.G.P.

Activity Assays—The ATPase activity was determined using a radiochemical method (25Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol.

The ATP-dependent phosphorylation level was determined at 21 °C as described previously (9Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36909-36916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Data were corrected for the levels of phosphorylated protein obtained with mock-infected membranes. The rate of dephosphorylation was determined by measuring the residual phosphorylation level 3 s after 8.3-fold dilution with non-radioactive ATP. Chemicals—SCH 28080 was kindly provided by Dr. C.D. Strader (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ). The antibody HKB was a gift of Dr. Michael Caplan (Yale). Analysis of Data—All data are presented as mean values for three to eight individual preparations with standard error of the mean. IC50 and K0.5 values were determined by analyzing the plots using the non-linear curve fitting program (Hill equation function) of Origin 6.1 (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Modeling—To investigate the structural basis of the K+-independent ATPase activity of the gastric H,K-ATPase E820Q mutant (10Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), molecular models of the E1 and E2 forms of the catalytic subunit of this ATPase were built using the known structures of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar, 26Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). With 31% sequence identity over 860 aligned residues, H,K- and Ca2+-ATPase can safely be assumed to adopt the same fold (15Rost B. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the alignment had to be manually adjusted in difficult regions like helix M7 by considering multiple sequences and structural requirements. Using the same valence scanning method as Ogawa and Toyoshima (27Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) in their recent modeling study of Na,K-ATPase, we found two weak signals for K+ binding sites in the transmembrane region of the E2 model. The addition of K+ ions at both locations, followed by an energy minimization step, yielded one strong binding site, whereas the other site showed no improvement in the valence-scanning score. We therefore concentrated our analysis on the clearly identified binding site that is located at a similar position as the K+ binding site II in the Na,K-ATPase model of Ogawa and Toyoshima (Table I). As shown in Fig. 1A, the K+ ion is surrounded by six oxygen atoms contributed by the backbone carbonyl groups of Val338 and Val341 (M4), one side chain oxygen of Glu795 (M5) and Glu820 (M6), and both side chain oxygens of Glu343 (M4). A striking observation was the formation of a salt bridge between Lys791 (M5) and Glu820 (M6). Such a salt bridge cannot occur in Na,K- or Ca2+-ATPases, because in these enzymes a Ser occupies the position of Lys791. The salt bridge is exclusive to the E2 form because of the large distance between the two residues in the E1-conformation (not shown). In yeast H+-ATPase, a salt bridge between an Arg in M5 and an Asp in M6 has also been reported, but this salt bridge is located at a different position (28Gupta S.S. DeWitt N.D. Allen K.E.

Glu820 normally accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone NH group of Leu345. Upon mutation to Gln, however, there are no satisfying options left. If the newly acquired amino group faces down, K+ binding is completely impossible, and if it faces up, it bumps into the backbone amino group of Leu345. In addition, both orientations lead to a contact with the amino group of Lys791. Energy minimization of this mutant made in silico therefore yielded the major rearrangements shown in Fig. 1B, i.e. Gln820 is pushed upwards to avoid Leu345, thereby losing contact with a potential K+ ion, whereas Lys791 now forms a salt-bridge with Glu795, taking over part of the space normally occupied by the K+ ion. The remaining hole has precisely the size of a water molecule. If Glu343 is indeed responsible for communication with the phosphorylation site, the situation depicted in Fig. 1B might be sufficiently similar to a true K+ binding event to induce dephosphorylation. This would explain the observed K+ independence of the dephosphorylation of the E820Q mutant. It is striking that K+-independent dephosphorylation of the latter mutant occurs at 21 °C but not at 0 °C (10Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the above-described conformational rearrangements in the cation binding site of this mutant are only possible above a certain temperature. ATPase Activity—In the two models presented in Fig. 1, Lys791 plays an essential role. We therefore mutated Lys791 alone and in combination with both E820Q and E343D and determined the properties of these mutants. We converted the Lys residue into both an Ala and an Arg residue. In the first one, the Lys side chain has been reduced to a methyl residue; in the second one, the positive charge of the Lys residue has been conserved. A few experiments were carried out with the K791S mutant, because a Ser residue is present on this position in both Na,K-ATPase and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). The properties of this mutant, however, were rather similar to that of the K791A mutant, and the K791S mutant was not further used in studies with double and triple mutants. In all these studies the wild-type enzyme, the E343D and E820Q single mutants, and the E343D/E820Q double mutant were used as control. The ATPase activities of the investigated mutants in the presence of 0, 1, and 10 mm K+ are presented in Fig. 2. The K+-stimulated ATPase activity of the K791A mutant was much lower than that of the wild type enzyme and the K+-independent ATPase activity of the E820Q single mutant. The K+-stimulated activity of the K791R mutant was hardly significant. In agreement with earlier findings (9Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36909-36916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), no ATPase activity was found when in one of these mutants Glu343 was additionally mutated into an Asp residue. The only double mutant that tended to show some K+-independent ATPase activity was K791R/E820Q. No ATPase activity was measured with the K791A/E820Q mutant. Dephosphorylation Studies—Because of previous observations that ATP could still phosphorylate some mutants without ATPase activity, we determined the ATP-phosphorylation level of all these mutants. Fig. 3 shows that all mutants could indeed be phosphorylated, although to a variable level. The ATP phosphorylation levels of the K791A mutants and, in particular, of the K791R mutants were markedly lower than that of the control mutants. The difference in phosphorylation capacity cannot be due to differences in expression level of the catalytic subunit, as shown by Western blotting experiments. The fact, however, that all these mutants could be phosphorylated gave the possibility to study their spontaneous and K+-sensitive dephosphorylation steps. None of the mutants or the wild type enzyme could be dephosphorylated by 1 mm ADP (not shown), indicating that the phosphorylated intermediates were all in the E2-P form. Fig. 4 confirms that the wild type enzyme was very K+-sensitive and that the E820Q mutant showed a high spontaneous dephosphorylation rate in the absence of K+. The E343D and E343D/E820Q mutants showed a low spontaneous dephosphorylation rate that was not increased by K+. The K791A mutant had a markedly reduced K+ sensitivity as compared with the wild type enzyme. The same was true for the K791S mutant (not shown). In contrast, the double K791A/E820Q and K791A/E343D as well as the triple K791A/E343D/E820Q mutants were completely K+-insensitive. Moreover, none of these mutants showed an enhanced K+-independent dephosphorylation rate as was found for the E820Q mutant. This finding is in agreement with the lack of (K+-stimulated) ATPase activity of these double and triple mutants (Fig. 2). All K791R-containing mutants did not show any K+-stimulated dephosphorylation activity (Fig. 4). This was even true for the K791R single mutant that showed a very low K+-stimulated ATPase activity (Fig. 2). The spontaneous dephosphorylation rate of the K791R/E820Q mutant was significantly higher than that of the other K791R-containing mutant, but much less than that of the E820Q single mutant. This might explain the very minor K+-independent ATPase activity of the latter mutant. In conclusion, although the K791A mutant is still K+-sensitive, the presence of this mutation prevents the K+-independent ATPase and dephosphorylation activity of the E820Q mutation. The K791R mutant, on the other hand, lost its K+-sensitivity but did not completely block the K+-independent ATPase and dephosphorylation activity of the E820Q mutation. E1/E2 Equilibrium Determinations—One of the peculiar properties of the E820Q mutant is its tendency toward the E1 form, whereas the wild type enzyme favors the E2 form. This can be shown by the IC50 value for vanadate on the ATPase activity (29Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. Josephson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7361-7368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type K+-dependent ATPase activity was inhibited by very low (0.4 μm) vanadate concentrations, whereas the K+-independent ATPase activity of the E820Q mutant was only 50% inhibited at 1 mm vanadate (11Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Wassink L. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6527-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Swarts et al. (9Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36909-36916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed that a measure for the direction of the E1/E2 equilibrium can also be obtained by determining the effect of vanadate on the ATP phosphorylation level. This makes it possible to include mutants without ATPase activity. Similarly, determination of the effect of SCH 28080 on the phosphorylation level gives a measure for the direction of this equilibrium. The phosphorylation level of mutants with an E2 preference was decreased by low SCH 28080 concentrations, whereas it hardly changed with E1-prefering mutants. In some cases, like the E820Q mutant, the phosphorylation level even increased when SCH 28080 was present (12Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that low SCH 28080 concentrations decreased the phosphorylation level of all K791A-containing mutants with a similar IC50 value as that measured for the wild type enzyme and the E343D mutant. SCH 28080 also largely decreased the phosphorylation level of both the K791R and the K791R/E343D mutants. This indicates that these mutants have, like the wild type enzyme, a preference for the E2-form. However, the phosphorylation level of the K791R/E343D/E820Q mutant was not lowered by SCH 28080, whereas that of the K791R/E820Q mutant was, like that of the E820Q mutant, even increased, indicating that the latter mutants have a preference for the E1 form (9Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36909-36916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). High vanadate concentrations were needed to reduce the phosphorylation level of the latter two mutants as shown by the measured IC50 values (Fig. 6). All mutants in which the phosphorylation level was decreased by SCH 28080 had also a low IC50 value for vanadate. Comparison of the results with mutants containing the K791A mutation with those lacking this mutation shows that the K791A mutation prevents the conformational equilibrium shift toward E1 that is characteristic for the E820Q mutation. K+Binding and Dephosphorylation—The atomic model presented in this paper provides a structural basis for the intriguing finding that replacing Glu at position 820 by a neutral amino acid residue renders gastric H,K-ATPase active in the absence of K+ (10Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Homology modeling of the α-subunit of H,K-ATPase was carried out to identify the K+ binding site(s) in the transmembrane region based on the two atomic structures of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, namely the Ca2+-bound E1 state for H+ (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar) and the Ca2+-free E2 state for K+ (26Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Valency scanning followed by energy minimization yielded one position at which high affinity for K+ is to be expected in the E2 model (Fig. 1A). Comparison with a recently published atomic model for Na,K-ATPase (27Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) suggests that the K+ binding site identified in H,K-ATPase most likely resembles the K+ binding site II in Na,K-ATPase (Table I). Fig. 1A shows that the K+ ion is held in place by six oxygen atoms provided by surrounding amino acids, namely the backbone carbonyl groups of Val338 and Val341 (M4), one side chain oxygen of Glu795 (M5) and Glu820 (M6), and both side chain oxygens of Glu343 (M4). Most remarkably, Lys791 (M5) formed a salt bridge with Glu820. This salt bridge was absent in the E1 model because of th"

The α-amino group of amino acid 1 is transferred to the PLP of the aminotransferase to give pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) and keto acid 1. Next, the amino group of PMP is transferred to keto acid 2 to yield amino acid 2 and regenerate PLP. For example, aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) takes aspartate and glutamate as amino acids 1 and 2, respectively.

We expressed the gene in Escherichia coli, purified the product protein, and physicochemically characterized it (9Hosono A. Mizuguchi H. Hayashi H. Goto M. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The protein, which is a PLP-dependent aminotransferase, showed high activity toward tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, kynurenine, methionine, glutamine, and the corresponding keto acids with kcat/Km values of 170,000–4,400,000 s-1m-1 for the half-transamination reactions and low activity toward other amino acids with kcat/Km values less than 130 s-1m-1. Based on the primary sequence homology and the substrate specificity, we proposed that the protein is glutamine:phenylpyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.64; ttGlnAT) in which the amino acids 1 and 2 in Scheme 1 are glutamine and an aromatic amino acid, respectively. This is the first non-eukaryotic GlnAT to be structurally characterized. In mammals, kynurenine aminotransferase I (KynAT I) is the equivalent of prokaryotic GlnAT and catalyzes the transamination of kynurenine to produce kynurenate (7Mosca M. Cozzi L. Breton J.

Kynurenate is involved in several aspects of the central nervous system by acting as an antagonist at both the glutamate-binding site and the allosteric glycine site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and possibly by blocking the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (12Schwarcz R. Pellicciari R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 13Stone T.W. Darlington L.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Kynurenate levels in the central nervous system are correlated to cerebral diseases such as schizophrenia and Huntington's disease. GlnAT is an interesting target enzyme for the development of a novel therapeutic compound controlling endogenous kynurenate levels because kynurenate is the product of the GlnAT-catalyzed reaction. We have determined the structures of the native, unliganded ttGlnAT in its PLP form and its complexes ttGlnAT·3-phenylpropionate (3PP) and ttGlnAT·α-keto-γ-methylthiobutyrate (KMTB), as the first structures of a non-eukarytotic GlnAT. In this article we describe substrate recognition by the enzyme and concomitant conformational changes at the domain level and present a computer model for the enzyme-kynurenine complex based on the crystal structure of ttGlnAT·3PP. Crystallization and Data Collection—The expression of ttGlnAT and the purification of the expressed enzyme have been reported previously (9Hosono A. Mizuguchi H. Hayashi H. Goto M. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The crystallization of the unliganded ttGlnAT in the PLP form was carried out at 293 K using the vapor-diffusion. The crystals were obtained by mixing 3 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml, 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 1.0 m monoammonium dihydrogenphosphate in 100 mm trisodium citrate, pH 5.6, and equilibrating against 400 μl of reservoir solution. Yellow crystals appeared within 2 weeks with the space group C2221, cell dimensions of a = 77.8, b = 91.9, and c = 110.7 Å, and with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Approximately 39% of the crystal volume was occupied by solvent (14Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7917) Google Scholar). The crystals of the ttGlnAT complex with 3PP were obtained by cocrystallization. A droplet of 3 μl of protein solution (6 mg/ml, 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 10 mm 3PP, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 17% (w/v) PEG4000 in 200 mm disodium tartrate and equilibrated against 400 μl of reservoir solution. The crystals of the ttGlnAT complex with KMTB were obtained under the same conditions as used for ttGlnAT·3PP, except for the concentration (24% (w/v)) of PEG4000. Within a week, yellow crystals of ttGlnAT·3PP and ttGlnAT·KMTB appeared. Both complex crystals were isomorphous with the space group P3121 and had average cell dimensions of a = b = 123.5 and c = 122.7 Å. There is one dimer in the asymmetric unit, and ∼55% of the crystal volume is occupied by solvent. Preliminary x-ray data were collected at 293 K on the BL45PX station at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). X-ray diffraction data sets for the unliganded crystal, the ttGlnAT·3PP crystal, and the ttGlnAT·KMTB crystal were collected to 1.9-, 2.35-, and 2.6-Å resolution at 293 K on the BL6A, BL18B, and BL18B stations, respectively, at the Photon Factory, KEK (Tsukuba, Japan), using an x-ray beam with a wavelength of 1.0 Å and an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD camera.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). The structure was refined by simulated annealing and energy minimization with the program CNS (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.N. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). Water molecules were picked up on the basis of the peak heights (3.0 σ) and distance criteria (4.0 Å from protein and solvent) from the sigmaA weighted Fo - Fc map. The water molecules whose thermal factors were above the maximum thermal factor of the main chain after refinement were removed from the list. Further model building and refinement cycles resulted in an Rfactor of 18.1% and an Rfree of 21.8%, calculated for 30,807 reflections (Fo > 2σ(Fo)) (Table I). During the last step of the refinement, unambiguous water molecules were added including those with a temperature factor higher than 50 Å2. The maximum temperature factor of the water molecules was 60 Å2. The initial structures for ttGlnAT·3PP and ttGlnAT·KMTB were determined with AMoRe (16Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar), using the structure of the unliganded ttGlnAT as the search model. The same refinement procedure as was used for the unliganded ttGlnAT was applied to ttGlnAT·3PP and ttGlnAT·KMTB. When the Rfactor value decreased below 30%, the substrate analogue 3PP or KMTB was introduced into a peak on a simulated annealing 2Fo - Fc map. Further model building and refinement cycles for ttGlnAT·3PP resulted in an Rfactor of 18.8% and an Rfree of 22.2%, calculated for 44,463 reflections (Fo > 2σ(Fo)). Further model building and refinement cycles for ttGlnAT·KMTB resulted in an Rfactor of 23.0% and an Rfree of 28.6%, calculated for 32,091 reflections (Fo > 2σ(Fo)) (Table I). The maximum thermal factors of the assigned water molecules in ttGlnAT·3PP and ttGlnAT·KMTB were 66 and 64 Å2, respectively. Modeling of ttGlnAT in Complex with Kynurenine—During the modeling, it was assumed that ttGlnAT·kynurenine as a Michaelis complex is in the closed form based on x-ray structures of ttGlnAT·3PP and ttGlnAT·KMTB. First, a model of the complex between ttGlnAT and tryptophan was constructed by replacing 3PP in ttGlnAT·3PP with tryptophan. The model structure was optimized by minimizing the empirical potential energy composed of stereochemical factors (bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles), van der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions using the program CNS (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.N. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). The ttGlnAT complex with kynurenine was then modeled on the assumption that kynurenine is bound to the active site in a manner similar to tryptophan. The 3-anthraniloyl and alanyl portions of kynurenine were located at the corresponding indolyl and alanyl groups of tryptophan, with the o-amino group of kynurenine superimposed onto the indolyl NH group of tryptophan. The model was optimized by a slow cooling molecular dynamics simulation using a standard protocol with a starting temperature of 500 K (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.N. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). Quality of the Structure—The final model of the unliganded ttGlnAT comprises 365 residues (1–10, 14–368) out of 368 residues within a subunit and one PLP with 171 water molecules. The average thermal factor of the main-chain atoms is 19.4 Å2. The final model of ttGlnAT·3PP comprises all residues for subunit 1, 367 residues (1–367) for subunit 2, two PLPs, and two 3PPs with 167 water molecules. The structures of the two independent subunits are quite similar. Superimposition of subunit 1 onto subunit 2 yields an r.m.s. deviation of 0.12 Å for 367 Cα positions. The average thermal factors of the main-chain atoms (N, Cα, C, and O) in subunits 1 and 2 are 31.5 and 36.0 Å2, respectively. The final model of ttGlnAT·KMTB comprises all residues for subunit 1, 367 residues (1–367) for subunit 2, two PLPs, and two KMTBs with 87 water molecules. The structures of the two independent subunits are quite similar. Superimposition of subunit 1 onto subunit 2 yields an r.m.s. deviation of 0.21 Å for 367 Cα positions. The average thermal factors of the main-chain atoms in subunits 1 and 2 are 36.7 and 44.1 Å2, respectively. The differences in the number of residues and the average thermal factors between the subunits 1 and 2 in the final models are due to the asymmetry of the intermolecular interactions. The thermal factors for both complexes reflect the fact that crystal packing has less of an effect on subunit 2 than on subunit 1. Analysis of the stereochemistry with PROCHECK (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that all the residues except for Phe-253 (Φ = 68°, Ψ = -66°) fall within the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot for all structures. On the basis of the electron density maps, it was confirmed that the conformation of Phe-253 is correct. The residues corresponding to Phe-253 are threonine in ttAspAT and serine in E. coli, pig cytosolic, and chicken mitochondrial AspATs. These residues have strained main-chain dihedral angles similar to that observed in ttGlnAT and participate in recognition of the substrate side chains (5Nakai T. Okada K. Akutsu S. Miyahara I.

The subunit structure of ttGlnAT in the PLP form, with secondary structure assignments as predicted by the program DSSP (26Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12270) Google Scholar), is shown in Fig. 3. Each subunit is divided into an N-terminal arm comprising residues 1–10, a small domain formed by two parts of the polypeptide chain from residues 11–38 and 279–368, respectively, and a large domain from residues 39–278. The core of the large domain is a sharply twisted seven-stranded sheet (parallel except for strand b10), which is surrounded by helices H5, H6, and H9 from the active-site side and helices H4, H7, and H8 from the surface side (Fig. 3). Helices H3 and H10, which are located around the molecular 2-fold axis, participate in the formation of the subunit interface. β-Strands b5 and b6 form a hairpin β structure at the domain interface. The small domain also has an antiparallel four-stranded sheet as its core, and this is flanked by four helices (H2, H11, H12, and H13) from the surface side. The molecule has two active-site cavities around a molecular 2-fold axis (Fig. 2A). Each cavity is located at the domain interface of one subunit and at the subunit interface. PLP-dependent enzymes have been classified into 4-fold groups (fold types I–IV) (27Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J.

Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The program DALI (32Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar) was used to search the Protein Data Bank data base for PLP-dependent enzymes possessing three-dimensional structures similar to that of the unliganded ttGlnAT. The highest Z scores (strength of structural similarity) were calculated to be 46.8 for ttAspAT (Fig. 2B; Ref. 5Nakai T. Okada K. Akutsu S. Miyahara I. Kawaguchi S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Hirotsu K.

Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 495-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Due to the fact that the first three enzymes with the highest Z scores belong to the subclass Ib and the last three enzymes belong to the subclass Ia, ttGlnAT is classified as a member of subclass Ib. The subunit Cα carbon atoms of ttGlnAT can be superimposed onto those of ttAspAT and E. coli AspAT with r.m.s. deviations of 1.6 and 2.7 Å for 355 and 337 Cα atoms, respectively. Open-Closed Conformation Change—One of the striking features of the AspATs in subclass Ia is the overall conformational change from the open to the closed form upon binding of substrates (20Okamoto A. Higuchi T. Hirotsu K. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Jäger J. Moser M. Sauder U. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol.

J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The small domain rotates as a rigid body to close the active site. On the other hand, in the ttAspAT of subclass Ib, only the N-terminal helix region from residues 13–30 (helix H2 in ttGlnAT) of the small domain approaches the active site to enclose the substrate inside the protein (5Nakai T. Okada K. Akutsu S. Miyahara I. Kawaguchi S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Hirotsu K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Upon binding of the substrate analogue (3PP) to ttGlnAT, a part of the small domain (the subdomain) comprising residues 14–31 from helix H2 and β-strand b1 and residues 319–332 from H12 and b13 moves to close the active site. The subunit Cα atoms, except for the subdomain Cα atoms in ttGlnAT·3PP, were superimposed onto the corresponding atoms in the unliganded ttGlnAT by least squares fitting with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.30 Å for 333 Cα atoms. However, in this calculation, larger differences were observed in the subdomain Cα atoms with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.71 Å f"

Spectrin family proteins, with their extensible three-helix folds, enable evaluation of dimerization effects at the single molecule level by atomic force microscopy. Although some spectrin family members function physiologically only as homodimers (e.g. α-actinin) or are strictly monomers (e.g. dystrophin), α- and β-spectrins are stable as monomeric forms but occur physiologically as α,β-heterodimers bound laterally lengthwise. For short constructs of α- and β-spectrin, either as monomers or as α,β-dimers, sawtooth patterns in atomic force microscopy-forced extension show that unfolding stochastically extends repeats ∼4–5-fold greater in length than native conformations. For both dimers and monomers, distributions of unfolding lengths appear bimodal; major unfolding peaks reflect single repeats, and minor unfolding peaks at twice the length reflect tandem repeats. Cooperative unfolding thus propagates through helical linkers between serial repeats (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys.

The associated chains in a dimer can stay together and unfold simultaneously in addition to unfolding independently. Weak lateral interactions do not inhibit unfolding, but strong lateral interactions facilitate simultaneous unfolding analogous to serial repeat coupling within spectrin family proteins.

The associated chains in a dimer can stay together and unfold simultaneously in addition to unfolding independently. Weak lateral interactions do not inhibit unfolding, but strong lateral interactions facilitate simultaneous unfolding analogous to serial repeat coupling within spectrin family proteins. As cytoskeletal proteins, spectrin superfamily proteins play important roles in cell organization and membrane mechanics (3Thomas G.H. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Thomas G.H. Williams J A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2843-2852PubMed Google Scholar). As flexible linkers that bind to actin filaments, these proteins function in both monomeric and associated forms. Erythroid αI- and βI-spectrin were the first identified spectrins among a still growing superfamily that includes α-actinin, dystrophin, utrophin, and many additional proteins that share homologous triple-helical repeat motifs (5Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar). In the red cell, α-chains of 20 repeats associate antiparallel along their lengths with β-chains of 17 repeats. The association is nucleated near the N terminus of β-spectrin (6Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that ends with an actin binding domain, which mediates formation of a cross-linked network (7Mohandas N. Evans E.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 787-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The ability of spectrin monomers to first dimerize laterally and then associate head-to-head as tetramers that cross-link actin is especially crucial to the resilience of the red cell membrane in circulation. Defects in association, for example, lead to membrane instabilities typical in hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (8Liu S. Palek J. Prchal J. Castleberry R. J. Clin. Investig. 1981; 68: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Like red cell spectrin, α-actinin, with its four homologous repeats, also associates laterally and cross-links actin, imparting stability to structures that range from focal adhesions to Z-lines of myotubes (5Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar). Dystrophin and utrophin (5Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar), in contrast, are hypothesized to impart cortical stability to diverse membranes as monomeric actin-binding proteins. For all of the spectrin family proteins, length and extensibility are deemed central to function. Surprisingly, perhaps, recent single-molecule studies (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Rief M. Pascual J. Saraste M. Gaub H.E. J. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) show that individual spectrin repeats will unfold under modest tensile forces. This is consistent with such motifs contributing directly to cytoskeletal flexibility and strain softening (11Lee J. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3178-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When compared with a growing list of forcibly unfolded protein domains, primarily stressed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) 1The abbreviations used are: AFM, atomic force microscopy; pN, piconewton. methods (12Rief M. Gautel F. Oesterhelt F. Fernandez J.M. Gaub H.E. Science. 1997; 275: 1295-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), the triple-helical fold of spectrin already appears to be among the most facile to unfold. Mechanical unfolding of spectrin raises higher order questions, however, such as the effect of association between chains. To specifically address the effect of the lateral association state of spectrin on unfolding, we have applied the AFM method of single molecule mechanics to two- and four-repeat constructs of α- and β-spectrin with comparison to the laterally associated α,β-heterodimer (see Fig. 1). The α-actinin homodimer and an eight-repeat rod segment of dystrophin were also studied. A variety of solution studies on spectrin dimerization have been conducted in the past (7Mohandas N. Evans E.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 787-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 13Begg G.E. Harper S. Morris M. Speicher D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3279-3287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (Kd) for the β1–4 and α18–21 dimer complex was measured to be ∼10 nm compared with the ∼10 pm reported for α-actinin dimers (14Flood G. Kahana E. Gilmore A.P. Rowe A.J. Gratzer W.B. Critchley D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Flood G. Rowe A.J. Critchley D.R. Gratzer W.B. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the affinity of β1–2 for α21–20 was found to be much stronger than that of β3–4 for α19–18 (13Begg G.E. Harper S. Morris M. Speicher D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3279-3287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) thus dividing the lateral dimer complex into a strong end and a weak end (Fig. 1C). Although other AFM studies have elaborated RNA hairpin interactions (16Trottier M. Mat-Arip Y. Zhang C. Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and insulin monomer-monomer association/dissociation interactions (17Yip C. Yip C. Ward M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5439-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), none to date have explicitly examined the inhibiting effects, if any, of protein dimerization on domain unfolding. Spectrin dimerization is predicated on the typical range of protein interactions: hydrophobic sequestration, hydrogen bonding, and most importantly electrostatic interactions between paired triple-helical bundles (13Begg G.E. Harper S. Morris M. Speicher D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3279-3287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here we probe these dimeric interactions through their effects on flexibility and unfolding. Evidence of positive cooperativity in forced unfolding of serial repeat interactions emerged in our recent work on spectrin that has been extended to temperature effects (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Law R. Liao G. Harper S. Yang G. Speicher D. Discher D. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3286-3293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We examine here whether lateral interactions facilitate or oppose unfolding. By a thorough statistical analysis, we conclude that strong lateral interactions lead to coupled unfolding of laterally adjacent repeats, whereas weak lateral interactions are surprisingly neutral in their effects on the force to unfold a repeat. Protein Preparation—The four N-terminal repeats of βI-spectrin (β1–4), the last four repeats of αI-spectrin (α18–21) (see Table I), and the four-repeat actinin central domains were expressed recombinantly and prepared as described (6Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Truncated α and β constructs were also studied. Purified α- or β-spectrin constructs exist only as monomers in solution (i.e. no homodimers), whereas actinin exists only as a tight homodimer. Stable αβ-heterodimer was purified from mixed monomers by gel permeation chromatography in phosphate-buffered saline as described elsewhere (18Shahbakhti F. Gratzer W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5969-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protein was kept on ice for AFM studies and typically was used within hours. Immediately before use, any protein aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 166,000 × g at 2 °C for 60 min, and dynamic light scattering was used to verify monodispersity prior to experiments.Table IPrimary structure properties of spectrin constructs Domain and total contour lengths, lc and Lc, respectively, have been calculated with a peptide length of 0.37 nm/aa.DomainNo. of aaaaa, amino acidContour, lcnmα2111141.0α2011442.1α1910739.5α1810940.2Extra93.3Total, Lc166.1Average41.5β112044.3β211442.1β310940.2β410639.1Extra20.7Total, Lc166.4Average41.6a aa, amino acid Open table in a new tab An AFM experiment was begun by adsorbing 100 μl of 0.03–0.1 mg/ml protein for 15 min at room temperature onto either freshly cleaved mica or amino-silanized glass coverslips. The surface was then rinsed lightly with phosphate-buffered saline and placed without drying under the head of the AFM; all measurements were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline. Lower protein concentrations generated minimal AFM results; higher protein concentrations showed higher unfolding forces, proving consistent with the results below indicating that domains in multiple, parallel chains are forced to unfold all at once. Fluorescence imaging of labeled protein demonstrated homogeneous adsorption, and AFM imaging after scratching the surface showed that no more than a monolayer of molecules covered the substrate (as illustrated in Ref. 19Carl P.

Dynamic Force Spectroscopy—Two AFMs were used with similar results: (i) a Nanoscope IIIa Multimode AFM (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a liquid cell and (ii) an Epi-Force Probe from Asylum Research. Sharpened silicon nitride (Si3N4) cantilevers (Park Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA) of nominal spring constant kC = 10 piconewtons (pN)/nm were commonly used, with equivalent results obtained using 30 pN/nm cantilevers. kC was measured for each cantilever using the manufacturer's directions at each temperature, and additional calibrations were performed as described previously (19Carl P. Kwok C.H. Manderson G. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For any one temperature, thousands of surface-to-tip contacts (∼4000) were collected and later analyzed with the aid of a semi-automated, visual analysis program custom written in C++. Because protein-unfolding events are stochastic, and the experiment is intrinsically random in many ways, collecting and analyzing thousands of peaks is necessary to provide an accurate statistical survey of the unfolding possibilities. Initial results at the beginning of an experiment lasting many hours were similar to those obtained at the end of the experiment. Thus nearly all of the data was analyzed. Force-Extension Curves Analysis—AFM-imposed extension of α- or β-spectrin chains, either as pure monomers or as premixed αβ-dimers, generally leads to an asymmetric sawtooth pattern of force peaks (Fig. 2). The ramped portions of the force-extension curves beyond the first peak correspond to the extension of an unfolded domain up to the point where another (still folded) domain in the chain unfolds. The number of peaks in an extension curve, Npk, would seem to reflect predominantly which repeat in the chain the randomly applied AFM tip physisorbs to on contact. Npk thus provides a useful measure of how many domains are subject to extension. The sawtooth patterns here with α-spectrin monomers reproduce and extend our recent findings (1Law R. Carl P.

J. 2003; 84: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) for β-spectrin by frequently showing extra wide intervals between force peaks. These are signatures of tandem repeat unfolding events. The heights of the force peaks with spectrins are invariably found as elsewhere (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W.

Gautel F. Oesterhelt F. Fernandez J.M. Gaub H.E. Science. 1997; 275: 1295-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Lower forces are likely to be indicative of more facile unfolding of proteins in vivo (11Lee J. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3178-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Heterodimer Force-Extension Curves—Lateral heterodimers of α18–21 plus β1–4 contain eight spectrin repeats in total (Fig. 1C). Their force-extension spectrograms are remarkably similar to those of the four-repeat α18–21-spectrin (Fig. 2). The 4-peak spectrograms with one extra wide tandem repeat event yield a similar total unfolding length to the various 5-peak spectrograms with all single repeat events. Histograms of length distributions discussed later will quantitate such results more thoroughly. As tentatively suggested in Fig. 2, the peaks of the heterodimer appear on average to be of almost twice the force as the predominant force peaks of the monomer. This indicates that the two adjacent chains of the heterodimers will unfold synchronously. A more thorough statistical analysis discussed below will again substantiate this assertion. The dimer chains could also split apart during unfolding and display a combination sometimes seen of both large high force peaks (two chains unfolding) and small low force peaks (single chain unfolding); the bottommost spectrograms of Fig. 2 illustrate this. In such cases, the larger peaks almost always occur before the smaller peaks. Such results contrast with findings of Li et al. (20Li H. Oberhauser A. Fowler S. Clarke J. Fernandez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6527-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) for single titin chains of alternating I27 and I28 domains and are discussed in detail later. Total Unfolding Length and Peak Distribution Analysis— Four thousand tip-to-surface contacts were typically performed on α+β-spectrin heterodimers as well as on all of the two- and four-repeat α- and β-spectrin monomer constructs. The total unfolding length and the peak distribution results are summarized in Fig. 3. It is immediately clear that each construct yielded different max(Npk) values. The two- and four-repeat α-monomers, like the two- and four-repeat β-monomers, show a max(Npk) = 4 and 6, respectively (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Such results indicate that the first and last peaks are desorption processes as widely assumed (1Law R.

The results also imply that partial unfolding events are not likely to occur with the spectrin constructs here, which contrasts with the studies of Lenne et al. (10Lenne P.-F. Raae A.J. Altmann S.M. Saraste M. Horber J.K.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) on chicken brain spectrin. The first peak and the force of the last peak were therefore ignored in the analyses and spectrograms with two peaks or less were not cumulated in force (see Fig. 7) and length (see Fig. 5) distributions. Spectrograms of 0–2 peaks accounted for >80% of the data because of the low concentrations of protein dispersed on the substrates in these experiments. As concluded by others (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Shao J-Y. Hochmuth R.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), single molecule experiments must be “designed to fail” more often than succeed to ensure the experiment is a single molecule experiment. Only the few Npk ≥ 3 spectrograms are protein unfolding events, and they ensure that we are operating in the single molecule limit.Fig. 7Histograms of unfolding forces for sawtooth extensions of monomeric α18–21-spectrin, β1–4-spectrin, and α,β-spectrin heterodimer. The bimodal histograms of the monomers were fitted with two gaussian peaks of the same width, and the overall sums of the gaussian peaks are indicated by heavy black lines. Spectrin heterodimer results were fitted with four gaussian peaks. For the first gaussian peak (see Table II) the averages of the major gaussian peaks from the two constituent monomers were used (denoted as F1) along with their averaged width (w) as restricted parameters. For the second gaussian peak, twice the major peak value (2F1) was used. For the third gaussian peak, three times the major peak value (3F1) was used, and the fourth gaussian peak was four times the major peak value (4F1). In contrast to the spectrin heterodimer, the unfolding force distribution for the 2 × 4 repeat α-actinin homodimer can be best fitted with a bimodal gaussian distribution (inset).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Histograms of peak-to-peak unfolding lengths for sawtooth extensions of monomeric α18–21-spectrin and α,β-spectrin heterodimer. For the α-spectrin monomer, the major peaks were fitted with sums of gaussian peaks that reflect proportional contour lengths for single repeats (see Table I). The minor peaks were likewise fitted but with contour lengths of tandem repeats. The spectrin dimer was fitted with two gaussian peaks of the same width (w = 16 nm), which prove similar to those of the monomer (w = 13 nm). The overall sum of all of the gaussian peaks is indicated by the heavy black line; a factor of about two (1.9–2.1) between the major and minor peaks is apparent for all.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For each Npk, Fig. 3B shows the average total unfolding length (±S.D.) as calculated beyond the second peak. Heterodimer results for Npk differ remarkably little from those of the monomers. A few 7-peak extension curves were counted in heterodimer experiments (Fig. 3A) and were not present in monomer results. Except for these few 7-peak heterodimer curves (4 total), all other spectrograms fall within the relevant contour length limits for either two repeats (transition to light gray) or four repeats (transition to dark gray). This finding is certainly consistent with the lack of any higher order spectrin oligomers or aggregates in solution (see “Materials and Methods”). Because the αβ-heterodimer consists of eight repeats, the rare seventh peak might correspond to an infrequent splayed chain as suggested earlier. Splaying is further illustrated in Fig. 3B from the overextension of the Npk = 7 spectrograms beyond the four-repeat contour length limit. The best-fit line through all of the data has a slope that averages both single and tandem events. The linearity of the unfolding length versus Npk plot is remarkable given the large extensions probed and the monomer versus dimer systems studied. Knowing that the length of the four-repeat rod domain of α-actinin is about 25 nm, the unfolding length for these homologous constructs is readily calculated to be up to 6–7-fold longer. Domain unfolding thus visibly modulates extensibility. Spectrin Heterodimer Versus an Eight Repeat in Series Dystrophin Construct—Another spectrin family protein (dystrophin) expressed in separate studies as a construct with eight repeats in series (22Calvert R. Kahana E. Gratzer W. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1605-1610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Kahana E. Flood G. Gratzer W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 36: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) offers an important contrast to the αβ-heterodimer with its eight repeats distributed as 4 in-series between two laterally associated chains. The serial versus lateral difference is most clearly illustrated in a plot of max(Npk) versus the number of repeats (Fig. 4). The max(Npk) = 7 for the spectrin heterodimer clearly departs from the linear trend of slope = 1 for the various monomers of spectrin α and β. The heterodimer result also contrasts with the eight-repeat dystrophin construct in showing a max(Npk) = 9 that is close to the expected max(Npk) = 10. 2R. Law, G. Liao, H. Zhao, L. Sweeney, and D. Discher, manuscript in preparation. Because the Npk distribution is known to decay exponentially (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Carl P. Kwok C.H. Manderson G. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) the likelihood of unfolding all eight serial spectrin repeats in dystrophin (to give 10 peaks) may be statistically too rare to encounter even with >3000 contacts, especially given the increased occurrence of tandem unfolding events (1Law R.

Nonetheless, consistent with the spectrin heterodimer here, an eight-repeat antiparallel actinin homodimer also showed max(Npk) = 7. The difference in max-(Npk) between the construct with eight repeats in series and the two complexes with eight repeats laterally associated clearly indicates a mechanism wherein repeats in both chains of a given dimer will often unfold simultaneously rather than splay apart to a wishbone conformation and then unfold as eight repeats in series. Peak-to-Peak Unfolding Length Distribution Analysis—Histograms of the unfolding lengths between peaks (lpk-pk) for the four-repeat α-spectrin monomer and the spectrin heterodimer are shown in Fig. 5. The distributions do not appear significantly dependent on the number of peaks in an extension curve, which seems consistent with a random desorption process. Both the monomer and heterodimer histograms appear bimodal with principal means differing by a factor of 2 (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Law R. Liao G. Harper S. Yang G. Speicher D. Discher D. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3286-3293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For α-spectrin, each peak is composed of four gaussian curves whose means reflect known proportions for domain contour lengths of the constructs (see Table I). The spectrin heterodimer was fitted with just two gaussian curves of the same width (w), which proved to be similar to those of the monomer. The averages of the major peaks range from 22 to 27 nm, including results for β1–4-spectrin (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Law R. Liao G. Harper S. Yang G. Speicher D. Discher D. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3286-3293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Lenne et al. (10Lenne P.-F. Raae A.J. Altmann S.M. Saraste M. Horber J.K.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) found a similar length for a 4-mer of a single spectrin repeat flexibly linked in series. Data for actinin homodimer appear similar to that for the spectrin heterodimer, showing a bimodal distribution with a factor of ∼2.0 between the mean for the major and minor peaks (data not shown). Because the major peaks in the unfolding distributions correspond to unfolding a single repeat, the freely fitted factor of 2.0 in mean length between the first and second peaks provides a strong indication of the unfolding of a tandem pair of in-series repeats as proposed in Fig. 1. Consistent with this interpretation, the Npk = 6 subhistogram for the α-monomer shows that the vast majority (90%) of the lpk-pk fall within the major envelope of single repeat unfolding events; Npk = 6 thus corresponds to four single repeat events plus initial and final desorption events. The few events outside of the single repeat envelope evidently reflect overextension of the cumulated slack that develops toward the end of a long extension before final desorption terminates the spectrogram (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The same observation also applies to the αβ-heterodimer. Because the lengths of the three helices composing each repeat are known from crystal structures to be 4–5 nm long or 12–15 nm/repeat, the single repeat unfolding lengths measured as 21–27 nm must involve some helix unwinding but are still much less than the ∼40 nm contour lengths of each repeat. This indicates that an unfolded repeat is not completely stretched before the unfolding of the next domain occurs. The implicit solvent molecular dynamics of Paci and Karplus (25Paci E. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) indeed suggest that helices can persist in unfolding as sketched in Fig. 1. Such a result is consistent with both broader distributions and lower forces for unfolding spectrin in comparison, for example, to titin whose unfolding lengths approach domain contour lengths at 5–10-fold higher forces. In this context, the fact that the αβ-heterodimer here gives longer peak-to-peak lengths (27 and 54 nm) than the constituent monomers suggests higher forces are likely involved in unfolding with dimer, as shown below. Tandem Repeat Unfolding Events—The frequency of tandem repeat unfolding events in the αβ-heterodimer is visibly lower relative to single repeat events. The spectrin heterodimer shows the fewest tandem events as a percentage of total events, just 20% for heterodimer (area under 54.1 nm peak) compared with 40% (48.2 nm peak) for the α-monomer. This suggests that tandem unfolding does not propagate as well in two laterally associated heterodimer chains compared with a single chain. Unfolding Force Distributions Reveal Spectrin Heterodimers—Force distributions for unfolding monomers also appear bimodal with gaussian means differing again by a factor of ∼2, but scatterplots are critical to first clarifying the mechanisms of unfolding. By pairing a given unfolding length with the appropriate unfolding force, a scatterplot (Fig. 6) demonstrates that factors of 2 in force for α- and β-monomers (Fig. 7, F1 and F2) reflect pulling on one chain versus two (or perhaps a loop in one chain). For the heterodimer, the force distribution (Fig. 7) is considerably broader, more multi-peaked, and shifted to relatively higher forces than the force distributions of the monomers. Four distinct peaks are suggested for the heterodimer, indicative of four different unfolding processes. The monomer results with F1 ≈ 27 pN were used in fitting with four gaussian curves centered at iF1 (i ∈ integer). For the second gaussian, two times the major peak value (2F1) was used and so on. The average width (w) was also parameter-restricted to be close to the average widths of the monomers. Only the relative amplitude of each peak was varied in the fitting of duplicate experiments (Table II). Such a fitting seems to capture the four distinct peaks extremely well compared with freely fitting the data with four gaussian curves. In contrast to the spectrin heterodimer, the unfolding force distribution for the α-actinin homodimer fits best with a bimodal gaussian distribution. Unfortunately, the α-actinin monomer quickly associates into a homodimer, making unfolding studies on the monomer impossible. No comparison of forces for the actinin monomer to forces for the actinin dimer can therefore be made. Perhaps future mutants of a non-dimerizing but folded α-actinin will make such studies possible.Table IIForce histogram gaussian parameters for spectrin heterodimers The force and amplitude from the four gaussian curves represent the unfolding properties for single, two, three, and four monomer chains.PeakForceAmplitudepN F1: single chain2736.2 ± 1.82F1: two chains5431.1 ± 1.83F1: three chains8118.6 ± 1.74F1: four chains1088.1 ± 1.7 Open table in a new tab Heterodimer Unfolding Pathways—First, just as unfolding two independent chains is inevitable in monomeric spectrin studies (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), pulling on two heterodimers is also to be expected and seems apparent from the third and fourth gaussian peaks. The multimodal fit indicates multiple pathways of unfolding. The 27-pN peak reflects the unfolding of a single chain in the dimer as it dissociates from its partner. The force needed to unfold such repeats in a single chain is remarkably unaffected by the adjacent chain. Such scenarios are possible but certainly not at the exclusion of also frequently unfolding both chains of the heterodimer to give the second gaussian peak. The minimal influence of the two chains on unfolding in each may again seem surprising but is consistent with the first peak. This may be overly simplified, because the force needed to split apart the heterodimer interaction may be incorporated in the first peak that is skewed beyond the gaussian fit of 27 pN. Freely fitting the force histogram of the heterodimer yields a first gaussian peak at 31 pN (not shown). The difference of 4 pN from the free fit and the forced fit (from monomer components) could be the small shearing force needed to split the dimer apart during unfolding. Accounting for both processes plus their two-chain counterparts would certainly tend to broaden the cumulated force distributions as found. All of the further heterodimer unfolding scenarios are presented in Fig. 8. The frequency of each scenario can be estimated using results from the α- and β-monomers. The force distributions for both α- and β-monomers displayed about ∼70% single-chain and ∼30% double-chain unfolding events (Fig. 6, lower versus upper quadrants). Assuming that experiments on the heterodimer has the same one-versus two-chain frequency and using the respective gaussian heights in Table II, one can readily calculate the frequencies for all of the unfolding scenarios sketched. Note that in the second dimer gaussian peak of Fig. 7, 2F1 is composed of unfolding (i) two chains within the same dimer and also (ii) two single chains from two distinct heterodimers. From the calculations summarized in Fig. 8, the first scenario (i) appears to be much more frequent (31%) compare with the latter (ii) scenario (2%). Similarly, unfolding possibilities from three or more unassociated dimers are probably too insignificant to consider relative to the high frequency of the unfolding of one or two dimers. Based on the overall statistics of Fig. 8 for pulling on one dimer, we conclude that there is an almost equal probability of the AFM tip unfolding a single chain (55%) within a dimer as there is of unfolding both chains (45%) within a dimer (Fig. 9). Recalling that the α20–21/β1–2 lateral interaction is much stronger than that of α18–19/β3–4, this strong versus weak association within the dimer complex explains why a single chain unfolds just as frequently as both chains when the AFM tip has an equal possibility of attaching to either end of the heterodimer. Attaching to the weaker end will result in the unfolding of single chains, whereas attaching to the stronger end will result in the simultaneous unfolding of both chains within the dimer. This is not the case for the α-actinin homodimer, which has the same affinity throughout its laterally associated chain. In addition to its more homogenous inter-chain affinity, the association constant of α-actinin is much greater compared with the spectrin heterodimer, consistent with the bimodal distribution for unfolding force in Fig. 7. The two chains of the heterodimer may come apart during unfolding, because dimeric interactions rely heavily on complementary electrostatic interactions within the triple-helical dimer interface (13Begg G.E. Harper S. Morris M. Speicher D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3279-3287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These might be easily severed with modest shearing force well below that experienced at the molecular level by the red cell in the circulation (26An X. Lecomte M.C. Chasis J. Mohandas N. Gratzer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31796-31800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the splaying of dimers can also occur partway through the unfolding process such that both chains may initially unfold together synchronously, then one chain may split off and continue to unfold, whereas the other partially folded chain remains folded. This raises the question as to how spectrin or related proteins are stressed in situ (Fig. 9B). In both erythroid and non-erythroid systems, the N-terminal CH-domains of β-spectrin bind actin (27Broderick M. Winder S. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and β-spectrin can also bind protein 4.1 into a highly stable ternary complex with F-actin (24Gimm J. An X. Nunomura W. Mohandas N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7275-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The EF-hands of α-spectrin might also enter into this complex (27Broderick M. Winder S. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and effectively supplement the stress-sharing because of the strong lateral interaction between α21 and β1 repeats. When F-actin junctional complexes are separated, the αβ-tetramer that interconnects two adjacent complexes will be stressed by a force, F, that will generally be divided by the α- and β-chains. As the force increases in time to F ∼ F1, fluctuations may make the division of force so unequal that one repeat in one of the chains will unfold (i). The slack in that chain will almost immediately lead to a load transfer to the antiparallel chain and cause unfolding in it (1Law R. Carl P. Harper S. Dalhaimer P. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). If F is divided more equally between the two chains of a spectrin tetramer, then the force could increase to F = 2F1 and unfold laterally adjacent repeats that might or might not be in registry (ii). Of course, only the actin-binding ends of the spectrin heterodimer associate laterally with any high affinity. Even so, the expectation is that scenario (i) is more frequent than (ii) in cells, and a hint of that emerges in the in vitro results (Fig. 9A). Conclusion—The extensible unfolding of monomeric versus heterodimeric spectrin is compared here by AFM. The results demonstrate that the two chains in the heterodimer could either stay intact and unfold simultaneously or splay apart and unfold as a single chain, because little force is needed to sever at least some heterodimeric interactions given the strong versus weak ends of the heterodimer complex. The basic method used here was to fit force distributions for heterodimers based on the separate results for the component monomers. Comparisons reveal various dimer unfolding scenarios as well as frequencies of occurrence. From these statistics, both chains within the dimer unfold just as frequently as a single chain within the dimer unfolds at half the force as the two chains. The results thus suggest that, in contrast to cooperativity in tandem repeat unfolding, lateral interactions do not strongly facilitate or oppose single-repeat unfolding processes in spectrin heterodimer extension.

Of the four characterized Id proteins, only Id2 is found in the nucleus of Sertoli cells that support the development of spermatozoa in the testis. Differential display analysis of rat primary Sertoli cell mRNA identified Id2 as being inducible by forskolin, a stimulator of cAMP production. Northern blot analysis confirmed that Id2 mRNA expression peaked in Sertoli cells 6–12 h after stimulation with forskolin or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), the major physiological stimulator of cAMP in Sertoli cells. Similarly, Id2 promoter activity in Sertoli cells was induced after forskolin or FSH stimulation as well as by overexpression of protein kinase A. Forskolin induction of the Id2 promoter required sequences located between positions -122 and -82. Protein(s) of 40–45 kDa were found to bind two activated transcription factor/cAMP-response element-like sites and a GATA motif within the regulatory region. The induction of the Id2 gene by FSH corresponded with a decrease in protein binding to an E-box consensus motif and decreased E-box-mediated transcription. Together, these findings raise the possibility that FSH-mediated induction of Id2 and resultant inhibition of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor-regulated genes in Sertoli cells may contribute to the regulation of spermatogenesis. Id (inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation) proteins repress differentiation and promote cell division by dimerizing with and inhibiting the action of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors including those that bind to E-box motifs. Of the four characterized Id proteins, only Id2 is found in the nucleus of Sertoli cells that support the development of spermatozoa in the testis. Differential display analysis of rat primary Sertoli cell mRNA identified Id2 as being inducible by forskolin, a stimulator of cAMP production. Northern blot analysis confirmed that Id2 mRNA expression peaked in Sertoli cells 6–12 h after stimulation with forskolin or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), the major physiological stimulator of cAMP in Sertoli cells. Similarly, Id2 promoter activity in Sertoli cells was induced after forskolin or FSH stimulation as well as by overexpression of protein kinase A. Forskolin induction of the Id2 promoter required sequences located between positions -122 and -82. Protein(s) of 40–45 kDa were found to bind two activated transcription factor/cAMP-response element-like sites and a GATA motif within the regulatory region. The induction of the Id2 gene by FSH corresponded with a decrease in protein binding to an E-box consensus motif and decreased E-box-mediated transcription. Together, these findings raise the possibility that FSH-mediated induction of Id2 and resultant inhibition of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor-regulated genes in Sertoli cells may contribute to the regulation of spermatogenesis. The development of spermatozoa within the testis requires specialized hormonal inputs and precise temporal control of gene expression.

Knobil E. Neil J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 1363-1434Google Scholar). Both hormones act on Sertoli cells to modulate cell processes and gene expression patterns that are required to support developing germ cells. FSH and testosterone actions are transduced through specific receptors present on the cell surface (FSH receptor) or within the cell (androgen receptor). Therefore, the proper expression of receptors for FSH and testosterone in Sertoli cells is essential for the process of spermatogenesis. Recently, transcription of the FSH receptor and androgen receptor genes was shown to be regulated by members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors (2Goetz T.L. Lloyd T.L. Griswold M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33317-33324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 3Takane K.K. McPhaul M.J. Mol. Cell.

Sawadago M. Daggert M.A.F. Chen J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1836-1848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). bHLH proteins are part of a larger group of HLH proteins that share an HLH structural domain (two amphipathic helices separated by a loop) that is required for dimerization with other HLH proteins (6Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Adjacent to the HLH domain, bHLH proteins contain a basic region of amino acids that is required to bind DNA. bHLH proteins bind as dimers to DNA sequences in gene promoters sharing the core hexanucleotide sequence CANNTG called an E-box (6Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Two broad functional groups of bHLH proteins have been defined by their pattern of expression. Class A bHLH proteins are expressed in most tissues, whereas the expression of class B members is tissue-specific. In general, cell type-specific bHLH proteins form dimers with ubiquitously expressed bHLH proteins. One major consequence of bHLH protein expression is the activation of genes required for the differentiation of tissues during development as well as the maintenance of normal physiological differentiation (7Massari M. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). For example, the differentiation processes of neurogenesis, myogenesis, and hematopoiesis as well as pancreatic development require bHLH proteins (reviewed in Ref. 7Massari M. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Furthermore, bHLH proteins are thought to be required for testicular development and Sertoli cell differentiation (8Chaudhary J. Cupp A.S. Skinner M.K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Chaudhary J. Skinner M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 774-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A subset of HLH proteins called inhibitors of DNA binding/differentiation or Id proteins represses the actions of bHLH transcription factors. Id proteins contain the helix-loop-helix region required for dimerization but lack the basic DNA binding domain. Therefore, Id proteins act as dominant negative repressors of transcription by dimerizing with and sequestering the ubiquitously expressed class A E-box HLH proteins (10Sun X.H. Copeland N.A. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), and in some cases, class B (tissue-specific) HLH proteins (11Langlands K. Yin X. Anand G. Prochownik E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19785-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Four subtypes of Id proteins have been characterized in mammalian cells, Id1, Id2, Id3, and Id4 (11Langlands K. Yin X. Anand G. Prochownik E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19785-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 12Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar, 14Christy B.A. Sanders L.K. Lau L.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1815-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 15Riechman V. van Cruchten I. Sablitzky F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 215-221Google Scholar). In an immunohistochemical analysis of adult mouse testis, Id1, Id2, and Id4 were observed to be expressed in germ cells at various specific stages of development (16Sabilitzky F. Moore A. Bromley M. Deed R.W. Newton J.S. Norton J.D. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 1015-1024PubMed Google Scholar). In this same study, Id3 was identified in the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells, whereas Id2 was the only Id protein detected in the nuclei of Sertoli cells. A more recent study detected all four Id mRNAs and proteins in primary Sertoli cells isolated from 20-day-old rats (17Chaudhary J. Johnson J. Kim G. Skinner M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the cellular localization of the proteins was not investigated, Id2 and Id3 expression levels were found to be higher than Id1 and Id4. Based on these available data, Id2 is likely the major Id protein regulating transcription in Sertoli cells. Overexpression of Id proteins in Sertoli cells has been shown to activate the E-box-regulated transferrin gene promoter (17Chaudhary J. Johnson J. Kim G. Skinner M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and inhibit the c-Fos and FSH receptor promoters through E-box motifs (2Goetz T.L. Lloyd T.L. Griswold M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33317-33324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Chaudhary J. Skinner M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 774-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of Id2 for Sertoli cell function and germ cell development is highlighted by the finding that Id2 null mice display defective spermatogenesis (18Norton J.D. J. Cell Science. 2000; 113: 3897-3905PubMed Google Scholar) in addition to retarded growth and neonatal morbidity (19Yokota Y. Mansouri A. Sugawara S. Adechi S. Nishikawa S.-I. Gruss P. Nature. 1999; 397: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence demonstrating that Id2 mRNA expression is transiently induced by the cAMP-elevating agents forskolin and FSH in Sertoli cells. We also show that the Id2 promoter is induced by forskolin, cAMP, or protein kinase A through a motif located 120 to 82 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This region is shown to bind proteins of 41 and 45 kDa. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of nuclear protein binding to E-box motifs corresponds to the induction of Id2 by FSH and that FSH induction of E-box-mediated transcription is delayed until Id2 levels decrease. These studies suggest that FSH-mediated induction of Id2 expression may be important for modulating the expression of Sertoli cell genes that are required to support spermatogenesis. Isolation of Primary Sertoli Cells and Cell Culture—Sertoli cells were isolated from 16-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (20Delfino F.J. Walker W.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Decapsulated testes were digested with collagenase (0.5 mg/ml, 33 °C, 12 min) in enriched Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium followed by three washes in enriched Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium (1 × g, 3 min) to isolate seminiferous tubules. Tubules were digested with trypsin (0.5 mg/ml, 33 °C, 12 min), and cell aggregates were passed repeatedly through a drawn-out Pasteur pipette. An equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added to the Sertoli cells, which were then pelleted (100 × g, 5 min) and resuspended in serum-free medium containing 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Ham's F12, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 10-6m retinoic acid, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 3 μg/ml cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Sertoli cells were cultured on matrigel (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA)-coated dishes (32 °C, 5% CO2). Sertoli cells were routinely >95% pure as determined by phase microscopy and alkaline phosphatase staining. The mouse-derived Sertoli cell line MSC-1, which lacks FSH receptors (21McGuinness M. Linder C.C. Morales C.R. Heckert L.L. Pikus J. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Animals used in these studies were maintained and sacrificed according to the principles and procedures described in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. These studies were approved by the University of Pittsburgh IACUC committee. Differential Display—Sertoli cells were either untreated or treated with forskolin (10 μm) and 3-isobutyl-1methylxanthine (IBMX) (0.5 mm) for 2 or 12 h, and extracted total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription and PCR amplification using the RNA image kit (GenHunter, Brookline, MA). Briefly, total RNA was incubated with reverse transcriptase and T11 primer having a G, A, or C 1-bp anchor at the 3′ end to produce cDNAs. The cDNAs were amplified in the presence of [α-33P]dATP using a random 5′ primer and a 3′-oligonucleotide primer “clamped” to the 5′ end of the cDNA poly(A) tail. Amplified cDNAs were fractionated on 6% sequencing gels, and cDNAs that were reproducibly modulated by forskolin treatment were isolated from the gel and amplified again. Using three separate 3′ primers and one 5′ primer, ∼20 regulated cDNAs were identified. The cDNAs that were induced by forskolin were isolated and sequenced. Northern Analysis—Primary Sertoli cells from 16-day-old rats were stimulated with either ovine FSH (100 ng/ml) plus IBMX (0.5 mm) or forskolin (10 μm) plus IBMX for 2, 6, 12, or 24 h. RNA was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62896) Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, RNA (20 μg) was fractionated on formaldehyde gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Micron Separations, Westboro, MA), and probed with a cDNA fragment including the entire murine Id2 coding region (kindly provided by Dr. Edward Prochownik, Children's Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with ribosome S16 cDNA. Autoradiograph data were digitized using a flatbed scanner, and relative hybridization levels were determined using NIH image version 1.6 software. Reporter Plasmid Constructs, Transient Transfections, and CAT Assays—The Id2CAT reporter plasmids obtained from Dr. Larry Kedes (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) contain regions of the human Id2 promoter extending upstream from position +30 as indicated (23Kurabatashi M. Dutta S. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6386-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). κBTATACAT contains the two tandem κB enhancer elements from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat linked to the albumen gene TATA element (24Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The MSC-1 Sertoli cell line and primary Sertoli cell cultures in 35-mm2 dishes were transfected using FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary Sertoli cells and MSC-1 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg of expression vector. The -834Id2CAT or κBTATACAT reporter plasmids were cotransfected with empty expression vector or pRSVCAT-β that expresses the Cβ catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (25Maurer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were exposed to vehicle, ovine FSH (100 ng/ml), or forskolin (10 μm) plus IBMX (0.5 mm) for 24 h. Studies of the -834, -180, -152, -132, -122, and -82 Id2CAT promoter constructs were performed in the presence of forskolin plus IBMX or vehicle. The E-box luciferase reporter contains two consensus E-box motifs upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter driving the luciferase gene. Assays for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and luciferase activity were performed 72 h after transfection. For CAT assays, cell lysates were incubated with fluorescent BODIPY chloramphenicol (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting products were separated by thin layer chromatography, and the levels of acetylated products were quantified using a Fluorimager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase assays were performed as described (26Delfino F.J. Walker W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35607-35613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). CAT and luciferase activities were normalized for total protein as determined by Bradford assay. DNA-Protein Binding Studies—32P-radiolabeled DNA probes were generated by annealing nucleotide templates containing Id2 promoter sequences to complementary 10-base primers. The overhangs were filled in with Klenow in the presence of [α-32P]dATP and 5 mm dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. The probes used and their coding strand template sequences included Id2 -120 to -78 (5′-AATGGAAGCGCCCGCTCGTCTTGATAGACGTGCCACCTTCCGC-3′), Id2 -120 to -78 ATF mt (5′-AATGGAAGCGCCCGGGCGTCTTGATCCACGTGCCACCTTCCGC-3′), E-box (5′-TATTTAACACCCCAGCTGGGCTCGCGCCCCG-3′), and consensus CRE (5′-GATCCGGCTGACGTCATGAAGCTAGATC-3′). Mutated nucleotides are underlined. In addition, 13 Id2 -120 to -78 probes were synthesized having sequential 2-bp transversion mutations incorporated from positions -108 to -83. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described (27Ballard D.W. Walker W.H. Doerre S. Sista P. Molitor J.A. Dixon E.P. Peffer N.J. Hannink M. Greene W.C. Cell. 1990; 63: 803-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-labeled probes were incubated with 2–5 μg of nuclear extracts prepared from untreated 16-day rat primary Sertoli cell cultures as described previously (20Delfino F.J. Walker W.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In some cases, EMSA assays employed NF-κB p50 or CREB proteins prepared by coupled in vitro transcription-translation (28Walker W.H. Girardet C. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20145-21050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50–100 mm NaCl or KCl, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EDTA. For competition EMSAs, a 10–50-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides including the Id2 -120 to -78 region, the consensus CRE motif, the E-box probe, the -144 to -119 region of the CREB promoter (5′-CTGGGAGAAGCGGAGTGTTGGTGAGT-3′), or the -152 to -120 region of the Id2 promoter (5′-GGAAGAACCAAGCCCACGCCCCGCGCCCGCGCCCACC-3′) were co-incubated with labeled Id2 -120 to -78 probe and nuclear extracts. DNA-protein complexes were resolved via 5% PAGE under non-denaturing conditions in a Tris borate/EDTA buffer. For comparing protein binding affinities of various probes, labeled probes with similar specific activities (±20%) were used in simultaneous reactions. DNA-protein cross-linking studies were performed with radiolabeled probes prepared as described above except that labeling reactions contained a 1:1 mixture of bromodeoxyuridine and dTTP, and binding reactions were scaled up 10-fold. The resolved DNA-protein complexes were exposed to UV light (302 nm) for 15 min in situ and then excised from PAGE gels. The gel pieces were inserted into the wells of SDS-PAGE gels and fractionated. DNA-protein complex formation was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using NIH Image 1.6 software analysis of digitized images. Identification of Forskolin-stimulated mRNAs in Sertoli Cells—To identify candidate genes that are induced by FSH and cAMP in the testis, primary rat Sertoli cells were stimulated with forskolin, an inducer of adenylate cyclase, in conjunction with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. A limited differential display analysis of gene expression was performed on RNA collected after 12 h of stimulation. From three experiments, a total of 20 mRNAs were found to be induced, and 6 were sequenced. Two of the partial transcripts did not match sequences present in the GenBank™, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), or Swiss-Protein data bases. The unique cDNAs are the subject of another study. Four other transcripts were identified by DNA sequence analysis. These included 1) ATP synthase lipid-binding protein, 2) S-100b (an EF-hand calcium-binding protein), 3) non-muscle myosin alkali light chain, and 4) Id2. Of the identified forskolin-induced cDNAs, the HLH protein Id2 was chosen for further study because of the possibility that Id2 may be a regulator of FSH-mediated gene transcription in Sertoli cells. Forskolin or FSH Enhance Id2 Gene Expression—To confirm that Id2 gene expression was stimulated by forskolin, Northern blotting experiments were performed using mRNA isolated from primary rat Sertoli cells stimulated with forskolin and IBMX. In agreement with earlier studies demonstrating that Id2 probes do not cross-hybridize with other Id mRNAs (17Chaudhary J. Johnson J. Kim G. Skinner M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Nagata Y. Todokoro K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), only a single Id2 transcript was detected. In primary Sertoli cells, Id2 levels rose 2 h after forskolin stimulation, peaked at 6–12 h, and fell to near basal levels by 24 h (Fig. 1). To determine whether the major physiological inducer of cAMP in Sertoli cells, FSH, could also induce the Id2 gene, FSH and IBMX were added to primary Sertoli cells for 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. Although the peak of Id2 mRNA induction was delayed, the pattern of Id2 induction by FSH was similar to that seen for forskolin. The Id2 Promoter Is Induced by Forskolin—Transient transfection studies were performed to determine whether the forskolin-mediated induction of Id2 mRNA was due to increased transcription initiation from the Id2 promoter. Primary Sertoli cells were transfected with the -834Id2CAT (30Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) reporter plasmid containing 834 bp of the Id2 promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene. The -834Id2 promoter was induced 3.3- and 2.8-fold by forskolin and FSH, respectively (Fig. 2A). Cotransfection of a vector expressing the catalytic subunit of PKA also stimulated the Id2 promoter (4.4-fold). In studies employing the MSC-1 mouse Sertoli cell line that does not express FSH receptors (21McGuinness M. Linder C.C. Morales C.R. Heckert L.L. Pikus J. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA also induced the -834Id2 promoter (19.0-fold)(Fig. 2B). Transcription from a control reporter plasmid (κBTATACAT) having the CAT gene driven by a TATA box and two κB enhancer motifs (24Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) was not altered by forskolin, FSH, or PKA. Together, these data suggest that the induction of Id2 mRNA by forskolin and FSH is due to stimulation of the Id2 promoter via PKA. The -122 to -82 Region of the Id2 Promoter Contains a cAMP-inducible Element—To localize the regions of the Id2 promoter that are required for basal and forskolin-inducible activity, primary Sertoli cells and the MSC-1 Sertoli cell line were transfected with CAT reporter plasmids containing various Id2 promoter deletion mutants (30Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Compared with the full-length -834Id2 promoter, removal of sequences upstream of -180 and -152 increased promoter basal activity (1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, for primary Sertoli cells (Fig. 3A) and 2.7- and 4.4-fold, respectively, for MSC-1 cells (Fig. 3B)). Further deletion of the Id2 promoter to positions -132, -122, and -82 sequentially diminished basal activity to 1.4-, 0.8-, and 0.4-fold in primary Sertoli cells and 1.2-, 0.4-, and 0.2-fold in MSC-1 cells relative to the -834 promoter fragment. Forskolin stimulation of primary and MSC-1 Sertoli cells for 24 h resulted in the induction for all Id2 promoter constructs except for -82 Id2CAT. Deletion to position -82 abolished forskolin induction of the Id2 promoter in primary or MSC-1 Sertoli cells. Together, these findings suggest that multiple sequences between positions -152 and -82 contribute to basal Id2 promoter activity, but the -122 to -82 region is required for forskolin induction of the Id2 promoter. These data are consistent with a previous study in glioma cells that identified a serum- and forskolin-inducible region in the Id2 promoter downstream of position -177 (31Biggs J.R. Zhang Y. Murphy E.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The -120 to -78 Region of the Id2 Promoter Binds Proteins of 41–45 kDa—We next investigated potential DNA-binding proteins that might be responsible for forskolin induction of the Id2 promoter through the -122 to -82 region. EMSA analysis of Sertoli cell nuclear extracts identified a triplet of DNA-protein complexes that were formed with a probe extending from positions -120 to -78 (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Competition studies revealed that a 50-fold excess of unlabeled -120 to -78 probe or a probe containing a consensus CRE competed for protein binding to the labeled probe (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–3). In contrast, competing probes containing an E-box motif, a region of the CREB promoter, or the -152 to -122 region of the Id2 promoter did not inhibit formation of the DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6). Additional competition studies using a range of 10–50-fold excess of unlabeled -120 to -78 or consensus CRE probes confirmed that these two sequences compete for binding with the labeled -120 to -78 probe but that the CRE motif was a less effective competitor (Fig. 4B). Previous studies of the Id2 promoter described two ATF/CRE-like motifs within the -120 to -78 region that contribute to promoter activity in C2 myoblasts but not HeLa cells (30Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). EMSA studies were performed to compare Sertoli nuclear extract binding to a probe containing wild-type -120 to -78 sequences and a probe in which the ATF/CRE-like sequences were mutated. These studies demonstrated that the ATF/CRE-like sites are required to bind Sertoli nuclear proteins (Fig. 5A). The competition observed using the consensus CRE probe and the dependence on an ATF/CRE-like motif for protein interactions raised the possibility that the binding complex contained a member of the CREB-ATF family of proteins. However, incubation of the -120 to -78 probe with an excess of CREB protein produced by in vitro translation did not result in a DNA-protein complex, whereas the CREB protein did form a complex with a consensus CRE probe (Fig. 5B). As expected, in vitro translated NF-κB p50 protein did not bind to the CRE or the -120 to -78 probe. These results suggest that CREB is not present in the complex binding to the Id2 ATF/CRE-like site. To determine the relative molecular weight of the proteins binding to the -120 to -78 region, UV cross-linking analysis was performed using a photoreactive probe (Fig. 5C). Two DNA-protein complexes of 46 and 50 kDa were resolved. Formation of the DNA-protein adducts was increased after stimulation with forskolin for 24 h, suggesting that elevated cAMP levels may induce the expression of the proteins binding to the -120 to -78 region of the Id2 promoter or increase their affinity for the regulatory region. Because the probe contributes ∼5 kDa to the complex (32Moliter J.A. Walker W.H. Doerre S. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10028-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), the proteins binding to the -120 to -78 region of the Id2 promoter are estimated to be 41 and 45 kDa. To localize the binding sites for Sertoli cell nuclear proteins binding to the -120 to -78 region of the Id2 promoter, a series of probes were synthesized having 2 bp mutations in the ATF/CRE-like and flanking regions. This strategy determined that the fastest migrating DNA-protein complex required the sequence 5′-CTCGTC-3′ (-106 to -101) for binding (Fig. 5D), which corresponds to the upstream ATF/CRE-like sequence identified previously (23Kurabatashi M. Dutta S. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6386-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The two slower migrating complexes were formed due to proteins binding to the sequence 5′-GATAGACGTG-3′ (-98 to -89), which contains a consensus"
https://openalex.org/W2041943150,"We reported previously that E-box and TATA-like elements repress human xanthine oxidoreductase gene (hXOR) expression. In the present investigation, we determined the means by which the E-box site functions in this basal repression. DNA affinity purification demonstrated that at least five proteins are involved in the nuclear protein complex binding to the E-box and adjacent Ku86-binding sites. Amino acid sequence analysis demonstrated that three proteins, DNA-PK catalytic subunit, Ku86, and Ku70 are components of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). By electrophoretic mobility shift assays, gel-shift, and site-directed mutagenesis, we confirmed Ku86 binding to the Ku86 site. Studies indicated that the other two proteins of the complex are AREB6-like proteins binding to the E-box. Pull-down and immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated the binding of Ku86 to AREB6-like proteins. The functional loss of Ku86 increases hXOR promoter activity and transcript expression. Based on the findings, we propose that DNA-PK/AREB6-like proteins play a central role in repression of basal hXOR activity. AREB6-like proteins specifically bind to the E-box, whereas Ku86 binds an adjacent site and recruits DNA-PK catalytic subunit and Ku70 proteins. A working model is presented to account for the role of DNA-PK and AREB6-like proteins in regulating hXOR activity.

Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) 1The abbreviations used are: XOR, xanthine oxidoreductase; hXOR, human xanthine oxidoreductase gene; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ROS, reactive oxygen species. (EC 1.1.3.22), a member of molybdoflavoprotein hydroxylases, is a homodimer with each subunit of about 150 kDa containing four redox active centers: two iron-sulfur, one FAD, and one molybdopterin (1Massey V.

Xanthine dehydrogenase transfers the reducing equivalents generated by the oxidation of substrates to NAD+, whereas XO transfers them to oxygen, with the resultant production of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. As the rate-limiting enzyme in nucleic acid degradation, XOR catalyzes the final two reactions of purine catabolism, with the resultant production of urate. More than just a rate-limiting enzyme in purine degradation, XOR plays important roles in physiological and pathological conditions as a producer of both urate and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Urate, which scavenges hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, hypochlorous acid, oxyheme oxidants, and hydroperoxyl radicals and is a potent iron chelator (4Ames B.N. Cathcart R. Schwiers E. Hochstein P.

Blood urate concentrations are ∼10-fold higher in humans and most primates than in other mammals because of the evolutionary loss of uricase. Urate functioning as an antioxidant has been cited as a possible basis for the relative increase in life span and the decrease in cancer rates of humans compared with other species (4Ames B.N. Cathcart R. Schwiers E. Hochstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6858-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2343) Google Scholar). The high concentrations, however, predispose to crystalline deposition, the histopathologic hallmark of gout, the “king of diseases.” In Western industrialized countries, ∼5% of the population has hyperuricaemia (10Slot O. Ugeskr Laeger. 1994; 156: 23960-24001Google Scholar). In contrast to the role of urate as a protective antioxidant, XOR-derived superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide lead to oxidative tissue injury in a variety of animal models that simulate several clinical disorders, including renal failure, endotoxin-induced mucosal injury, viral pneumonia, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and cutaneous photosensitivity to hematoporphyrins (11Diamond J.R.

In addition, the XOR-derived ROS may contribute to the regulation of physiological functions as inducers of signal transduction and gene transcription (23Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T.

It has been demonstrated that XOR enzyme activity is 100 times lower in humans than that in nonprimate species, including rats and mice (27Wajner M. Harkness R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 991: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Muxfeldt M. Schaper W. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1987; 82: 486-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29Abadeh S. Killacky J. Benboubetra M. Harrison R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that the results obtained from the nonprimate species cannot be simply extrapolated to humans. To understand the physiological and pathophysiological role of XOR in humans, it is important to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of its expression. To date, little is known regarding the regulation of human XOR, although post-translational mechanisms seem to partially explain the low activity (30Harrison R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Sanders S. Eisenthal R.S. Harrison R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, we cloned human XOR (hXOR) and characterized its chromosomal location, genomic organization, and basal transcriptional regulation (32Xu P. Huechsteadt T.P. Harrison R. Hoidal J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 199: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33Xu P. Zhu X.L. Huecksteadt T.P. Brothman A. Hoidal J.R.

Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the basal expression of hXOR is restricted by a repressive mechanism involving E-box and TATA-like elements (35Xu P. Lavallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We also identified a conjunct consensus GTTTC located 19-bp upstream of the E-box that, in the human 70-kDa heat-shock gene promoter, is required for repressive function of the E-box (36Ikeda K. Kawakami K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a Ku86 binding site (GAGAAA) immediately upstream of the E-box. The Ku86 protein is an important component of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) that participates in repair of damaged DNA and phosphorylation of transcription factors (37Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 38Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. Giffin W. Kochan J.C. Ngsee J.K. Traykova-Andonova M. Hache R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16848-16856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated the basis for the E-box/Ku86 repression of hXOR. Cell Culture—PFSK-1 cells, a neural cell line obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.0 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. V79–4 and XR-V15B cells were cultured according to ATCC recommendations. V79–4 cells are a fibroblast cell line derived from Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts. XR-V15B cells are Ku86-deficient V79–4 cells resulting from the internal in-frame deletion of 46 amino acids generated by ethylnitrosourea-mutagenesis (39Zdzienicka M.Z. Tran Q. van der Schans G.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 41Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the extracts were determined spectroscopically using Bio-Rad protein reagents. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSA were employed to study the binding of nuclear or AREB6 proteins to DNA probes (34Xu P. Huecksteadt T.P. Hoidal J.R. Genomics. 1994; 34: 173-180Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Xu P. Lavallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In EMSA, DNA probes EG (wild-type), 3× EG (three repeats of EG), EGm (mutant GTTTC), and EmGm (combined mutant E-box and GTTTC) were used as binding probes, whereas EG (specific), EmG (mutant E-box), Kum1 and Kum2 (mutants of the Ku86 binding site) were used as competitors, as illustrated in Fig. 1A. For gel-shift assays using nuclear extracts, 15–30 fmol of labeled binding probes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 5–10 μg of nuclear proteins in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 4% glycerol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 25 μg of bovine serum albumin plus 3 μg of poly[d(I-C)] or poly[d(A-T)] to reduce nonspecific binding. For competition studies, the samples were pre-incubated with unlabeled competitors for 10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the labeled binding probes. For gel-shift analysis, incubation of EMSA reaction mixtures for 15 min at room temperature was followed by the addition of the specific or irrelevant antibodies and incubation for an additional 30 min at room temperature. AREB6 antiserum was generated and prepared as described below. Ku70, Ku86, and DNA-PKcs antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The reaction samples were electrophoresed and then transferred to nylon membranes by electroblotting. The oligonucleotides were fixed onto the membranes by baking at 100 °C for 30 min. The chemiluminescent signals were detected following the DIG gel shift kit (Roche Applied Science) protocol. Purification of Nuclear Proteins Binding to the Probe EG—For DNA affinity purification, biotin-labeled DNA probe 3× EG (three repeats of probe EG, 47 bp for each repeat that contains the E-box, conjunct GTTTC, and Ku86 site) was generated by PCR amplification (43Gabrielsen O.S. Huet J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 508-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The labeled probe was chemically conjugated to Dynal streptavidin magnetic beads following the recommended protocol (Dynal). The nuclear extracts were purified by anion exchange purification using a Hi-Trap Sepharose Q column following the recommended protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The anion exchange-purified nuclear proteins were used for incubation with the 3× EG-conjugated Dynal beads. Nuclear proteins specifically binding to the probes were eluted in 100 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.6 m NaCl after three washes of the magnetic beads, with washing buffer containing scrambled probes to remove the non-specifically bound proteins. The eluted proteins and the molecular weight markers were mixed with 10 μlof2× Laemmli buffer, then boiled for 3 min and, while still warm, directly loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis to determine the molecular weights. The proteins were recovered from the gels for amino acid sequencing analysis. Expression of GST-human Recombinant AREB6 N-terminal (AREB6-N), H-domain (AREB6-H), and C-terminal (AREB6-C) and Generation of AREB6 Antiserum—The pGEX-3X-AREB6 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Kawakami (Tochigi, Japan) as a gift. DNA constructs for expression of different domains of AREB6 proteins were generated by modification of the pGEX-3X-AREB6 as described previously (36Ikeda K. Kawakami K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The AREB6-N, -H, and -C were expressed in E. coli and purified using a GST purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteins were further characterized by their predicted molecular weights after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then used as antigens to generate mouse AREB6 antiserum or for binding and pull-down experiments. Plasmid Construction and Promoter Activity Assay—pGL3 luciferase reporter vectors (Promega) were used to determine promoter activity. To create the hXOR-luciferase constructs, the hXOR promoter fragment (F5) was inserted into the pGL3-basic vector (which contains no promoter or enhancer) at XhoI/SacI sites by modifying the 5′ and 3′ ends as described previously (35Xu P. Lavallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) and 2 μg of DNA/transfection following the supplier's protocol. At predetermined times after transfection, the cells were lysed in 1× lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured. To minimize errors due to the variation of transfection efficiencies, cotransfection with pSV-β-Gal plasmid DNA was carried out, and transfections were performed in triplicate for each experiment. The protein content of each sample was determined to correct for cell numbers. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. At least three separate experiments with each plasmid DNA preparation were performed. Measurement of XOR Transcripts—XOR transcript levels in V79–4 and XR-V15B cells were analyzed using reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNAgents Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) following the supplier's protocol. The reverse transcription-PCR conditions and primers for amplification of XOR transcripts were described previously (35Xu P. Lavallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The primers TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA (forward) and CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG (reverse) were used to amplify β-actin transcripts (691 bp). Western Blot Analysis, GST Pull-down Assays, and Immunoprecipitation—Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts and eluted proteins from probe 3× EG-conjugated Dynal magnetic beads was performed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the supplier's protocol. AREB6 antiserum (1:3000) and irrelevant antibodies (pre-immune serum and sulfite oxidase antiserum, 1:3000) were used as primary antibodies. For GST pull-down, AREB6-C, AREB6-H, and AREB6-N proteins were conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The conjugated beads were incubated with nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 2 h in a total volume of 400 μl of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA) containing 0.05% Triton X-100. After extensive washing with binding buffer, the beads were suspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Ku86 antibodies (1:3000) were used as primary antibodies to detect the signals. The immunoprecipitation of nuclear extracts was performed using Ku86 or irrelevant (Vimentin, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies following the protocol described in Ref. 44Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Agelica E.C. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., U. S. A.2003Google Scholar. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with AREB6 antiserum (1: 3000) as primary antibodies, as described above. Nuclear Proteins Bind to the E-box and Ku86 Sites—We demonstrated previously that an E-box restricts basal hXOR promoter activity (35Xu P. Lavallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Further sequence analysis indicated that a Ku86 binding site is located 2 bp upstream of the E-box, as shown in Fig. 1A. To determine mechanisms by which the E-box/Ku86 region regulates hXOR promoter activity, we examined the nuclear proteins binding to the E-box and Ku86 sites. Probe EG containing E-box and Ku86 sites was used as the binding probe and specific competitor in the experiments. The DNA probes used in the experiments are illustrated in Fig. 1A. As shown in Fig. 1B, binding of nuclear proteins to the probe EG caused multiple shifted bands. One of the bands was competed for specifically by the probes (Kum1, Kum2, and specific competitor) containing the E-box (lanes 3, 4, and 5) but not the probe containing the mutant E-box (probe EmG, lane 6), as indicated by an arrow and labeled E-box binding. The results demonstrate specific binding of nuclear protein to the E-box. Besides the E-box binding band, Fig. 1B demonstrated that two nuclear proteins binding to probe EG were specifically competed for by the specific competitor (lane 5) and the probe containing the mutant E-box (probe EmG, lane 6), but not by the probes containing a mutant Ku86 site (probe Kum1 and Kum2, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that specific nuclear proteins bind to the Ku86 site. Meanwhile, the probe with a mutant E-box (probe EmG) was able to compete for the Ku86 binding but not with the E-box binding, suggesting no interference between E-box and Ku86 sites in the binding of nuclear proteins. Magnetic DNA Affinity Purification and Sequence Analysis of Nuclear Proteins Binding to the Probe EG—To further characterize the nuclear proteins binding to the E-box/Ku86 site, DNA probes containing three repeats of probe EG (probe 3× EG) were conjugated to the Dynal magnetic beads. As shown in Fig. 2A, the binding pattern of nuclear proteins to probe 3× EG was similar in comparison with that to probe EG (Fig. 1B). Of particular note, the competition pattern of the binding by various competitors was similar in both experiments, indicating that the proteins binding to probe 3× EG are likely the same as those binding to probe EG. Five proteins were eluted from probe 3× EG-conjugated Dynal beads (Fig. 2B). The three major proteins were ∼350, 86, and 70 kDa. Sequence analysis identified these proteins as DNA-PKcs (350 kDa), Ku86 (86 kDa), and Ku70 (70 kDa). The other two proteins with sizes of around 200 and 100 kDa could not be sequenced because of inadequate amounts. Ku86 Antibodies Block the Nuclear Protein Binding to Probe EG—DNA-PKcs, Ku86, and Ku70 are all subunits of DNA-PK complex (37Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 38Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. Giffin W. Kochan J.C. Ngsee J.K. Traykova-Andonova M. Hache R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16848-16856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To further characterize binding of the DNA-PK complex, by using gel-shift assays we examined the effect of DNA-PKcs, Ku86, and Ku70 antibodies on the binding of nuclear proteins to the EG probe. As shown in Fig. 3, the Ku86 antibody, but not the other two, specifically blocked binding of nuclear proteins. Combining with the results in Figs. 1 and 2, it appears that Ku86 binds to the EG probe. Immunoreactivities to AREB6 Antiserum of the Nuclear Extracts and the Eluted Proteins from Probe 3×-conjugated Dynal Beads—As already indicated, sequence analysis identified a conjunct consensus GTTTC 19 bp upstream of the E-box in the hXOR promoter (35Xu P. Lavallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To date, AREB6 is the only E-box binding protein shown to require the consensus for its repressive function (36Ikeda K. Kawakami K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To test whether the other proteins eluted from the probe 3× EG-conjugated Dynal beads, in addition to the DNA-PK complex, were AREB6-like proteins, Western blot analysis with AREB6 antiserum was performed. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, proteins immunoreactive to AREB6 antiserum were present in nuclear extracts. The sizes of the major AREB6-immunoreative proteins were ∼200, 160, 100, and 75 kDa. Similar results were obtained in Western blot analysis of proteins eluted from probe 3× EG-conjugated Dynal beads (Fig. 4B). The bands a∼100 and 75 kDa are likely nonspecific because of the cross-immunoreactivity to pre-immune and sulfite oxidase antiserum. A protein of 200 kDa was also observed in Fig. 2B as discussed above. It appears that the protein ∼200 kDa is AREB6-like. The protein ∼160 kDa may be a partially degraded or distinct AREB6-like protein. The Eluted Proteins Contain Specific Binding Activity to the E-box; AREB6 Antiserum Blocks the Binding of Crude Nuclear Proteins to the Probe EG—We assumed that if the eluted proteins contain AREB6-like proteins, then they will have E-box binding activity. To test this hypothesis, the binding to the E-box of proteins eluted from probe 3× EG-conjugated Dynal beads was analyzed. As demonstrated in Fig. 5A, one binding band was competed for by the specific but not by mutant E-box or nonspecific probes. The same competition pattern in the experiments with eluted (Fig. 5A) and crude (Fig. 1B) nuclear proteins indicates the same E-box binding in both preparations. The results demonstrate E-box binding activity in the eluted proteins that is similar to that in crude nuclear proteins. To determine whether the native AREB6 immunoreactive nuclear proteins bind to the probe EG, the binding of native AREB6-like proteins in nuclear extracts was analyzed using gel-shift assays with AREB6 antiserum. As demonstrated in Fig. 5B, the AREB6 antiserum specifically blocked the binding, indicating that native nuclear proteins with AREB6 immunogenicity bind to the E-box. Recombinant AREB6-C Binds the E-box—To examine further whether AREB6-like proteins are able to bind to the E-box of the hXOR promoter, we generated a recombinant C-terminal fragment of human AREB6 (AREB6-C) that contains a C-terminal zinc-finger domain with the binding activity to the E-box (36Ikeda K. Kawakami K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In these experiments, probes EG, EGm (mutant GTTTC), and EmGm (combined mutant E-box and GTTTC) were used. As shown in Fig. 6A, AREB6-C proteins bound to probe EG. AREB6 antiserum blocked the binding. Fig. 6B shows that mutation of GTTTC (probe EGm, lane 2) slightly reduced the binding of AREB6-C, whereas the mutations of both E-box and GTTTC (probe EmGm, lane 4) significantly reduced the binding. The results indicate that AREB6 proteins bind to the E-box of the hXOR promoter. AREB6 Proteins Interact with Ku86 Proteins—To determine whether AREB6-like proteins interact with Ku86 proteins, we examined the ability of recombinant AREB6 to interact with Ku86 proteins present in the nuclear extracts. Fig. 7A shows that Ku86 proteins were pulled-down from nuclear extracts by AREB6-C and AREB6-N fusion proteins. The absence of interaction between AREB6-H and Ku86, as an endogenous negative control, indicates that the interaction is specific. To examine the interaction in the opposite direction and with native nuclear proteins, we used Ku86 antibodies to immunoprecipitate proteins from nuclear extracts, using vimentin antibodies as a negative control. Fig. 7B shows that proteins around 200 and 160 kDa identified by AREB6 antiserum were present in immunoprecipitates using Ku86 but not vimentin antibodies. The results indicate interactions between native AREB6-like and Ku86 proteins. The Loss of Ku86 Function Enhances the Repressed hXOR Promoter Activity and Increases XOR mRNA Expression—We next determined whether the loss of Ku86 protein binding altered hXOR promoter activity. In these experiments, hXOR promoter activity in V79–4 cells (wild type) was compared with that in XR-V15B cells (the mutant of Ku86 proteins). To avoid problems caused by variation of transfection efficiencies between the two cell lines, co-transfections with pSV-β-Gal plasmid DNA were performed. The luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and protein concentrations. As shown in Fig. 8A, hXOR promoter activity in XR-V15B cells was substantially higher than that in V79–4 cells. These results indicate functional involvement of Ku86 proteins in regulation of basal hXOR promoter activity. To investigate further whether Ku86 proteins regulate XOR expression, we determined XOR mRNA levels in V79–4 cells and XR-V15B cells. These results, presented in Fig. 8B, reveal that the expression of XOR mRNA was significantly higher in XR-V15B cells than in V79–4 cells, indicating that Ku86 proteins regulate the expression of XOR in vivo. DNA-PK and AREB6-like Proteins Binding to the E-box/Ku86 Site—We demonstrated previously that XOR uses repressive transcriptional mechanisms to regulate its basal expression in humans (35Xu P. Lavallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis suggested that an E-box was important in this repressive activity. In the present investigation, we sought to identify the nuclear proteins binding to the E-box and the adjacent Ku86 binding site, and to determine the functions of Ku86 proteins in regulation of hXOR transcription. DNA affinity purification identified at least five proteins (350, 200, 100, 86, and 70 kDa) involved in binding to the region containing the E-box/Ku86 site. Sequence analysis demonstrated that three of the proteins (350, 86, and 70 kDa) are DNA-PKcs, Ku86, and Ku70, respectively, all components of DNA-PK complex. DNA-PK is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase complex that is composed of a large catalytic subunit termed DNA-PKcs and a regulatory factor termed Ku (a dimer of Ku86 and Ku70). DNA-PK functions as a key component in DNA double-strand break repair and in the V(D)J recombination apparatus (37Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 45Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 46Finnie N. Gottlieb T. Hartley K. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In interactions between DNA-PK and DNA strands, Ku and DNA-PKcs function interdependently, in that DNA-PKcs is recruited to DNA by Ku and activated by interactions with DNA. In addition to the above functions, DNA-PK phosphorylates transcription factors, and contributes to signaling DNA-damage and telomere maintenance (37Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Ku proteins function as the DNA-targeting component non-specifically binding to DNA-ends in DNA double-strand break repair or as nuclear proteins specifically binding to DNA with a consensus of GAGAAA. This consensus is immediately upstream of the E-box in the hXOR promoter (35Xu P. Lavallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study, EMSA, combined with mutational analysis of the Ku86 site and gel-shift analysis, demonstrated that Ku86-immunoreactive proteins bind specifically to the Ku86 site. In view of the interdependence of Ku and DNA-PKcs, it is likely that Ku86 proteins bind directly to the site and recruit DNA-PKcs and Ku70 through protein-protein interaction. This suggestion is supported by the findings presented in Fig. 1B showing that two shifted bands are associated with the Ku86 binding site, indicating the interaction of Ku86 with other proteins. EMSA combined with mutational analysis of the E-box demonstrated specific binding of proteins to the E-box. The two proteins (200 and 100 kDa) obtained by DNA affinity purification are candidates for binding to the E-box. Considering the presence of a conjunct consensus GTTTC 19 bp upstream of the E-box in the hXOR promoter (35Xu P. Lavallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which is required for the E-box binding protein AREB6 to repressively regulate gene transcription (36Ikeda K. Kawakami K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that AREB6-like proteins are the best candidates for binding to the E-box in hXOR. This hypothesis is supported by experiments demonstrating that: (i) proteins around 200 kDa are immunoreactive to AREB6 antiserum, and are present in the nuclear extract and proteins eluted from probe 3× EG-conjugated Dynal beads; (ii) the eluted proteins are able to bind to the E-box; and (iii) the AREB6 antiserum specifically blocks binding of nuclear proteins to the E-box. In addition, AREB6-C binds to the E-box. The estimated molecular mass of AREB6 is ∼120 kDa, based on the deduced amino acid residues from the cDNA sequence. To date, AREB6, a zinc finger-homeodomain transcription factor (47Watanabe Y. Kawakami K. Hirayama Y. Nagano K. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), is the only E-box binding protein requiring the consensus GTTTC for its repressive function. Three transcription factors homologous to AREB6 have been reported. One, ZEP, is a 1164-amino acid residue protein that has 40 extra amino acid residues at the N-terminal compared with AREB6. ZEP regulates lymphocyte and smooth muscle cell differentiation (48Genetta T. Ruesinsky D. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6153-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A second, Nil-2-α, a negative regulator of the interleukin-2 gene, is a 734-amino acid residue protein that is similar to AREB6 but lacks the N-terminal (49Williams T.M. Moolten D. Burlten J. Romano J. Bhaerman R. Godillot A. Mellon M. Rauscher III, F.J. Kant J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1791-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The third, BZP, is a homologue of AREB6 in hamsters and functions as a serum-responsive transcriptional repressor (50Franklin A.J. Jetton T.L. Shelton K.D. Magnuson M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6773-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). None of these proteins has a mass around 200 kDa. Based on Western blot analysis, the proteins around 100 kDa are likely nonspecific. Therefore, the protein around 200 kDa may represent a new member of AREB6 group or post-translationally modified form of AREB6. In addition, a protein around 160 kDa and immunoreactive to AREB6 antiserum was observed in nuclear extracts and purified nuclear proteins. The biochemical property of the protein is unknown and may be a partially degraded or distinct AREB6-like protein. Direct sequence analysis will be required to further characterize these proteins. Function of Ku86 in Regulation of hXOR—In the present study, we showed that loss of function of Ku86 causes enhanced hXOR promoter activity and transcript expression. These results indicate that, besides AREB6-like proteins that bind to the E-box, Ku86 proteins also contribute to the repressive regulation of hXOR. Compared with our previous study showing that mutation of the Ku86 binding site did not significantly release the repressed promoter activity (35Xu P. Lavallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the use of Ku86-deficient cells in the present study clearly demonstrates that Ku86 proteins regulate hXOR expression. The basis for this disparity is not known but may be a result of residual binding to the mutated Ku86 in the former study. Using animals and cells deficient in DNA-PKcs or Ku, it has been demonstrated that DNA-PK is important in DNA repair and V(D)J recombination (37Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The repressive activity of Ku86 observed in the present investigation is novel. The characterization of the E-box/Ku86-bound nuclear proteins provides a basis for further addressing the function of E-box/Ku86 site in the regulation of the hXOR promoter. In view of the close relationship between the E-box and Ku86 sites, DNA-PK and AREB6-like proteins could be organized in a cluster with other proteins in the binding region. DNA-PK, besides its function in DNA repair, has been demonstrated to regulate gene transcription by phosphorylation of transcription factors (46Finnie N. Gottlieb T. Hartley K. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the cluster, ABRE6-like proteins could be regulated by DNA-PKcs through phosphorylation (51Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 52Cowell I.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 53Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genetics. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This possibility is supported by our demonstration that Ku proteins are able to bind to AREB6 domains and by the recent report (38Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. Giffin W. Kochan J.C. Ngsee J.K. Traykova-Andonova M. Hache R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16848-16856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showing that Ku proteins bind homeodomain proteins such as octamer transcription factors (Oct-1 and Oct-2) and, in so doing, promote their phosphorylation by DNA-PK. Similar events would provide a basis by which hXOR is regulated in various physiologic and pathologic conditions. Fig. 9 illustrates a working model based on our results. In this model, hXOR transcription is regulated by means of alteration of phosphorylation status of transcription factors. In the model, the transcription factors include DNA-PK, AREB6-like proteins, co-repressors, TFIID, and other unknown proteins. Future studies will be directed at further assessing the importance of phosphorylation of transcription factors in regulating hXOR activity.

https://openalex.org/W1983280802,"Evaluation of the activation state of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes relies on analysis of subcellular translocation. A monoclonal antibody, 14E6, specific for the activated conformation of ϵPKC, was raised using the first variable (V1) domain of ϵPKC as the immunogen. 14E6 binding is specific for ϵPKC and is greatly increased in the presence of PKC activators. Immunofluorescence staining by 14E6 of neonatal rat primary cardiac myocytes and the NG108-15 neuroblastoma glioma cell line, NG108-15/D2, increases rapidly following cell activation and is localized to new subcellular sites. However, staining of translocated ϵPKC with 14E6 is transient, and the epitope disappears 30 min after activation of NG-108/15 cells by a D2 receptor agonist. In contrast, subcellular localization associated with activation, as determined by commercially available polyclonal antibodies, persists for at least 30 min. In vitro, ϵRACK, the receptor for activated ϵPKC, inhibits 14E6 binding to ϵPKC, suggesting that the 14E6 epitope is lost or hidden when active ϵPKC binds to its RACK. Therefore, the 14E6 antibody appears to identify a transient state of activated but non-anchored ϵPKC. Moreover, binding of 14E6 to ϵPKC only after activation suggests that lipid-dependent conformational changes associated with ϵPKC activation precede binding of the activated isozyme to its specific RACK, ϵRACK. Further, monoclonal antibody 14E6 should be a powerful tool to study the pathways that control rapid translocation of ϵPKC from cytosolic to membrane localization on activation.

Most isozymes are localized to unique sites prior to cell stimulation, and translocate upon activation to new distinct intracellular sites. PKC isozyme localization is determined by binding to specific anchoring molecules termed RACKs (receptors for activated C-kinase) (5Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Two RACKs have been identified and characterized to date: the βIIPKC-specific RACK (RACK1) (6Ron D. Chen C.-H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) and the ϵPKC-specific RACK (ϵRACK), also known as β′COP (7Csukai M.

Many aspects of PKC activation are not fully understood. Are conformational changes associated with PKC activation? Does lipid binding precede RACK binding? In order to answer these and other questions, it is necessary to develop new “statespecific” reagents to distinguish between active and inactive individual PKC isozymes. ϵPKC is an isozyme that regulates many cellular functions (8Akita Y.

A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), we expected that a conformational change in this domain must occur upon activation. We therefore predicted that some antigenic determinants on the V1 domain should be exposed only following ϵPKC activation and that some of the antibodies raised against V1 might recognize the active state of ϵPKC and be isozyme-selective. We report here the production and characterization of an isozyme-selective monoclonal antibody (mAb) to ϵPKC that is specific for the activated form of this isozyme. Activation is required to expose the epitope for this antibody, but 14E6 no longer binds to the activated enzyme when the latter is bound to ϵRACK. Together, these studies suggest the existence of a previously unidentified state in PKC activation: a transient, activated, but non-anchored state. Immunostaining with 14E6 should help in identifying cells in tissues where ϵPKC has been activated by a physiological trigger. In addition, 14E6 will be a useful marker to follow the pathway of ϵPKC translocation and help elucidate the mechanism involved in this pathway. Materials—Recombinant δ, ϵ, and γ PKCs produced in Sf9 cells were obtained from PanVera (Madison, WI). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was from Alexis (San Diego, CA), and phosphatidylserine (PS) and dioleoylglycerol (DG) were purchased from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). PKC was partially purified from rat brain by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration as described previously (25Mochly-Rosen D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A rabbit IgG raised to the C terminus of ϵPKC (sc-214, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used in some of the Western blots and immunoprecipitation experiments. Rabbit antiserum to the C terminus of ϵPKC (AS-2453S, Research & Diagnostic Antibodies, Berkeley, CA) was used for immunofluorescence in cardiac myocytes. A monoclonal antibody to ϵPKC (SC-1681, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for immunofluorescence in NG108-15 cells. 2,10,11-trihydroxy-N-propylnorapomorphine hydrobromide (NPA) was purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc. All other reagents were from Sigma Chemicals unless otherwise noted. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—The V1 regions of rat δ and ϵPKC (amino acids 2–144 and 2–145, respectively) were expressed as fusion proteins with MBP (maltose-binding protein; pMAL-c2 vector, New England BioLabs) in Esherichia coli. Vectors were also constructed expressing the C-terminal half of ϵRACK as an MBP fusion protein (MBP-ϵRACK-C, amino acids 425–905), MBP-LacZ, and MBP-βIIPKC-V5 (amino acids 622–673). MBP fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on amylose resin according to the New England Bio-Labs protocol. Where indicated, cleavage of the fusion protein and removal of MBP were carried out with 5 μg/ml Factor Xa (New England BioLabs) for 24 h at 4 °C. Monoclonal Antibody Production—Purified ϵPKC-V1 was incubated with 120 μg/ml PS, 4 μg/ml DG, and ϵ RACK-C for 15 min at room temperature (PS and DG in ethanol were dried under nitrogen, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 was added to bring PS to 1.2 mg/ml and DG to 40 μg/ml, the mixture sonicated on ice, with a Branson Sonifier at 20% output at setting 2.5, using 3 cycles of 1 min each, with 30 s cooling periods on ice between cycles). Eight-week-old BALB/c mice (Harlan) were injected subcutaneously three times at 3–4-week intervals with 10 μg of ϵPKC-V1 and 10 μg of ϵRACK-C with PS and DG, emulsified with Freund's adjuvant. Four days after the final boost, splenocytes (108) were fused with 2 × 107 murine myeloma Fox-NY cells (from Thomas A. Stamey) according to Kohler and Milstein (26Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12655) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in HAT-containing medium as described (25Mochly-Rosen D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and positive cultures were subcloned three times. Antibodies were obtained either as ascites in BALB/c mice or as supernatant in serum-free medium in roller bottles, and purified by precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate, followed by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300. SDS-PAGE revealed the expected 75 and 25 kDa heavy and light chains at ∼95% purity. Immunoglobulin isotypes were determined with a kit from BD Pharmingen. ELISA Binding Assays—Recombinant MBP fusion proteins and PKCs were incubated at 3–5 μg/ml in PBS in 96-well ELISA plates for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBS plus 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS/Tween), blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h (this and subsequent incubations were at room temperature), and washed as above. 100 μl of antibody was added, and the plate was further incubated for 1 h, followed by three washes with PBS/Tween. 100 μl of HRP-goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Chemicals and Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA; diluted 1:5000 in PBS containing 1% BSA) was added and incubated for 1 h, followed by three washes with PBS/Tween. 100 μlof O-phenylenediamine and 0.03% H2O2 in 100 mm citrate buffer, pH 6, was added to assess HRP activity; after 15 min, 50 μlof2 n H2SO4 was added to stop the reaction and absorbance at 490 nm determined. To determine whether binding of ϵRACK to ϵPKC affects the subsequent binding of antibodies, 5 μg/ml MBP-ϵRACK-C was added to immobilized MBP-ϵPKC-V1 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS/Tween, prior to antibody addition. ELISA for Analysis of ϵPKC Activation—Activation of ϵPKC was carried out by incubation of 1–5 μg of PanVera Sf9 ϵPKC in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 μg/ml PS, and 2 μg/ml DG, at room temperature for 5 min. The mixture was diluted to 10 ml with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and bound to ELISA plates (Costar 3590) at 100 μl per well for 1 h. Plates were washed (this and all subsequent washes were carried out three times with PBS/Tween), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk powder in PBS/Tween for 45 min, washed again, incubated with antibodies in PBS/Tween for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again. Plates were incubated with anti-mouse IgM-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce Endogen 31440) for 1 h, washed, and developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma T3405; 1 mg per 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate/25 mm citric acid, pH 5.5 with 2 μlof 30% hydrogen peroxide). The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 2 m H2SO4 and absorbance determined at 450 nm. Cardiac Myocyte Preparation—Primary cardiac myocytes were prepared from the hearts of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats by gentle trypsinization as described (27Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Non-myocytes were removed by preplating for 30 min. Myocytes were plated at 800 cell/mm2 in M-199 medium (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine, 2 μg/ml vitamin B12, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) in 1% CO2. After 24 h, the culture medium was changed to the above medium containing 80 μm ascorbic acid, and cells were cultured an additional 72 h. Myocytes were then incubated in a defined medium (M-199 with penicillin and streptomycin, 2 μg/ml vitamin B12, and 10 μg/ml each of insulin and transferrin) for 24 h, after which experiments were initiated. NG108-15 Cell Culture—NG108–15 cells were cultured as described (28Gordon A.S. Yao L. Wu Z.-L. Coe I.R. Diamond I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and maintained in a serum-free defined medium for 6 days prior to immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation experiments. Experiments with the dopamine receptor agonist NPA were carried out with NG108 cells stably transfected with the dopamine D2 receptor, NG108-15/D2 (29Asai K. Ishii A. Yao L. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Alcoholism: Clin. Exp. Res. 1998; 22: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cardiac myocytes were plated on glass cover slips or in chamber slides coated with 1.2 μg/ml laminin from mouse sarcoma cells (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). Following the indicated treatments, cells were fixed for 3 min on ice in methanol/acetone (1:1, -20 °C). Slides were washed three times with cold PBS, blocked with PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS/Triton) containing 1% normal goat serum, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °Cin PBS/Triton containing 1% normal goat serum. After three washes with PBS/Triton, cells were incubated with fluorescein labeled-goat anti-mouse IgM, anti-mouse IgG, or anti-rabbit IgG (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) in PBS/Triton containing 1% normal goat serum for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS/Triton, and mounted in Vecta Shield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence microscopy was carried out with a ×40 water immersion objective or by confocal microscopy. NG108–15/D2 cells were fixed with methanol and confocal microscopy carried out as described (28Gordon A.S. Yao L. Wu Z.-L. Coe I.R. Diamond I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These fixation conditions were found optimal to conserve antibody epitopes and cell structure. Preparation of Cell Lysates—NG108–15/D2 cells were incubated with NPA for the indicated times and concentrations. Cells were then kept on ice and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5 and lysed in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm β-mercapthoethanol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (17 μg/ml), SBTI (20 μg/ml), leupeptin (25 μg/ml), and aprotinin (25 μg/ml). Cells were then fractionated into soluble and particulate fractions; cells resuspended in homogenization buffer were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in one-fifth of the initial volume in DE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 12 mm β-mercapthoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton-X 100) and protease inhibitors as above. The lysate was ultracentrifuged as above, and the Triton-soluble material was collected and used for immunoprecipitation studies. Immunoprecipitation of NG108–15 Cell Lysates—For immunoprecipitation with 6E4 antibody, 2 μg of 6E4 was incubated with 30 μl of packed volume of protein G beads (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation with 14E6 antibody, 2 μg of 14E6 in PBS was added to 30 μl of packed volume of anti-mouse IgM agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Antibody-bound beads were then washed twice with PBS and blocked with 3% BSA for 2 h at 4 °C. Triton-soluble material was diluted 5 times in homogenization buffer to dilute the Triton X-100 to 0.2%, then precleared with protein G or anti-IgM beads for 30 min at 4 °C, incubated with antibody-bound beads overnight at 4 °C, and subsequently washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound material was eluted with SDS sample buffer, run on an 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred and probed for ϵPKC (anti-V5 Santa Cruz) and ϵRACK (monoclonal antibody 4B12). Immunoprecipitation of Rat Brain PKC—For immunoprecipitation, 5 μg of each monoclonal antibody was added to 50 μl of goat anti-mouse IgM (Jackson Laboratories) conjugated to Sepharose beads using cyanogen-bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), or to 50 μl of protein G-Agarose beads (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.), and rocked for 2 hat 4 °C. The beads were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween. Approximately 30 μg of rat brain PKC (partially purified by DEAE cellulose and gel filtration chromatography, Ref. 17Mochly-Rosen D. Wu G. Hahn H. Osinska H. Liron T. Lorenz J.N. Yatani A. Robbins J. Dorn II, G.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) was diluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with 20 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 mg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (protease inhibitors) without EDTA or EGTA, and incubated for the indicated times at room temperature with 120 μg/ml PS and 4 μg/ml DG. Brain PKC was then added to the beads and the incubation continued for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by washing the beads three times with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. The entire immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 8% acrylamide. Western blotting was carried out with rabbit polyclonal IgG to ϵPKC from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-214, followed by donkey anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to HRP (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence was generated by adding 1.25 mm luminol (Sigma), 200 μm p-coumaric acid, and 2.7 mm H2O2 in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5. Our purpose was to generate mAbs that distinguish between active and inactive ϵPKC. The V1 domain of this isozyme was chosen as the immunogen because it contains a RACK binding site (7Csukai M.

Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) that is exposed only after ϵPKC activation. We therefore expected that certain epitopes in this domain may be exposed only following activation of ϵPKC and therefore should be recognized by antibodies that would only recognize activated ϵPKC. Mice were injected with recombinant protein comprising the V1 region of rat ϵPKC (amino acids 2–145). Hybridoma culture supernatants were screened by ELISA for binding to MBP-ϵPKC-V1. Identification of Antibodies to the V1 Domain of ϵPKC That Are Isozyme-specific—An IgM antibody, 14E6, was shown by ELISA to be specific for ϵPKC. 14E6 bound to MBP-ϵPKC-V1 and to full-length recombinant ϵPKC expressed in Sf9 cells (Sf9-ϵPKC), but not to Sf9-δ PKC, Sf9-γ PKC, MBP-δ PKC-V1, MBP-β IIPKC-V5, or to the ϵRACK fragment that binds the ϵPKC-V1 domain (MBP-ϵRACK-C) (Fig. 1). In Western blot analyses, 14E6 did not recognize full-length Sf9-ϵPKC or purified rat brain αPKC, but did recognize MBP-ϵ V1 (data not shown). 6E10, a second IgM antibody raised against MBP-ϵPKC-V1, has a specificity similar to 14E6 in ELISA and Western blot analyses (Figs. 1 and 4, and data not shown).Fig. 414E6 binding to ϵPKC in vitro increases following activation of the enzyme with PS and DG. A, partially purified PKC from rat brain (∼100 units/mg) was incubated at room temperature for 3 or 6 min with or without PS and DG (upper blot) and immunoprecipitation by 14E6 was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunoprecipitated material was analyzed for ϵPKC and δPKC by Western blot (lower blots). The molecular weight of δPKC was confirmed using the brain extract (data not shown). B, partially purified PKC was incubated at room temperature for 5 min with or without PS and DG, immunoprecipitated by either 14E6 or 6E10, and analyzed for ϵPKC by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 14E6 Competes with ϵRACK for Binding to ϵPKC-V1—Because the 14E6 binding site on ϵPKC is within the V1 domain (Fig. 1), the same domain that contributes significantly to the binding of ϵPKC to full-length ϵRACK (7Csukai M. Chen C.-H. De Matteis M.A. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29200-29206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), we next determined whether the 14E6 epitope overlaps with the ϵRACK binding site. We used recombinant MBP-fusion proteins containing either the ϵ V1 domain, MBP-ϵPKC-V1 (ϵPKC 2–145) or the C-terminal half of ϵRACK, MBP-ϵRACK-C (β′-COP 425–905), which contains the ϵPKC binding site. Both 14E6 and the control anti-ϵPKC-V1 mAb, 6E10, bound to MBP-ϵPKC-V1 (Fig. 2, A and B, solid bar and Fig. 1), and did not bind to MBP-ϵRACK-C or to MBP (Fig. 2, A and B, striped bars). However, when ϵPKC-V1 and ϵRACK-C were preincubated before addition of 14E6, the binding of 14E6 to this complex (Fig. 2A, open bar) was 70% lower than to ϵPKC-V1 alone (Fig. 2A, filled bar), suggesting that binding of ϵRACK to ϵPKC prevents the binding of 14E6 to the enzyme. In contrast, binding of 6E10 to ϵPKC-V1 was not significantly decreased by concurrent ϵRACK-C binding (Fig. 2B, open bar), making it unlikely that the inhibition of 14E6 binding to ϵPKC by ϵRACK was due to a nonspecific steric effect. Our data indicate that the epitope for 14E6 overlaps with or is close to an ϵRACK binding site on ϵPKC-V1 and predict that 14E6 will not bind to complexes of active ϵPKC with ϵRACK in vivo. In Vitro Activation of ϵPKC with PS and DG Increases Binding by 14E6 —PKC is activated in vivo through binding of lipid activators such as PS and DG. To determine whether 14E6 or 6E10 could distinguish between the active and inactive forms of ϵPKC, recombinant ϵPKC was activated by addition of PS and DG, and 14E6 or 6E10 binding was assessed by ELISA. Antibody binding to ϵPKC is expressed as the ratio of binding in the presence of lipid activators to binding in the absence of lipid activators (Fig. 3). Binding of 14E6 was increased almost 3-fold by inclusion of lipid activators to 10 ng of ϵPKC (Fig. 3). The concentration of enzyme appeared to be critical for optimal sensitivity in this assay. When 25 or 50 ng of ϵPKC was used, binding of 14E6 was already high (data not shown) and was minimally affected by lipid activation of the enzyme (Fig. 3). This explains the binding of 14E6 to ϵPKC in the absence of activators shown in Fig. 1, since the standard ELISA protocol used over 300 ng of protein per well. The increased binding to ϵPKC in the presence of lipid activators when limiting amounts of ϵPKC are used suggests that the 14E6 epitope on the enzyme becomes exposed upon activation of ϵPKC. We also found that the binding of mAb 6E10 to activated ϵPKC is slightly but significantly lower than binding to inactive ϵPKC (Fig. 3). Taken together, our data suggest that mAb 14E6, but not 6E10, specifically recognizes the active form of PKC in an ELISA assay. We next determined whether 14E6 recognizes the active form of ϵPKC in solution using an immunoprecipitation assay. When a partially purified preparation of PKC from rat brain was incubated with 14E6, little ϵPKC was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4A). However, incubation of brain PKC with the activating lipids PS and DG for 3 or 6 min at room temperature resulted in significant immunoprecipitation of ϵPKC by 14E6 (Fig. 4A). These activators increase the catalytic activity of calcium-independent PKC in the brain PKC preparation by over 10-fold as determined by phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (data not shown). In contrast, 6E10 immunoprecipitated more ϵPKC in the absence of PKC activators (Fig. 4B) and commercial antiserum to the C terminus of ϵPKC-V5 immunoprecipitated equal amounts of enzyme regardless of the presence of PKC activators (data not shown). The level of δPKC in the 14E6 immunoprecipitate was very low, indicating the specificity of 14E6 for ϵPKC (Fig. 4A). In addition, SDS electrophoresis of the supernatants of the immunoprecipitates demonstrated that degradation of ϵPKC did not occur during the experiment (Fig 4A, upper blot), indicating that the differences in immunoprecipitation observed in Fig. 4 reflect differences in epitope exposure in the various samples. Therefore, 14E6 is a unique antibody; it specifically recognizes an antigenic determinant on ϵPKC that becomes exposed following activation by PS and DG. The 14E6 Epitope Is Exposed Following Stimulation of NG108-15/D2 Cells—To determine whether 14E6 identifies activated ϵPKC in cells, we used a rat/mouse neuroblastoma X glioma cell line stably expressing the dopamine D2 receptor, NG108-15/D2. These cells respond to the dopaminergic agonist NPA with a robust transloca"
https://openalex.org/W2043418670,"Abstract The binding of C10 RNA oligomers to wild type and mutant Escherichia coli transcription termination factor Rho provides a model for the enzyme-RNA interactions that lead to transcription termination. One surprising finding is that wild type Rho binds between five and six C10 oligomers per hexamer with KD = 0.3 μm, and five to six additional C10 molecules with KD = 7 μm. Previously, approximately half this number of oligomer-binding sites was reported (Wang, Y., and von Hippel, P. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 13947–13955); however, the E155K mutant form of Rho, thought at the time to be wild type, was used in that work. The present results with E155K Rho agree with the earlier work. C10 binding with mutant forms of Rho that are altered in RNA interactions, bearing amino acid changes F62S, G99V, F232C, T286A, or K352E, indicate that the higher affinity binding sites constitute what has been termed the primary RNA site, and the lower affinity sites constitute the secondary sites. The binding data together with the crystal structures for wild type Rho (Skordalakes, E., and Berger, J. M. (2003) Cell 114, 135–146) support structurally distinct locations on Rho for the two classes of C10-binding sites. The results are consistent with participation of residues 33 A apart in secondary site RNA interactions. The data further indicate that not all RNA sites on Rho must be filled for full ATPase and transcription termination activity, and suggest a model in which RNA binding to the higher affinity sites leads to a protein conformation change that exposes the previously hidden lower affinity sites."
