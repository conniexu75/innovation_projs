https://openalex.org/W2147284262,"Elevations measured by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter have yielded a high-accuracy global map of the topography of Mars. Dominant features include the low northern hemisphere, the Tharsis province, and the Hellas impact basin. The northern hemisphere depression is primarily a long-wavelength effect that has been shaped by an internal mechanism. The topography of Tharsis consists of two broad rises. Material excavated from Hellas contributes to the high elevation of the southern hemisphere and to the scarp along the hemispheric boundary. The present topography has three major drainage centers, with the northern lowlands being the largest. The two polar cap volumes yield an upper limit of the present surface water inventory of 3.2 to 4.7 million cubic kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W2103584087,"Proximity-induced superconductivity in single-walled carbon nanotubes below 1 kelvin, both in a single tube 1 nanometer in diameter and in crystalline ropes containing about 100 nanotubes, was observed. The samples were suspended between two superconducting electrodes, permitting structural study in a transmission electron microscope. When the resistance of the nanotube junction is sufficiently low, it becomes superconducting and can carry high supercurrents. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the critical current of such junctions exhibits unusual features related to their strong one-dimensional character."
https://openalex.org/W1964982794,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that has pleiotropic effects on a variety of different cell types. Although many of the biologic responses induced by IL-10 are also induced by other cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-10 is relatively unique in its ability to potently inhibit production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. In this study, we have used gain-of-function and loss-of-function genetic approaches to define the intracellular components involved in the different biologic actions of IL-10. Herein, we demonstrate that the ability of IL-10 to inhibit tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages requires the presence of Stat3, Jak1, and two distinct regions of the IL-10 receptor intracellular domain. Macrophages deficient in Stat3 or Jak1 were unable to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFα production following treatment with murine IL-10. Structure-function analysis of the intracellular domain of the IL-10 receptor α chain showed that whereas two redundant Stat3 recruitment sites (427YQKQ430 and477YLKQ480) were required for all IL-10-dependent effects on either B cells or macrophages, expression of IL-10-dependent anti-inflammatory function required the presence on the intracellular domain of the IL-10 receptor of a carboxyl-terminal sequence containing at least one functionally critical serine. These results thus demonstrate that IL-10-induced inhibition of TNFα production requires two distinct regions of the IL-10 receptor intracellular domain and thereby establish a distinctive molecular basis for the developmental versus the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10.

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; muIL, murine IL; huIL, human IL; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IFN, interferon; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. is a cytokine produced by Th0 and Th2 CD4+ T cells, CD5+ B cells, thymocytes, ketatinocytes, and macrophages (1Liu Y.

One of the most unique actions of this cytokine is its ability to inhibit production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), IL-1, and IL-12, which are synthesized by macrophages in response to bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This activity results in decreased IFNγ production and inhibition of cell-mediated immune responses while concomitantly enhancing humoral immunity (6Howard M. O'Garra A. Immunol.

Both subunits belong to the class II cytokine receptor family that also contains the receptors for IFNα and IFNγ (12Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). The IL-10 receptor α chain is a 110-kDa polypeptide that plays the dominant role in mediating high affinity ligand binding and signal transduction (1Liu Y. Wei S.H.-Y. Ho A.S.-Y. deWaal Malefyt R. Moore K.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 152: 1821-1829Google Scholar, 11Ho A.S.Y. Liu Y. Khan T.A. Hsu D.-H. Bazan J.F. Moore K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11267-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The IL-10 receptor β subunit (also known as CRF2–4) is predicted to be a 40-kDa polypeptide that is largely required only for signaling (13Spencer S.D. Di Marco F. Hooley J. Pitts-meek S. Bauer M.

Specifically, IL-10 effects the activation of Jak1 (associated with the IL-10 receptor α chain) and Tyk2 (associated with the IL-10 receptor β chain) and induces the activation of Stat1, Stat3, and, in some cells, Stat5 (15Finbloom D.S.

Previous work from our laboratory using cells from mice with disrupted genes for Jak1 and Stat1 has revealed that the characteristic ability of IL-10 to inhibit TNFα production in LPS-stimulated macrophages (i.e. anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10) displays an obligate dependence on Jak1 but does not require the presence of Stat1 (20Meraz M.A. White J.M.

Thus, whereas the Janus kinases are clearly required for promoting the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10, it remains uncertain which STAT protein, if any, is involved in mediating these unique IL-10-induced responses. Other studies have suggested that Stat3 participates in manifesting at least some of the biologic effects of IL-10 on B cells and macrophages. First, Stat3 is directly recruited to two redundant YXXQ sequences in the intracellular domain of the IL-10 receptor following ligand binding (18Weber-Nordt R.M. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C. Moore K.W. Darnell J.E. Schreiber R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27954-27961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Stahl N. Farrugglella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Receptor mutants lacking these two sequences fail to activate Stat3 and fail to promote a variety of IL-10-dependent responses when expressed in the Ba/F3 pro-B cell line (16Ho A.S.-Y. Wei S.H.-Y. Mui A.L.-F. Miyajima A. Moore K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5043-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Weber-Nordt R.M. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C. Moore K.W. Darnell J.E. Schreiber R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27954-27961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Second, overexpression of a dominant-negative Stat3 mutant protein in the J774 murine macrophage cell line inhibited IL-10-dependent antiproliferative responses and partially blocked IL-10-induced expression of the CD32/16 Fcγ receptor (23O'Farrell A.M. Liu Y. Moore K.W. Mui A.L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Importantly, these latter developmental responses are also effected by other cytokines that activate Stat3, such as IL-6. However, these same studies failed to find a blocking effect of mutant Stat3 proteins on the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10. Thus, the existing data suggest either that the IL-10 receptor utilizes different signaling mechanisms to manifest anti-inflammatory versus developmental effects or that different IL-10-induced biologic responses in cells display differential requirements for Stat3 activation. Herein we demonstrate that macrophages derived from mice engineered to express a genetic Stat3 deficiency in the myeloid cell compartment fail to respond to IL-10 and secrete high levels of TNFα upon stimulation with IL-10 plus LPS. These results thus unequivocally establish the requirement of Stat3 for the anti-inflammatory functions of IL-10 in primary cells. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function receptor mutants, we also define the functionally critical regions on the IL-10 receptor that regulate developmental versusanti-inflammatory functions of this cytokine. The developmental functions map to IL-10 receptor regions that are critical for Stat3 recruitment and that are shared by receptors for other cytokines that activate Stat3, such as IL-6. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory function of IL-10 displays the additional requirement for a carboxyl-terminal 30-amino acid sequence in the intracellular domain of the receptor that contains at least one functionally important serine residue. Thus, the unique anti-inflammatory functions of IL-10 can be explained by distinctive receptor intracellular domain sequences that are not shared by other Stat3 activating cytokine receptors. Recombinant murine IL-10 was generated as described previously (24Weber-Nordt R.M. Meraz M.A. Schreiber R.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3734-3744PubMed Google Scholar). Purified recombinant human and murine IFNγ were generously provided by Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Purified recombinant murine IL-3 and IL-6 were purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). M-CSF were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Escherichia coli0127:B8 was purchased from Difco (Detroit, MI). GIR-208 is a murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for the human IFNγ receptor (25Sheehan K.C.F. Calderon J. Schreiber R.D. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4231-4237PubMed Google Scholar), and 9E10 is a murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for a 13-amino acid peptide tag derived from the human c-Myc protein (SMEQKLISEEDLN) (26Evan G.I.

Plasmids were constructed using standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.1-1.8Google Scholar). The hgrα/IL-10Rα chimeric receptor (hgrα1–434aa/muIL-10Rα420–559aa) was created through the use of a two-step polymerase chain reaction as described previously (29Farrar M.A. Campbell J.D. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11706-11710Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Primers 100741 and 100141 were used as the 5′-and 3′-primers, whereas primers 100341 and 100242 were the internal primers used to generate the chimeric receptor. The chimeric receptor point mutants (hgrα/IL-10RαY427F, hgrα/IL-10RαY477F, and hgrα/IL-10RαY427F/Y477F) were also generated through the use of a two-step polymerase chain reaction. All chimeric receptor point mutants utilized primers 100741 and 100141 as the 5′- and 3′-primers. hgrα/IL-10RαY427F was constructed using primers 5393 and 5394 as the internal primers. hgrα/IL-10RαY477F was created using internal primers 5395 and 5396. In both cases, a Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that contained the wild type hgrα/IL-10Rα chimeric receptor was used as template. hgrα/IL-10RαY427F/Y477F was generated using internal primers 5395 and 5396. A Bluescript plasmid that contained hgrα/IL-10RαY427F was used as template. We generated a series of hgrα/IL-10Rα chimeric receptor truncation mutants by serially truncating 15 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the wild type hgrα/IL-10Rα chimeric receptor. All of the receptor truncation mutants were generated using primer 100741 as the 5′-primer. The 3′-primers used to construct hgrα/IL-10RαΔ1–4 were 38436, 38437, 38438, and 38439 respectively. The chimeric receptor serine to alanine mutant (hgrα/IL-10RαS541A/S544A/S553A/S554A) was generated using primers 100741 and 373356 as the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. All previously described constructs were digested withSmaI/HindIII and subcloned into a Bluescript plasmid that contained the wild type human IFNγ receptor α chain digested with the same enzymes. All constructs were then subcloned into the pSRα expression vector. The accuracy of all polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA was confirmed by automated sequencing (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). RAW264.7 cells, a murine monocyte-macrophage cell line, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2%l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Ba/F3 cells, a murine pro-B cell line, were generously provided by Kevin Moore (DNAX, Palo Alto, CA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 ng/ml muIL-3. Primary macrophages derived from fetal liver or bone marrow were prepared using CSF-1 as described (21Rodig S.J. Meraz M.A. White J.M. Lampe P.A. Riley J.K. Arthur C.D. King K.L. Sheehan K.C.F.

Cells were then placed in culture for two days in D-10 supplemented with 5% heat inactivated horse serum. Bone marrow macrophages derived from Stat3-deficient mice were >99% positive for MAC-1 and Fcγ receptor as determined by flow cytometry. Cells (1 × 107) were transfected with 50 μg of plasmid by electroporation at 320 V and 960 μF (RAW264.7 cells) or at 400 V and 960 μF (Ba/F3 cells) on a Bio-Rad gene pulser. Cotransfections were carried out using 5 μg of the pMon1118 plasmid (hygromycin resistance) and 45 μg of the expression plasmid. Selection with G418 and hygromycin B was begun 48 h after transfection. After selection was completed, cells were sorted based on their expression of both the hgrα/IL-10Rα chimeric receptor and the human IFNγ receptor β chain. Cell lines were subsequently cloned by limiting dilution. Similar results were obtained with bulk-transfected populations. Both RAW264.7 and Ba/F3 cells were stably transfected with a plasmid (pSRα, which confers neomycin resistance) (30Bach E.A. Tanner J.W. Marsters S.A. Ashkenazi A. Aguet M. Shaw A.S. Schreiber R.D.

RAW264.7 cells transfected with different forms of the chimeric receptor and the human IFNγ receptor β chain were selected on G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., 1.0 mg/ml active compound) and 0.5 mg/ml of hygromycin B (Calbiochem). Ba/F3 cells transfected with receptor constructs were selected using G418 (1.0 mg/ml active compound) and 1.3 mg/ml hygromycin B. Flow cytometry for the hgrα/IL-10Rα chimeric receptor and receptor mutants or the human IFNγ receptor β chain was conducted using the biotinylated forms of GIR-208 (anti-human IFNγ receptor) and 9E10 (anti-c-Myc peptide) respectively and streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate (Chromoprobe, Redwood City, CA) as described (31Farrar M.A. Fernandez-Luna J.

Cells (5 × 106) were washed once and then resuspended in 500 μl of medium. 1000 units/ml murine or human IFNγ or 200 ng/ml muIL-10 was added to the cells and incubated for 7 min at 37 °C. The cells were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described previously (32Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) using an 18-base pair oligonucleotide probe that contained the gamma response region of the FcγRI gene. Ba/F3 cells were washed twice in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium that lacked muIL-3. The cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and rested for 3 h in the absence of muIL-3. The cells were then incubated with varying amounts of huIFNγ or muIL-10 in a total volume of 150 μl of medium. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and an 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay was performed as described previously (33Traversari C. van der Bruggen P.

Experiments were performed at least three times using multiple clones of each transfected cell line. Similar results were obtained using transfected bulk populations. RAW264.7 cells were washed once, seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well, and incubated with varying amounts of huIFNγ, muIL-6, or muIL-10 in a total volume of 150 μl supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then treated with 10 ng of LPS/well. The cells were placed at 37 °C for 24 h, at which point the culture supernatants were harvested, and TNFα levels were quantitated via a TNFα ELISA (34Sheehan K.C.F. Ruddle N.H. Schreiber R.D. J.

Similar results were obtained using transfected bulk populations. Peritoneal exudate cells (5 × 104) derived from naive female BALB/c ByJ mice were plated in each well of a 96-well tissue culture plate. Cells were allowed to adhere for 3 h. Adherent peritoneal exudate cells were then washed twice with warm medium and treated as described above. Macrophages derived from Stat3-, Stat1-, and Jak1-deficient mice were cultured as described above. Cells were incubated with different doses of muIL-10 for 12 h. LPS was added at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml, and the cells were cultured for and additional 24 h. Culture supernatants were harvested, and TNFα levels were quantitated via a TNFα ELISA. To determine whether Stat3 is required for the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10, we monitored the ability of this cytokine to inhibit LPS-induced TNFα production in macrophages derived from mice with a genetic deficiency of Stat3 targeted to myeloid cells (35Takeda K. Clausen B.E. Kaisho T. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Forster I. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 10: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). IL-10 treatment of wild type macrophages resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced TNFα production that reached maximal levels at a 1 ng/ml dose of IL-10 (Fig.1). In contrast, macrophages derived from mice with a myeloid cell Stat3 deficiency were unable to inhibit LPS-induced TNFα production at any dose of IL-10 used. As additional controls, macrophages from Jak1−/− and Stat1−/− mice were also tested in these experiments for IL-10 sensitivity (21Rodig S.J. Meraz M.A. White J.M. Lampe P.A. Riley J.K. Arthur C.D.

Thus, Stat3, together with Jak1, is obligatorily required for IL-10-dependent inhibition of TNFα production in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Whereas these results demonstrated that Stat3 was required for mediating the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10, they did not reveal whether it was sufficient to induce these functions. To address this issue, we compared the anti-inflammatory action of IL-10 to that of IL-6, a cytokine that utilizes a distinct receptor system but that also activates Stat3 and Jak1. Pretreatment of RAW264.7 cells with increasing doses of IL-10 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of TNFα production, reaching a maximal level of 75% at a dose of 200 ng of the cytokine (Fig.2 A). In contrast, RAW264.7 cells pretreated with IL-6 were only slightly inhibited in their ability to produce TNFα (maximal level of inhibition, 30% at a 200-ng dose of IL-6). We also compared the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10 and IL-6 on primary murine macrophages. Here again, whereas IL-10 displayed potent inhibitory activity on TNFα production, IL-6 did not (Fig. 2 B). These functional differences could not be ascribed to different levels of Stat3 activation because the kinetics and ultimate magnitude of Stat3 activated by IL-10 and IL-6 in either RAW264.7 cells or primary macrophages was identical (data not shown). Thus, the JAK-STAT pathway is required but not sufficient for IL-10-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced TNFα production. To identify functionally critical amino acid residues within the intracellular domain of the muIL-10 receptor ligand binding chain involved in mediating the anti-inflammatory versus developmental effects of IL-10, we generated a chimeric receptor that consisted of the human IFNγ receptor α chain extracellular and transmembrane domains and the first 184 amino acids of the intracellular domain (i.e.truncated just above the Stat1 docking site) attached to a 140-amino acid region of the murine IL-10 receptor carboxyl terminus, which contains the Stat3 docking sites (Fig.3). The resulting chimeric receptor thus consists of the human IFNγRα chain that retained the Jak1 binding site and lacked the Stat1 docking site but now contained the two redundant IL-10 receptor Stat3 docking sites. The chimeric polypeptide was then expressed in murine RAW264.7 macrophages or Ba/F3 pro-B cells that had been engineered to also stably express the human IFNγ receptor β chain (Table I).Table IExpression levels of wild type and mutant hgrα/IL-10Rα chimeric receptors on RAW264.7 and BaF3 cellsChimeric receptorSubunit expression (mean channel shift)RAW264.7Ba/F3α chainβ chainα chainβ chainhgrα/IL-10Rα27.19.8216.58.0hgrα/IL-10RαY427F23.237.212.217.3hgrα/IL-10RαY477F47.55.717.110.3hgrα/IL-10RαY427F/Y477F22.230.610.216.9hgrα/IL-10RαΔ123.627.619.717.2hgrα/IL-10RαΔ215.038.416.811.3hgrα/IL-10RαΔ319.025.714.610.0hgrα/IL-10RαΔ419.333.421.210.0hgrα/IL-10RαS541A/S544A/S553A/S554A16.225.5 Open table in a new tab Engagement of the endogenous IL-10 receptor on RAW264.7 cells with muIL-10 led to a dose-dependent inhibition of TNFα production in LPS-treated cells (Fig.4 A). HuIFNγ has no effect on these cells because of the strict species specificity that governs the interaction of IFNγ with its receptor. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells expressing the hgrα/IL-10Rα chimeric receptor with human IFNγ induced a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-dependent TNFα production in a manner that was quantitatively identical to that induced by the activated, endogenous IL-10 receptor. In contrast, treatment of wild type or transfected RAW264.7 cells with murine IFNγ caused a dose-dependent increase of TNFα production (data not shown). In a similar manner, Ba/F3 engineered to express the wild type muIL-10 receptor proliferated in the presence of muIL-10 (Fig. 4 B) but did not respond to human IFNγ. In contrast, Ba/F3 cells bearing the hgrα/IL-10Rα chimeric receptor proliferated upon exposure to human IFNγ. Thus, transfer of IL-10 receptor sequences containing the Stat3 recruitment sites to the IFNγ receptor results in the generation of a modified IFNγ receptor that promotes IL-10-dependent rather than IFNγ-dependen"

Nighttime temperatures form an unexpected pattern, with high temperatures on the bright ejecta blanket of the crater Pwyll and an equatorial minimum in temperatures after sunset, uncorrelated with surface albedo or geology. The nighttime anomalies may be due to regional thermal inertia variations of an unknown origin, which are equivalent to a two- to threefold variation in thermal conductivity, or to endogenic heat fluxes locally reaching 1 watt per square meter. Endogenic heat flow at this high level, although consistent with some geological evidence, is theoretically unlikely."

Little is known about the internal targeting information in preproteins and the distribution of binding sequences for the three import receptors. We have studied the binding of the purified cytosolic domains of Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70 to cellulose-bound peptide scans derived from a presequence-carrying cleavable preprotein, cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, and a non-cleavable preprotein with internal targeting information, the phosphate carrier. All three receptor domains are able to bind efficiently to linear 13-mer peptides, yet with different specificity. Tom20 preferentially binds to presequence segments of subunit IV. Tom22 binds to segments corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal part of the presequence and the amino-terminal part of the mature protein. Tom70 does not bind efficiently to any region of subunit IV. In contrast, Tom70 and Tom20 bind to multiple segments within the phosphate carrier, yet the amino-terminal region is excluded. Both charged and uncharged peptides derived from the phosphate carrier show specific binding properties for Tom70 and Tom20, indicating that charge is not a critical determinant of internal targeting sequences.

Many mitochondrial preproteins are synthesized with amino-terminal extensions, termed presequences, that function as targeting signals to direct the preproteins into mitochondria (1Schatz G.

Upon import into the mitochondrial matrix, the positively charged amphipathic presequences are cleaved off by a specific peptidase. Studies with fusion proteins consisting of a presequence and a non-mitochondrial passenger protein demonstrated that a presequence contains sufficient information for specifically directing the import of proteins into mitochondria (4Hurt E.C.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In many other cases, in particular membrane proteins, the available information on the targeting signals is limited. The largest family of mitochondrial membrane proteins is the inner membrane metabolite carriers, including the ADP/ATP carrier and the phosphate carrier (19Palmieri F.

Each carrier protein is ∼300 amino acids in length and contains six membrane-spanning segments. Three homologous domains, each with two membrane-spanning segments, constitute a carrier protein. On the one hand, the amino-terminal third of a carrier was sufficient for targeting to mitochondria, and a region in the second half of this domain seemed to constitute at least part of an import signal (22Adrian G.S. McCammon M.T. Montgomery D.L. Douglas M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23Liu X. Bell A.W. Freeman K.B. Shore G.C. J.

Although a further analysis of internal targeting signals in the carrier preproteins has not been reported in the past 10 years, major progress was made in the identification and characterization of the mitochondrial outer membrane proteins that recognize and translocate preproteins. A multisubunit machinery containing at least eight different subunits was identified and termed the translocase of the outer membrane (designated Tom) (reviewed in Refs. 1Schatz G. Dobberstein B.

Three Tom proteins, Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70, were shown to function as import receptors in vivo and in organello. The expressed cytosolic domains of the import receptors were able to specifically bind mitochondrial preproteins in vitro (28Schlossmann J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol.

Tom22 binds cleavable preproteins; Tom70 preferentially binds non-cleavable preproteins; and Tom20 binds both cleavable and non-cleavable preproteins. Synthetic presequence peptides were able to interact with the purified cytosolic domains of Tom20 and Tom22 as shown by their competition of binding of full-length cleavable preproteins (29Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30Komiya T. Rospert S. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that the linear peptides contained sufficient information for specific recognition by the mitochondrial presequence receptors. The presequence peptides, however, did not influence the binding of a carrier preprotein to Tom70 or Tom20 (29Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For this study, we attempted to obtain information about the mechanism of interaction of carrier preproteins with import receptors. In particular, we asked if a carrier preprotein contained short binding sequences for receptors. Because the current knowledge did not allow the prediction of possible binding sequences in a carrier preprotein, we decided to undertake a systematic approach with cellulose-bound peptide scans (33Reineke U. Sabat R. Kramer A. Stigler R.D. Seifert M. Michel T. Volk H.D. Schneider-Mergener J. Mol. Divers. 1996; 1: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) and the expressed receptor domains. A peptide scan derived from a cleavable preprotein was selected for comparison and validated the specificity of the approach, i.e. Tom20 and Tom22 preferentially bound to peptides derived from the amino-terminal region of a presequence-containing preprotein. In contrast, the amino-terminal region of the phosphate carrier was found to be devoid of linear binding sequences for import receptors, yet multiple binding sequences for Tom70 and also Tom20 were observed throughout the remainder of the protein. Thus, both cleavable and non-cleavable preproteins contain linear binding sequences that are, however, of striking difference in the selection of receptors and the distribution over the preproteins. This study implies the existence of different mechanisms for recognition of non-cleavable and cleavable mitochondrial preproteins. Expression and purification were performed essentially as described (29Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).

Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonified. After a clarifying spin, the supernatant was applied to Mobicol columns containing Ni2+-NTA 1The abbreviations used are: NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Tom20cd, Tom22cd, and Tom70cd, expressed cytosolic domains of Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70, respectively; CoxIV, cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV. -agarose resin (QIAGEN Inc.). After five washes with 80 mmimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, the Tom domains were eluted with 1 m imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and dialyzed against 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. One aliquot was taken to test for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and for protein concentration by the Bradford assay or absorption at 280 nm. The cellulose-bound peptide scans were prepared by automated spot synthesis (33Reineke U. Sabat R. Kramer A. Stigler R.D. Seifert M. Michel T. Volk H.D. Schneider-Mergener J. Mol.

The dry membranes were incubated once with methanol and three times with wash buffer (100 mm KCl and 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6) at room temperature for 10 min. For analysis of protein binding activity, the membrane was incubated with 150 nm Tom protein (expressed cytosolic domains) in binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) for 60 min at 25 °C with gentle shaking. Nonspecifically bound protein was removed by washing the membrane with wash buffer for 3 min at room temperature, and peptide-bound protein was electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semidry blotter. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the cellulose membrane were laid on top of filter papers soaked in cathode buffer (75 mm Tris base, 120 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, and 0.01% SDS) and overlaid with filter papers soaked in anode buffers AI and AII (AI = 90 mm Tris base; and AII = 300 mm Tris base) at 4 °C. Blotting was performed at a constant power of 0.8 mA/cm2 of cellulose membrane. The Tom protein transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was detected by specific antisera using a fluorescence blotting substrate (ECF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a fluorescence scanning system (Fuji). Quantitation was performed with the program TINA (Raytest), including subtraction of the local background for each peptide spot. The means of at least three independent experiments for each peptide spot were used (average units). The values for different membranes were adjusted by use of identical reference peptides on each membrane. To correlate the peptide binding values with the amino acid sequence, the average units obtained for each peptide covering a given amino acid were added and divided by the number of peptides (typically four to five different peptides/residue), yielding normalized units. The preprotein of the phosphate carrier was synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine and incubated with Ni2+-NTA resin-bound Tom70cd or Tom20cd for 40 min at 30 °C as described (29Brix J.

Where indicated, synthetic peptides, blocked amino-terminally by acetylation and carboxyl-terminally by amidation, were added. Bound proteins were eluted with 1 m imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and analyzed by digital autoradiography (phosphor storage imaging technology, Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The import receptor Tom20 possesses a hydrophobic membrane anchor directly at the amino terminus, whereas the remainder of the protein is exposed to the cytosol (Fig. 1 A) (38Schneider H. Söllner T.

The scans consisted of 13-mer peptides overlapping by 10 residues, which were covalently attached to the cellulose membrane. Thus, 49 peptides were synthesized for this 155-residue preprotein. Tom20cdwas incubated to equilibrium with the cellulose-bound peptides, followed by electrotransfer and immunodetection of the receptor domain (Fig. 1 B). Bovine serum albumin, in a 50-fold molar excess over the receptor domains, was included in the binding assay to minimize nonspecific binding of proteins to the membranes. A quantitative analysis was performed using the TINA program, which corrects for the local background around each individual peptide spot. The best binding efficiency of Tom20cd was observed with peptides derived from the amino-terminal region of CoxIV (Fig.1 D, upper panel). For a non-cleavable preprotein, the S. cerevisiae phosphate carrier was selected, which was previously shown to bind to Tom70 and Tom20 in organello and in vitro (29Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J.

Tom20cdbound to multiple regions of the phosphate carrier peptide scan (Fig.1 C). By inclusion of reference peptides on each peptide scan (data not shown), the results from the CoxIV and phosphate carrier peptide scans were quantitatively comparable. The quantitation is presented in Fig. 1 D (lower panel). The binding efficiency of Tom20cd with numerous peptides derived from the phosphate carrier was at least as high as that with amino-terminal CoxIV peptides. Interestingly, peptides derived from the amino-terminal region of the phosphate carrier did not interact with Tom20cd. The single membrane anchor of Tom22 is located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the receptor. In contrast to Tom20 and Tom70, Tom22 exposes its amino terminus to the cytosol (Fig.2 A) (47Kiebler M.

The cytosolic domain of S. cerevisiae Tom22 with a carboxyl-terminal His10 tag (29Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) was expressed in E. coli and purified via Ni2+-NTA. Tom22cd was incubated with the CoxIV peptide scan (Fig.2 B) and the phosphate carrier peptide scan (Fig.2 C), followed by quantitative analysis (Fig. 2 D). Tom22cd efficiently bound to peptide spots in the amino-terminal region of CoxIV, i.e. within the first 10 peptides. The peak region included peptides P4–P9 (Fig. 2,B and D, upper panel). In comparison, the peak region for binding of Tom20cd to CoxIV peptides included peptides P1–P6 (Fig. 1 D). Thus, both Tom20cd and Tom22cd show the best binding to the amino-terminal region of CoxIV, yet the peak is shifted by approximately three peptides, i.e. ∼9 amino acids. The remainder of the CoxIV sequence provided only few binding peptides for Tom22cd (Fig. 2, B and D, upper panel). The phosphate carrier peptide scan revealed several binding sequences for Tom22cd scattered over various regions of the preprotein (Fig. 2, C and D, lower panel). In comparison with Tom20cd, however, a striking difference was observed. Although numerous and efficient binding peptides for Tom20cd were found (Fig.1 D, lower panel), both the number of peptides and the intensity of interaction with Tom22cd were significantly lower. The single membrane anchor of Tom70 is located at the amino terminus (50Hase T. Riezman H. Suda K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2169-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 51Steger H.F. Söllner T. Kiebler M. Dietmeier K.A. Pfaller R. Trülzsch K.S. Tropschug M. Neupert W. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2353-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The membrane anchor of S. cerevisiae Tom70 was replaced by a His10 tag; the resulting cytosolic domain was expressed in E. coli cells and purified (29Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In contrast to Tom20cd and Tom22cd, binding of Tom70cd to the CoxIV peptide scan was nearly absent (Fig.3 B). A few weak binding spots were observed in the amino-terminal region (Fig. 3 D,upper panel). With the phosphate carrier-derived peptide scan, however, several clusters of high efficient binding of Tom70cd were found (Fig. 3, C and D,lower panel). Interestingly, only weak binding of Tom70cd was observed within the first 23 peptides, comprising the amino-terminal ∼70 residues of the phosphate carrier. We conclude that the non-cleavable preprotein of the phosphate carrier, but not the cleavable CoxIV preprotein, contains multiple linear binding sequences for Tom70cd. Since the peptides overlap such that a single amino acid is covered by four to five consecutive peptides of the scan (except the penultimate amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal residues), the quantitation data shown in Figs. 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D did not readily allow a correlation of the binding efficiencies with the amino acid sequences of the preproteins. We therefore developed a score to assign the binding efficiencies for the receptor domains throughout the linear sequences of CoxIV and the phosphate carrier. For each amino acid, the binding units determined for the peptides covering this residue (average units in Figs. 1 D, 2 D, and3 D) were added and normalized for the number of peptides. The resulting normalized units can be directly aligned with the linear sequences of CoxIV (Fig. 4) and the phosphate carrier (Fig. 5). The binding properties for the CoxIV peptide scan were analyzed first since a comparison was possible to the in organello import studies with various constructs of CoxIV (4Hurt E.C. Pesold-Hurt B.

We report the cloning, sequence analysis, tissue distribution, genomic organization, and functional analysis of a new member of the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) family, NBC3, from human skeletal muscle. mNBC3 encodes a 1214-residue polypeptide with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains. The ∼ 7.8-kilobase transcript is expressed uniquely in skeletal muscle and heart. The NBC3 gene (SLC4A7) spans ∼80 kb and is composed of 25 coding exons and 24 introns that are flanked by typical splice donor and acceptor sequences.

Furthermore, a sodium bicarbonate cotransporter has also been cloned from human kidney (kNBC1) and human pancreas (pNBC1) (38Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol.

The kidney uniquely expresses the kNBC1 isoform, predominantly in the proximal tubule, whereas expression of pNBC1 is more widespread (39Abuladze N. Lee I. Newman D. Hwang J. Boorer K. Pushkin A.

In this paper, we report the cloning, sequence analysis, tissue distribution, genomic organization, and functional analysis of this new member of the NBC family, NBC3.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe report the cloning, sequence analysis, tissue distribution, genomic organization, and functional characterization of a new member of the NBC family, NBC3, which is uniquely expressed in skeletal muscle and heart muscle. Partial sequence information obtained from human expressed sequence tag clones and 5′ and 3′ RACE products were used for generating probes to screen a human muscle λgt11 cDNA library to obtain full-length mNBC3. The nucleotide sequence of mNBC3 is 7785 nucleotides in length, with a predicted open reading frame of 3642 nucleotides, as 5′-untranslated region of 71 nucleotides and a 3′-untranslated region of 4072 nucleotides (GenBankTM/EMBL Data Bank with the accession number AF047033). mNBC3 is homologous to several expressed sequence tag sequences (human: AA205898, AA535856AA569234, AA188932, AA852668, AA243166, AA476540, AA227419, AA216661,AA243228, AA218565, AA101282, Z19373, R57438, AA494043, AA630595,H66521, AF00103, and Z20394; mouse: AA166155, AA689098, and AA592390). Beginning with methionine at position 1, an open reading frame codes for a protein of 1214 amino acids. Fig. 1demonstrates the protein alignment of mNBC3 with other members of the NBC family and the anion exchanger bAE3. mNBC3 is 78% homologous to NBC2; 39 and 46% homologous to pNBC1 and kNBC1, respectively, and 29% homologous to bAE3.The secondary structure analyses and hydropathy profile of the protein predict an intrinsic membrane protein with 12 putative transmembrane domains (Fig. 2); N-linked glycosylation sites in exofacial loops 1–2 and 5–6; protein kinases A and C, casein kinase II, and ATP/GTP-binding consensus phosphorylation sites; potential sites for myristylation and amidation; and cytoplasmic N and C termini. A large exofacial loop is present between predicted membrane domains 1 and 2. The first of two putative stilbene-binding motifs (K(M/L)XK) shared by other members of the anion exchanger superfamily (AE1, AE2, AE3, pNBC1, and kNBC1) is lacking in mNBC3, which has the sequence KLFD (amino acids 742–745). The replacement of the highly conserved lysine at position 745 by aspartic acid may block negatively charged stilbene disulfonates from binding and alter the K i of these compounds for mNBC3 (44Wood P.G.

A synthetic 95-bp oligonucleotide probe (nucleotides 1002–1096) specific for the unique region of mNBC3 was randomly primed and labeled with [32P]dCTP and [32P]dATP. This probe hybridized to a ∼7.8-kb transcript in mRNA from skeletal muscle and heart. These results indicate the mNBC3 transcript is muscle-specific. We have recently determined the chromosomal localization of the mNBC3 gene by fluorescent in situhybridization (46Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Lee I. Newman D. Hwang J. Kurtz I. Genomics. 1999; 57: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). mNBC3 maps to a position that is 19% of the distance from the centromere to the telomere of chromosome arm 3p, an area that corresponds to band 3p22. Recently, Olsen and Keating (47Olsen T.M. Keating M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) have studied a family with dilated cardiomyopathy associated with sinus node dysfunction, supraventricular tachyarrythmias, conduction delay, and stroke. The disease gene has been mapped to a 30 cM region of chromosome 3p22–3p25 excluding genes encoding a G-protein (GNA12), calcium channel (CACNL1A2), sodium channel (SCN5A), and inositol triphosphate receptor. The finding that mNBC3 maps to this region suggests that it is a new candidate gene potentially causing familial dilated cardiomyopathy.Figure 3Northern blot analysis of expression of mNBC3 in human tissues.

The gene coding for mNBC3 is composed of 25 exons and 24 introns and spans ∼80 kb. The exon sizes ranged from 82 to 4123 bp. The large 3′-untranslated region is contained in exon 25. Intron sizes were not determined. All intron sequences match known consensus donor and acceptor splice sites. The genomic organization of the related anion exchange gene family differs in several respects. There are 20 exons in the AE1 gene and 23 exons in the AE2 and AE3 genes if alternate exons transcribed from internal promoters are excluded. For all AE family members the first exon consists of the 5′-untranslated region, and the second exon contains translation start site. In the NBC3 gene there are 25 exons, and the translation start site is contained in the first exon. In NBC3 (SLC4A7), the large 3′-end exon (exon 25) codes for the 3′-terminus of the polypeptide and the 3′-untranslated region.Figure 4Intron/exon boundaries of the human NBC3 (approved symbol SLC4A7) gene.

Polyadenylated cRNA prepared as described above was injected into oocytes and allowed to express for at least 72 h. As shown in Fig. 5, augmented 22Na uptake was observed in oocytes injected with mNBC3 cRNA. The uptake was increased by approximately 12 nmol/h/oocyte in cRNA-injected oocytes (3.44 ± 0.34 nmol/h/oocyte in control oocytes (n= 24) versus 15.3 ± 1.44 nmol/h/oocyte (n = 32), p < 0.001). 22Na uptake was not significantly different in oocytes exposed to Cl−-free solutions (15.3 ± 1.44 nmol/h/oocyte (n = 32) versus 13.8 ± 1.30 nmol/h/oocyte (n = 16) in oocytes exposed to Cl−-free solutions). Uptake was not significantly affected by DIDS (1 mm; 16.5 ± 1.56 nmol/h/oocyte (n = 8)) but was completely inhibited by EIPA (50 μm; 3.28 ± 0.38 nmol/h/oocyte (n = 16), p < 0.02). 86Rb uptake was similar in control oocytes and cRNA-injected oocytes (controls 1.04 ± 0.04 nmol/h/oocyte (n = 16) versus 2.55 ± 0.04 nmol/h/oocyte (n = 16) in cRNA-injected oocytes).Figure 5Functional expression of mNBC3 inXenopus laevis oocytes. 22Na uptake (expressed in nmol/h/oocyte) in control oocytes or with mNBC3 cRNA-injected oocytes 3–6 days after injection was measured in chloride-free solutions and in the presence of DIDS (1 mm) or EIPA (50 μm). Each bar represents the mean ± S.E. of 8–32 oocytes. 22Na uptake was significantly increased by mNBC3 cRNA versus control oocytes (p < 0.001) and inhibited in the presence of 50 μm EIPA (p < 0.02). Furthermore, in cRNA-injected oocytes 22Na uptake was not affected by chloride removal or 1 mm DIDS. 86Rb uptake (expressed as nmol/h/oocyte) was also assessed in control oocytes and in mNBC3 cRNA-injected oocytes. 86Rb uptake was similar in both groups.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Further studies were done measuring pHi transients in control oocytes and those injected with mNBC3 cRNA (Fig.6). All studies were performed in the absence of chloride given the lack of dependence of the22Na uptake results on the presence of chloride. In bicarbonate-buffered solutions, resting pHi was 7.14 ± 0.02 (n = 4) in control oocytes and 7.29 ± 0.04 (n = 5) in cRNA-injected oocytes (p < 0.05). After extracellular Na+ was removed in bicarbonate-buffered solutions, in control oocytes, pHi failed to decrease (Fig. 6 a). In contrast, in the cRNA-injected oocytes, at a resting pHi of 7.29 ± 0.04 (n = 5), pHi decreased at a rate of −0.14 ± 0.02 pH/min (n = 5), p < 0.001 (Fig. 6 b). Further experiments were done to determine whether K+-induced pHi transients would be present. As shown in a typical experiment in Fig. 6 c, in bicarbonate-buffered solutions, increasing the external K+from 2 to 50 mm in cRNA-injected oocytes had no effect on pHi. These results suggest that 1) mNBC3 is K+-independent as was also shown by the 86Rb flux measurements and 2) depolarizing the oocyte membrane potential using high K+ solutions (48Dascal N. Landau E.M. Lass Y. J. Physiol. 1984; 352: 551-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) has no measurable effect on pHi in cRNA-injected oocytes, suggesting that the transport process is electroneutral. In Hepes buffered-solutions, following Na+ removal at a resting pHi of ∼7.5, pHidecreased at a rate of −0.17 ± 0.02 pH/min (n = 4) (Fig. 6 d). The rate of change of pHi in Hepes-buffered solutions when pHi had decreased to ∼7.3 (resting pHi in bicarbonate-buffered solutions), was −0.15 ± 0.01 pH/min (n = 4). Furthermore, at a minimum pHi of ∼6.5, following the readdition of Na+ in bicarbonate-buffered solutions pHi increased at a rate of 0.13 ± 0.01 pH/min versus 0.12 ± 0.01 pH/min in Hepes-buffered solutions. Given the difference in intracellular buffer capacities in Hepes and bicarbonate-containing solutions, the results suggest that the rate of equivalent base flux is greater in the presence of bicarbonate in cRNA-injected oocytes. In separate experiments the effect of DIDS and EIPA inhibition was studied. In cRNA-injected oocytes, DIDS (1 mm) did not significantly modify the decrease in pHi induced by Na+ removal (−0.12 ± 0.01 pH/min (n= 3), p = NS; Fig. 6 e). In contrast, EIPA (50 μm) completely blocked the Na+-induced pHi transients in cRNA-injected oocytes (0.02 pH/min ± 0.01 pH/min (n = 3), p < 0.001; Fig.6 f). The dependence of mNBC3 transport on external Na+ is shown in Fig.7 a. In these studies, Na+ was repeatedly removed to acidify pHi to a value of ∼7.0. Various concentrations of Na+ were added to determine the external Na+ dependence of the transporter. The data indicate that the external K mfor external Na+ under these conditions is ∼24 mm (Fig. 7 b).Figure 6Intracellular pH measurements in X. laevis oocytes 5–14 days after injection.

Na+ was repeatedly removed to acidify pHi to a value of ∼7.0. Various concentrations of Na+ were added when pHi decreased to ∼7.0. The Na+-dependent rate (at each Na+concentration) was calculated by subtracting the rate of change in pHi immediately prior to the addition of Na+ (the acidification rate in zero Na+ at pH ∼ 7.0) from the initial rate of change in pHi following the addition of a particular concentration of Na+. Once the initial rate of change in pHi was measured for a given Na+concentration, pHi was returned more rapidly to ∼7.5 by the addition of 108 mm Na+ followed by another phase of Na+ removal. b, a Hanes-Woolf analysis of the data revealed that the external K m for Na+ is ∼24 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The properties of mNBC3 closely resemble those of Na+-dependent HCO3− transport activity previously described in certain smooth muscle cells.

https://openalex.org/W2018709037,"The Cbl proto-oncogene product has emerged as a novel negative regulator of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Our previous observations that Cbl overexpression in NIH3T3 cells enhanced the ubiquitination and degradation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) and that the expression of oncogenic Cbl mutants up-regulated the PDGFRα signaling machinery strongly suggested that Cbl negatively regulates PDGFRα signaling. Here, we show that, similar to PDGFRα, selective stimulation of PDGFRβ induces Cbl phosphorylation, and its physical association with the receptor. Overexpression of wild type Cbl in NIH3T3 cells led to an enhancement of the ligand-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the PDGFRβ, as observed with PDGFRα. We show that Cbl-dependent negative regulation of PDGFRα and β results in a reduction of PDGF-induced cell proliferation and protection against apoptosis. A point mutation (G306E) that inactivates the tyrosine kinase binding domain in the N-terminal transforming region of Cbl compromised the PDGF-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl although this mutant could still associate with the PDGFR. More importantly, the G306E mutation abrogated the ability of Cbl to enhance the ligand-induced ubiquitination and degradation of the PDGFR and to inhibit the PDGF-dependent cell proliferation and protection from apoptosis. These results demonstrate that Cbl can negatively regulate PDGFR-dependent biological responses and that this function requires the conserved tyrosine kinase binding domain of Cbl.

Cbl is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon stimulation through a number of receptors, resulting in the association of Cbl with SH2 domain-containing proteins, such as the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, the Crk adaptor protein family, and the Rac exchange factor VAV. Recently, the phosphopeptide motifs that mediate these interactions have been localized within the C-terminal third of Cbl (7Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y.

Furthermore, a large proline-rich region (amino acids 481–690) in Cbl mediates interactions with the SH3 domains of Src family PTKs and the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Nck, thus promoting the formation of signaling protein complexes that are present in cells prior to receptor activation. Although these associations have promoted the notion that Cbl functions as a complex adaptor protein to couple PTKs to downstream signaling pathways, lack of evolutionary conservation of the C-terminal region suggests that the primary role of Cbl may be different. Indeed, a number of recent biochemical and genetic studies have identified Cbl as a novel negative regulator of receptor and non-receptor PTKs (2Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L.

The first evidence for the role of Cbl as a negative regulator of tyrosine kinase signaling was provided by studies of vulval development in Caenorhabditis elegans, a process that requires the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase, a homologue of the mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (11Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A negative regulator of signaling downstream of the LET-23 receptor, the suppressor of lineage defect 1 (sli-1), was shown to encode a Cbl homologue (SLI-1). Recently, a Drosophila Cbl homologue (d-Cbl) was also identified and shown to function as a negative regulator of theDrosophila EGFR-mediated R7 photoreceptor development (12Meisner H. Daga A.

The Cbl TKB domain was shown to bind to the negative regulatory phosphorylation sites within the SH2 kinase linker of ZAP70 and Syk PTKs (15Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C.

These binding activities were abrogated by a mutation (G306E), equivalent to the loss of function mutation (G315E) in SLI-1. Notably, Cbl overexpression in the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3 led to a decrease in the autophosphorylation and kinase activity of Syk and inhibition of degranulation in response to FcεR1 stimulation (18Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); the Cbl-induced reduction in Syk tyrosine kinase activity requires an intact Cbl TKB domain (16Lupher Jr., M.L.

Overexpression of Cbl in Jurkat T cells was shown to reduce Ras-dependent AP1 transcription factor activity, whereas overexpression of the oncogenic 70Z/3 Cbl mutant induced an enhancement of basal and Ca2+ionophore-induced nuclear factor of activated T cell reporter activity (9Liu Y.C.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30806-30811Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These studies have highlighted the role of Cbl as a negative regulator of ZAP70/Syk PTKs. A potential role for Cbl as a negative regulator of mammalian receptor PTKs is suggested by a number of findings. Decreased autophosphorylation of the EGFR and lower JAK-STAT phosphorylation was observed in NIH3T3 cells that overexpressed Cbl, and higher EGFR autophosphorylation was seen in antisense Cbl-transfected cells (20Ueno H. Sasaki K. Miyagawa K. Honda H. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Conversely, NIH3T3 cells expressing oncogenic forms of Cbl revealed a hyperphosphorylation of PDGFRα and an up-regulation of signaling downstream of this receptor (21Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, NIH3T3 cells expressing the oncogenic forms of Cbl showed an increase in the autophosphorylation and kinase activity of a transfected human EGFR, both under serum-starved and EGF-stimulated conditions (22Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Apparently, the effect of the oncogenic mutants of Cbl on PDGFRα and EGFR reflects a reversal of the negative regulatory role of endogenous wild type Cbl. Although the above studies clearly implicated Cbl as a negative regulator of PTKs, the biochemical and cell biological mechanisms mediating such an effect have been less clear. Recently, we showed that Cbl overexpression in NIH3T3 cells led to the enhancement of the PDGF-induced ubiquitination and degradation of the PDGFRα (23Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that one mechanism of the negative regulatory function of Cbl for receptor PTKs may be at the level of regulating the ligand-induced turnover of PDGFRα. Here, we have extended these initial observations along three major directions. First, we show that Cbl regulates both the α and β PDGF receptors. Second, we show that an intact TKB domain is required for Cbl-dependent enhancement of ubiquitination and degradation of the PDGFR. Finally, we demonstrate that Cbl-mediated negative regulation of the PDGF receptors is biologically relevant in that Cbl overexpression induces a TKB domain-dependent reduction in PDGF-induced cell proliferation. These studies generalize the role of Cbl in regulating receptor PTK signaling and suggest a direct correlation between the biological functions of Cbl and its ability to regulate ligand-induced receptor ubiquitination and degradation. Parental and transfected NIH3T3 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT). Transfectants of the PDGFRα-negative Patch mutant mouse-derived 3T3 cell line (Ph) (28Seifert R.A. van Koppen A. Bowen-Pope D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4473-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. For all transfectants, the medium was supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfectants were established by retroviral transfection using pJZenNeo plasmid constructs, as described (21Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Clonal transfectants of the NIH3T3 cells overexpressing the N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged human Cbl (3T3-HA-Cbl.8 and 3T3-HA-Cbl.9, referred to here as Cbl.8 and Cbl.9, respectively) have been described previously (21Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Additional NIH3T3 cell clones expressing HA-Cbl (Cbl.2–8) or HA-Cbl-G306E (G306E.1–10 and G306E.2–3) and the pJZenNeo vector-transfected clones (pJ.1 and pJ.8) were derived using the same retroviral transfection approach. The HA-Cbl expressing (Ph-Cbl.1–8, Ph-Cbl.2–8, and Ph-Cbl.2–10) or the pJZenNeo vector-transfected (Ph-pJ.1 and Ph-pJ.2) Ph cell lines were also established using retroviral transfection. The overexpression of exogenous HA-Cbl in NIH3T3 (Fig. 1 A) and Ph (Fig. 1 C, middle and bottom panels) transfectant clones was demonstrated by anti-Cbl and anti-HA immunoblotting of whole cell lysates. The expression of PDGF receptors in NIH3T3 transfectants was quantified by anti-PDGFRα and anti-PDGFRβ immunoblotting of serial dilutions of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1 B). The expression of PDGFRβ in Ph cell transfectants was assessed by anti-PDGFRβ immunoblotting (Fig. 1 C, top panel). Whereas different clones varied in the level of transfected Cbl and PDGFR expression under basal (unstimulated) conditions, no systematic correlation between PDGFR levels and the nature of Cbl (wild type versusG306E) or its level of expression was apparent. The murine monoclonal antibodies used were as follows: 4G10 (anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Tyr(P)) (24Druker B.J. Mamon H.J. Roberts T.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) (gift of Dr. Brian Druker, Oregon Health Sciences University) and 12CA5 (anti-HA epitope tag) (25Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The polyclonal rabbit antibodies used were as follows: anti-PDGFRα (sc-431, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-PDGFRβ (against the kinase insert; PharMingen, San Diego, CA); anti-PDGFRβ (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, used for Western blotting in Figs. 1, B and C, and4 C); and anti-ubiquitin (NCL-UBIQ, NovoCastra Laboratories, Newcastle, UK; obtained from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Normal rabbit serum (negative control) was obtained from non-immunized rabbits. For PDGF stimulation, cells were first cultured for 24 h in medium containing 0.5% FCS (serum deprivation). Recombinant human PDGF-AA (for selective activation of PDGFRα) or PDGF-BB (both from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was then added at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. At the indicated time points, the medium was aspirated, and cell extracts were prepared at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, chymostatin, antipain, and aprotinin (Sigma). Optimal amounts of antibodies (determined by preliminary titrations) were added to aliquots of lysates equalized for protein content by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad; using the bovine serum albumin standard). After 1–2 h of rocking at 4 °C, 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and incubation was continued for 45 min. Beads were washed six times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol and resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Resolved polypeptides were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase (HRPO)-conjugated protein A (Cappel-Organon Technika, Durham, NC) was used as a secondary reagent for blotting, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, NEN Life Science Products). Membranes were stripped and reprobed, as described (21Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Graphics were generated by direct scanning of films using a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 4cTM scanner and Corel DrawTM version 6 software. Six-mg aliquots of cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads on which GST or GST fusion proteins of Cbl (Cbl-N, aa 1–357; Cbl-N/G306E; or Cbl-C, aa 358–906) were noncovalently immobilized (14Lupher Jr., M.L. Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). After 3 h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed six times in cold wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), and proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm HEPES buffer solution, pH 7.35, and then incubated in the same buffer with sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) for 15 min at 4 °C. After washing, the cells were incubated in α-MEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (tissue culture grade; Sigma) with PDGF-BB (7.5 ng/ml) at 37 °C for the indicated time points, and lysates were prepared as described above. Anti-PDGFRβ immunoprecipitates of these lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with an avidin-HRPO conjugate (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence, as described above. Densitometry was carried out using Scion Images for WindowsTM software. Densitometric data are expressed in arbitrary units. The cells were plated in triplicate at a density of 2 × 104 cells per 25-cm2 flask in α-MEM containing 0.5% FCS. After 18 h, the cells were switched to the same medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml recombinant human PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB, as appropriate. The culture medium, containing the indicated PDGF isoforms, was changed on alternate days. The number of cells was counted every other day from day 1 to day 13, or as indicated, using a hemacytometer. The cells were grown on coverslips in α-MEM containing 0.5% FCS and 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 10 days, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate. After a series of washes in phosphate-buffered saline, DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells was determined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Apoptotic cells were visualized and photographed using a fluorescence microscope. Propidium iodide was used to visualize the entire cell population on the coverslip. Given that the G306E mutation in the TKB domain of Cbl, corresponding to a loss-of-function mutation in C. elegansCbl homologue SLI-1, abrogate the ability of an oncogenic Cbl mutant to transform NIH3T3 cells and to induce hyperphosphorylation of the PDGFRα (21Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it appeared likely that a functional TKB domain would be required for Cbl-mediated negative regulation of the PDGFRα. To assess if this was the case, we established NIH3T3 clones expressing either wild type Cbl (Cbl.8, Cbl.9, and Cbl.2–8) or the Cbl-G306E mutant (G306E.1–10 and G306E.2–3) (Fig.1). In view of the role of the TKB domain in the physical association of Cbl with other PTKs, such as ZAP70 and Syk (15Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Lill N.L. Andoniou C.E. Miyake S. Clark E.A. Druker B. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35273-35281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we first compared the association of wild type Cbl versus Cbl-G306E with PDGFRα in PDGF-AA-stimulated cells. Following PDGF-AA stimulation, a 185-kDa phosphoprotein, corresponding to PDGFRα, was co-immunoprecipitated both with Cbl and Cbl-G306E (Fig.2 A, top panel, lanes 2 and 4). Therefore, elimination of the TKB domain function did not abolish the physical association between Cbl and PDGFRα, similar to recent results with the EGFR (26Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As expected (23Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), the wild type Cbl-associated PDGFR band showed a substantial proportion of the slower-migrating species, which represents the ubiquitinated PDGFRα. In contrast, PDGFRα associated with the Cbl-G306E mutant protein showed little of the slower-migrating species. These results suggested that the TKB domain may be critical for Cbl-dependent enhancement of the ubiquitination of PDGF receptor, as fully described below. Because of the smearing of the PDGFR as a result of enhanced ubiquitination, it was difficult to quantify accurately the differences in the level of association between PDGFR and wild type Cbl versus Cbl-G306E mutant. Therefore, some loss of physical association as result of TKB domain inactivation cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, the Cbl-G306E mutant itself exhibited a reduced level of PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation compared with that of wild type Cbl, even though the cell lines examined expressed similar levels of the Cbl proteins (Fig. 2 A, middle and bottom panel). The reduced phosphorylation of Cbl-G306E was not due to changes in the kinetics of phosphorylation, as revealed by a time course experiment (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the TKB domain is essential for efficient PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. To assess directly the role of the TKB domain in Cbl-dependent enhancement of the PDGFRα ubiquitination, we compared NIH3T3 cells transfected with vector alone (pJ.8) to cells expressing wild type Cbl (Cbl.2–8) or Cbl-G306E (G306E.1–10 and G306E.2–3). Serum-deprived cells were stimulated with PDGF-AA for various time points, and anti-PDGFRα immunoprecipitations were carried out on their lysates. These were analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) and anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting (Fig.3, A and B, top andmiddle panels). As expected (23Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), the ligand-induced ubiquitination of the PDGFRα (seen as the upward-shifted smear in anti-Tyr(P) blot) in Cbl-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells was substantially higher as compared with that in the vector-transfected cells and was already maximal at 3 min of PDGF stimulation (Fig. 3 A, lane 6) versusabout 10 min in the control cells (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and3). Notably, the Cbl-dependent enhancement of PDGFRα ubiquitination was essentially abrogated by the G306E mutation in Cbl (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 2–4 tolanes 6–8 and 10–12). These results reveal a critical role for the TKB domain in Cbl-mediated facilitation of ligand-induced PDGFRα ubiquitination. Elucidation of signaling pathways that are either shared between α and β PDGF receptors, or are selectively recruited to these receptors, is of significant biological interest (27Claesson-Welsh L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 37-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our previous studies of NIH3T3 cells expressing the wild type Cbl (23Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) or the oncogenic Cbl proteins (21Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have established the PDGFRα as a target of the negative regulatory effect of Cbl; this effect appears to involve the Cbl-dependent enhancement of the ligand-induced ubiquitination and degradation of the PDGFRα. However, it has remained unclear whether PDGFRα is selectively regulated by Cbl or if Cbl-dependent regulation may be a feature of both the α and β PDGF receptors. To address this question, we overexpressed HA-tagged wild type Cbl in PDGFRα-negative Patch 3T3 cells (Cbl-Ph) (28Seifert R.A. van Koppen A. Bowen-Pope D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4473-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using retroviral transfection (Fig. 1 C). Similar to parental Ph cells, the Cbl-Ph cells failed to respond to PDGF-AA by tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (data not shown). Stimulation of Cbl-Ph cells with PDGF-BB was used to assess if selective stimulation of the PDGFRβ can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and its association with the activated receptor. For this purpose, lysates prepared from unstimulated or PDGF-BB-stimulated Cbl-Ph cells were subjected to anti-HA immunoprecipitation and analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. Stimulation of Ph-Cbl cells with PDGF-BB induced a prominent time-dependent phosphorylation of Cbl, which peaked at 3 min (Fig. 4 A). When anti-HA and anti- PDGFRβ immunoprecipitates were resolved side-by-side, the 185-kDa Cbl-associated band (Fig. 4 B, lane 4) co-migrated with PDGFRβ. In addition, the 185-kDa band was immunodepleted with anti-PDGFRβ antibody (data not shown). These experiments indicated that, similar to selective stimulation of the PDGFRα, selective stimulation of the PDGFRβ can also induce Cbl phosphorylation and its association with the receptor. Our previous studies showed that Cbl could physically interact with the PDGFRα through the Cbl TKB domain, which binds directly to autophosphorylated PDGFRα (21Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal region of Cbl can associate with the activated receptor, consistent with its ability to bind the SH3 domains o"
https://openalex.org/W2086889008,"Identification of prostate cancers at high risk of progression is difficult and a better understanding of how peptide growth factors influence cellular function might be useful. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have been implicated in prostate cancer development. FGF8 was identified in the Shionogi mouse mammary carcinoma SC-3 cell line as an androgen-induced mitogen. We tested if FGF8 was over-expressed in human prostate cancer and if its expression correlated with clinical data and outcome. One hundred and six cases of prostate cancer and ten cases of BPH were examined. In situ hybridization was employed to detect FGF8 mRNA expression, which was identified within the malignant prostatic epithelium in 85/106 (80.2%) cases. Increased expression of FGF8 correlated significantly with higher Gleason scores (P=0.0004) and advanced tumour stage (P=0.0016). Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed over-expression of the FGF8b isoform. Men with tumours which expressed high levels of FGF8 had worse survival (P=0.034), although FGF8 mRNA was not able to provide additional prognostic information in a multivariate analysis. Additionally, FGF8 expression was shown to persist in androgen independent prostate cancer. Using a range of normal adult tissues, FGF8 expression was restricted to neurones and the germinal epithelium in addition to the prostate. In vitro studies demonstrated that in the presence of neutralizing antibody to FGF8b there was significant inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth, confirming the biological significance of FGF8 in prostate carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2121846036,"We have previously shown that protein kinase C-β (PKC-β) is required for activation of tyrosinase (Park, H. Y., Russakovsky, V., Ohno, S., and Gilchrest, B. A. (1993)J. Biol. Chem. 268, 11742–11749), the rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis. We now examine its mechanism of activation in human melanocytes. In vivo phosphorylation experiments revealed that tyrosinase is phosphorylated through the PKC-dependent pathway and that introduction of PKC-β into nonpigmented human melanoma cells lacking PKC-β lead to the phosphorylation and activation of tyrosinase. Preincubation of intact melanosomes with purified active PKC-β in vitro increased tyrosinase activity 3-fold. By immunoelectron microscopy, PKC-β but not PKC-α was closely associated with tyrosinase on the outer surface of melanosomes. Western blot analysis confirmed the association of PKC-β with melanosomes. Only the cytoplasmic (extra-melanosomal) domain of tyrosinase, which contains two serines but no threonines, was phosphorylated by the serine/threonine kinase PKC-β. These two serines at positions 505 and 509 both are present in the C-terminal peptide generated by trypsin digestion of tyrosinase. Co-migration experiments comparing synthetic peptide standards of all three possible phosphorylated tryptic peptides, a diphosphopeptide and two monophosphopeptides, to tyrosinase-phosphorylated in intact melanocytes by PKC-β and then subjected to trypsin digestion revealed that both serine residues are phosphorylated by PKC-β. We conclude that PKC-β activates tyrosinase directly by phosphorylating serine residues at positions 505 and 509 in the cytoplasmic domain of this melanosome-associated protein.

Melanin production is principally responsible for skin color and plays an important role in prevention of sun-induced skin injury (1Hearing V.J. King R.A. Levine N. Pigmentation and Pigmentary Disorders. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 3-32Google Scholar). Melanin is produced in melanocytes, neural crest-derived cells residing at the basal layer of epidermis; tyrosine andl-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa) serve as precursors for this complex biopolymer (1Hearing V.J.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 3-32Google Scholar).Mammalian tyrosinase is a copper-dependent glycoprotein spanning the melanosomal membrane with a molecular mass ranging from 60 to 75 kDa, depending on its state of glycosylation (4Hearing V.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Human tyrosinase has been cloned and sequenced (5Shibahara S. Tomita Y. Tagami H. Muller R.M. Cohen T. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1988; 156: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the deduced amino acid sequence reveals that tyrosinase is composed of 511 amino acids with >90% of the enzyme, the part containing the copper-binding sites (5Shibahara S. Tomita Y. Tagami H. Muller R.M. Cohen T. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1988; 156: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), localized inside the melanosome. The remainder of the tyrosinase protein consists of a short amino acid sequence that spans the membrane of melanosome, followed by a tail of approximately 30 amino acids that reside in the melanocyte cytoplasm. Therefore, tyrosinase can be divided into inner, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. Patients with oculocutaneous albinism, who lack tyrosinase activity, frequently display mutations in the copper binding region of tyrosinase, as well as other regions in the inner domain (6King R.A. Townsend D. Oetting W.S. Levine N. Pigmentation and Pigmentary Disorders. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 297-336Google Scholar, 7King R.A. Nordlund J.J. Boissy R.E. Hearing V.J. King R.A. Ortonne J. The Pigmentary System: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 553-575Google Scholar). Point mutations at codons encoding for amino acids at positions 489 or 501 that result in premature termination of tyrosinase and loss of 21 or 22 amino acids at the C terminus lead to oculocutaneous albinism (6King R.A. Townsend D. Oetting W.S. Levine N. Pigmentation and Pigmentary Disorders. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 297-336Google Scholar), suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain is similarly critical to melanogenic function. A second role for the cytoplasmic domain in proper subcellular trafficking of tyrosinase has been inferred from the observation that the platinum mutation in mice, which results in deletion of the 27 terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain, causes tyrosinase to be incorporated into the plasma membrane rather than the melanosomal membrane (8Beermann F.

Xu Y. Bouchard B. Houghton A.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, a recent report has suggested that only six amino acids residing near the melanosomal membrane within the cytoplasmic domain are responsible for the subcellular trafficking (11Vijayasaradhi S. Xu Y. Bouchard B. Houghton A.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).Although the biochemistry of melanogenesis has been extensively characterized, molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of tyrosinase activity are still poorly understood. In murine melanoma cells, agents that increase the intracellular level of cAMP, such as α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), dibutyryl cAMP, and forskolin, are known to be potent inducers of pigmentation (12Bertolotto C.

Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1989; 15: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Halaban R. Pomerantz S. Marshall S. Lerner A.B. Arch. Biochem.

Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Inhibitors and activators of tyrosinase have also been postulated (16Korner A. Pawelek J.M. Nature. 1977; 267: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Wong G. Pawelek J.M. Nature. 1975; 255: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although neither an inhibitor nor an activator has yet been identified. Because tyrosinase is a glycoprotein, inhibition of glycosylation was specifically postulated to play a physiologic role in modulating tyrosinase activity (18Imokawa G. Mishima Y. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1994-2002PubMed Google Scholar).In human melanocytes, even less is known about regulation of tyrosinase activity. Unlike murine melanoma cells, the regulation of tyrosinase activity appears to occur mostly at the posttranslational level. For example, the level of tyrosinase mRNA does not correlate with the total melanin level in cultured human melanocytes (19Naeyaert J.M. Eller M. Gordon P.R. Park H.Y. Gilchrest B.A Br. J. Dermatol. 1991; 125: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Jimenez M. Kameyama K. Maloy W.L. Tomita Y. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3830-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and human melanoma cells often fail to produce melanin despite having abundant tyrosinase protein (21Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ohno S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Salopek T.G. Jimbow K. J. Invest. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 195-202PubMed Google Scholar). However, the posttranslational mechanism by which tyrosinase activity is putatively regulated is not well understood. Again, an inhibitor of tyrosinase in human skin has been suggested (23Vijayan E. Husain I. Ramaiah A. Madan N.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but it is yet undocumented.Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that protein kinase C (PKC) plays an important role in regulating both human and murine pigmentation (21Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ohno S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ao Y. Fernandez E. Gilchrest B.A. Exp.

Archambault M. Messana E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 687-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol, the known physiologic activator of PKC that is often cleaved from cell membrane lipids when ligands bind their cell surface receptors (27Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar) or following ultraviolet irradiation (28Matsui M.S. DeLeo V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Punnonen K. Yuspa S.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 221-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), increased melanin content in cultured human melanocytes, an effect blocked by PKC inhibitors (25Gordon P.R. Gilchrest B.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 93: 700-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In murine melanoma cells, depletion of PKC completely blocked α-MSH induced pigmentation (24Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ao Y. Fernandez E. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); in intact guinea pig skin, topical application of diacylglycerols known to activate PKC caused tanning, whereas application of analogues lacking PKC activity did not (26Allen A.E. Archambault M. Messana E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 687-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments revealed that the β-isoform of PKC specifically regulates human pigmentation, in that human melanoma cells expressing a normal level of tyrosinase but lacking PKC-β were amelanotic and that transfection with PKC-β activated tyrosinase in these cells (21Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ohno S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PKC is a serine/threonine kinase for which one of the best-characterized intracellular substrates is myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (30Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although tyrosinase contains possible phosphorylation sites for a serine/threonine kinase, it has never been determined whether phosphorylation is a mechanism by which tyrosinase activity is regulated. In the present study, we demonstrate that PKC-β acts directly on human tyrosinase by phosphorylating serine residues in its cytoplasmic domain.DISCUSSIONIt has been surprisingly difficult to decipher the regulation of human melanogenesis despite rapid evolution of adequate culture methods for human melanocytes over the past two decades. The confounding role of phorbol esters, initially added to media to stimulate melanocyte growth in the absence of then-unidentified key mitogens (43Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 611-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but eventually discovered to severely down-regulate tyrosinase activity through PKC depletion (21Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ohno S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has only recently been appreciated. In addition, many potent inducers of murine pigmentation, such as α-MSH, either fail to induce human pigmentation or are far less effective, a situation also likely to be attributable at least in part to media artifacts, such as reliance on choleragen or other agents to elevate basal cAMP levels (21Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ohno S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 611-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, after several negative or ambiguous studies, it was finally reported that under defined culture conditions, α-MSH can induce tyrosinase mRNA, protein, and activity in human melanocytes (44Abdel-Malek Z. Swope V.B. Suzuki I. Akcali C. Harriger M.D. Boyce S.T. Urabe K. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1789-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 45McLeod S.D. Smith C. Mason R.S. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 146: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but its overall contribution to regulation of human melanogenesis is appears nevertheless to be far less than in the murine system. Importantly, posttranslational modification appears to play a more critical role in regulating tyrosinase activity in human than in murine melanocytes, with mRNA and protein levels poorly correlated with the enzyme activity (19Naeyaert J.M. Eller M. Gordon P.R. Park H.Y. Gilchrest B.A Br. J. Dermatol. 1991; 125: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Jimenez M. Kameyama K. Maloy W.L. Tomita Y. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3830-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and amelanotic human melanoma cells often expressing ample tyrosinase protein (21Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ohno S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Salopek T.G. Jimbow K. J. Invest. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 195-202PubMed Google Scholar).PKC-β is the first documented control point for human tyrosinase activity. The protein level of PKC-β correlates with total pigment content in melanocytes and activation of PKC leads to increased tyrosinase activity, whereas depletion of PKC decreases tyrosinase activity (21Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ohno S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC-β is required to activate tyrosinase, in that when the lysate from amelanotic human melanoma NP-MM4 cells, which lack PKC-β expression but have abundant tyrosinase protein, was mixed with the lysate of normal melanocytes, tyrosinase in the NP-MM4 cells was activated. This activation was abolished when the melanocyte lysate was immunoprecipitated using a specific monoclonal antibody to remove PKC-β before being mixed with the NP-MM4 cell lysate. In addition, transient expression of PKC-β in NP-MM4 cells activates tyrosinase (21Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ohno S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A key role for PKC-β is not unique to human melanogenesis but also has been documented in the murine system. Pigmented S91 murine melanoma cells, known to progressively lose their ability to pigment both under basal conditions and after α-MSH stimulation if serially passaged (46Park H.Y. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cutan. Med. Surg. 1996; 1: 4-9Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), in parallel lose the expression of PKC-β, whereas the expression of PKC-α and tyrosinase remains unaffected (46Park H.Y. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cutan. Med. Surg. 1996; 1: 4-9Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the induction of murine pigmentation by α-MSH or other cAMP elevating agents, such as isobutyl methyl zanthine or dibutyryl cAMP, requires PKC in that when PKC is depleted, induction of pigmentation by these agents is completely blocked (24Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ao Y. Fernandez E. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In human melanocytes, we have further recently shown that PKC-β is rate-limiting for cAMP-mediated elevation of tyrosinase activity in that cAMP-induced tyrosinase activation does not correlate temporally with increased tyrosinase protein, but rather parallels the later cAMP-mediated induction of PKC-β (47Park H.Y. Murphy M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar).In cultured human melanocytes, we and others have reported that at least the α-, β-, δ-, and ε-isoforms of PKC are expressed (48Yamanishi D.T. Graham M. Buckmeier J.A. Meyskens Jr., F.L. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,49Park H.Y. Rubeiz N. Fernandez E. Sachs D.L. Gilchrest B.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 440Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The present immunoelectron microscopy studies show that the β-isoform co-localizes with tyrosinase at the surface of melanosomes, whereas the α-isoform is found diffusely in the cytoplasm and not specifically near melanosomes. These results suggest that compartmentalization of PKC-β with melanosomes may determine its ability to phosphorylate tyrosinase. The mechanism by which certain PKC isoforms may adopt a nonrandom localization within cells is incompletely elucidated. However, specific receptors for activated protein kinase C have been identified, suggesting that PKC isoform specific receptor for activated C kinase proteins may govern the intercellular distribution of PKC isoforms (50Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). It would thus be interesting to determine whether melanosomes express a PKC-β specific receptor activated C kinase that is melanosome-associated.Our current and previously published work (21Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ohno S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) establishes that PKC-β activates tyrosinase activity in human melanocytes. The data presented here further indicate that PKC-β-mediated phosphorylation exclusively involves the cytoplasmic domain of tyrosinase and that both serine residues in this domain are phosphorylated. Radioactivity from the tryptic digest of 32P-labeled tyrosinase co-migrates with the synthetic diphosphopeptide Glu-Asp-Tyr-His-Ser(P)-Leu-Tyr-Gln-Ser(P)-His-Leu, corresponding to amino acids 501–511, using separation methods based on hydrophobicity (reversed phase HPLC), charge and size (thin layer electrophoresis), and polarity (thin layer chromatography). Furthermore, synthetic standard peptides corresponding to this portion of tyrosinase are phosphorylated by PKC-β in vitro, even though the conventional substrate sequence for PKC (51Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) is lacking, further supporting this conclusion.Tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2 (TRP1 and TRP2), two proteins known to be important for melanogenesis, share 70–80% nucleotide sequence homology and 40–45% amino acid identity with tyrosinase (52Oetting W.S. Nordlund J.J. Boissy R.E. Hearing V.J. King R.A. Ortonne J. The Pigmentary System: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 231-249Google Scholar). Like tyrosinase, they are transmembrane melanosomal proteins, with cytoplasmic domains of about 26–28 amino acids. In addition, TRP1 has one serine at amino acid position 502 and one threonine at amino acid position 516, and TRP2 has two serines at amino acid positions 510 and 511 and three threonines at amino acid positions 503, 508, and 516, (52Oetting W.S. Nordlund J.J. Boissy R.E. Hearing V.J. King R.A. Ortonne J. The Pigmentary System: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 231-249Google Scholar). They are therefore potential PKC substrates, although they have never been reported to be phosphoproteins. However, TRP1 and TRP2 do not share any amino acid homology with tyrosinase in their cytoplasmic domains (5Shibahara S. Tomita Y. Tagami H. Muller R.M. Cohen T. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1988; 156: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 52Oetting W.S. Nordlund J.J. Boissy R.E. Hearing V.J. King R.A. Ortonne J. The Pigmentary System: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 231-249Google Scholar), and therefore, the tryptic fragments generated from the cytoplasmic domains of TRP1 and TRP2 are vastly different from those of tyrosinase. Hence, the tryptic fragments of TRP1 and TRP2 would not co-migrate with the synthetic mono- and diphosphopeptide standards that were used for mapping experiments in this report, excluding the possibility that our phosphorylation results reflect TRP1 and/or TRP2 contamination. It has also been demonstrated that only peptides of identical size and charge will co-migrate in the thin-layer chromatography employed in these experiments (39Ueno Y. Makino S. Kitagawa M. Nishimura S. Taya Y. Hata T. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1995; 46: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).A central role for PKC-β in melanogenesis does not diminish the importance of other signal transduction molecules. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), the principal serine/threonine kinase mediating the actions of cAMP, also activates tyrosinase either directly or indirectly through phosphorylation. Addition of purified PKA to murine S91 cell lysate activates tyrosinase (17Wong G. Pawelek J.M. Nature. 1975; 255: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), presumably through phosphorylation of a PKA substrate protein, but in one early study (15Pawelek J. Sansone M. Koch N. Christie G. Halaban R. Hendee J. Lerner A.B. Varga J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), when these cells were treated with α-MSH in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate, tyrosinase apparently was not phosphorylated. Indeed, only recently was an obligate role for PKA in α-MSH-induced murine melanogenesis firmly established (53Ao Y. Park H.Y. Olaizola-Horn S. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As noted above, the role of the PKA pathway in human melanogenesis is even less clear and appears intimately connected to the PKC pathway (53Ao Y. Park H.Y. Olaizola-Horn S. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The critical role of the cytoplasmic domain of tyrosinase in its melanogenic activity established by the present experiments is also strongly suggested by mutations identified in patients with oculocutaneous albinism. Insertion of single nucleotides at codons determining the amino acid at position 489 or 501 causes premature termination of tyrosinase, deleting 20–22 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain, including the serines at 505 and 509 (6King R.A. Townsend D. Oetting W.S. Levine N. Pigmentation and Pigmentary Disorders. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 297-336Google Scholar). This abolishes tyrosinase activity, although the intramelanosomal domain of the tyrosinase protein is present and normal. Site-directed mutagenesis to alter or eliminate one or both of the serines in the cytoplasmic domain, followed by expression of the mutated DNA in pigment cells lacking wild-type tyrosinase, would rigorously demonstrate that phosphorylation of these residues is required for protein activity, but unfortunately, substantial technical difficulties in transfecting human melanocytes would need to be overcome before such experiments could be performed. In mice harboring the platinum mutation, in which the last 27 amino acids of tyrosinase are absent, pigment production is greatly reduced and, in addition, tyrosinase is directed to the cytoplasmic membrane (8Beermann F. Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Schmidt A. Boissy Y.L. Lamoreux M.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Orlow S.J. Lamoreux M.L. Pifko-Hirst S. Zhou B.K. J. Invest.

However, a more recent study has suggested that amino acids at positions 494–498 of the human tyrosinase are responsible for the subcellular trafficking (11Vijayasaradhi S. Xu Y. Bouchard B. Houghton A.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These findings and our report suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of tyrosinase is critical for both subcellular trafficking and the activation of the protein.Our results strongly suggest that direct phosphorylation of tyrosinase by PKC-β leads to its activation. When purified human melanosomes are incubated with purified activated PKC-β, tyrosinase activity increases. This activation is thus likely due to the direct interaction between tyrosinase and PKC-β. Demonstration of direct activation of purified human tyrosinase by PKC-β was not attempted due to the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient amount of highly purified enzyme from poorly proliferative human melanocytes, particularly in light of its close association in the melanosome membrane with highly homologous TRP1 and TRP2 (52Oetting W.S. Nordlund J.J. Boissy R.E. Hearing V.J. King R.A. Ortonne J. The Pigmentary System: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 231-249Google Scholar) and the hydrophobic polymer melanin. Moreover, PKC-β-mediated phosphorylation of isolated human tyrosinase might well not lead to the same activation as when the protein is residing in the melanosome membrane, in a specific steric relationship to other cellular constituents complicating interpretation of negative results.We have shown that phosphorylation occurs on the two serine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of tyrosinase, but the precise mechanism by which this phosphorylation activates tyrosinase has yet to be determined. Recent studies suggest that tyrosinase might interact with other melanogenic enzymes, such as TRP1 and TRP2, in the melanosomal membrane (54Johnson R. Jackson I.J. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 55Orlow S. Zhou B.K. Chakraborty A.K. Drucker M. Pifko-Hirst S. Pawelek J.M. J. Invest.

https://openalex.org/W1988621347,"It has recently been shown that RNase H overproduction can partially compensate for the growth defect due to the absence of DNA topoisomerase I in Escherichia coli(Drolet, M., Phoenix, P., Menzel, R., Massé, E., Liu, L. F., and Crouch, R. J. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 3526–3530). This result has suggested a model in which inhibitory R-loops occur during transcription in topAmutants. Results presented in this report further support this notion and demonstrate that transcription-induced supercoiling is involved in R-loop formation. First, we show that stable R-loop formation duringin vitro transcription with E. coli RNA polymerase only occurs in the presence of DNA gyrase. Second, extensive R-loop formation in vivo, revealed by the production of RNase H-sensitive hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs, is observed under conditions where topA mutants fail to grow. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the coupling of transcription and translation in bacteria is an efficient way of preventing R-loop formation. It has recently been shown that RNase H overproduction can partially compensate for the growth defect due to the absence of DNA topoisomerase I in Escherichia coli(Drolet, M., Phoenix, P., Menzel, R., Massé, E., Liu, L. F., and Crouch, R. J. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 3526–3530). This result has suggested a model in which inhibitory R-loops occur during transcription in topAmutants. Results presented in this report further support this notion and demonstrate that transcription-induced supercoiling is involved in R-loop formation. First, we show that stable R-loop formation duringin vitro transcription with E. coli RNA polymerase only occurs in the presence of DNA gyrase. Second, extensive R-loop formation in vivo, revealed by the production of RNase H-sensitive hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs, is observed under conditions where topA mutants fail to grow. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the coupling of transcription and translation in bacteria is an efficient way of preventing R-loop formation. The nascent RNA is normally displaced during the process of transcription to be translated or to participate in the process of translation. Shortly after the discovery that cellular DNA can be negatively supercoiled, it was suggested that the favorable free energy of such supercoiling should maintain the base pairing between the nascent RNA and the template DNA strand, and consequently, should interfere with the process of RNA displacement. Indeed, a direct correlation between the level of negative supercoiling and the length of the RNA-DNA hybrid (or R-loop, the template strand is paired with RNA, leaving the nontemplate strand unpaired) after transcription withEscherichia coli RNA polymerase was found (1Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 87: 797-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The formation of such hybrids was later shown to be due to the denaturing of transcribing RNA polymerases, and hence to the use of protein denaturing agents to stop the transcription reactions (2Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These experiments have also demonstrated that the RNA polymerase possesses a putative “separator” function allowing the nascent RNA to be displaced as transcription proceeds, and therefore a function that counteracts the favorable free energy of negative supercoiling for RNA-DNA hybrid formation. In agreement with this notion are the results from several experiments revealing that the 9–12-base pair RNA-DNA hybrid within the RNA polymerase is positioned very close to the downstream edge of the 18-base pair open transcription bubble (3von Hippel P.H. Science. 1998; 281: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, extensive R-loop formation originating from the short hybrid within the transcription bubble does not normally occur during transcription. However, the results of several in vitro and in vivo experiments have clearly shown that extensive R-loops can form during transcription on negatively supercoiled templates, and that both the formation and the length of such structures is modulated by DNA topoisomerases (4Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These topoisomerases are, DNA gyrase, responsible for the introduction of negative supercoiling, and DNA topoisomerase I, responsible for the relaxation of negative supercoiling (reviewed in Ref. 8Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Indeed, in one study (5Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), overproduction of RNase H, an enzyme degrading the RNA moiety of an R-loop, was shown to partially correct the growth defect oftopA null mutants. In another series of experiments, R-loop formation during transcription of a portion of the rrnBoperon, encoding for rRNAs, was shown to occur both in vitroand in vivo in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I (6Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). How these results can be pieced together with the early observations described above is still unknown. One way to reconcile all these observations is to consider that the R-loop does not originate from the transcription bubble but is initiated by the reannealing of a portion of the nascent RNA with a complementary DNA template region behind the moving RNA polymerase. This, of course, requires that the nascent RNA be free and therefore not bound by ribosomes and that the corresponding DNA region behind the moving RNA polymerase be opened. DNA opening behind the moving RNA polymerase can be nucleotide sequence-dependent and can be promoted by negative supercoiling generated during transcription in the frame of the twin-domain model (9Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). According to this model, supercoiling can be generated during transcription elongation because of the difficulty for a moving transcription complex to rotate around the double helix. In this situation, domains of negative and positive supercoiling are transiently generated, respectively, behind and ahead of the moving transcription complex. In the absence of DNA topoisomerase I, the local negative supercoiled domain can build up, whereas the positive one can be removed by DNA gyrase. Interestingly, we have recently shown that severe growth inhibition in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I correlates with transcription-induced supercoiling (10Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16654-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because RNase H overproduction stimulates the growth of the topA null mutants used to demonstrate this correlation (5Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we thought that R-loop formation generated during transcription might be due to negative supercoiling generated behind the moving RNA polymerase, which accumulates in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I. In this report, we present biochemical and genetic evidence supporting this hypothesis. Moreover, in agreement with the model for R-loop formation described above, we present evidence that the binding of ribosomes to nascent RNAs can inhibit R-loop formation. The two plasmid DNAs used in this study are pBR322 derivatives and have been described elsewhere (Refs. 10Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16654-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 11Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar; also see Fig. 3). Briefly, pBR322ΔPtet has a small deletion within the promoter of the tetA gene that considerably reduces its expression. In pBR322Δtet5′ anHindIII-EcoRV deletion removed the 5′ portion of the tetA gene, so that the remaining tetA RNA is not translated but still produced. pEM001 and pEM003 are pACYC184 derivatives that, respectively, carry the wild-type rnhAgene or a mutated version of this gene (7Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Typical in vitro transcription reactions were performed as described previously (4Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Phoenix P.

Briefly, they were performed in a volume of 25 μl of a solution containing 35 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 25 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.4 mm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP, 1.2 mm ATP, 0.5 μg of purified pBR322 DNA, 1 unit of E. coli RNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and, when specified, RNase A and E. coli RNase HI were added at the indicated concentrations. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 min before the addition (or not) of reconstituted E. coli DNA gyrase (about 50 ng of each subunit) and then incubated for an additional 10 min at the same temperature. In Fig. 1, the reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 30 mm. The samples were brought to 0.3 m NaCl final before the addition of 100 ng of RNase A, followed by a 60-min incubation period at 37 °C. The reactions were extracted with phenol once, chloroform once, and precipitated with ethanol. They were resuspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 m NaCl and treated or not with 7.5 ng of RNase H for 60 min at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis as indicated. In Fig. 2, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 25 μl of a solution containing 50 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, and 12. 5 μg of proteinase K. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the samples were extracted once with phenol, once with chloroform, and then precipitated with ethanol. They were resuspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and treated with 1 μg of RNase A and 20 ng of RNase H. After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, the samples were phenol-extracted and then analyzed by electrophoresis.Figure 2Hypernegative supercoiling during in vitro transcription with E. coli RNA polymerase.

The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in an agarose gel containing 7.5 μg/ml of chloroquine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For the extraction of plasmid DNAs for supercoiling analysis, the following procedure was used. RFM480 cells (topA20::Tn10,gyrB221(couR), gyrB203(Ts), Ref. 5Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) carrying the various pBR322 derivatives were grown overnight in VB Casa medium at 37 °C and then diluted 1/75 in prewarmed LB medium. All the media were supplemented with ampicillin at 50 μg/ml and chloramphenicol at 30 μg/ml when required. The cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.4 at 37 °C at which time they were transferred to the desired temperature. The plasmid DNAs were extracted when the A 600 reached about 0.7 (all the strains at 37 °C and only the ones carrying pEM001 at 28 °C and therefore overproducing RNase H) or after an exposition of 2 h at the respective temperature when an A 600 of 0.7 could not be reached (the strains that do not overproduce RNase H at 28 °C and all the strains at 21 °C). When hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs were produced at 21 °C, the proportion of such topoisomers reached a maximum after about 1 h at this temperature and did not change for at least another hour (data not shown). Growth was stopped by transferring the cells in a tube filled with ice. With this procedure, the temperature of the cultures immediately dropped to 0 °C. Plasmid DNAs were extracted by an alkaline lysis procedure (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

One-dimensional and two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of chloroquine were performed in 0.5 × TBE as described (7Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were either stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light (Figs. 1 and 2) or dried and prepared for in situ hybridization (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) as described (7Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol.

The samples were analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. The chloroquine concentrations used were 7.5 μg/ml and 30 μg/ml, respectively, in the first and second dimension.

When pBR322Δtet5′ was analyzed, the gel was probed with a32P-labeled DNA fragment carrying the bla gene of pBR322.

The DNA template used, pBR322, was extracted from a wild-type strain and therefore had a higher level of negative supercoiling than DNA from topAnull mutants with gyr mutations. Moreover, its effective negative supercoiling density was significantly higher than DNA from wild-type cells, considering that about half of the DNA supercoiling is constrained in vivo (8Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To detect R-loop formation, we used the previously described assay in which RNase H-sensitive gel retardation and/or relaxation of plasmid DNAs after transcription is revealed following electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining of the gel (7Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, all the in vitro reactions were arrested with EDTA and treated with RNase A before being phenol-extracted. This procedure was used, because R-loop formation involving nascent RNA (sensitive to RNase A) can be induced following denaturing of E. coli RNA polymerases that transcribe DNA templates with a wild-type supercoiling level (Ref. 2Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and data not shown). The results shown in Fig. 1clearly demonstrate that significant and stable R-loop formation exclusively occurs when DNA gyrase is present during the transcription reaction. Indeed, RNase H-sensitive gel retardation of plasmid DNAs is only detected when DNA gyrase was added during transcription (comparelane 4, −RNase H with lane 5, +RNase H after transcription, lane 7, +RNase H during transcription orlane 8, +RNase H during and after transcription). This alteration in the electrophoretic mobility is better seen in the gel containing chloroquine (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), because plasmid DNAs carrying R-loops are hypernegatively supercoiled (see below). Hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA represents a population of topoisomers that can no longer be resolved by electrophoresis in agarose gels containing chloroquine (11Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 13Pruss G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These in vitroresults demonstrate that an effective global negative supercoiling level, even higher than the effective level existing in topAnull mutants, is unable on its own to trigger the formation of stable R-loops. This is in agreement with the results of early experiments (2Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Most likely, R-loop initiation during transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase involves transcription-induced supercoiling, and DNA gyrase participates in the process of R-loop elongation to generate stable and detectable R-loops. We next wanted to study more precisely the link between hypernegative supercoiling and R-loop formation during in vitrotranscription with E. coli RNA polymerase, in the presence of DNA gyrase. Fig. 2 shows the results of an experiment in which the susceptibility of hypernegative supercoiling formation to RNase A and/or RNase H treatments was evaluated. It can be seen that both RNase A and H dramatically reduced the production of hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA in the presence of DNA gyrase (compare lane 1, complete withlane 2, RNase H and lane 3, RNase A). Interestingly, RNase A and H together completely abolished hypernegative supercoiling (lane 6). This result may suggest that two independent mechanisms are operating to generate hypernegative supercoiling; one directly linked to the twin-domain model (sensitivity to RNase A) and the other one linked to R-loop formation independent of the twin-domain model (sensitivity to RNase H). However, by a more careful look at lanes 2 and 3, it is clearly revealed that both independent treatments to RNase A and H abolished more than half of the amount of hypernegatively supercoiled DNA generated in the absence of RNases (lane 1). Moreover, by increasing the amount of RNase H we found that it is possible to completely abolish hypernegative supercoiling (data not shown). Therefore, hypernegative supercoiling during transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase in the presence of DNA gyrase is completely dependent on R-loop formation, involving the participation of nascent RNA. In this context, the nascent RNA may serve two purposes: it is involved in generating negative supercoiling during transcription according to the twin-domain model, as previously shown in similarin vitro systems (4Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tsao Y.P. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and it anneals with the complementary DNA template strand to form the R-loop. This is in contrast with what has been demonstrated for hypernegative supercoiling during transcription with phage T3 and T7 RNA polymerases (6Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, in these cases, the formation of such topoisomers was more sensitive to RNase H treatment but was highly resistant to RNase A treatment, suggesting that R-loop formation did not involve free RNA and occurred in the 5′ to 3′ direction, and therefore the newly synthesized RNA was never displaced from the template strand (6Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is worth mentioning that the natural DNA template for T3 and T7 RNA polymerases is not supercoiled but linear. Perhaps these polymerases do not possess an efficient RNA-DNA hybrid separator function as found for E. coli RNA polymerase, to counteract the favorable free energy for R-loop formation during transcription of a negatively supercoiled template. Indeed, stable R-loop formation on supercoiled templates during transcription by T3 and T7 RNA polymerases is detected in the absence of DNA gyrase, as opposed to the situation with E. coli RNA polymerase (Fig. 1, lane 3), and under the same experimental set-up as the one used in this study (7Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 1E. Massé and M. Drolet, unpublished results. Our next goal was to reproduce the in vitro data presented above in vivo, and to test the model for R-loop formation involving free nascent RNA and transcription-induced supercoiling. Because R-loop formation can be induced on a negatively supercoiled template by the use of protein denaturing agents during nucleic acids extraction, we decided to use the RNase H-sensitive hypernegative supercoiling assay to reveal R-loop formation in vivo. The generation of such topoisomers occurs within the cells, and it is therefore a more reliable assay to reveal R-loop formation in vivo. Because all the previous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that detectable R-loop formation does not occur in the presence of DNA topoisomerase I, our in vivo experiments were performed in a topA null mutant. In addition, because the presence of cellular RNase H could potentially be a problem, we used a topA null mutant that grows better when RNase H is overproduced (5Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This topA null mutant, RFM480, carries thetopA20::Tn10 allele and agyrB(Ts) allele allowing the modulation of cell growth in a manner that depends on the temperature. Low temperatures (30 °C and below) are more restrictive for this strain, owing to thisgyrB(Ts) allele that regains a more wild-type level of activity under these conditions. This explains why the growth of RFM480 is cold-sensitive. At these temperatures, the topA null mutant behaves as a true topA mutant without compensatory mutations, and its growth is shown to be stimulated by overproducing RNase H (5Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNAs used in our studies are pBR322 derivatives. One derivative, pBR322ΔPtet (Fig.3), has a small deletion within thetetA promoter region that was originally believed to abolishtetA gene expression (11Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). This plasmid was used to show that the formation of hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322 was linked totetA gene expression, because such topoisomers were not detected when it was extracted from a widely used topA null mutant, DM800 (11Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The formation of hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA was later shown to be due to membrane anchorage of the transcription complex via the tetA gene product, a membrane bound protein (15Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We have recently found that pBR322ΔPtet confers low level tetracycline resistance, because a weak promoter was reconstituted during the construction of this plasmid. When this plasmid was extracted from our cold-sensitivetopA null mutants exposed to nonpermissive temperatures, transcription-dependent hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA was detected (10Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16654-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This result provided evidence that severe growth inhibition of topA null mutants correlates with transcription-induced supercoiling but not with global supercoiling. We found that an EcoRI-EcoRV deletion within pBR322 that totally abolishes tetracycline resistance and tetA gene expression, also almost completely abolished the formation of such topoisomers (data not shown). This result suggests that the generation of hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322ΔPtet DNA is due to the residual tetA gene expression originating from that plasmid. We found that RNase H overproduction, conferred by the presence of the multicopy plasmid pEM001 that carries thernhA gene, had no effect on the formation of such topoisomers (data not shown). This means that R-loop formation is not involved in hypernegative supercoiling of pBR322ΔPtet DNA. According to our model for R-loop formation, this is not a surprising result, because the tetA mRNA from that plasmid is translated, and therefore the nascent RNA is not free to hybridize with the template DNA strand. Results presented below support this conclusion. The other pBR322 derivative used in the present study is pBR322Δtet5′, from which the remaining portion of thetetA gene is transcribed but the resulting RNA is not translated (Fig. 3). This is because theHindIII-EcoRV deletion that was made to construct this plasmid eliminated the 5′ part of the tetA gene including the original −10 promoter region, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome binding site), the ATG initiator codon, and one transmembrane domain responsible for the anchorage of the TetA protein to the membrane. However, an active promoter was reconstituted (Fig.3). This promoter is almost as active as the original tetApromoter, according to lacZ assays (data not shown). When this plasmid DNA was extracted from our cold-sensitive topAnull mutants exposed to nonpermissive temperatures, transcription-dependent hypernegatively supercoiled topoisomers were detected (10Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16654-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The formation of such topoisomers is linked to tetA gene transcription, because, as mentioned above, a larger deletion, EcoRI-EcoRV (Fig. 3), which completely eliminates tetA gene transcription, also dramatically reduces the accumulation of such topoisomers. The next series of experiments was performed to verify if the production of hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322Δtet5′ DNA was linked to R-loop formation. For that purpose, we introduced an additional plasmid DNA, pEM001, carrying the rnhA gene or the control plasmid, pEM003, carrying an inactivated rnhA gene, within RFM480 bearing pBR322Δtet5′. The cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C and exposed to the indicated temperatures as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The extracted plasmid DNAs were subjected to electrophoresis in agarose gel in the presence of chloroquine at 7.5 μg/ml. Under these conditions the more negatively supercoiled topoisomers migrate slowly except for the fastest migrating band pointed out by an arrow (Fig. 4, [- -]), which represents hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs. First of all, it can be seen that the global DNA supercoiling level in the various strains, represented by the topoisomers distributions of pBR322ΔPtet DNA without considering hypernegatively supercoiled DNA, increases as the temperature decreases. This is expected, because the temperature-sensitive DNA gyrase becomes more active at low temperatures. It is also obvious that RNase H overproduction did not have any effect on global supercoiling level (for example, compare lane 5, +pEM001 with lane 6, +pEM003). Results presented in Fig. 4 also clearly demonstrate that, as opposed to pBR322ΔPtet DNA, RNase H overproduction abolished the generation of hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322Δtet5′ DNA (compare lane 5 withlane 6, 28 °C and lane 8 with lane 9, 21 °C). Most likely, such topoisomers are not produced at 37 °C, because DNA gyrase activity for R-loop elongation is too weak to counteract the wild-type level of RNase H activity. As the temperature decreases, DNA gyrase regains a higher level of activity, and the wild-type level of RNase H activity is no longer sufficient to completely abolish extensive R-loop formation; hence, the generation of hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322Δtet5′ DNA. Two-dimensional agarose gel analysis was also performed to confirm the presence of hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322Δtet5′ DNA and the fact that its formation is abolished by overproducing RNase H (Fig. 5, top panels). Fig. 5also shows that RNase H overproduction partially abolished the formation of hypernegatively supercoiled pACYC184Δtet5′(bottom panels), a pACYC184 derivative carrying an identical deletion to the one found in pBR322Δtet5′. ThetetA gene is the only common DNA sequence between pACYC184 and pBR322. As it is the case for pBR322 when the tetA gene of pACYC184 is translated, the formation of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA is not sensitive to RNase H overproduction (data not shown). One prediction that could be made regarding hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA, is that the formation of such topoisomers should be insensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors under conditions where DNA gyrase is active enough during transcription to promote R-loop formation. This is demonstrated by the experiment shown in Fig.6. Indeed, the protein synthesis inhibitor spectinomycin abolished the formation of hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322 only under conditions where DNA gyrase was not very active, therefore when RFM480 cells were grown at 37 °C (Fig. 6, compare lane 1 with lane 3, respectively, + or − spectinomycin). Under such conditions, hypernegative supercoiling has been shown to be dependent on membrane anchorage of the transcription complex via the TetA protein (15Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, when RFM480 cells were exposed to 21 °C, hypernegative supercoiling was not abolished by spectinomycin treatment as expected, because at this temperature DNA gyrase is active enough to promote R-loop-dependent hypernegative supercoiling (Fig. 6, compare lane 2 with lane 4, respectively, + or − spectinomycin). When a similar experiment was performed with the pBR322 derivative carrying the EcoRI-EcoRV deletion that completely inactivates tetA gene expression, only a very small amount of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs could be detected (data not shown). This result suggests that R-loop-dependent hypernegative supercoiling of pBR322 in the absence of translation is mostly related to tetA gene transcription. All together, the results of our in vivo experiments are in accordance with the model for R-loop formation during transcription byE. coli RNA polymerase. 1) RNase H-sensitive hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA, and hence R-loop formation, is detected under conditions where DNA gyrase is very active during transcription. Indeed, under these conditions, very weak tetA gene expression from pBR322ΔPtet DNA is still sufficient to trigger the formation of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA. 2) It is only in the absence of translation that RNase H-sensitive hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA, and hence R-loop formation, is detected. This is also in agreement with our previous results showing RNase H-sensitive hypernegative supercoiling when a portion of the untranslated rrnB operon was transcribed (7Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Two major conclusions emerge from the work presented here. First, R-loop formation is linked to transcription-induced supercoiling but not to global supercoiling level. This is in agreement with the results demonstrating that extensive R-loop formation does not normally occur during transcription on negatively supercoiled templates unlessE. coli RNA polymerase is denatured (Ref. 2Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and data not shown). This result shows that even under conditions where the negative supercoiling level favors R-loop formation, they do not form. It may suggest that DNA supercoiling is not a major contributor to R-loop formation when such structures are generated. The best studied example of R-loop formation involves the origin of replication of the ColE1 plasmid DNA. In these studies, R-loop formation was clearly shown to be nucleotide sequence-dependent (16Itoh T. Tomizawa J.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2450-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 17Masukata H. Tomizawa J.-I. Cell. 1990; 62: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the results of several in vitro and in vivoexperiments, including the work presented here, have clearly shown that extensive R-loops can form during transcription and that it is regulated by DNA topoisomerases that modulate the supercoiling level inE. coli (4Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 6Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because the global supercoiling level does not seem to be involved in R-loop formation, one obvious alternative explanation for the contribution of DNA topoisomerases in this process is in relation to transcription-induced supercoiling in the frame of the twin-domain model (9Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Our results support this interpretation. The model derived from this interpretation implies that the free nascent RNA, in addition to being directly involved in RNA-DNA hybrid formation, also contributes to the generation of negative supercoiling during transcription. Such supercoiling can promote DNA opening behind the moving RNA polymerase, which is a prerequisite to the initiation of the annealing between the nascent RNA and the corresponding DNA template region. DNA opening could also be promoted by specific DNA sequences and/or global supercoiling level. Once the R-loop is initiated, it creates an anchor for the moving RNA polymerase, inhibiting its rotation and hence increasing transcription-induced negative supercoiling. This supercoiling can promote R-loop elongation if it is not relaxed by DNA topoisomerase I. Indeed, anchorage of the RNA polymerase via the annealing of the nascent RNA with the DNA template strand was originally described as one potential mechanism for increasing transcription-induced supercoiling (9Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Anchoring the RNA polymerase will also increase transcription-induced positive supercoiling. Such supercoiling must be removed in order for the RNA polymerase and R-loop extension to progress at a proper rate. DNA gyrase will be involved in relaxing positive supercoiling, and therefore will contribute to R-loop elongation. DNA gyrase can also promote R-loop elongation by constantly replacing the negative supercoils removed by this process. Either way, DNA gyrase must be active enough to counteract the cellular RNase H activity that disrupts the R-loop. Therefore, if DNA gyrase is active enough, extensive, stable, and detectable R-loops will be generated. In the absence of RNase H, a mutated DNA gyrase, which even causes a decrease in global negative supercoiling below the wild-type level, will be sufficient for R-loop elongation. This is supported by the fact that doubletopA-rnhA mutants are nonviable (5Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) even when the strain carries very good compensatory gyr mutations, as in the case for the widely used DM800 topA null strain.1 Moreover, the growth of RFM480 in rich media is stimulated by RNase H overproduction even when global negative supercoiling is below the wild-type level (growth at 37 °C) (5Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in vitro transcription experiments withE. coli RNA polymerase from synthetic RNA-DNA bubble duplexes have shown that the nascent RNA was frequently rehybridizing to the permanently unpaired DNA bubble (18Daube S.S. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the frame of our model for R-loop formation, the presence of this permanent bubble can be viewed as an optimal condition for R-loop initiation. An important question that was not addressed in this study is related to RNA swiveling, which is required for extensive R-loop formation. In fact, the length of the R-loop when the RNA polymerase is still present on the template may not be limited by energetic considerations related to negative supercoiling, but rather by the capacity of the RNA to swivel. It is possible that the initiated R-loop behind the moving RNA polymerase eventually extends up to the transcription bubble. Under these conditions, the separator function of the RNA polymerase might be disrupted. In this context, swiveling of the RNA-DNA hybrid within the transcription bubble should be sufficient to allow the progression of transcription and R-loop elongation. This model can also explain the synthesis of the RNA primer at the ColE1 origin of replication (17Masukata H. Tomizawa J.-I. Cell. 1990; 62: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, additional experiments are required to solve this problem. The second important conclusion emerging from this study concerns the role of DNA topoisomerase I in E. coli. In a previous study (10Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16654-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it was shown that severe growth inhibition of topAnull mutants correlates with transcription-induced supercoiling. Together with the results presented in this study and the ones showing that RNase H overproduction stimulates the growth of topAnull mutants (5Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we can conclude that one major function of DNA topoisomerase I is to relax transcription-induced negative supercoiling to inhibit R-loop formation.

Thus, our results show for the first time that similar to cell proliferation, maintenance of a physiologically low intracellular Na+/K+ratio is required for progression of VSMC apoptosis. The maintenance of the transmembrane gradient of monovalent cation (high [K+]i and low [Na+]i) is a universal property of all nucleated cells, and its dissipation is viewed as a hallmark of necrotic-type cell death (1Wyllie A.H.

It was shown that a transient and moderate rise of intracellular Na+concentration in mitogen-treated cells is involved in rejoining DNA strand breaks preceding DNA synthesis (3Prasad C.V. Greer W.L.

Hypertens. 1988; 6 Suppl. 4: S219-S221Crossref Google Scholar). Much less is known about the role of the transmembrane gradient of monovalent ions in the triggering and progression of programmed cell death (apoptosis). Cell shrinkage is one of the initial morphological markers of apoptosis in all types of cells, particularly in VSMC (10Orlov S.N. Dam T.V. Tremblay J. Hamet P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 708-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In immune system cells, apoptotic shrinkage is so impressive that the term “shrinkage-mediated necrosis” was originally proposed to describe this type of cell death (11Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12858) Google Scholar), and the striking increase in the density of shrunken cells was used to separate intact from apoptotic cells (12Ohyama H. Yamada T. Watanabe I. Radiat. Res. 1981; 85: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,13Klassen N.V. Walker P.R. Ross C.K. Cygler J. Lach B. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1993; 64: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, the apoptotic cell volume decrease is caused by the loss of potassium chloride (14Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) and a major organic osmolyte, taurine (15Lang F. Madlung J. Uhlemann A.C. Risler T. Gulbins E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), because of the CD95 receptor-mediated activation of Cl− and K+ channels and the taurine outward transporter (for a recent review, see Ref. 16Lang F. Lepple-Wienhues A. Szabo I. Siemen D. Gulbins E. Lang F. Cell Volume Regulation. Contributions to Nephrology. Karger, Basel1998: 158-168Google Scholar). However, the involvement of perturbation of intracellular ion composition and the ionic strength of the cytoplasm in the triggering and development of the apoptotic machinery remains unclear. Recently, it was shown that equimolar substitution of extracellular Na+ by K+ protects Jurkat cells from apoptosis induced by Fas ligand receptors (14Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), suggesting that dissipation of K+gradients plays a role in the triggering of apoptosis in immune system cells. Here, we report that in contrast to Jurkat cells, inversion of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio blocks apoptosis of VSMC at a site upstream of Caspase-3, independently of the transmembrane gradient of monovalent cations and cell volume. VSMC were obtained by explant methods from the aortas of 10–13-week-old male rats as described previously (17Franks D.J. Plamondon J. Hamet P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), cultured in DMEM with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and used between 10 and 16 passages. Cells transfected with c-myc (VSMC-MYC) and E1A adenovirus (VSMC-E1A) were obtained in accordance with a previously described protocol (18Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Newby A.C. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and were cultured in the same medium with the addition of 500 μg/ml Geneticin. Jurkat cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplied with 10% calf serum, antibiotics, sodium pyruvate, glutamate, and β-mercaptoethanol. Chromatin cleavage in VSMC was estimated by a technique described previously in detail (10Orlov S.N. Dam T.V. Tremblay J. Hamet P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 708-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, VSMC grown in 24-well dishes were labeled for 24 h in serum-supplied DMEM with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml), washed with 2 × 2 ml of DMEM, and incubated in serum-supplied DMEM. For 48 h, the cells were pretreated with ouabain or K+-depleted medium as indicated in Fig. 2 and Table III, washed twice with serum-containing medium, and incubated with 0.5 ml of medium with or without ouabain and containing different inducers of apoptosis. To measure the content of chromatin fragments, the cells were transferred on ice, and 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 (pH 8.0)) was added. In 15 min, the cell lysate was transferred to Eppendorf tubes and sedimented (12,000 rpm, 10 min), and 1 ml of supernatant was transferred for the measurement of radioactivity (A 1t). The remaining radioactivity from pellets and wells was extracted with 0.5 ml of a mixture of 1% SDS and 4 mm EDTA, combined, and counted (A 2). Chromatin cleavage was quantified as the content of chromatin fragments normalized by total content of3H-labeled DNA in accordance with the equation (1.5 × (A 1t −A 1o)/(A 2 +A 1t − 1.5A 1o)) × 100%, whereA 1o is the value ofA 1t before induction of apoptosis. To measure chromatin fragmentation in [3H]thymidine-labeled Jurkat cells, the cells were resuspended at a density of 106 cells/ml in medium containing 10% calf serum; the additions are indicated in Fig. 4 and Table IV. At the time intervals shown in Fig. 4, 100 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and the content of chromatin fragments was measured as described previously in detail (20Garner R.

VSMC growing in six-well (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release) or 24-well (chromatin cleavage assay) plates were preincubated for 3 h with or without 1 mm ouabain. In part of the experiments, the cells were subjected to a 30-min incubation at 46 °C (heat-treated cells, line 3). They were then incubated in the absence (line 2) or presence (lines 1 and 3) of 10% calf serum during an additional 8 h, and chromatin cleavage and LDH release were measured as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” and with a spectrophotometric kit (Sigma), respectively. Means ± S.E. from experiments performed in triplicate (LDH release) or quadruplicate (chromatin cleavage) are given. Cells were incubated in K+-containing medium consisting of 91 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.9 mmNaH2PO4, 44 mm NaHCO3, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 33 mm HEPES, and 5 mm d-glucose (pH 7.4) (lines 1 and 2) or in K+-depleted medium (equimolar substitution of potassium chloride by sodium chloride, line 3) with or without 10% calf serum (CS) and 1 mm ouabain as indicated. In experiments with VSMC-MYC and VSMC-E1A, cells were preincubated for 1 h with ouabain or with K+-depleted medium in the presence of CS and then subjected to treatment with serum-free medium. After 24 h (VSMC) or 6 h (VSMC-MYC and VSMC-E1A), the content of chromatin fragments was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mean values ± S.E. obtained in three experiments performed in quadruplicate (VSMC) or triplicate (VSMC-MYC, VSMC-E1A) are given. To estimate chromatin cleavage, cells were incubated for 2 h in the presence of 10% calf serum in the control solution (DMEM, [Na+] = 137 mm; [K+] = 5 mm; line 1) or under equimolar substitution of NaCl with KCl ([Na+] = 14 mm; [K+] = 128 mm; line 2) with or without 1 mm ouabain and then for an additional 7 h in the same media with or without 100 ng/ml Fas ligand (Fas-L). Intracellular Na+ and K+content was measured as steady-state distribution of isotopes after a 24-h preincubation of cells in control Na+-enriched solution containing 0.5 μCi/ml 86Rb or 2 μCi/ml 22Na and an additional 6-h incubation in Na+ (line 1)- or K+ (line 2)-enriched medium containing 10% calf serum and isotopes with the same specific activity with or without 1 mm ouabain. For more details, see “Experimental Procedures.” Mean values ± S.E. obtained in experiments performed in triplicate are given. VSMC-E1A seeded in 75-cm2flasks were treated with 4 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% SDS, and 500 μg/ml proteinase K. The lysate was incubated at 50 °C for 3 h, mixed with 250 μg/ml RNase A, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After phenol-chloroform extraction, DNA was precipitated by the addition of a mixture containing 500 mm potassium acetate and ethanol (1:2, v:v). The precipitate was resuspended in water, and 1 μg of DNA was mixed with a solution containing 2 mm CoCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm potassium cacodilate, 0.5 mm[32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 15 units/μl terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (final volume, 20 μl). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the aliquots were loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel, run at 100 V for 3–4 h, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (for more details, see Ref. 21Hamet P. Richard L. Dam T.V. Teiger E. Orlov S.N. Gaboury L. Gossard F. Tremblay J. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). VSMC-E1A seeded in 20-cm2flasks and treated as indicated in Fig. 5 were scratched, transferred to centrifuge tubes, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 0.5 ml of Buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% CHAPS. Then, 50–100 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 600 μl of Buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 40 μm YVAD-AMC or DEVD-AMC, with or without 1 μm Caspase-1 and Caspase-3 inhibitors (Ac-YVAD-CHO and Ac-DEVD-CHO, respectively), incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and diluted 15-fold with 80 mm glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10). Fluorescence of the samples was measured at λex = 365 nm and λem = 465 nm and calibrated with AMC in the range of 10 to 100 nm. To measure Caspase activity in control and ouabain-treated Jurkat cells, 5 ml of suspension containing ∼2 × 107 cells was transferred onto ice and sedimented. The pellet of cells was washed and treated with 0.3 ml of Buffer A in the same way as VSMC. Protein content was estimated by the Bradford method. The intracellular content of exchangeable Na+and K+ was measured as steady-state distribution of extra- and intracellular 22Na and 86Rb, as described previously in detail (22Orlov S.N. Tremblay J. Hamet P. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, to establish the steady-state distribution of isotopes, VSMC growing in 12 (22Na)- or 24 (86Rb)-well plates or ∼106 Jurkat cells in suspension were preincubated for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 0.5 μCi/ml 86RbCl or 2 μCi/ml22NaCl and then treated in medium with the compositions shown in Fig. 1 and Tables III and IV and with the same specific radioactivity. At the end of the incubation time, the VSMC were transferred on ice, washed four times with 2 ml of ice-cold medium W, containing 100 mm MgCl2 and 10 mmHEPES-Tris buffer (pH 7.4), and lysed with an SDS/EDTA mixture. One ml of Jurkat cell suspension was applied on a Whatman type C filter with the cells being washed with 3 × 5-ml aliquots of ice-cold medium W under negative pressure at 20–30 mm Hg. The level of radioactivity of the incubation medium and the cell lysate was measured with a liquid scintillation analyzer. Intracellular cation content was determined asA/am, where A was the radioactivity of the samples (cpm), a was the specific radioactivity of Na+ and K+ (86Rb) in the medium (cpm/nmol), and m was the protein content determined by the method of Lowry. Previously, it was shown that the activity of apoptotic pathways triggered by serum deprivation can be heightened by transfection of VSMC with c-myc or with its functional analogue E1A adenoviral protein (VSMC-MYC and VSMC-E1A cells, respectively) (18Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Newby A.C. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We used these cells to study the involvement of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio in the regulation of VSMC apoptosis. To increase the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio, we inhibited Na+,K+ pump activity with ouabain or by depleting the incubation medium of K+. In VSMC-E1A, 2 h after the addition of ouabain, intracellular Na+content was augmented from 38 ± 8 to 283 ± 30 nmol/mg protein, whereas K+i dropped from 405 ± 41 to 131 ± 19 nmol/mg protein (Fig. 1, curves 1 and 3). Prolongation of the incubation with ouabain for up to 5 h did not significantly modify Na+i and K+i content in VSMC-E1A. The same kinetics of modulation of Na+iand K+i content were observed in ouabain-treated Jurkat cells (Fig. 1, curves 2 and 4) and in VSMC incubated in K+-depleted medium (data not shown). A 10-fold increase in the content of intracellular Na+ in ouabain treated Jurkat lymphocytes (Fig. 1, curve 2) is consistent with the same level of elevation of free Na+iconcentration in human peripheral lymphocytes after inhibition of the Na+,K+ pump in K+-depleted medium and measured with a fluorescent Na+-indicator, sodium binding benzofuran isophthalate (23Webb G.D. Taylor E.A. Oh V.M.S. Yeo S.-B. Ng L.L. Clin. Sci. 1995; 88: 695-700Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Considering these results, the effect of the [Na+]i/[K+]iratio on apoptosis was studied after 1–2 h of Na+,K+ pump inhibition. As seen in Fig. 2 a, serum deprivation drastically potentiated chromatin cleavage in VSMC-E1A, and after 6 h the content of chromatin fragments was 4.5 ± 0.4 and 26.3 ± 3.0% in control and serum-deprived media, respectively. Treatment with ouabain blocked base-line as well as serum withdrawal-induced chromatin cleavage. Similar to VSMC-E1A, the antiapoptotic effect of ouabain was also seen in serum-deprived VSMC-MYC as well as in nontransfected VSMC (TableI). In these experiments, Na+,K+ pump activity was also blocked by incubation of cells in K+-depleted medium. As with ouabain, this procedure sharply inhibited VSMC apoptosis (Table I). Fig. 2 b shows that apart from serum withdrawal, VSMC apoptosis can be triggered by inhibitors of protein kinase C and serine-threonine phosphatase. After 6 h of incubation of VSMC-E1A with staurosporine and okadaic acid, the content of chromatin fragments was increased up to 30.1 ± 4.7 and 28.3 ± 4.2%, respectively. Similar to serum-deprived cells (Fig. 2 a), apoptosis triggered by these compounds was blocked by treatment with ouabain (Fig. 2 b). Chromatin cleavage in control and ouabain-treated VSMC-E1A was insensitive to hyperosmotic shrinkage caused by the addition of 350 mm mannitol (Fig.2 b). This is consistent with previous results obtained in nontransfected VSMC (10Orlov S.N. Dam T.V. Tremblay J. Hamet P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 708-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic action of ouabain in VSMC was further confirmed by phase contrast microscopy and by analysis of DNA laddering. Fig.3 A shows that pretreatment with ouabain sharply decreased the number of apoptotic cells after 6 h of incubation of VSMC-E1A in serum-deprived medium. Treatment of VSMC-E1A with ouabain prevented DNA laddering and reduced the accumulation of low molecular weight 3′-end-labeled DNA oligonucleosomal fragments triggered by serum deprivation (Fig.3 B). Similar results were obtained with cells that underwent apoptosis in the presence of staurosporine and okadaic acid (data not shown). Recently, we reported that heat stress triggers necrosis but does not affect apoptosis in VSMC (24Champagne M.-J. Dumas P. Orlov S.N. Bennett M.R. Hamet P. Tremblay J. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, as can be seen from TableII, in contrast to serum-deprived cells, heat stress (46 °C, 30 min) did not modulate chromatin cleavage in VSMC but led to a 5-fold increase of lactate dehydrogenase release, a marker of necrosis. In contrast to apoptosis, we did not observe modulation by ouabain of heat stress-induced lactate dehydrogenase release. Viewed collectively, these data demonstrate that inhibition of the Na+,K+ pump protects VSMC against apoptosis but does not affect the necrotic type of cell death. Fig. 4 a shows that during a 7-h incubation of Jurkat cells in control medium, the content of chromatin fragments was increased monotonously up to ∼5%. After a 1.5-h incubation in the presence of Fas ligand (anti-human Fas, mouse monoclonal IgM), the content of chromatin fragments was increased by 10-fold and did not change much during the next 5.5 h of incubation (Fig. 4 a, curve 3). These kinetics are consistent with previously reported data (20Garner R. Helgason C.D. Atkinson E.A. Pinkosk"
https://openalex.org/W2061724992,"Wild-type p53 is degraded in part through the ubiquitin proteolysis pathway. Recent studies indicate that MDM2 can bind p53 and promote its rapid degradation although the molecular basis for this degradation has not been clarified. This report demonstrates that MDM2 can promote the ubiquitination of wild-type p53 and cancer-derived p53 mutants in transiently transfected cells. Deletion mutants that disrupted the oligomerization domain of p53 displayed low binding affinity for MDM2 and were poor substrates for ubiquitination. However, efficient MDM2 binding and ubiquitination were restored when an oligomerization-deficient p53 mutant was fused to the dimerization domain from another protein. These results indicate that oligomerization is required for p53 to efficiently bind and be ubiquitinated by MDM2. p53 ubiquitination was inhibited in cells exposed to UV radiation, and this inhibition coincided with a decrease in MDM2 protein levels and p53·MDM2 complex formation. In contrast, p53 dimerization was unaffected following UV treatment. These results suggest that UV radiation may stabilize p53 by blocking the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 mediated by MDM2.

Inactivation of p53 is considered an important step in the development of many human cancers. It is therefore important to determine how p53 levels are normally regulated and how this regulation is altered in cancer. The activity most associated with the tumor suppressor function of p53 is its ability to bind DNA and activate gene transcription (1Funk W. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 2Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

A. 1994; 91: 1988-2002Crossref Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This activity increases in response to DNA damage because of stabilization of the p53 protein (4Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 5Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The effect of increasing p53 is to stop cell proliferation, either through a G1-phase cell cycle arrest or apoptotic cell death (6Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4487) Google Scholar, 7Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6727) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that p53 is part of a DNA damage checkpoint pathway that monitors the genome integrity and protects cells from accumulating genetic damage. p53 carries out this function by temporarily halting cell proliferation to allow DNA repair, or, in the case of irreparable damage, by inducing cell death through apoptosis. Two proteolytic pathways have been implicated in p53 degradation: the calpain proteolytic pathway (8Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 9Pariat M. Carillo S. Molinari M. Salvat C. Debussche L. Bracco L. Milner J. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2806-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway (10Chowdary D.R. Bermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). The relative contribution of these two pathways to p53 turnover has not been clarified. The hallmark of the ubiquitin pathway is the covalent attachment of ubiquitin (an 8-kDa protein) to a substrate, which “marks” that substrate for degradation (reviewed in Ref. 12Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is first sequentially transferred through a series of ubiquitin system enzymes, designated E1, E2, and E3. The E3 enzyme then transfers the ubiquitin molecule to one or more lysine residues in the substrate (13Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Multiple ubiquitins are attached to one another to form ubiquitin chains, and the multi-ubiquitinated substrate is degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Proof that p53 is a ubiquitin-system target came with the demonstration of wild-type p53:ubiquitin conjugates in vivo (11Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). Factors that regulate and/or participate in p53 ubiquitination have not been fully characterized. Increasing evidence suggests that MDM2 can regulate p53 stability. MDM2 forms an autoregulatory feedback loop in which p53 activates MDM2 transcription, and increased levels of MDM2 protein then bind p53 and inhibit its transcriptional activity (14Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2787) Google Scholar, 15Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). DNA-damaging agents that stabilize p53 can promote p53 phosphorylation at serines 15 and 37 (16Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MDM2 was unable to inhibit the activity of p53 when p53 was phosphorylated at these sites. This could result if MDM2 is unable to bind p53 phosphorylated at Ser-15 and Ser-37. Other studies demonstrated that MDM2 can promote p53 degradation in transient transfection assays (17Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3705) Google Scholar, 18Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar). Though the basis of this degradation was not clarified, Honda et al. (19Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar) reported that MDM2 could promote p53 ubiquitination in vitro in the presence of E1 and E2 ubiquitin system enzymes. Further, MDM2 formed a thioester bond with ubiquitin, a characteristic of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. Mutations in MDM2 that abrogated thioester bond formation also abrogated p53 ubiquitination, suggesting that MDM2 functions as an E3 enzyme in p53 ubiquitination. Taken together, these studies provide a provocative model for the regulation of p53 stability. According to this model, MDM2 binds p53 under normal conditions and promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In response to DNA damage, p53 is phosphorylated at Ser-15 and Ser-37, preventing MDM2 binding and thus stabilizing p53. The stabilized p53 can then promote transcription of its downstream target genes, resulting in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. This report demonstrates the presence of p53:ubiquitin conjugates in cells transiently transfected with p53 expression DNAs. High levels of p53 ubiquitination were observed when cells were cotransfected with MDM2, providing evidence that MDM2 can promote p53 ubiquitinationin vivo. Deletion mutants that disrupted the oligomerization domain of p53 had low MDM2 binding affinity and were poor substrates for ubiquitination. However, efficient MDM2 binding and ubiquitination were restored when oligomerization-deficient p53 mutants were fused to a heterologous dimerization domain. Finally, p53 ubiquitination was inhibited in UV-irradiated cells, and this coincided with decreased MDM2 protein levels and p53·MDM2 complex formation. UV radiation may stabilize p53 by inhibiting the ubiquitination of p53 mediated by MDM2. Expression DNAs encoding wild-type p53, mutant p53s, and Myc-tagged ubiquitin were from Peter Howley (Harvard Medical School). HA-tagged p53 expression DNA was from Christine Jost (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). DNAs encoding p53-(1–363) and -(1–333) (20Pellegata N.S. Cajot J.-F. Stanbridge E.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar) were from Eric Stanbridge (University of California-Irvine). DNAs encoding p53-(1–353) and p53–333CC (3Pietenpol J.A. Tokino T. Thiagalingam S.

Human MDM2 expression DNA was from Steve Grossman (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). Human osteosarcoma cell lines Saos-2 (p53-null) and U2OS (wild-type p53) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) 1The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer. supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Transfections were done using the calcium-phosphate method (5Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) in 60- or 100-mm dishes with cells approximately 80% confluent. For 60-mm dishes, 4–5 μg of each p53 plasmid was transfected with an equal quantity of MDM2 plasmid, and the final DNA amount was adjusted to 12–15 micrograms with herring sperm DNA. For 100-mm dishes, 10 μg of p53 plasmid was transfected with 10 μg of MDM2, and the final DNA amount was adjusted to 25 micrograms. Saos-2 cells were washed twice with DMEM minus serum 6–8 h after addition of the DNA precipitate and then refed with DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell extracts were prepared 30–36 h later. U2OS cells were washed and refed 16 h after addition of the DNA precipitate. Where indicated, U2OS cells were UV irradiated (5Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and extracts prepared 3–7 h later. For detection of p53:ubiquitin conjugates, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 800-μl radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (RIPA) (2 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1.0% deoxycholate, 0.025% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were then sonicated for 10 pulses at setting 5, 50% output, with a Branson 450 sonifier, and spun at 15,000 ×g for 15 min. One-twentieth (40 μl) of the resulting supernatant was examined directly by immunoblotting. p53 was immunoprecipitated from the remaining supernatant using the p53 antibody Ab-6 (Oncogene Science). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 750 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and placed on ice for 30 min. Cells were then spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with either the p53 antibody 1801 (Oncogene Science) or the anti-HA polyclonal antibody HA.11 (Babco). Immunoprecipitates from RIPA or lysis buffer were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane. For detection of p53:ubiquitin conjugates, the membrane was autoclaved in water for 15 min prior to blocking with milk and probing with the p53 antibody Ab-6. MDM2 was detected in p53 immunoprecipitates using the MDM2 polyclonal antibody N-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). MDM2 can promote p53 degradation in transfected cells (17Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3705) Google Scholar, 18Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine the basis for this degradation and the amino acid determinants in p53 required for this effect. Saos-2 cells (p53 null) were transfected with expression DNAs encoding p53, MDM2, and myc-tagged ubiquitin. p53 was then immunoprecipitated and examined by immunoblotting with the p53 antibody Ab-6 (Fig. 1 A). A ladder of protein bands with molecular weights larger than p53 were recognized when p53 was coexpressed with MDM2. These bands ranged in size from ∼63 to 90 kDa, consistent with the addition of one to five ubiquitin moieties to p53. When Myc-tagged ubiquitin was coexpressed with p53 and MDM2, these bands shifted to a slightly larger molecular weight, consistent with the additional Myc-tag. To confirm these bands as p53:ubiquitin conjugates, cells were transfected with epitope-tagged p53 (HA-p53) and Myc-tagged ubiquitin. p53 was then immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and examined by immunoblotting for the myc epitope. The myc antibody recognized a ladder of bands in the immunoprecipitates, and these same bands were recognized by the p53 antibody Ab-6 (Fig. 1 B). These results prove that the ladder of bands is ubiquitinated p53 and thus prove that MDM2 can promote p53 ubiquitination. Cancer-derived p53 point mutants were also tested for MDM2-mediated ubiquitination (Fig. 2). The p53 mutants V143A and R248W were ubiquitinated to approximately equal levels when coexpressed with MDM2, while the R273H mutant was ubiquitinated to a much lesser extent. R273H ubiquitination could be seen on long gel exposures, but the extent of R273H ubiquitination was consistently lower than that of either V143A or R248W. This suggests that specific p53 mutations can affect the susceptibility of p53 to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination. The relative ability of each p53 mutant to bind MDM2 was assessed to determine whether the lower ubiquitination of R273H was because of a decreased ability to bind MDM2. This involved immunoprecipitation of mutant p53 from transfected cells, followed by immunoblotting for MDM2 (Fig. 3). Approximately equal levels of MDM2 were detected in V143A and R273H immunoprecipitates, while slightly lower MDM2 levels were detected in R248W immunoprecipitates. These results suggest that the decreased ubiquitination of R273H is not because of a decreased ability to bind MDM2.Figure 3MDM2 binding by mutant p53s. Saos-2 cells were transfected with the indicated p53 mutant alone, or cotransfected with MDM2, and cell lysates were prepared. A, p53 was immunoprecipitated with the p53 antibody 1801, and the immunoprecipitates were examined by immunoblotting with the MDM2 antibody N20. B, 50 micrograms of protein extract were examined without prior immunoprecipitation by immunoblotting for p53 and MDM2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Deletion analysis was used to identify p53 regions required for MDM2-mediated ubiquitination (Fig. 4). p53 contains four main functional domains (21Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2288) Google Scholar). Amino acids 1–42 comprise the transcriptional activation domain, and it is this region that binds MDM2. Residues102–292 encode the sequence-specific DNA binding domain. p53 binds DNA as a tetramer, and oligomerization is mediated by residues 324–355. The carboxyl terminus of p53 (residues 367–393) binds DNA nonspecifically and can allosterically regulate DNA binding by the central region. p53 proteins lacking 30 (p53-(1–363)), 40 (p53-(1–353)), or 60 (p53-(1–333)) C-terminal amino acids were tested for MDM2-mediated ubiquitination. p53-(1–363) and p53-(1–353) maintain the oligomerization function of p53, while oligomerization is lost in p53-(1–333) (22Marston N.J. Jenkins J.R. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1709-1715PubMed Google Scholar). All three deletion mutants maintain the major nuclear localization signal (NLSI, residues 316–325) of p53 (23Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Wild-type p53 and the deletion mutants p53-(1–363) and p53-(1–353) were efficiently ubiquitinated by MDM2 (Fig. 4), indicating that sequences between 353 and 393 are not critical for ubiquitination. In contrast, ubiquitination was drastically reduced in p53-(1–333), indicating that sequences between 333 and 353 are required for efficient ubiquitination. There are three possible explanations for these results. First, deletion of residues 333 to 353 may have removed critical lysine residues that are sites of p53 ubiquitination. There is one lysine (position 351) between residues 333 and 353, and a p53 protein with this site mutated to isoleucine was efficiently ubiquitinated by MDM2 (not shown). Second, deletion of residues 333 to 353 may have abrogated MDM2 binding. Third, p53 oligomerization may be required for ubiquitination by MDM2, and deleting this function in p53-(1–333) may have thus prevented ubiquitination. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were done to determine the relative ability of the p53 deletion mutants to bind MDM2 (Fig.5). High levels of MDM2 were detected in immunoprecipitates of wild-type p53, p53-(1–363), and p53-(1–353). In contrast, very low levels of MDM2 coimmunoprecipitated with p53-(1–333). These results establish a correlation between MDM2 binding and p53 ubiquitination and suggest that deletion of residues 333 to 353 abrogated p53 ubiquitination by diminishing the ability of p53 to bind MDM2. To determine whether oligomerization affected either p53 ubiquitination or p53·MDM2 binding, the effect of replacing the oligomerization domain of p53 with the dimerization domain from another protein was determined (Fig. 6). p53–333CC contains amino acids 1–333 of p53 fused to the dimerization domain from the yeast transcription factor GCN4 (3Pietenpol J.A. Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. El-Deiry W.S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1988-2002Crossref Scopus (382) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 A, wild-type p53 and p53–333CC were efficiently ubiquitinated by MDM2, while p53-(1–333) was not. Further, MDM2 co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type p53 and p53–333CC to comparable levels but did not coimmunoprecipitate with p53-(1–333) (Fig. 6 B). These results indicate that a heterologous dimerization domain can restore MDM2 binding and MDM2-mediated ubiquitination to an oligomerization-deficient p53. This is consistent with the findings of Karen Vousden and co-workers (24Kubbutat M.H.G. Ludwig R.L. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) who recently reported that p53 proteins with disrupted oligomerization function displayed decreased MDM2 binding affinity and lower susceptibility to MDM2-mediated degradation. We conclude that the ability to oligomerize is required for p53 to efficiently bind MDM2 and be targeted for ubiquitination. DNA-damaging agents stabilize p53 through an unknown mechanism. Given that p53 is targeted for ubiquitination by MDM2, one possibility is that MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 is inhibited in DNA-damaged cells. To test this possibility, cells were transfected with p53 alone, or in combination with MDM2, and subsequently DNA-damaged by exposure to UV light. The effect of UV exposure on p53 ubiquitination, p53·MDM2 complex formation, and p53 dimerization was then assessed (Fig. 7). U2OS cells were used for these experiments because p53 could be ubiquitinated in these cells in the absence of MDM2 coexpression. p53 ubiquitination was inhibited in the transfected cells between 1 and 7 h after UV treatment (Fig.7 A). This decrease in ubiquitination coincided with decreased MDM2 protein levels, and a corresponding decrease in p53·MDM2 complexes (Fig. 7 B). The effect of UV radiation on p53 dimerization was also assessed. Cells were cotransfected with DNAs encoding epitope-tagged p53-(HA-p53) and nontagged p53 and subsequently were exposed to UV radiation. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, followed by immunoblot analysis for p53. The ability of HA-tagged p53 to immunoprecipitate nontagged p53 was used as a measure of p53 dimerization in UV-irradiated and nonirradiated cells. As shown in Fig. 7 C, HA-tagged p53 could dimerize nontagged p53 in transfected cells, and this dimerization was not diminished after UV exposure. These results indicate that the decrease in p53·MDM2 complex formation following UV treatment did not involve a decrease in the ability of p53 to homodimerize. The activity of wild-type p53 is regulated in large part through changes in protein stability. It is of interest therefore to identify cellular factors that regulate p53 turnover. The most compelling evidence that MDM2 normally regulates p53 levels comes from David Lane and colleagues (25Bottger V. Bottger A. Howard S.F. Picksley S.M. Chene P. Garcia-Echeverria C. Hochkeppel H.K. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2141-2147PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bottger A. Bottger V. Sparks A. Liu W.L. Howard S.F. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 860-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Phage-display was used in these studies to identify a 12-amino acid peptide that mimics the MDM2 binding site in p53 and blocks p53·MDM2 binding. When expressed in cells containing low p53 levels, this peptide caused an accumulation of p53, activation of p53-responsive genes, and a cell cycle arrest. In contrast, a mutant peptide unable to block p53·MDM2 binding had no effect. These results provided strong evidence that p53 levels and activity are normally regulated by MDM2 interaction. Other studies demonstrated that MDM2 can promote p53 degradation in transient transfection assays (17Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3705) Google Scholar, 18Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar) although the basis of this degradation was not fully clarified. The current report demonstrates that MDM2 can promote the formation of p53:ubiquitin conjugates in vivo. These results are consistent with those of Honda et al. (19Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar), which suggested that MDM2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase in p53 ubiquitination. Cancer-derived p53 mutant proteins varied in their susceptibility to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, with the V143A and R248W mutants being more prone to ubiquitination than the R273H mutant. This did not appear to result from a lower ability of R273H to bind MDM2, suggesting that factors other than MDM2 binding can affect p53 ubiquitination. One possibility is that these p53 mutants vary in their subcellular localization, and this accounts for their differences in ubiquitination. It has been suggested that p53 ubiquitination by MDM2 occurs in the nucleus (27Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and certain p53 mutants may be retained in the cytoplasm (28Martinez J. Georgoff I. Martinez J. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) where they may not be ubiquitinated. The conformation of p53 might also affect its susceptibility to ubiquitination. It is worth noting that the V143A and R248W p53 mutants were more highly ubiquitinated than either wild-type p53 or R273H. Perhaps R273H adopts a more wild-type conformation than V143A or R248W and so is less susceptible to ubiquitination. Deletion analyses indicated that the C-terminal oligomerization domain of p53 was required for efficient MDM2 binding and ubiquitination. This is perhaps surprising given that the MDM2 binding site in p53 is located in the N terminus of p53 (29Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Further, MDM2 can interact with peptides from the N terminus of p53, indicating that C-terminal sequences are not essential for the interaction to occur. Perhaps the MDM2 binding domain in p53 assumes a more complex tertiary structure when p53 is oligomerized, which enhances its affinity for MDM2. These results are consistent with those of Karen Vousden and her coworkers (24Kubbutat M.H.G. Ludwig R.L. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) who recently demonstrated that p53 proteins with disrupted oligomerization function displayed decreased binding affinity for MDM2 and were less susceptible to MDM2-mediated degradation. p53 is stabilized in response to various DNA damaging agents, including ionizing radiation (5Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), UV radiation (5Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), actinomycin D (30Kessis T.D. Slebos R.J. Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Plunkett B.S. Han S.M. Lorincz A.T. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3988-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), and cisplatin (31Perego P. Giarola M. Righetti S.C. Supino R. Caserini C. Delia D. Pierotti M.A. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Zunino F. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 556-562PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this stabilization is unknown. Two proteolytic pathways have been implicated in p53 degradation; the calpain proteolysis system (8Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 9Pariat M. Carillo S. Molinari M. Salvat C. Debussche L. Bracco L. Milner J. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2806-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the ubiquitin proteolysis system (10Chowdary D.R. Bermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). Given that p53 is degraded through these two pathways, one possibility is that DNA damaging agents signal a repression of p53 degradation through the calpain system, the ubiquitin system, or both. This report demonstrates that p53 ubiquitination is inhibited in response to UV radiation. This inhibition coincided with decreased expression of MDM2, and a decrease in p53·MDM2 complexes. This suggests that UV radiation may stabilize p53, at least in part, by inhibiting MDM2 expression and thus blocking the ubiquitination and degradation of p53. DNA-damaging agents can promote p53 phosphorylation, and it has been suggested that this phosphorylation could stabilize p53 by blocking p53·MDM2 complex formation (16Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). It remains possible that such post-translational modifications might also contribute to the UV-induced loss of p53 ubiquitination observed in the current report. Current models suggest that p53 functions in a pathway that monitors the DNA and protects cells from accumulating genetic damage. p53 carries out this function in response to DNA damage by temporarily halting cell proliferation to allow DNA repair or by eliminating the damaged cell through apoptosis (6Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4487) Google Scholar, 7Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6727) Google Scholar). This model predicts that p53 inactivation would be necessary for cells to resume cycling following repair of the damaged DNA. In this regard, it is worth noting the studies of Perry et al. (32Perry M.E. Piette J. Zawadzki J.A. Harvey D. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) in which the kinetics of MDM2 and p53 induction were examined in UV-irradiated cells. Three important findings emerged: 1) the induction of MDM2 was delayed in UV-treated cells even though p53 levels rose almost immediately; 2) MDM2 induction was delayed for longer periods of time with increasingly larger UV doses; and 3) the time of MDM2 induction was correlated with the recovery of normal rates of DNA synthesis, presumably after DNA repair. Based on these results, it is reasonable to speculate that MDM2 expression may be inhibited in UV-irradiated cells to allow an accumulation of p53 and a subsequent cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. Once DNA repair is completed, the induction of MDM2 may then allow for p53 ubiquitination and degradation and for continued cell cycle progression. It will be of interest to determine whether MDM2 induction following UV radiation is coincident with repair of the UV-induced DNA lesions. This would suggest that MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53 is important for cells to resume cycling after DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2046051847,"The small GTPase Rho and one of its targets, Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), are implicated in a wide spectrum of cellular functions, including cytoskeletal rearrangements, transcriptional activation and smooth muscle contraction. Since Rho also plays an essential role in cytokinesis, Rho-kinase may possibly mediate some biological aspects of cytokinesis. Here, using a series of monoclonal antibodies that can specifically recognize distinct phosphorylated sites on glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin, phosphorylation sites by Rho-kinase in vitro were revealed to be identical to in vivo phosphorylation sites on these intermediate filament (IF) proteins at the cleavage furrow in dividing cells. We then found, by preparing two types of anti-Rho-kinase antibodies, that Rho-kinase accumulated highly and circumferentially at the cleavage furrow in various cell lines. This subcellular distribution during cytokinesis was very similar to that of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins and Ser19-phosphorylated myosin light chain. These results raise the possibility that Rho-kinase might be involved in the formation of the contractile ring by modulating these F-actin-binding proteins during cytokinesis and in the phosphorylation and regulation of IF proteins at the cleavage furrow."
https://openalex.org/W1984838097,"Chromosome translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) is unique to synovial sarcomas and results in an 'in frame' fusion of the SYT gene with the SSX1 or closely-related SSX2 gene. Wild-type SYT and SSX proteins, and the SYT-SSX chimaeric proteins, can modulate transcription in gene reporter assays. To help elucidate the role of these proteins in cell function and neoplasia we have performed immunolabelling experiments to determine their subcellular localization in three cell types. Transient expression of epitope-tagged proteins produced distinctive nuclear staining patterns. The punctate staining of SYT and SYT-SSX proteins showed some similarities. We immunolabelled a series of endogenous nuclear antigens and excluded the SYT and SYT-SSX focal staining from association with these domains (e.g. sites of active transcription, snRNPs). In further experiments we immunolabelled the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins RING1 or BMI-1 and showed that SSX and SYT-SSX proteins, but not SYT, co-localized with these markers. Consistent with this we show that SSX and SYT-SSX associate with chromatin, and also associate with condensed chromatin at metaphase. Noteably, SSX produced a dense signal over the surface of metaphase chromosomes whereas SYT-SSX produced discrete focal staining. Our data indicate that SSX and SYT-SSX proteins are recruited to nuclear domains occupied by PcG complexes, and this provides us with a new insight into the possible function of wild-type SSX and the mechanism by which the aberrant SYT-SSX protein might disrupt fundamental mechanisms controlling cell division and cell fate."

Evolution of the CML to the more agressive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is accompanied by increased cellular proliferation and genomic instability at the cytogenetic level. We hypothezised that genomic instability at the nucleotide level and spontaneous error in DNA replication may also contribute to the evolution of CML to AML. Murine Ba/F3 cell line was transfected with the p190 and p210-encoding BCR – ABL oncogenes, and spontaneous mutation frequency at the Na-K-ATPase and the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) loci were measured. A significant 3 – 5-fold increase in mutation frequency for the transfected cells relative to the untransfected control cells was found. Furthermore, we observed that BCR – ABL transfection induced an overexpression of DNA polymerase β, the most inaccurate of the mammalian DNA polymerases, as well as an increase in its activity, suggesting that inaccuracy of DNA replication may account for the observed mutator phenotype. These data suggest that the Philadelphia abnormality confers a mutator phenotype and may have implications for the potential role of DNA polymerase β in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2043154103,"Filamentous phage f1 exits its Escherichia coli host without killing the bacterial cell. It has been proposed that f1 is secreted through the outer membrane via a phage-encoded channel protein, pIV. A functional pIV mutant was isolated that allowed E. coli to grow on large maltodextrins and rendered E. coli sensitive to large hydrophilic antibiotics that normally do not penetrate the outer membrane. In planar lipid bilayers, both mutant and wild-type pIV formed highly conductive channels with similar permeability characteristics but different gating properties: the probability of the wild-type channel being open was much less than that of the mutant channel. The high conductivity of pIV channels suggests a large-diameter pore, thus implicating pIV as the outer membrane phage-conducting channel."

Although GAGA binding sites frequently show a degenerated nucleotide composition, a “consensus” binding site containing 3.5 dinucleotide repeats was derived from the analysis of about 50 different sites found at promoter regions (1Granok H.

In this study, we have shown that, also in the case of the GAGA protein, the N-terminal POZ domain mediates the formation of oligomers both in vitro and in vivo. GAGA oligomers bind DNA with high affinity and specificity, being capable of binding adjacent sites spaced by as many as 20 bp. The interaction of GAGA with DNA fragments carrying several d(GA·TC)n sequences is of higher affinity than its interaction with fragments containing a single short binding site. These observations are discussed in view of the clustered organization of GAGA binding sites at promoter regions and might also have consequences in the context of the efficient contribution of GAGA to nucleosome disruption.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that GAGA forms oligomers both in vitroand in vivo. Others (19Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have also reported the formation of GAGA-DNA complexes compatible with the formation of GAGA oligomers. Here, however, we have been able to show that formation of these oligomers, which exist in solution in the absence of DNA binding, requires the contribution of the N-terminal POZ domain and that GAGA can form different types of oligomers, dimers, but also tetramers and complexes of high stoichiometry. Several results indicate that these oligomeric forms do not arise from the unspecific in vitroself-aggregation of the protein. First, they bind d(GA·TC)nsequences with high specificity as reflected by the fact that their DNase I footprints do not extend beyond the d(GA·TC)nsequence, even when binding to DNA fragments carrying two independent binding sites spaced by as few as 5 bp (Fig. 7). Second, the formation of these GAGA oligomers requires the contribution of specific protein-protein interactions involving the N-terminal POZ domain, deletion of the first 6 or the last 21 amino acid residues of the domain abolishing the interaction in vivo. Finally, these GAGA oligomers are functionally active, being transcriptionally competent in vitro. Altogether, these observations indicate that GAGA oligomers are functionally active forms of the protein arising from specific protein-protein interactions.The crystal structure of the POZ domain of the human promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein was recently reported (20Ahmad K.F. Engel C.K. Privé G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12123-12128Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the crystal, the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger POZ domain forms a dimer that is held together by interactions involving the most N- and C-terminal regions of the monomers. In particular, the five most N-terminal residues of one monomer form a β1-strand that interacts with an internal β5′-strand on the second monomer. One face of this β1/β5′ sheet is then packed against the α6′ helix of the second monomer, which spans the last 15 residues, establishing a number of stabilizing hydrophobic interactions. These interactions provide a reasonable interpretation for the strong effect that terminal deletions have on GAGA oligomerization in vivo, because given its high degree of conservation, it is reasonable to assume that all POZ domains will have a similar fold.Our results indicate that in solution GAGA can form dimers and tetramers, as well as oligomers of higher stoichiometry. This behavior is not influenced by the source of the protein used that, in the experiments reported here, was expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged protein. Non-His-tagged recombinant GAGA also binds DNA as an oligomer (21Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Espinás M.L. Soliva R. Orozco M. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J. Biol.

Other POZ domain-containing proteins have also been shown to form oligomers (7Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 8Chen W. Zollman S.

Couderc J.L. Laski F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10717-10721Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Although, in general, the stoichiometry of these complexes was not determined, the formation of both dimers and tetramers was observed in some cases (12Robinson D.N. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 799-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interestingly, though the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger POZ domain appears to form only dimers in solution, the formation of a short four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet between two symmetry related dimers is observed in the crystal (20Ahmad K.F. Engel C.K. Privé G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12123-12128Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This interaction involves four different peptide chains and, therefore, can give rise to the formation of tetramers and oligomers of higher stoichiometry.The binding experiments reported here were performed under conditions where GAGA exists mainly as tetramers and oligomers of higher stoichiometry. Consistent with these results, the GAGA-DNA complexes formed under these conditions are of high M. However, when the binding was performed under conditions where a significant percentage of the GAGA molecules exists as oligomers of low stoichiometry, the formation of protein-DNA complexes of low M could also be observed (Fig. 4), indicating that the GAGA species of low stoichiometry, monomers and dimers, can also bind DNA. Nevertheless, the formation of GAGA-DNA complexes of high M is also observed under these conditions, predominating at high protein concentration (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that the GAGA oligomers of high stoichiometry bind DNA very efficiently or, alternatively, that DNA binding facilitates GAGA oligomerization.Others (7Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) had reported earlier that GAGA, through its POZ domain, forms in vitro heteromeric complexes of unknown stoichiometry with other POZ domain-containing proteins, such astramtrack. Several other Drosophila proteins, including the enhancer of variegation E(var)3–39D, contain similar POZ domains (13Zollman S. Godt D. Prive G.G. Couderc J.L. Laski F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10717-10721Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 25Dorn R. Krauss V. Reuter G. Saumweber H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11376-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether they can also interact with GAGA. These observations indicate that the POZ domain is likely to play a key role in the control of GAGA function(s) in vivo, by regulating its oligomerization state and its interaction with other proteins. Interestingly, GAGA associates with the centromeric (AAGAG)n heterochromatin during mitosis (3Platero J.S. Csink A.K. Quintanilla A. Henikoff S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4Raff J.W. Kellum R. Alberts B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5977-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The formation of large oligomers might play a role in this context. The POZ domain might also regulate DNA binding. Earlier studies indicate that the POZ domain inhibits the interaction of GAGA with a short 17-bp-long DNA fragment carrying a single GAGA binding site (7Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). We have also observed that, compared with the BDGAGA peptide, GAGA binds with high difficulty to short synthetic oligonucleotides (not shown). However, as reported here and elsewhere (5Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Tsukiyama T. Becker P. Wu C. Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), GAGA binds efficiently to DNA fragments carrying longer or multiple GAGA binding sites. Our results also show that the affinity of GAGA for DNA depends strongly on the length and number of binding sites, being significantly lower for fragments carrying single short d(GA·TC)n sequences than for fragments carrying either several short sites or a long one, providing a reasonable interpretation for the apparently contradictory results mentioned above.We have shown here that a single GAGA oligomer can bind two adjacent GAGA binding sites spaced by as many as 20 bp. Others have recently reported similar results (34Katsani K.R. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As judged from EMSA and DNase I footprinting experiments, this interaction is of high affinity and specificity. As mentioned before, most frequently, promoters contain clusters of independent d(GA·TC)n sequences that, as derived from our results, could be bound by a single GAGA complex. Previously reported results suggest that this situation might occur both in vitro (16Soeller W.C. Poole S.J. Kornberg T.B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Read D. Nishigaki T. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4334-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and in vivo (28Weber J.A. Gilmour D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3327-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, a single short d(GA·TC)n sequence is not a good substrate for GAGA binding in vitro. These results suggest that several adjacent d(GA·TC)n sequences are required to create a GAGA binding site of high affinity. Given the repetitive character of the sequences that GAGA recognizes, this mode of interaction, requiring the presence of several independent d(GA·TC)n sites for efficient protein binding, provides an additional factor that increases the specificity of the interaction of GAGA with DNA.Several observations suggest that, to some extent, GAGA functions at the chromatin level, participating in the formation of an open chromatin structure. GAGA is the product of theTrithorax-like(Trl) gene (29Farkas G. Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H. Karch F. Nature. 1994; 371: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) which, being a member of theTrithorax group, antagonizes the chromatin-mediated repression that Polycomb genes induce on the expression of the homeotic genes. A more direct link to chromatin structure is indicated by the fact that Trl is an enhancer of position effect variegation (29Farkas G. Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H. Karch F. Nature. 1994; 371: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Moreover, in collaboration with nucleosome remodeling factor, GAGA was shown to help nucleosome disruption at specific regions of the hsp70 promoter, encompassing GAGA binding sites (26Tsukiyama T. Becker P. Wu C. Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 30Okada M. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2455-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). At present, little is known about the specific contribution of GAGA to chromatin remodeling and, although other DNA-binding proteins such as HSF (heat shock factor) or GAL4-HSF can also help disrupting chromatin organization (29Farkas G. Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H. Karch F. Nature. 1994; 371: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 31Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 32Wall G. Varga-Weisz P.D. Sandaltzopoulos R. Becker P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), GAGA appears to be particularly efficient in this respect (31Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 33Mizuguchi G. Tsukiyama T. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although a direct interaction with the chromatin remodeling machinery cannot be excluded, the simultaneous interaction of GAGA oligomers with multiple adjacent sites could significantly contribute to the higher efficiency of GAGA in disrupting nucleosomes. In this context, it would be interesting to know whether a functional POZ domain is required for efficient nucleosome disruption. GAGA can also activate transcriptionin vitro suggesting a possible interaction with the basal transcription machinery. Our results indicate that the presence of several independent GAGA sites is required for efficient transcription activation in vitro, indicating that the oligomeric character of GAGA might also be functionally relevant in this context. Interestingly, in the case of the ΔPOZ245 peptide, significant transcription activation is detected in the presence of a single binding site, and no synergism is observed upon increasing the number of GAGA binding sites. These results suggest that the synergism observed with full GAGA arises from specific features of the GAGA-DNA complex rather than from the simple recruitment of multiple GAGA molecules to the promoter. The GAGA factor is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, which participates in the regulation of the expression of a variety of different classes of genes in Drosophila such as many developmentally regulated genes, stress induced genes, and cell cycle regulated genes, as well as housekeeping genes (for reviews see Refs. 1Granok H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3963-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). GAGA binds repeated d(GA·TC)n sequences. As judged from the size of the regions protected from DNase I cleavage, GAGA binding sites are variable in length, ranging from 10 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); Ni2-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; M, molecular mass. 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); Ni2-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; M, molecular mass. to more than 40 bp, with an average of 15 bp (1Granok H. Leibovitch B.A. Shaffer C.D. Elgin S.C.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 238-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). GAGA can also bind to the (AAGAG)nand (AAGAGAG)n satellite DNAs, which constitute exceptionally long GAGA binding sites (3Platero J.S. Csink A.K. Quintanilla A. Henikoff S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4Raff J.W. Kellum R. Alberts B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5977-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although GAGA binding sites frequently show a degenerated nucleotide composition, a “consensus” binding site containing 3.5 dinucleotide repeats was derived from the analysis of about 50 different sites found at promoter regions (1Granok H. Leibovitch B.A. Shaffer C.D. Elgin S.C.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 238-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A remarkable feature of the GAGA binding sites is their multiplicity so that, in general, promoters contain multiple sites spaced by relatively short variable distances (5Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).

We have examined the regulation by MEKK3 of MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7) and MKK6, two novel MAPK kinases specific for JNK and p38, respectively. Coexpression of MKK7 with MEKK3 in COS-7 cells enhanced MKK7 autophosphorylation and its ability to activate recombinant JNK1 in vitro. MKK6 autophosphorylation and in vitro activation of p38α were also observed following coexpression of MKK6 with MEKK3. MEKK2, a closely related homologue of MEKK3, also activated MKK7 and MKK6 in COS-7 cells. Importantly, immunoprecipitates of either MEKK3 or MEKK2 directly activated recombinant MKK7 and MKK6 in vitro. These data identify MEKK3 as a MAPK kinase kinase specific for MKK7 and MKK6 in the JNK and p38 pathways. We have also examined whether MEKK3 or MEKK2 activates p38 in intact cells using MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2) as an affinity ligand and substrate. Anisomycin, sorbitol, or the expression of MEKK3 in HEK293 cells enhanced MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation, whereas MEKK2 was less effective. Furthermore, MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation induced by MEKK3 or cellular stress was abolished by the p38 inhibitor SB-203580, suggesting that MEKK3 is coupled to p38 activation in intact cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinasekinase kinase 3 (MEKK3) activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, although no substrates for MEKK3 have been identified. We have examined the regulation by MEKK3 of MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7) and MKK6, two novel MAPK kinases specific for JNK and p38, respectively. Coexpression of MKK7 with MEKK3 in COS-7 cells enhanced MKK7 autophosphorylation and its ability to activate recombinant JNK1 in vitro. MKK6 autophosphorylation and in vitro activation of p38α were also observed following coexpression of MKK6 with MEKK3. MEKK2, a closely related homologue of MEKK3, also activated MKK7 and MKK6 in COS-7 cells. Importantly, immunoprecipitates of either MEKK3 or MEKK2 directly activated recombinant MKK7 and MKK6 in vitro.

Raf-1 activation by cell surface receptors involves Ras-GTP, which binds to the NH2-terminal domain of Raf-1, causing its translocation and activation at the plasma membrane (1Marshall C.J.

To determine the role of the prenyl modification in the interaction of βγ dimers with effectors, the CAAX (where A indicates alipathic amino acid) motifs in the γ1, γ2, and γ11 subunits were altered to direct modification with different prenyl groups. Six recombinant βγ dimers were overexpressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, purified, and examined for their ability to stimulate three phospholipase C-β isozymes and type II adenylyl cyclase. The native β1γ2 dimer (γ subunit modified with geranylgeranyl) is more potent and effective in activating phospholipase C-β than either the β1γ1 (farnesyl) or the β1γ11 (farnesyl) dimers. However, farnesyl modification of the γ subunit in the β1γ2dimer (β1γ2-L71S) caused a decrement in its ability to activate phospholipase C-β. In contrast, both the β1γ1-S74L (geranylgeranyl) and the β1γ11-S73L (geranylgeranyl) dimers were more active than the native forms. The β1γ2dimer activates type II adenylyl cyclase about 12-fold; however, neither the β1γ1 nor the β1γ11 dimers activate the enzyme. As was the case with phospholipase C-β, the β1γ2-L71S dimer was less able to activate adenylyl cyclase than the native β1γ2dimer. Interestingly, neither the β1γ1-S74Lnor the β1γ11-S73L dimers stimulated adenylyl cyclase. The results suggest that both the amino acid sequence of the γ subunit and its prenyl group play a role in determining the activity of the βγ-effector complex.

Selective assembly of βγ heterodimers from these proteins may produce a large number of unique complexes that differ in their interactions with α subunits, receptors, and effectors. While the first four β subunits identified, β1–β4, are 85–90% identical in primary amino acid sequence (9Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), the γ subunits are much more divergent. For example, the γ1 and γ5 subunits are only 25% identical. Thus, the γ subunits may impart some specificity to the βγ signal. The G protein γ subunits are subject to post-translational modification by the addition of isoprenoid lipids to an invariant cysteine residue in the CAAX motif at their C terminus (15Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Casey P.J. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The last amino acid (X) of the CAAXmotif is an important determinant for modification by one of two distinct isoprenoids, the 15-carbon farnesyl group or the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group. Among the 11 known γ subunits, the γ1, γ8, and γ11 subunits are thought to be modified with the addition of a 15-carbon farnesyl group, whereas the other γ subunits contain a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group (10Ray K. Kunsch C. Bonner L.M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21765-21771Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The γ11 subunit was recently identified as a widely expressed γ subunit that is 76% identical to the γ1subunit (10Ray K. Kunsch C. Bonner L.M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21765-21771Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Morishita R. Ueda H. Kato K. Asano T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the function of βγ dimers containing the γ11 subunit has not been studied. Moreover, the significance of farnesyl versus geranylgeranyl modification of the γ subunit in βγ subunit-mediated activation of effectors has not been established. Lipid modification is important for anchoring the βγ subunit to the membrane (17Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Gierschik P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since the γ subunits may have different primary amino acid sequences and different prenyl groups at their C terminus, investigators have attempted to determine whether the type of prenyl group is an important determinant of the activity of the βγ dimer. Some studies suggest that βγ dimers containing the farnesylated γ1 subunit couple rhodopsin to the Gt α subunit more effectively (27Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25356-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), while others show a small increase in the activity of βγ dimers containing a geranylgeranylated γ1 subunit in receptor-coupling assays (29Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Ueda H. Asano T. Matsuura Y. Doi T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Fukada Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9843-9850Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have determined that βγ dimers containing a geranylgeranyl group on the γ subunit couple the Gi α subunit to the A1 adenosine receptor more effectively than those containing a farnesyl group (30Yasuda H.

Overall, these results suggest that the type of prenyl group on the γ subunit does play an important role in determining the activity of βγ dimers. Most investigators have considered that the prenyl group is involved in tethering the βγ subunit to the membrane (17Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

However, the recent x-ray crystal structure of a phosducin-βγ complex, which was crystallized with an intact γ subunit containing a farnesyl group, shows that the isoprenoid group folds into a hydrophobic pocket formed by blades 6 and 7 of the β propeller (31Loew A. Ho Y.-K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the conformation of the β subunit in this complex is different from the conformation of the free βγ dimer (32Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that there is an active conformation of the βγ dimer, which occurs upon binding to effectors, and that the prenyl group participates in establishing this conformation. These observations provide a compelling reason to examine the ability of βγ dimers in which the γ subunit contains different isoprenoid lipids in regulating effectors. We have reported previously that the prenyl group on the γ1 and γ2 subunits can be altered by mutation of the last amino acid (X) in the CAAXmotif at their C terminus (30Yasuda H. Lindorfer M.A. Woodfork K.A. Fletcher J.E. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18588-18595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Lindorfer M.A. Sherman N.E.

Expression of the mutant γ subunits in Sf9 cells with a β subunit allows formation of functional βγ dimers in which the lipid on the γ subunit has been changed from farnesyl to geranylgeranyl or vice versa (30Yasuda H.

Using this approach, we have purified six recombinant βγ dimers containing γ subunits with native or altered prenyl groups and verified that the altered CAAX sequences result in the expected post-translational modifications using mass spectrometry. We examined the effects of the β1γ2, β1γ1, and β1γ11dimers and their prenyl mutants on the activity of PLC-β and type II adenylyl cyclase. The results indicate that both the primary amino acid sequence of the γ subunits and the type of prenyl group on the γ subunit are important determinants of the activation of PLC-β and type II adenylyl cyclase. The recombinant baculoviruses encoding the αS, β1, γ1, γ2 subunits (34Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Neurosci. 1996; 29: 207-226Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the γ1 and γ2 subunits with altered prenylation sequences in the CAAX motifs, γ1-S74L and γ2-L71S, were prepared as described (33Lindorfer M.A. Sherman N.E.

A full-length cDNA encoding the human γ11 protein was identified in the expressed sequence tag data base and obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. (γ11, GenBankTM accession number H00850). To minimize the length of the construct 5′ from the ATG start codon, the polymerase chain reaction was used to add aSmaI restriction site to the 5′ end of γ11. For the γ11 cDNA, the primers used were: sense primer, 5′-TCCCGGGCGAAAATGCCTGCC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCACTTAGGATGCAGTTTCTCCC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the pCNTR shuttle vector, and the γ11coding sequence excised from pCNTR with SmaI andXbaI was ligated into these sites in the baculovirus transfer vector, pVL1393. The cDNA encoding a γ11with the altered prenylation sequence in the CAAX motif, γ11-S73L, was constructed with the same strategy. Modification of the C-terminal CAAX motif of γ11 was performed using polymerase chain reaction to introduce a CVIS → CVIL into the CAAX sequence. To produce the γ11-S73L cDNA, the primers used were: sense primer, 5′-TCCCGGGCGAAAATGCCTGCC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TTTATAAAATAACACAGCTGCC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the pCNTR shuttle vector, digested withSmaI and XbaI, and ligated into these sites in the pVL1393 transfer vector. The completed constructs of both γ11 and γ11-S73L in the pVL1393 transfer vector were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the γ sequences. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced by co-transfecting each recombinant plasmid DNA with linear wild type BaculoGold® viral DNA (PharMingen) into Sf9 cells as described (36Fletcher J.E.

The recombinant baculoviruses were purified by one round of plaque purification (37Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-56Google Scholar). G protein α and βγ subunits were overexpressed by infecting Sf9 insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses as described (34Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Neurosci. 1996; 29: 207-226Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were co-infected at a multiplicity of infection of 3 with the appropriate β and γ recombinant baculoviruses and harvested 48 h after infection. The βγ subunits were extracted from frozen cell pellets with 0.1% Genapol C-100 and purified on a DEAE column followed by affinity chromatography on a Gi1-α-agarose column as described (35Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Neurosci. 1996; 29: 207-226Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The Gs α subunit used in the adenylyl cyclase assays was prepared from a 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS extract of crude cell lysates as described (36Fletcher J.E. Lindorfer M.A. DeFilippo J.M. Yasuda H.

Recombinant turkey PLC-β and human PLC-β1 and PLC-β2 were purified to homogeneity following overexpression in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells using chromatography on Q-Sepharose FF, heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, HPHT hydroxylapatite, Sephacryl S-300, and FPLC Mono Q HR 5/5 columns as described previously (38Paterson A.

Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Full processing of the γ subunit requires the addition of either a farnesyl or a geranylgeranyl group to the C-terminal cysteine in the CAAX motif, the removal of the three C-terminal amino acids (AAX), and the addition of a carboxymethyl group to the C terminus (16Casey P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 33Lindorfer M.A. Sherman N.E. Woodfork K.A. Fletcher J.E. Hunt D.F. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18582-18587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine the extent of the post-translational lipid modification of the γ subunits, the six purified βγ dimers used in this study were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry as described previously (33Lindorfer M.A. Sherman N.E. Woodfork K.A. Fletcher J.E. Hunt D.F. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18582-18587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The result of this analysis showed that 96% of the native γ1 subunit contained the expected farnesyl group and had a completely processed C terminus. Similarly, 87% of the prenyl mutant, γ1-S74L, contained the geranylgeranyl group and was fully processed at its C terminus. Ninety-one percent of the γ2 subunit and 70% of the γ11 subunit were found to have the expected geranylgeranyl and farnesyl groups, respectively, and a completely processed C terminus. The prenyl mutants of these two γ subunits, γ2-L71S and γ11-S73L, were fully processed with expected isoprenoid lipids to the extent of 95 and 87%, respectively. Therefore, all γ subunits used in this study contain the expected isoprenoid lipid at the C terminus and are capable of high-affinity interactions with α subunits, receptors and effectors. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared as described (40Myung C.-S. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipids were mixed at a molar ratio of 4:1 of phosphatidylethanolamine to PIP2 with [inositol-2-3H]PIP2 in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 3 mm EGTA, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol and the mixture dried under argon. The dried lipid was suspended with 3.0 ml of the above buffer to give final concentrations of 1 mmphosphatidylethanolamine, 250 μm PIP2, and 800 cpm/μl [3H]PIP2 and hydrated in the dark at room temperature. Extruded large unilamellar vesicles were formed from multilamellar vesicles by vortexing the lipid solution followed by 10 extrusion cycles through a stack of two polycarbonate filters using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) (41Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). After extrusion, the final lipid concentration (phosphatidylethanolamine and PIP2) was about 1100 μm. Extruded large unilamellar vesicles were stored under argon at 4 °C until use. CHAPS-solubilized βγ subunits (ranging from 10 ng to 10 μg) were mixed with vesicles in a volume of 200 μl. The final CHAPS concentration in the mixture was held to 0.01%. After reconstituting the mixture on ice for 30 min, the vesicles were applied to a 2-ml gel filtration column prepared with Ultrogel AcA34 as described previously (40Myung C.-S. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 42Rubenstein R.C. Linder M.E. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10769-10777Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The column was pre-equilibrated at 4 °C with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (450 μl/min). The vesicles reconstituted with βγ dimers were eluted at the void volume of the column in a total volume of about 900 μl. This protocol has been demonstrated to remove more than 98% of the detergent from the vesicles (42Rubenstein R.C. Linder M.E. Ross E.M.

Biochem. 1999; 270: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The concentration of lipid in each fraction was monitored by counting the incorporated [3H]PIP2, and the amount of βγ protein inserted into the vesicles was quantified by silver staining as described below. The second fraction from the AcA34 column contained vesicles with the least amount of free βγ dimer and were used in all experiments (40Myung C.-S. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 17 mm NaCl, 67 mm KCl, 0.83 mm MgCl2, 0.17 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml BSA was added to 70 μl of gel-filtered vesicles (fraction 2) in a total volume of 80 μl. Controls were performed using column-reconstituted vesicles without βγ dimers. The reactions were initiated by adding 10 ng of PLC-β and 3 μm free Ca2+ and placing the mixture in a 30 °C water bath. After a 15-min incubation, the reactions were terminated by transferring each assay tube to a 4 °C ice bath and adding 200 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by the addition of 100 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA (40Myung C.-S. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The assay mixtures were centrifuged to remove precipitated protein and intact PIP2and the [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate released into the supernatant quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry (44Smrcka A.V.

Briefly, Sf9 insect cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding rat type II adenylyl cyclase (47Jacobowitz O. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10630-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and harvested 48 h after infection. Sf9 membranes containing type II adenylyl cyclase (5 μg of protein/assay tube) were reconstituted with GTPγS-activated Gs α subunit (48Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and varying concentrations of βγ dimers on ice for 30 min. The reaction was initiated by addition of the reconstituted membranes to the reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mmphosphocreatine, 10 units/ml of creatine phosphokinase, 0.4 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA and incubated for 7 min at 30 °C. The assay was stopped by addition of 0.1 n HCl and cyclic AMP measured using an automated radioimmunoassay (49Brooker G. Terasaki W.L. Price M.G. Science. 1976; 194: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For quantitation of the βγ concentration in vesicles, the βγ dimers reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles were electrophoresed on a 12% acrylamide, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and stained with silver according to the method of Bloom et al. (50Bloom H. Beier H. Gross H.S. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3736) Google Scholar). The βγ concentrations in the gel were estimated using the amount of stained β subunit protein as compared with ovalbumin standards run in the same gel. The stained proteins were quantitated using a Bio-Image scanning densitometer and the Whole Band® software (Bio-Image, Ann Arbor, MI) as described (36Fletcher J.E. Lindorfer M.A. DeFilippo J.M.

Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To better display the mobility of the γ subunits, Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels were run according to the procedure of Schagger and von Jagow (51Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). The separating gel contained 16.5% total acrylamide, 0.4% bisacrylamide, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The stacking gel contained 4% total acrylamide and 0.1% bisacrylamide. Gels were run at constant voltage (∼100"

Recombinant Hcm1p catalyzed quantitativeS-adenosylmethionine-dependent conversion of GpppA-capped poly(A) to m7GpppA-capped poly(A). We identified by alanine-scanning mutagenesis eight amino acids (Asp-203, Gly-207, Asp-211, Asp-227, Arg-239, Tyr-289, Phe-291, and Phe-354) that are essential for human cap methyltransferase function in vivo. All eight residues are conserved in other cellular cap methyltransferases. Five of the mutant human proteins (D203A, R239A, Y289A, F291A, and F354A) were expressed in bacteria and found to be defective in cap methylation in vitro.

Isogenic yeast strains with fungal versusmammalian capping systems should facilitate rational screens for antifungal drugs that target cap formation in vivo. The m7GpppN cap of eukaryotic mRNA is formed by a series of three enzymatic reactions in which the 5′-triphosphate end of nascent pre-mRNA is hydrolyzed to a 5′-diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase, then capped with GMP by GTP:RNA guanylyltransferase, and methylated by RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (1Shuman S.

The physical and functional organizations of the capping apparatus differ in significant respects in fungi, metazoans, protozoa, and viruses. For example, fungi and mammals use distinct strategies to assemble a bifunctional enzyme with triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities. In yeast, separate triphosphatase (Cet1p) and guanylyltransferase (Ceg1p) polypeptides interact to form a heteromeric complex (10Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Murakoshi T. Suzuki M.

The enzyme RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (referred to hereafter as cap methyltransferase) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, adenosylmethionine; AdoHcy, adenosylhomocysteine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, adenosylmethionine; AdoHcy, adenosylhomocysteine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. to the GpppN terminus of RNA to produce m7GpppN-terminated RNA and AdoHcy (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 101-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae cap methyltransferase is the product of the ABD1 gene (7Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). ABD1 encodes a 436-amino acid polypeptide. A catalytic domain of Abd1p from residues 110–426 suffices for yeast cell growth (8Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Wang S.P. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A key distinction between the yeast and poxvirus cap methyltransferases is their physical linkage, or lack thereof, to the other cap-forming enzymes. The poxvirus methyltransferase active site is encoded within the same polypeptide as the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase (27Higman M.A. Christen L.A. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mao X. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24472-24479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the yeast methyltransferase is a monomeric protein that is not associated with the other capping activities during fractionation of yeast extracts (7Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of the yeast and vaccinia cap methyltransferases have identified conserved residues that are critical for cap methylation (8Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Wang S.P. Shuman S. J. Biol.

In the case of Abd1p, mutations that abolished methyltransferase activity in vitro were lethalin vivo. At present, Abd1p is the only cap methyltransferase that has been identified from a fungal source. There is scant information available on the cap-methylating enzymes from metazoan organisms. An RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase with a native size of 130 kDa (estimated by gel filtration) was isolated from rat liver by Mizumoto and Lipmann (30Mizumoto K. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4961-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A cap methyltransferase with a native size of 56 kDa (gauged by sedimentation and gel filtration) was partially purified from HeLa cells by Ensinger and Moss (31Ensinger M.J. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5283-5291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No metazoan cap methyltransferase has yet been purified to homogeneity. Identification of the gene encoding a metazoan cap methyltransferase and characterization of the recombinant protein offer the quickest route to an understanding of cap methylation in higher organisms. A putative cap methyltransferase from Caenorhabditis eleganswas identified on phylogenetic grounds (9Wang S.P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Alignment of the sequence of the predicted 402-amino acid C. elegans protein (GenBank accession Z81038) with the yeast cap methyltransferase Abd1p revealed side chain identity or similarity at 149/402 positions. Although it remains to be shown that the nematode protein has cap methyltransferase activity, the extensive sequence conservation suggested that other metazoans might also encode homologs of Abd1p. Here, we report the identification of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida albicans, and human cDNAs or genes that encode cap methyltransferases (Pcm1p, Ccm1p, and Hcm1p, respectively) that can substitute for yeast Abd1p in vivo. (cDNAs encoding the human protein were reported recently by other investigators (34Pillutla R.C. Yue Z. Maldonado E. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol.

We present a physical characterization of the recombinant human cap methyltransferase produced in bacteria, and we define by deletion analysis a catalytic domain of Hcm1p which is active in vivo and in vitro. We also identify by alanine scanning eight amino acid residues that are essential for Hcm1p function and are conserved in other cellular cap-methylating enzymes. Finally, we establish the potential for using yeast to identify therapeutic drugs that differentially target fungal and metazoan cap-forming enzymes. Plasmid pHG0376 containing the 6,203-bp human brain cDNA KIAA0398 (GenBank accession AB007858) inserted into pBluescript II-SK+ was a generous gift of Dr. Takahiro Nagase (Kasuza DNA Research Institute, Japan). A DNA fragment containing the 476-amino acid open reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the pHG0376 template usingPfu DNA polymerase and oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the translation start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into the T7 RNA polymerase-based expression plasmid pET16b to generate plasmid pET-His-Hcm1. The DNA sequence of the insert of pET-His-Hcm1 was identical to that of the KIAA0398 clone. Amino-terminal deletion mutants of HCM1 were constructed by PCR amplification with mutagenic sense strand primers that introduced an NdeI restriction site and a methionine codon in lieu of the codon for Gly-120 or an NdeI restriction site at the Met-179 codon. The PCR products were digested with NdeI andBamHI and then inserted into pET16b to yield plasmids pET-His-Hcm1(121–476) and pET-His-Hcm1(179–476). The inserts of each plasmid were sequenced to verify that no unwanted coding changes were introduced during amplification and cloning. pET-His-Hcm1 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). A 1-liter culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-His-Hcm1 was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A 600 reached 0.5. The culture was adjusted to 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and incubation was continued at 30 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Cell lysis was achieved by the addition of lysozyme and Triton X-100 to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 18,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The soluble extract was mixed for 1 h with 2 ml of Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with lysis buffer. The suspension was poured into a column and washed with lysis buffer. The column was eluted stepwise with IMAC buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol) containing 25, 50, 200, and 500 mm imidazole. The polypeptide composition of the column fractions was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The recombinant Hcm1p protein was retained on the column and recovered in the 200 mmimidazole eluate. An aliquot of this fraction (100 μg of protein) was applied to a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient containing 0.5m NaCl in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The gradient was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 15 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50 rotor. Fractions (∼0.2 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. A modified strategy was employed to optimize the expression of the Hcm1(121–476)p protein in soluble form in bacteria. A 1-liter culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) bearing the pET-based plasmid was grown at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 0.5. The culture was adjusted to 2% ethanol, and incubation was continued at 17 °C for 24 h. The recombinant Hcm1(121–476)p protein was purified from the soluble lysate by Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation as described above for wild type Hcm1p. Hcm1(179–476)p was expressed in bacteria but was recovered exclusively in the insoluble pellet fraction of the cell lysate. NdeI-BamHI restriction fragments containing the wild type HCM1 gene and the NH2-terminal deletion mutants were excised from the respective pET16b-based plasmids and inserted into a customized yeast expression vector pYX1-His, a derivative of pYX132 (CEN TRP1) in which six consecutive histidine codons and a uniqueNdeI site are inserted between the NcoI andBamHI sites of pYX132. (pYX132 was purchased from Novagen.) The single copy expression plasmids were named pYX-Hcm1, pYX-Hcm1(121–476), and pYX-Hcm1(179–476).NcoI-XhoI fragments containing the wild typeHCM1 gene and the NH2-terminal deletion mutants were excised from the respective pYX1-based CEN plasmids and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYX232 (2μTRP1). In these vectors, expression of the human methyltransferase is under the control of the yeast TPI1promoter. Alanine substitution mutations in the HCM1(121–476) gene were programmed by synthetic oligonucleotides using the two-stage PCR-based overlap extension strategy as described (8Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). AnNdeI-BamHI restriction fragment of each PCR-amplified gene was inserted into pET16b. The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed in every case by sequencing the entire insert. The Hcm1p (121–476)-Ala mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified as described above for the “wild type” Hcm1(121–476) protein. The mutated genes were transferred from the pET vectors to the yeast expression plasmid pYX1-His. Then, the mutant genes were excised from their respective pYX1-based CENplasmids and inserted into the 2μ plasmid pYX232. The complete S. pombe open reading frame encoding Pcm1p (a putative homolog of Abd1p; GenBank accession AL031603) was amplified by PCR from a S. pombe cDNA library (39Fikes J.D. Becker D.M. Winston F. Guarente L. Nature. 1990; 346: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) using an antisense primer that introduced a BamHI site immediately 3′ of the translation stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI (which cleaved at a unique in-frame site overlapping codons His-5 and Met-6) and BamHI, then inserted into a customized yeast expression vector pYN132, a derivative of pYX132 in which a unique NdeI site replaced the NcoI site of pYX132. The resulting plasmid was named pYN-Pcm1(6–389). Amino-terminal deletion mutants ofPCM1 were constructed by PCR amplification with mutagenic sense strand primers that introduced an NdeI restriction site at the codon for Met-30 or Met-56 or an NdeI restriction site and a methionine codon in lieu of the codon for Gly-80, Val-93, Tyr-106, or Leu-117. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and then inserted into pYN132 to yield plasmids pYN-Pcm1(30–389), pYN-Pcm1(56–389), pYN-Pcm1(81–389), pYN-Pcm1(94–389), pYN-Pcm1(107–389), and pYN-Pcm1(118–389). In these vectors, expression of the S. pombe polypeptide is under the control of the TPI1promoter. Plasmids p360-ABD1 (CEN URA3 ABD1) and p358-ABD1 (CEN TRP1 ABD1) contain the yeast cap methyltransferase gene under the control of its natural promoter (7Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Plasmids p360-CET1/CEG1 (CEN URA3 CET1 CEG1) and p358-CET1/CEG1 (CEN TRP1 CET1 CEG1) contain the yeast RNA triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase genes under the control of their natural promoters; the CET1 and CEG1 genes are arrayed head to head and transcribed divergently. Plasmids p360-CET1/CEG1/ABD1 (CEN URA3 CET1 CEG1 ABD1) and p358-CET1/CEG1/ABD1 (CEN TRP1 CET1 CEG1 ABD1) were constructed by insertion of ABD1 (under the control of its natural promoter) into p360-CET1/CEG1 and p358-CET1/CEG1, respectively; the ABD1 gene was placed next to CEG1 in a tail-to-tail orientation. Yeast strain YBS50 (MAT a leu2 ade2 trp1 his3 ura3 can1 ceg1::hisG cet1::LEU2 p360-CET1/CEG1) is deleted at the chromosomal loci encoding RNA triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase. YBS40 (MAT a leu2ade2 trp1 his3 ura3 can1 abd1::hisG p360-ABD1) and YBS10 (MATα ura3 trp1 lys2 his3 leu2 abd1::LEU2p360-ABD1) are deleted at the chromosomal locus encoding cap methyltransferase. YBS52 (MAT a leu2 ade2 trp1 his3 ura3 can1 ceg1::hisG cet1::LEU2 abd1::KAN p360-CET1/CEG1/ABD1) is deleted at the chromosomal loci encoding all three components of the yeast capping apparatus. YBS50, YBS40, and YBS52 were derived by targeted gene disruptions in the diploid strain W303 followed by tetrad dissection and genotyping of haploid progeny. YBS10 was derived by targeted gene disruption in strain YPH399. Gene disruptions were confirmed by Southern blotting. The 476-amino acid polypeptide encoded by human cDNA KIAA0398 was uncovered during a screen of the NCBI data base for potential homologs of the yeast cap-methylating enzyme Abd1p. The putative human cap methyltransferase (which we named Hcm1p) displays extensive sequence conservation with the 426-amino acid Abd1p protein (176 positions of identity or similarity) (Fig.1). Abd1p contains an 11-amino acid COOH-terminal extension that has no counterpart in Hcm1p; note that the COOH-terminal decapeptide of Abd1p is dispensable for cap methyltransferase activity in vitro and in vivo(9Wang S.P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hcm1p also displays extensive sequence similarity to the candidate cap methyltransferase from C. elegans: there are 179 identical or conserved side chains with a 347-amino acid overlap that extends from Hcm1p residue 130 to its COOH terminus and from positions 8 to 356 of the C. elegans polypeptide (Fig. 1). We also identified on phylogenetic grounds a putative S. pombe cap methyltransferase (which we named Pcm1p) encoded by a gene on fission yeast chromosome III. We determined that this gene is expressed in vivo, insofar as we were able to PCR amplify the complete PCM1 coding sequence from a S. pombecDNA library. The 389-amino acid S. pombe polypeptide displays extensive sequence similarity to S. cerevisiaeAbd1p (201 positions of identity or side chain similarity) (Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that all six amino acids that have been shown to be essential for cap methylation by Abd1p (denoted by dotsabove the aligned sequences in Fig. 1) are conserved in Hcm1p and Pcm1p (8Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Wang S.P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We took advantage of an in-frame NdeI restriction site at codons His-5 and Met-6 in the PCM1cDNA to clone a restriction fragment encoding Pcm1(6–389)p into a yeast CEN TRP1 plasmid such that its expression was under the control of the constitutive S. cerevisiae TPI1 promoter. The PCM1(6–389) plasmid was introduced into a yeast strain in which the chromosomal ABD1 locus was deleted. Growth of the Δabd1 strain is contingent on maintenance of an extrachromosomal ABD1 gene on a CEN URA3 plasmid. Trp+ transformants were plated on medium containing 5-FOA to select against the URA3 ABD1 plasmid. Control cells transformed with a TRP1 ABD1 plasmid grew on 5-FOA, whereas cells transformed with the TRP1 vector were incapable of growth on 5-FOA (Fig. 2 A). The instructive finding was that cells bearing the PCM1(6–389)plasmid grew on 5-FOA (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the S. pombe cap methyltransferase was functional in vivo in lieu of the endogenous S. cerevisiae enzyme. Several NH2-terminal deletion mutants of PCM1were cloned into the CEN TRP1 vector and tested for functionin vivo by plasmid shuffle. PCM1(30–389) andPCM1(56–389) complemented growth of the Δabd1strain on 5-FOA (Fig. 2 A), as did allelesPCM1(81–389) and PCM1(94–389) (Fig.2 B). However, the more extensively truncated allelesPCM1(107–389) and PCM1(118–389) were lethalin vivo (Fig. 2 B). Based on the sequence alignment in Fig. 1, the viable NH2-terminal Δ29, Δ55, and Δ80 and Δ93 deletions of Pcm1p would be analogous to deletions of 53, 69, 102, and 121 amino acids from the NH2 terminus of Abd1p. (The NH2 terminus of the viable Pcm1pΔ93 deletion is denoted by the arrow in Fig. 1.) The lethal NH2-terminal Δ106 and Δ117 deletions of Pcm1p correspond to Δ135 and Δ147 deletions of Abd1p. We showed previously that deleting 52 or 109 amino acids from the NH2terminus of Abd1p had no effect on yeast cell growth, whereas deletion of 142 or 155 residues was lethal (8Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Wang S.P. Shuman S. J. Biol.

We recently found that an NH2-terminal deletion of 120 amino acids from Abd1p is viable when the truncated protein is expressed under the control of theTPI1 promoter. 2N. Saha and S. Shuman, unpublished data. Thus, the NH2-terminal margins of the functional domains of the budding and fission yeast cap methyltransferases are fairly similar. Full-length HCM1 and an NH2-terminal deletion mutant HCM1(121–476) were cloned into a yeast 2μTRP1 plasmid such that their expression was under the control of the yeast TPI1 promoter. The HCM1plasmids were introduced into an abd1 deletion strain and tested for function by plasmid shuffle. Cells bearing theHCM1 or HCM1(121–476) plasmids grew on 5-FOA, as did cells transformed with a TRP1 ABD1 control plasmid, whereas cell"

For example, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ play major roles in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes and hepatocytes (2Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 5Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1917-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ also functions in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of white blood cells, ovarian granulosa cells, and mammary epithelial cells (6Yamanaka R. Barlow C. Lekstrom-Hines J. Castilla L. Liu P. Echaus M. Decker T. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xanthopolous K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13187-13192Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 17Sterneck E. Tessarollo L.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1917-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Like C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ is also associated with adipocyte differentiation (2Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). In addition to adipocyte differentiation, C/EBPδ also functions in the differentiation of lung epithelial cells (20Breed D.R. Margraf L.R. Alcorn J.L. Mendelson C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5527-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and myelomonocytic cells (21Scott L. Civin C. Rorth P. Friedman A. Blood. 1992; 80: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPδ also plays an important role in the hepatic acute phase response (22Cantwell C.A. Sterneck E. Johnson P. Genes Dev. 1998; 18: 2108-2117Google Scholar, 23Yamada T. Tobita K. Osada S. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). C/EBPε, the newest member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, regulates differentiation of granulocytes (6Yamanaka R. Barlow C. Lekstrom-Hines J. Castilla L. Liu P. Echaus M. Decker T. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xanthopolous K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13187-13192Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar).Recent reports indicate that C/EBPs play prominent roles in mammary gland development, differentiation, and programmed cell death (18Robinson G.W. Johnson P.F. Hennighausen L. Sterneck E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 19Seagroves T.N. Krnacik S. Raught B. Gay J. Burgess-Beusse B. Darlington G.J.

Two recent reports investigated the role of C/EBPβ in mammary gland biology using C/EBPβ knockout mice (18Robinson G.W. Johnson P.F. Hennighausen L. Sterneck E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 19Seagroves T.N. Krnacik S. Raught B. Gay J. Burgess-Beusse B. Darlington G.J. Rosen J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1917-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In both reports, mammary epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation were dramatically reduced in female C/EBPβ knockout mice. C/EBPδ also functions in mammary gland biology; however, instead of promoting mammary gland proliferation and differentiation, C/EBPδ is associated with mammary epithelial cell G0 growth arrest and programmed cell death (24O'Rourke J. Yuan R. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6291-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Gigliotti A.P. DeWille J. J. Cell.

Most reports indicate that C/EBPα plays a relatively minor role in mammary epithelial cell biology (19Seagroves T.N. Krnacik S. Raught B. Gay J. Burgess-Beusse B. Darlington G.J. Rosen J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1917-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar,24O'Rourke J. Yuan R. DeWille J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 174: 232-239Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The mammary gland is a unique organ system in that it attains full functional capacity late in life, at sexual maturation (27Topper Y. Freeman C. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 1049-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Mammary epithelial cells in the adult female cycle through intervals of quiescence, proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death in response to hormonal changes of the normal estrous cycle (27Topper Y. Freeman C. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 1049-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). These alterations in mammary epithelial cell fate are well described at the morphological level but poorly understood at the molecular level.The overall goal of this study was to investigate the role of C/EBPδ in mammary epithelial cell G0 growth arrest. Even though most cells in the adult animal have exited the cell cycle and exist in G0, few G0 regulatory genes have been described (27Topper Y. Freeman C. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 1049-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 28Cooper G. The Cell: A Molecular Approach. ASM Press, Washington, DC1997: 561-597Google Scholar). A better understanding of genes that regulate cell cycle exit/G0 entry is important in understanding normal cell biology, tissue homeostasis, and cancer. Mutational inactivation of one G0 regulatory gene, the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, has been implicated in 80% of human sporadic renal cell carcinomas (29Pause A. Lee S. Lonergan K.M. Klausner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).We previously showed that C/EBPδ is induced in G0growth-arrested COMMA D mouse mammary epithelial cells (24O'Rourke J. Yuan R. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6291-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). C/EBPδ induction occurs early in cell cycle exit/G0 growth arrest and remains elevated throughout the time the cells remain in G0. The present results extend this observation, demonstrating G0 induction of C/EBPδ in multiple mammary-derived cell lines. In addition, the induction of C/EBPδ in mammary epithelial cells is G0-specific. Altering mammary epithelial cell C/EBPδ content by transfection with C/EBPδ antisense or over expression constructs dramatically affected both G0 growth arrest and apoptosis in response to serum and growth factor withdrawal. These results demonstrate a key role for C/EBPδ in the regulation of major cell fate determining pathways in mammary epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONThis study investigated the growth regulatory role of C/EBPδ in mouse mammary epithelial cells in vitro. In a previous report, we showed that C/EBPδ gene expression and DNA binding activity is induced in the COMMA D mouse mammary epithelial cell line during G0 growth arrest (24O'Rourke J. Yuan R. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6291-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this report, we extend this observation, showing that C/EBPδ is induced during G0 growth arrest is a general property of mammary epithelial-derived cell lines. C/EBPδ expression is unrelated to growth status in 3T3 cells, which express constitutively high levels of C/EBPδ, and the IEC18 rat intestinal epithelial cell line, which expresses relatively low levels of C/EBPδ. This indicates that C/EBPδ functions in a mammary epithelial cell-specific G0growth control in vitro. We and others (25Gigliotti A.P. DeWille J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 174: 232-239Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Sabatakos G. Davies G.E. Grosse M. Cryer A. Ramji D. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have shown that C/EBPδ is induced in mouse mammary gland in vivoduring stage I of postweaning mammary gland involution. Because G0 growth arrest precedes apoptosis in many cell types, C/EBPδ may play a role in reprogramming mammary epithelial cell gene expression in preparation for apoptosis.The extracellular ligand and the intracellular signal transduction pathway that results in G0 induction of C/EBPδ in mammary epithelial cells have not yet been identified. Factors that induce C/EBPδ gene expression in other tissues and cell types do not appear to induce C/EBPδ expression in cultured HC 11 mammary epithelial cells. For example, glucocorticoids induce C/EBPδ expression in intestinal epithelial cells, lung epithelial cells and in adipocytes (20Breed D.R. Margraf L.R. Alcorn J.L. Mendelson C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5527-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Boudreau F. Blais S. Asselin C. Exp.

Insulin induces C/EBPδ mRNA in adipocytes (35MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); however, C/EBPδ levels are low in mammary epithelial cells cultured in insulin-containing complete growth medium (24O'Rourke J. Yuan R. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6291-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interleukin-6 and cAMP induce C/EBPδ expression in a variety of cell types (22Cantwell C.A. Sterneck E. Johnson P. Genes Dev. 1998; 18: 2108-2117Google Scholar, 23Yamada T. Tobita K. Osada S.

Other candidate molecules that may act as inducers of C/EBPδ include additional cytokines of the interleukin and interferon families and cell adhesion molecules.Growth rates were similar in AS1, OV, and control cell lines cultured in complete growth medium (Fig. 4 A). This suggests that C/EBPδ does not influence mammary epithelial cell growth under optimal growth conditions (presence of serum and growth factors). A similar observation has been reported for VHL, the first tumor suppressor found to function in the regulation of cell cycle exit (29Pause A. Lee S. Lonergan K.M. Klausner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Growth rates in complete growth medium were similar between VHL-negative and VHL wild type renal carcinoma cells (29Pause A. Lee S. Lonergan K.M. Klausner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). VHL-negative cells, however, did not exit the cell cycle and enter G0growth arrest when cultured in low serum containing (growth arrest) medium (29Pause A. Lee S. Lonergan K.M. Klausner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Reintroduction of wild type VHL restored appropriate G0 growth arrest in VHL-negative cells (29Pause A. Lee S. Lonergan K.M. Klausner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). AS1 cells are not completely C/EBPδ-negative (AS1 cells express C/EBPδ at about 10% of control levels), but AS1 cells do exhibit defective cell cycle exit/G0 entry when cultured in low serum containing (growth arrest) medium. Reintroduction of wild type C/EBPδ restored appropriate cycle exit/G0 entry growth arrest and apoptosis in AS1 cells. These results suggest that C/EBPδ, like VHL, functions in the regulation of cell cycle exit.The difficulty we encountered in the generation of a C/EBPδ overexpressing mammary epithelial cell line supports a growth inhibitory role for C/EBPδ. Similar difficulties were not encountered in producing C/EBPδ antisense cell lines or other C/EBP isoform expression cell lines. Once produced, however, the presence of elevated levels of C/EBPδ (OV cells) did not directly induce cell cycle exit/G0 growth arrest if cells were cultured in optimal growth medium. This suggests that either the individual surviving cell line (OV) had developed a compensatory mechanism to overcome the expression of C/EBPδ, or C/EBPδ alone is insufficient to induce growth arrest. Additional factors, such as subcellular compartmentation and/or posttranscriptional modification of C/EBPδ may be required for full function.C/EBPδ is regulated by subcellular localization in hepatocytes (39Yin M. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Lane M.D. Chatterjee S. Diehl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In cultured mammary epithelial cells and the mammary gland in vivo, C/EBPδ protein is primarily localized to the nucleus, regardless of growth or differentiation status (24O'Rourke J. Yuan R. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6291-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). C/EBPδ protein is also primarily localized to the nucleus in growing OV cell lines (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that subcellular localization is not a major mechanism of C/EBPδ regulation in mammary epithelial cells. The inability of C/EBPδ to inhibit OV cell growth in complete growth medium could be due to a lack of phosphorylation in growing cells. Phosphorylation of C/EBPδ is required for DNA binding during the hepatic acute phase response (40Lacorte J.M. Ktistaki E. Beigneux A. Zannis V.I. Chambaz J. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23578-23584Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, C/EBPs bind DNA as homo- and heterodimers (1Hurst H.C.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even high levels of C/EBPδ may be ineffective in blocking cell cycle progression if the appropriate dimerization partner is absent or inactive in cells cultured under optimal growth conditions.Although C/EBPδ overexpression in OV cells did not induce cell cycle exit/G0 growth arrest in optimal growth medium, C/EBPδ overexpression did accelerate cell cycle exit/G0 growth arrest in suboptimal growth medium (growth arrest medium). This indicates that mammary epithelial cells with a ready supply of C/EBPδ in the nucleus (OV cells) rapidly exit the cell cycle in response to growth arrest conditions. This suggests that C/EBPδ may be limiting for cell cycle exit in mammary epithelial cells.The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 functions in G0 growth arrest in a variety of cell types, including mammary-derived cells (41Coats S.

Basal p27 levels increased in confluent HC11 control and OV cultures following exposure to growth arrest medium and the initiation of G0 growth arrest. In contrast, AS 1 cells cultured in growth arrest medium failed to induce p27 and exhibited a marked delay in the initiation of G0 growth arrest. These results indicate an association between mammary epithelial cell C/EBPδ levels, p27, and G0 growth arrestin vitro. This association may extend to the mammary glandin vivo, as C/EBPδ and p27 are both induced in the mammary gland during involution. 2L. Dearth, and J. DeWille, manuscript in preparation. C/EBPδ may influence cellular p27 levels by increasing p27gene transcription or p27 protein stabilization. p27 overexpression is associated with apoptosis in a variety of cell lines, including breast cancer cell lines (45Katayose Y.

Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, p21 and p16 were virtually undetectable in any of the HC 11-derived cell lines regardless of growth status (51Sgambato A. Han E.K. Zhou P. Schieren I. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar).Overexpression of cyclin D1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells is associated with cell cycle progression in low serum medium (52Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S.

When C/EBPδ levels were reduced (AS1 cells), cyclin D1 levels remained elevated and cell cycle progression continued in low serum medium. When C/EBPδ levels were increased (OV cells), cyclin D1 levels rapidly declined and cell cycle progression stopped in low serum medium. These data indicate that C/EBPδ and cyclin D1 are induced under opposing growth conditions. C/EBPδ may influence cyclin D1 levels by acting as a transcriptional repressor of cyclin D1 in G0 growth-arrested mammary epithelial cells. C/EBPδ functions as a transcriptional repressor of the apolipoproteinC-III gene during the hepatic acute phase response (40Lacorte J.M. Ktistaki E. Beigneux A. Zannis V.I. Chambaz J. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23578-23584Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, cyclin D1 levels are also tightly controlled at the posttranslational level by cell cycle regulated, calpain-mediated degradation (54Choi Y. Lee S. Nguyen P. Jang J. Lee J. Wu M.-L.

We addressed whether BDNF might promote survival and chemoprotection in neuroblastoma (NB) using a drug-sensitive human NB cell line. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces a striking phenotypic differentiation of NB1643 cells, and exogenous BDNF treatment promotes survival of these differentiated cells. ATRA induces TRKB expression, and exogenous BDNF stimulates both autophosphorylation of TRKB and induction of the immediate early gene, FOS, in these cells.BDNF mRNA is expressed in NB1643 cells. Because the time course of TRKB induction closely parallels phenotypic differentiation of these cells, it seems probable that ATRA induces differentiation of NB1643 cells by establishing an autocrine loop involving BDNF and TRKB. Exogenous BDNF treatment resulted in a further increase in neurite outgrowth, which again suggests that an autocrine loop is involved in differentiation of NB1643 cells in response to ATRA. We then tested whether BDNF might afford drug resistance in NB and found that BDNF does indeed protect in this NB model against cisplatin, a DNA-damaging agent actually used in the treatment of NB.

Park J.-G. Gazdar A. Atlas of Human Tumor Cell Lines. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 42-78Google Scholar). Examination of the expression of enzymes involved in chromaffin cell differentiation suggests that NB tumor cells arising from the adrenal medulla may be derived from neuroblasts arrested during a stage of morphogenesis (2Cooper M.J. Hutchins G.M. Cohen P.S. Helman L.J. Mennie R.J. Israel M.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 149-159PubMed Google Scholar). NB cells characteristically express neuronal markers, such as neuron-specific enolase (3Triche T.J. Askin F.B. Hum. Pathol. 1983; 14: 569-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), tyrosine hydroxylase, and dopamine β-hydroxylase (4Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1983; 71: 741-747PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that NB may arise from a neuroblast that either fails to differentiate or is not eliminated by programmed cell death at the appropriate stage of development. These hypotheses encompass potentially inappropriate activation of signaling pathways that could result in failure to properly execute differentiation or cell death during development. This could lead to a proliferative disease. If a subpopulation of NB cells is refractory to chemotherapy due to activation of signaling pathways required for survival in sympathetic neurons, then an understanding these signaling pathways may prove invaluable. Chemotherapeutic strategies for preventing the arising of drug-resistant tumors or sensitizing tumors to existing drugs can be envisioned. Neurotrophin receptors, TRK, TRKB, and, TRKC are required for development of the sympathetic nervous system (5Smeyne R.J. Klein R. Schnapp A. Long L.K. Bryant S. Lewin A. Lira S.A. Barbacid M.

The TRK family (TRKs), which consists of TRK, TRKB, and TRKC, are receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. TRKB encodes a receptor for BDNF (9Soppet D. Escandon E. Maragos J. Middlemas D.S. Reid S.W.

Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 8: 947-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), although NT-3 also activates TRKB (9Soppet D. Escandon E. Maragos J. Middlemas D.S. Reid S.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5458-5466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NT-3 is the ligand for TRKC receptor (14Lamballe F. Klein R. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Besides a full-length receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, TRKB expresses truncated receptors containing the extracellular region and the transmembrane domain but lacking the kinase domain (15Klein R. Conway D. Parada L.F. Barbacid M. Cell. 1990; 61: 647-656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 16Middlemas D.S. Lindberg R.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The role that truncated receptors have is not known, although a potential role in signaling has been proposed based on the finding that BDNF activation of either TRKB.T1 or TRKB.T2 increases the rate of acidic metabolite release from cells (17Baxter G.T. Radeke M.J. Kuo R.C. Makrides V. Hinkle B. Hoang R. Medina-Selby A. Coit D. Valenzuela P. Feinstein S.C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2683-2690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic disruption of TRK expression in mice caused neuronal cell loss in sympathetic ganglia and trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia (5Smeyne R.J. Klein R. Schnapp A. Long L.K. Bryant S. Lewin A. Lira S.A. Barbacid M. Nature. 1994; 368: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Disruption of the TRKB locus in mice did not have a pronounced effect on sympathetic neurons (18Klein R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), although TRKB is expressed in sympathetic neurons (19Klein R. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. Parada L.F. Development. 1990; 109: 845-850PubMed Google Scholar). However, TRKB is required for normal development of neurons in the peripheral nervous system (trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia) (20Klein R. Smeyne R.J. Wurst W. Long L.K. Auerbach B.A. Joyner A.L. Barbacid M. Cell. 1993; 75: 113-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In these TRKB (−/−) mice, there is an increase in neuronal loss in the trigeminal ganglion earlier than neuronal loss observed in mice homozygous for a null mutation ofTRK (21Pinon L.G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Davies A.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3255-3261PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that TRKB signaling is required for survival of many trigeminal neurons before they become NGF-dependent. In the central nervous system, additional studies on TRKB (−/−) mice indicate increased apoptotic cell death in different regions of the brain, most significantly the dentate gyrus, during early postnatal life (22Alcantara S. Frisen J. del Rio J.A. Soriano E. Barbacid M. Silos-Santiago I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3623-3633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRKB may have a neuroprotective function as well. Experiments that offer direct support of this conceptin vivo demonstrated lower rates of survival for axotomized hippocampal and motor neurons in TRKB (−/−) mice contrasted to wild-type mice (22Alcantara S. Frisen J. del Rio J.A. Soriano E. Barbacid M. Silos-Santiago I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3623-3633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So not only is TRKB important for survival of neurons during postnatal development, but it may well protect neurons from injury and axotomy-induced cell death. With regard to NB, we wanted to test whether BDNF and its receptor, TRKB, have a role in survival and, perhaps more importantly, to assess whether TRKB may protect NB cells from chemotherapeutic drugs. Neurotrophin receptor expression could, in theory, render a population of NB cells refractory to chemotherapy and contribute to the development of drug-resistant tumors. Indeed, there are data suggesting that TRKB, and BDNF, are expressed in more aggressive tumors that have N-MYC amplification (23Nakagawara A. Azar C.G. Scavarda N.J. Brodeur G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In vitro data with a NB cell line indicate that BDNF may increase invasiveness of NB cells (24Matsumoto K. Wada R.K. Yamashiro J.M. Kaplan D.R. Thiele C.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1798-1806PubMed Google Scholar). In this communication, we examine the role of BDNF in promoting survival of NB cells with N-MYC amplification derived from a stage D NB tumor and present the novel finding that BDNF protects NB cells from cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent actually used in the treatment of NB. 5 mm ATRA (Sigma) and 9-cis-RA (Hoffman-La Roche) stocks were prepared by dissolving retinoic acids in ethanol and stored for less than 3 months at −80 °C. Human BDNF and NGF were generously supplied by AMGEN. Unless otherwise stated, NB1643 cells were grown in 10% FBS/RPMI (RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm glutamine (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in tissue culture plates from Costar or Corning. Cells were trypsinized in trypsin versene mixture (BioWhittaker) for routine counting and splitting. Nuclei were prepared using the method of Butler (25Butler W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and counted using a Z2 counter equipped with a 256 channelyzer (Coulter) for both cell plating and for growth and survival assays monitored by nuclei counting. Poly-lysine coating of tissue culture plates was accomplished by incubating plates 16 h with 1 ml of 50 μg/ml poly-lysine in H2O and then washing once with H2O, air drying under UV light, and subsequently cross-linking using UV light supplied by a Stratalinker (Stratagene) using the “auto” setting. NB1643 cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105 per well in 6-well tissue culture dishes (Costar) with or without 5 μm ATRA in 10% FBS/RPMI medium. Final ethanol concentration was 0.1% in all wells. Photographs at a magnification of × 225 were taken at 5 days following ATRA treatment. To examine the effect of exogenous BDNF treatment, NB1643 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well dishes with 5 μmATRA. After 3 days, medium was changed to 5 μm ATRA with or without 50 ng/ml BDNF. Final ethanol concentration was always 0.1% in all wells. Photographs at a magnification of × 80 were taken 12 days after exogenous BDNF treatment. 2.5 × 104 NB1643 cells/well were plated in medium (10% FBS/RPMI) containing 5 μm ATRA on poly-lysine-coated 96-well plates (Costar). Final ethanol concentration was 0.1% through out the experiment. 48 h after ATRA treatment, BDNF (50 ng/ml) and varying concentrations of FBS (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5%) were added in fresh medium containing 5 μm ATRA. After 4 days, wells were aspirated, and 1 μm Calcein AM (Molecular Probes) was added in Hanks' solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was quantitated using a cytofluor fluorescent plate reader (Millipore). Fluorescent signal from Calcein produced by reactions catalyzed by cellular esterases is linear with respect to viable cell number. In order to establish that detection of cells with Calcein AM is linear, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 75 × 103cells were plated in 96-well plates and cultured overnight. For Calcein AM detection, quadruplicate wells were aspirated, and 1 μm Calcein AM (Molecular Probes) was added in Hanks' solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was quantitated using a cytofluor fluorescent plate reader. For direct assessment of cell number, triplicate wells were trypsinized, and nuclei were prepared and counted as described above. 2.5 × 105NB1643 cells were plated in 3.5-cm tissue culture wells (Costar) coated with poly-lysine with 5 μm ATRA in 10% FBS/RPMI. Final ethanol concentration was 0.1% in all wells. Medium was changed 48 h later to medium with or without 50 ng/ml BDNF and 5 μm ATRA in 0.1% FBS/RPMI. Triplicate wells were trypsinized, and nuclei were counted as described above at various times subsequent to BDNF addition. 5 × 105 NB1643 cells were plated per well in 6-well tissue culture dishes (3.5-cm-diameter wells) (Costar). Medium was changed 24 h later to medium with or without 5 μm ATRA. For the BDNF growth rate experiments, 2.5 × 105 NB1643 cells were plated per well in 6-well tissue culture dishes (3.5-cm-diameter wells) (Costar). Medium was changed 24 h later to medium with or without 5 μm ATRA. After 48 h, BDNF was added (100 ng/ml). Final ethanol concentration was 0.1% in all wells. Triplicate wells were harvested by trypsinization and nuclei were counted as described above. Linear regression and statistical analysis to determine if the dependence of growth rate (slopes) of NB1643 differ significantly were performed using the method described by Zar (26Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. 2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1984: 292-305Google Scholar) with Prism software (GraphPad). 4 × 106 NB1643 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and treated 1 day later with or without ATRA. Final ethanol concentration was 0.1% in both samples. After 5 days, total cellular RNA was isolated using RNAZol B using the method provide by the manufacturer (Tel-Test) and quantitated and characterized by using UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. Total RNA preparations were examined by resolution on an agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining to verify that the 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA was not degraded. 20 μg of total RNA isolated from NB1643 cells and 0.24–9.5-kilobase RNA ladder for size analysis (Life Technologies, Inc.) was resolved on a agarose gel containing formaldehyde (27Melton D.A. Kriegg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). Northern transfer of the RNA to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was accomplished using a Posiblot pressure blotter (Stratagene) followed by UV cross-linking using a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene). 32P-Labeled TRKcDNA probe was synthesized using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the EcoRI restriction fragment from pDM69 (28Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Prehybridization was in 5× SSPE, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon DNA prepared for hybridization (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 h at 65 °C. Probes were added for hybridization at 65 °C for 18 h at label concentrations of 2.5–5 × 106 cpm/ml. Low stringency washes were followed by two high stringency washes for 10 and 2 min, respectively, in 0.2× SSPE and 0.1% SDS pre-equilibrated to 60 °C. Images were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). 4 × 106NB1643 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes (Corning) and treated with or without ATRA 1 day later for analysis of TRKB,BDNF, and NGF mRNA. For analysis ofFOS induction, 2 × 106 NB1643 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and treated with or without ATRA 1 day later. After 5 days, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml BDNF or NGF for 30 min. Ethanol concentration was 0.1% in all dishes. Total RNA was prepared and characterized as discussed above at 1, 2, and 5 days. cDNA was made using the cDNA Cycle kit (Invitrogen) using 1 μg of total RNA. One-tenth of the cDNA was used for PCR. 1 μmprimers, corresponding to the extracellular domain of TRKB(5′-TCTCGAATCTCCAACCTCAG-3′, 5′-TACTTCTGTTCGTGGTGTCC-3′), were used for PCR using GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer) using standard conditions with the inclusion of 0.2 μl [33P]dATP per sample.Taq was added after 5 min at 94 °C and 6 min at 60 °C, and then 25 cycles with 2 min of extension steps at 72 °C, 1 min of denaturation steps at 94 °C, and 1 min of annealing steps at 60 °C were performed, followed by a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. 1 μl of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) primers (CLONTECH) were used in each reaction. Conditions for analysis of BDNF andNGF were identical, except that 30 reaction cycles were performed using 1 μl of transferrin primers (CLONTECH). BDNF primers were 5′-GCAACGGCAACAAACCACAACATTATC-3′ and 5′-GTCCCTGTATCAAAAGGCCAACTGAAG-3′, and NGF primers were 5′-GCCCTTGATGTCTGTGGCGGTGGTC-3′ and 5′-GCTTTTCTGATCGGCATACAGGCGG-3′. For FOS PCR, conditions were identical except that annealing was at 57 °C. FOS primers (Continental Laboratory Products) were 5′-CTACGAGGCGTCATCCT-3′ and 5′-TCTGTCTCCGCTTGGAGTGTA-3′, and G3PDH primers were used for normalization. Samples, along with 123-bp ladder DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.), were analyzed on a 4% nondenaturing acrylamide:bisacrylamide (19:1) gel in TBE buffer (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.7Google Scholar) and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Levels of induction were determined by normalizing to G3PDH ortransferrin PCR products. PCRs were carried out with TRKB, BDNF, NGF, and FOS primers and titrations of templates to ensure that the reactions were linear. G3PDH, transferrin, and FOS PCR products exhibited log-linear relationships between 15 and 30, 20 and 35, and 15 and 30 reaction cycles, respectively. The lane containing the DNA ladder was cut from the gel and stained in ethidium bromide for size analysis. Control cDNA synthesis reactions without addition of reverse transcriptase to RNA preparations, followed by PCR, did not result in detectable PCR products. This verifies that the PCR products are derived from mRNA as opposed to genomic DNA. For analysis of TRK and TRKB expression induced by ATRA, 4 × 106 NB1643 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes (Corning) and treated with or without 5 μm ATRA 2 days later. Ethanol concentration was 0.1% in all samples. For analysis of 9-cis-RA induction, 4 × 106 NB1643 cells were plated with either 5 μm ATRA or 9-cis-RA for 5d. Cells in each dish were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) with fresh 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (diluted from 100× stock in methanol) at 4 °C, and repipetted four times through a 25 G needle. Samples were either stored at −80 °C or used directly. Samples were thawed, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 30 min. To immunoprecipitate TRK and TRKB, supernatants were incubated with 10 μl of TRK C-14 antisera (Santa Cruz) and then incubated with rotation with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Repligen) at 4 °C. The immune complexes were pelleted in a microcentrifuge and then resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA, vortexed, and pelleted in a microcentrifuge. Washes were repeated three times, after which, the remaining RIPA buffer was removed from the beads by aspiration through a 26 gauge needle. The samples were then taken up in 30 μl of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the gels were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) using the Milliblot semidry apparatus (Millipore). Immunoblot analysis to detect TRK and TRKB was performed as follows at 22 °C. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween-20). The blot was washed once for 15 min and twice for 5 min with TBST and then incubated with TRK C-14 (1:200) in 1% milk/1% bovine serum albumin in TBST for 1 h. The membrane was then washed as above and incubated with anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase in 1% milk/1% bovine serum albumin in TBST for 1 h. The membrane was then washed for 15 min and then four times for 5 min in TBST. TRK and TRKB bands were then visualized using chemiluminescent detection with the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and XAR 5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For analysis of TRK- or TRKB-specific expression, 2 × 106 NB1643 cells were plated with either 0 or 5 μm ATRA for 4 days. TRK was immunoprecipitated using 1 μg of TRK-specific antibodies (catalog no. 9142, New England Biolabs) followed by immunoblotting with TRK C-14 antisera using the methods described above. For TRKB expression, TRKs were immunoprecipitated with TRK C-14 antisera followed by immunoblotting with TRKB-specific antiserum 5050 (1:400) (13Middlemas D.S. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5458-5466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Middlemas D.S. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 12: 139-155Google Scholar) and TRKB antibodies (1:200) (catalog no. 794, Santa Cruz). For analysis of NGF-induced autophosphorylation, 4 × 106 NB1643 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes (Corning) with or without 5 μm ATRA. 5 days later, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml of NGF for 5 min. For analysis of BDNF-induced autophosphorylation, 5 × 106cells were plated and treated with or without 5 μm ATRA 1 day later. 5 days later, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml BDNF for 5 min. Ethanol concentration was 0.1% in all dishes. Cells were lysed immediately at 4 °C, and TRKs were immunoprecipitated, resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Immobilon-P as described above. Immunoblot analysis to detect TRKs was performed as described above. Immunoblot analysis to detect phosphotyrosine was performed as follows at 22 °C. The membrane was blocked for 2 h in 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, catalog no. A-6003) in TBST, and then fresh 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (1:5000) (Upstate Biotechnology) were added for 1 h with rotation. The blot was washed once for 15 min and twice for 5 min with TBST and then incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase in 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, catalog no. A-6003) in TBST. The membrane was then washed for 15 min and then four times for 5 min in TBST. Antiphosphotyrosine containing protein bands were then visualized using chemiluminescent detection with the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and XAR 5 film (Kodak). 2.5 × 104NB1643 cells/well were plated in quadruplicate in medium (10% FBS/RPMI) containing 5 μm ATRA on poly-lysine coated 96 well plates (Costar). Final ethanol concentration was 0.1% through out the experiment. 48 h after ATRA treatment, BDNF (50 ng/ml) and varying concentrations of cisplatin were added in fresh medium containing 5 μm ATRA. Medium containing drug was removed 24 h later and replaced with fresh medium with BDNF (50 ng/ml) and 5 μm ATRA. After 5 days, wells were aspirated, and 1 μm Calcein AM (Molecular Probes) was added in Hanks' solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was quantitated using a cytofluor fluorescent plate reader (Millipore). Fluorescent signal resulting from Calcein AM product produced by cellular esterases is linear with respect to viable cell number. Data were analyzed with sigmoidal dose response equations using Prism (GraphPad) to estimate EC50 values. Cell viability assays with or without NGF (50 ng/ml) were done using the same protocol, except that the assay was read with Calcein AM after 6 days following the 24 h cisplatin pulse. As there is evidence that BDNF and its corresponding receptor, TRKB, may have a role in NB exhibiting poor prognosis (23Nakagawara A. Azar C.G. Scavarda N.J. Brodeur G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), we wanted to establish a model of NB using a cell line to test the role of BDNF on growth and survival of NB cells. To this end, we characterized a drug-sensitive cell line, NB1643, which has N-MYC amplification and is derived from a stage D NB. The cell line was established from a tumor isolated from a patient who had not yet been treated with chemotherapeutic drugs (32Thompson J. Zamboni W. Cheshire P. Lutz L. Luo X. Li Y. Houghton J.A. Stewart C.F. Houghton P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar), which may explain the unique drug-sensitive nature of this NB cell line. ATRA induces a striking differentiated phenotype in the NB1643 cell line that is most clearly characterized by extensive neurite outgrowth (Fig.1). There is also a distinct morphological change in the cell body, which can be described as flattening and elongation. Neurite outgrowth started within a day of ATRA addition and was extensive after 5 days. In addition, NB1643 cells were less aggregated after differentiation induced by ATRA. As might well be expected, differentiation in response to ATRA treatment was accompanied by a reduced rate of cell growth (Fig.2 A). ATRA increased cell doubling time from 2.5 days to 3.5 days. However, there was still cell proliferation, in the presence of serum, even 5 days after ATRA addition. On the other hand, BDNF did not significantly alter the growth rate observed in these differentiated cells in the presence of serum (Fig. 2 C). BDNF had no effect on the growth rate of undifferentiated cells (Fig. 2 B), which was expected because undifferentiated NB1643 cells do not express TRKB (see below). We next wanted to test whether or not BDNF promoted survival in differentiated NB1643 cells.Figure 2Growth of NB1643 cells is decreased by ATRA but unaffected by BDNF . NB1643 were grown in medium containing 0 or 5 μm ATRA and with or without 100 ng/ml BDNF. Cell number was determined by harvesting and counting nuclei. A,ATRA alone reduced the proliferation rate of NB1643 cells (p = 0.002). B, BDNF (100 ng/ml) had no significant effect on the growth rate of undifferentiated cells (p = 0.66). C, BDNF had no significant effect on the growth rate of differentiated cells (p = 0.35), which were cultured for 2 days in 5 μm ATRA and then grown in medium containing 10% FBS and with or without 100 ng/ml BDNF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) BDNF promotes survival of cells under stress resulting from varying levels serum (Fig. 3 A). It is interesting that increasing levels of serum in the presence of a constant concentration of BDNF results in increased survival. Perhaps there is synergism between BDNF and a growth factor in serum that promotes survival. Alternatively, perhaps pretreatment with BDNF is required for the effects of a growth factor in serum in these NB cells. Cellular viability was assessed using Calcein AM, which is an established method for measuring cell viability. This assay requires both cellular esterases for conversion of cell-permeable, nonfluorescent, Calcein AM to fluorescent Calcein and intact plasma membranes for retention of the cell impermeant, highly charged, Calcein (33Bozyczko-Coyne D.

https://openalex.org/W2333796915,"The Deleted in Colorectal Cancer gene (DCC) encodes a cell surface receptor that belongs to the Ig superfamily. Inactivation of the DCC gene has been implicated in human tumor progression. However, little is known about the biological function of the DCC protein. In the present study, we demonstrated that expression of DCC activated caspase-3 and programmed cell death, or induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in tumor cells. In some cell lines, apoptosis was evident within 24 h of DCC expression. Timing of the appearance of apoptotic cells coincided with that of the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, a substrate of caspase-3. Expression of the apoptosis inhibitory gene Bcl-2 was not able to abrogate the DCC-induced apoptosis. In the G2/M cycle arrest cells, cdk1 activity was inhibited. Our results suggest that the DCC protein may transduce signals resulting in activation of caspases or inhibition of Cdk1. These data provide a possible mechanism by which DCC suppresses tumorigenesis."

Activation of the Wnt growth factor signaling cascade results in the inhibition of the serine/threonine kinase, GSK-3β, and in response, β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm (16Peifer M. Sweeton D.

Polyubiquitinated proteins are recognized and rapidly degraded by the proteasome, a large multisubunit proteolytic complex. Proteasomal degradation plays a critical role in the rapid elimination of many important regulatory proteins,e.g. cyclins and transcriptional activators like NFκB-IκB (28Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar).

In experiments where FLAG-tagged β-catenin was cotransfected with APC, anti-FLAGTM antibodies (Kodak) were used to detect the exogenous β-catenin. In the SW480 colon cancer cell line, which produces only a mutant APC protein containing amino acids 1–1337 of the complete 2843-amino acid sequence, overexpression of WT APC or deletion construct APC 25 (amino acids 1342–2075), but not APC 3 (amino acids 2130–2843) (Fig.1 A), can effect a posttranslational down-regulation of β-catenin (11Munemitsu S.

SW480 cells were transiently transfected with various APC deletion constructs (Fig. 1 A) and treated with proteasomal inhibitors, and β-catenin-LEF signaling was assayed using LEF reporters (31van de Wetering M.

Fig.1 B shows that the APC-mediated down-regulation of β-catenin-LEF signaling is reversed by a panel of proteasomal inhibitors including ALLN, lactacystin-β lactone, and MG-132, but not Me2SO (vehicle) or ALLM (calpain inhibitor II), that effectively inhibits calpain proteases but has a 100-fold lower potency as a proteasomal inhibitor. The specificity of APC-mediated effects on LEF reporters was confirmed using pFOPFLASH, which harbors mutated LEF binding sites, and an unrelated AP-1 reporter, neither of which was influenced by APC (31van de Wetering M.

The effects of APC 25 can be completely reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor ALLN, and the effects of WT APC can be restored to 50–60% of control values. However, the full-length WT APC construct, and not the APC 25 deletion construct, was used for all immunostaining experiments because it was more physiologically relevant (incorporating all the functional domains).

Double immunofluorescent staining for APC (Fig. 2, A,C, and E) and β-catenin (Fig. 2, B,D, and F) shows that the APC induced reduction in β-catenin protein (Fig. 2, A and B) is reversed by proteasomal inhibitors ALLN (Fig. 2, C and D) and lactacystin-β lactone (Fig. 2,E andF).Figure 2APC-mediated down-regulation of β-catenin protein is reversed by proteasomal inhibitors.

At least one of these, S37A, is a stabilizing mutation that renders β-catenin resistant to ubiquitination (25Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). If indeed APC regulates β-catenin-LEF signaling by targeting β-catenin for proteasomal degradation, then it should not be able to down-regulate the non-ubiquitinatable S37A mutant β-catenin protein or the LEF signaling induced by this stable form of β-catenin. To test this hypothesis, vector, FLAG-tagged WT, or S37A mutant β-catenin constructs were cotransfected with vector or WT APC and the LEF reporters into SW480 cells. β-Catenin-LEF signaling was monitored by assaying LEF reporter activity. Overexpression of both WT and S37A mutant forms of β-catenin increased the basal LEF reporter activity by about 30%, even against the background of high levels of endogenous β-catenin and β-catenin-LEF signaling in the SW480 cells. S37A β-catenin is more stable than WT β-catenin (in cells that actively degrade β-catenin, e.g. SKBR3 cells), but both forms increased LEF signaling by comparable levels in SW480 cells (which lack the ability to degrade β-catenin). Fig.3 shows that APC down-regulates LEF signaling induced by WT β-catenin but not by the S37A mutant β-catenin. The ability of APC to down-regulate the cotransfected FLAG-tagged WT β-catenin and the S37A β-catenin protein levels was examined by double immunofluorescent staining using anti-APC antibodies and anti-FLAG antibodies (Kodak) (40Munemitsu S. Souza B. Muller O. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3676-3681PubMed Google Scholar). By double immunofluorescent staining for both the FLAG epitope and APC, we were able to monitor effects of APC specifically on the coexpressed forms of β-catenin. Fig. 4 A (anti-APC) and Fig.4 B (anti-FLAG) show that WT APC effectively down-regulates WT β-catenin. Fig. 4 C (anti-FLAG) shows that in concurrent transfections with empty vector and FLAG-tagged WT β-catenin, the FLAG-tagged WT β-catenin is expressed and the anti-FLAG antibody efficiently detects it. Fig. 4, D and E shows that APC does not down-regulate the S37A mutant β-catenin protein. These findings complement the observations of Munemitsu et al. (41Munemitsu S. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Li et al. (42Li C. Bapat B. Alman B.A. Am. J.

However, our earlier studies demonstrate that neither the PKC inhibitor calphostin C nor TPA-induced down-regulation of PKCs stabilizes β-catenin (25Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In contrast, the bisindoylmaleimide-type PKC inhibitor GF-109203X causes a dramatic accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm (25Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol.

The bisindoylmaleimides inhibit both DAG-dependent and -independent PKC isoforms by competing with ATP for binding to the kinase, whereas calphostin C and long term TPA treatment inhibit only DAG-dependent PKC activities. The inhibitor profile implicates DAG-independent, atypical PKC activity in regulating β-catenin stability. These kinase(s) may offer a level of regulation distinct from the DAG-dependent PKC isoforms that regulate Wnt-dependent and GSK-3β-mediated β-catenin signaling (25Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P.

We tested the hypothesis that GF-109203X will inhibit the ability of APC to regulate β-catenin-LEF signaling. Fig.5 shows that the PKC inhibitor GF-109203X decreases the ability of APC to down-regulate LEF signaling in a dose-dependent manner in SW480 cells. The changes in β-catenin-LEF signaling are paralleled by changes in β-catenin protein (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained with another bisindoylmaleimide-type PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 (data not shown).Figure 6The bisindoylmaleimide-type PKC inhibitor, GF-109203X, but not lithium, reverses the APC-mediated down-regulation of β-catenin protein.

Axin, the recently described product of the mouseFused locus, forms a complex with GSK-3β, β-catenin, and APC (47Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10823-10826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Axin promotes GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin and may therefore help target β-catenin for degradation (48Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of Axin inhibits β-catenin-LEF signaling in SW480 colon cancer cells in the absence of functional, WT APC. It is not known if APC promotes GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin. Rubinfeld et al. (49Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) have shown that the APC protein is phosphorylated by GSK-3β in vitro and suggest that this phosphorylation event is linked to β-catenin turnover. It has also been suggested that APC and Axin may regulate the degradation of β-catenin by different mechanisms (50Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Uochi T. Ikeda S. Koyama S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that Li+ can inhibit the ability of APC to down-regulate β-catenin-LEF signaling. The colon cancer cell line SW480 was transfected with empty vector or WT APC and treated with 10, 20, or 40 mm LiCl or NaCl for 24 h. The treatments were initiated immediately following the 5-h transfection period, and the cells were exposed to LiCl or NaCl throughout the 24-h assay period to assure GSK-3β repression. Fig. 6 shows that lithium does not alter the ability of WT APC to down-regulate β-catenin protein. Fig. 7 shows that lithium does not reverse the ability of WT APC to down-regulate LEF reporter activity in SW480 cells. Even at 40 mm lithium, a level well above that required to completely inhibit GSK-3β, exogenous WT APC continues to significantly down-regulate LEF reporter activity. These experiments were repeated in several different formats incorporating variations in the amount of WT APC transfected, duration of treatment with lithium, and timing of treatment initiation following transfections. Regardless of these variations, lithium does not inhibit the ability of exogenous APC to down-regulate β-catenin-LEF signaling in the colon cancer cells tested. Lithium treatment also leads to activation of AP-1-luciferase reporter activity in Xenopusembryos, consistent with previous observations that GSK-3β inhibits c-jun activity (46Hedgepeth C.M. Conrad L.J. Zhang J. Huang H.C. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 51Nikolakaki E. Coffer P.J. Hemelsoet R. Woodgett J.R. Defize L.H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar). Concurrent AP-1 transactivation assays also confirmed that GSK-3β was inhibited in SW480 cells following treatment with lithium (data not shown). These results indicate that GSK-3β activity (the molecular target of lithium action, in the Wnt signaling cascade) is not required for the ability of exogenously expressed APC to down-regulate β-catenin. Recent data indicated that the role of GSK-3β may be to potentiate assembly of the APC·Axin·β-catenin complex (48Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the high level of APC expressed in the transiently transfected cells may well drive complex assembly in the absence of GSK-3β activity. Indeed, in SKBR3 cells, lithium treatment causes the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin and increases β-catenin-LEF signaling 2V. Easwaran and S. Byers, unpublished observations. (25Orford K.

Our observations suggest that one function of APC is to down-regulate β-catenin-LEF signaling via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.In vitro reconstitution experiments designed to explore β-catenin ubiquitination suggested the requirement of key components other than GSK-3β and APC.2 During the course of this study there has been an explosion of data describing novel proteins, including Axin, Conductin, and Slimb·β-TrCP as regulators of β-catenin stability (47Kishida S.

Nature. 1998; 391: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Recently, the receptor component of the IκB·ubiquitin ligase complex has been identified as a member of the Slimb·β-TrCP family (39Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Considering the increasing number of similarities between the regulation of IκB and β-catenin (25Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that like IκB, β-catenin ubiquitination occurs in a multiprotein complex that includes kinases, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and co-factors. Context-dependent potentiation of this complex by GSK-3β and other serine kinase(s) may be regulated by DAG-dependent and -independent PKC activity, respectively. The challenge for future studies will be to determine the exact role of APC in this process.

However, other in vivo studies have shown that DNA topoisomerase I is very effective in removing local negative supercoiling generated during transcription elongation. To determine whether topoisomerase I is essential for controlling global or local DNA supercoiling, we have prepared a set of topAnull mutant strains in combination with different plasmid DNAs. Although we found a correlation between the severity of the growth defect with both transcription-induced and global supercoiling, near to complete growth inhibition correlated only with transcription-induced supercoiling. This result strongly suggests that the major function of DNA topoisomerase I is to relax local negative supercoiling generated during transcription elongation. It has been suggested that the essential function of DNA topoisomerase I in Escherichia coli is to prevent chromosomal DNA from reaching an unacceptably high level of global negative supercoiling. However, other in vivo studies have shown that DNA topoisomerase I is very effective in removing local negative supercoiling generated during transcription elongation.

Although we found a correlation between the severity of the growth defect with both transcription-induced and global supercoiling, near to complete growth inhibition correlated only with transcription-induced supercoiling. This result strongly suggests that the major function of DNA topoisomerase I is to relax local negative supercoiling generated during transcription elongation. Based on genetic evidence, it has been postulated that the maintenance of a global level of chromosomal negative supercoiling within a ±15% range is required for good growth of Escherichia coli cells (1Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The global level of DNA supercoiling reflects the average superhelical density of all supercoiling domains. In this context, the essential function of DNA topoisomerase I is to prevent chromosomal DNA from reaching an inappropriate level of negative supercoiling. This model stems from the observation thattopA null mutants are viable only if they accumulate compensatory mutations that are very often found in one of the genes encoding a subunit of DNA gyrase. As a result, global negative supercoiling of both chromosomal and plasmid DNA were decreased below the normal level (2Pruss G.J. Manes S.H. Drlica K. Cell. 1982; 31: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 3DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Therefore, this global level of negative supercoiling is believed to be regulated by the opposing enzymatic activities of DNA topoisomerase I, encoded by the topA gene, which specifically relaxes negative supercoiling, and DNA gyrase, with two different subunits encoded by gyrA and gyrBthat introduces negative supercoiling. However, exactly how a high level of global negative supercoiling could be detrimental to cell growth is not known. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that DNA topoisomerase I is highly efficient in removing negative supercoils produced in the wake of moving transcription complexes (4Tsao Y.P. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 5Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 6Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such supercoiling can be generated during transcription elongation because of the difficulty for a moving transcription complex to rotate around the double helix (the twin-domain model for transcription; see Ref. 7Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). In this situation, domains of negative and positive supercoiling are transiently generated, respectively, behind and ahead of the moving transcription complex. In the absence of DNA topoisomerase I, the local negative supercoiled domain can build up, whereas the positive one can be removed by DNA gyrase. In some cases, especially when the transcribed genes encode membrane bound proteins, extreme negative supercoiling is generated by transcription (8Cook D.N. Ma D. Pon N.G. Hearst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10603-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). When such genes are present on a plasmid DNA, transcription in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I has been shown to generate hypernegatively supercoiled DNA (5Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 8Cook D.N. Ma D. Pon N.G. Hearst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1985; 185: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the context of transcription elongation, the major role of DNA topoisomerase I is to control important local fluctuations of negative supercoiling, as opposed to simply maintaining global chromosome supercoiling at a constant level. Given the fact that in all these studies, the experiments were performed withtopA null mutants with compensatory gyrase mutations, one may conclude that the removal of transcription-induced negative supercoiling by DNA topoisomerase I is not essential for cell growth. In the work reported here, we present data suggesting that the essential function of DNA topoisomerase I is linked to transcription elongation and not to the control of the global level of negative supercoiling. These results were obtained by measuring the linking number deficit of pBR322 derivatives extracted from varioustopA mutants having different growth capacities. On these pBR322 derivatives, the effect of transcription of the tetAgene that encodes a membrane bound protein is either kept at its minimum or totally abolished. These plasmid DNAs allowed us to measure both global negative supercoiling and transcription-induced negative supercoiling and to make a correlation between these parameters and the growth of the various topA mutants. Our results indicate that the essential function of DNA topoisomerase I is linked to transcription-induced negative supercoiling. Our results presented in Ref. 11Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). This deletion was further characterized in the present study by sequencing the appropriate region of the plasmid (Fig. 1). pBR322Δtet5′ was obtained by deleting theHindIII-EcoRV DNA fragment from pBR322. TheHindIII-EcoRV-digested pBR322 vector was treated with the Klenow enzyme to fill in the HindIII site, before being treated with DNA ligase. Transformants were selected on LB medium with ampicillin and were screened for sensitivity to tetracycline. The plasmid DNA of some Tets transformants was analyzed by using appropriate restriction enzymes to confirm theHindIII-EcoRV deletion. Unless otherwise indicated, bacteria were grown in VB Casa or LB medium (13Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) supplemented with cysteine (50 μg/ml) at the temperature indicated in the table and figure legends. When needed, antibiotics were added as follows: ampicillin at 50 μg/ml, and chloramphenicol at 30 μg/ml. Because of the acrA13 mutation in the DM800 derivatives, which renders these cells more permeable to many antibiotics (3DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), chloramphenicol was used at 10 μg/ml for these cells. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-glucoside were purchased from Sigma. For the extraction of plasmid DNAs for supercoiling analysis, bacterial cells carrying various pBR322 derivatives were grown overnight in VB Casa medium at 37 °C and then diluted 1/75 in prewarmed LB medium. The cells were grown to an A 600 of 0.4 at 37 °C at which time they were transferred to the desired temperature. The plasmid DNAs were extracted when theA 600 reached about 0.7 or after an exposition of about 2 h at the respective temperature when anA 600 of 0.7 could not be reached. We found that when hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs were produced at 21 °C, the proportion of such topoisomers reached a maximum after about 1 h at this temperature and did not change for at least another hour. Growth was stopped by transferring the cells in a tube filled with ice. By this procedure, the temperature of the cultures immediately dropped to 0 °C. Plasmid DNAs were extracted by an alkaline lysis procedure (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The current molecular biology techniques were performed essentially as described (16Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CaCl2 transformations were carried out as described by Drolet et al. (13Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). One-dimensional and two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of chloroquine in 0.5 × TBE were performed essentially as described (16Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Chloroquine was used at the concentration indicated in the figure legends. After electrophoresis, agarose gels were dried and prepared for in situhybridization as described (16Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Most of the previous studies related to the effects of transcription on DNA supercoiling were designed to support the twin-domain model for transcription (7Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar) but not to test if DNA topoisomerase I activity during transcription is crucial for cell growth. In these studies, transcription of genes encoding membrane bound proteins allowed the extraction of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs from topA null mutants (5Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 8Cook D.N. Ma D. Pon N.G. Hearst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10603-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although the results of these studies supported very well the twin-domain model for transcription, the question of DNA topoisomerase I activity being essential during transcription was not addressed or could not even be addressed, because the topA null mutants used in these studies grew very well. Indeed, the fact that these strains grew very well may suggest that DNA topoisomerase I activity during transcription is not normally essential. Therefore, to better address the role of DNA topoisomerase I in transcription elongation, we had to design a genetic system in which at least two requirements needed to be met: 1) the plasmid DNAs used should not carry genes encoding for membrane bound products; 2) thetopA mutants used should not benefit from compensatory mutations in order for the topA phenotypes to be fully expressed. Because most of the results supporting the twin-domain model for transcription were obtained by using pBR322 DNA, we decided to use several of its derivatives in our studies. In the early studies, the extraction of hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA fromtopA null mutants carrying compensatory mutations, was clearly shown to be dependent on tetA gene expression, which encodes a membrane-bound protein (9Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One derivative used in one study, pBR322ΔPtet, has a deletion within the promoter responsible for tetA expression (Fig.1 A), which was shown to abolish the production of hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA (5Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to use this pBR322 derivative in our studies. However, as can be seen in Table II, this plasmid confers residual tetracycline resistance, because bacterial cells carrying it can grow in the presence of 4 μg/ml tetracycline, whereas cells carrying no plasmid DNAs can only grow when tetracycline concentrations do not exceed 1 μg/ml. This residual tetAexpression can be explained by the fact that a weak −10 promoter region, according to the consensus, was created during plasmid construction (Fig. 1 B). We constructed an additional pBR322 derivative, pBR322Δtet5′ (Fig. 1 A), from whichtetA gene expression is not detectable (Table II). This plasmid has an HindIII-EcoRV deletion, removing the 5′ part of the gene including the original −10 promoter region, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the ATG initiator codon, and one transmembrane domain responsible for the anchorage of the TetA protein to the membrane (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, by performing such a deletion, a −10 region that restored a promoter sequence was produced (Fig. 1 B). Indeed, promoter activity was detected when the lacZ gene was cloned downstream in the appropriate orientation (Fig. 1 B).Table IIGrowth of RFM475 carrying pBR322 derivatives on LB plates with various amounts of tetracyclinePlasmidsTetracycline01246μg/mlNo plasmid+++−−−pBR322++++++++++pBR322ΔPtet+++++++−pBR322Δtet5′+++−−−RFM475 cells carrying the indicated plasmid were grown overnight in liquid VB Casa medium with cysteine and ampicillin (except for the strain carrying no plasmid) at 37 °C, and 2 μl were streaked on LB plates with the indicated concentration of tetracycline.

The plates were incubated for 20 hrs at 37 °C. +, reflects colony size; −, absence of growth. The relative growth capacity of the various topA null strains used in our studies is shown in TableIII. It can be seen that the strain showing the most severe growth defect and therefore, in our view, the strain that most closely resembles a true topA null mutant without compensatory mutations is RFM475. Low temperatures are more restrictive for this strain because of the gyrB(Ts) allele that regains a more wild-type level of activity at these temperatures (13Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The other strain that grows poorly is a gyrB+ derivative of the widely used DM800 strain (ΔtopA andgyrB225). The fact that it is possible to introduce a wild-type gyrB allele in DM800 indicates a possible presence of additional compensatory mutation(s) as previously considered when a similar transduction experiment was performed (3DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Moreover agyrB(Ts) derivative of DM800, a strain that should almost be identical to RFM475, grows significantly better than RFM475 (TableIII), again suggesting that additional compensatory mutation(s) might be present. It is also important to note that all the ΔtopA strains used in our studies carry the sametopA deletion [Δ(topA cysB)204].Table IIIRelative colony size on LB medium of the various ΔtopA strains used in this studyBacterial strainsTemperature37 °C28 °C21 °CDM800 [ΔtopA, gyrB225]++++++++++++EM176 [DM800 gyrB +]++1/2EM169 [DM800gyrB(Ts)]++++++1/2++RFM475 [ΔtopA, gyrB(Ts)]++−aThe few colonies that appeared are made of bacterial cells with tolC region duplications known to compensate for the absence of topA, as previously described for this bacterial strain (13).−Bacterial cells were grown overnight in liquid VB Casa medium with cysteine at 37 °C, and 2 μl were streaked on LB plates that were incubated at 37, 28, and 21 °C, respectively, for 20, 42, and 72 h (EM176 and RFM475 were incubated for 6 days at 21 °C). +, reflects colony size; −, absence of growth.a The few colonies that appeared are made of bacterial cells with tolC region duplications known to compensate for the absence of topA, as previously described for this bacterial strain (13Drolet M.

The various ΔtopAmutants carrying pBR322ΔPtet were grown in LB medium at 37 °C and exposed to the indicated temperatures as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All the strains were exposed to various temperatures to discriminate between true temperature effects and allele specific effects [gyrB(Ts)] on DNA supercoiling. The extracted plasmid DNAs were subjected to electrophoresis in agarose gel in the presence of chloroquine at 7.5 μg/ml, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under these conditions the more negatively supercoiled topoisomers migrate slowly except for the fastest migrating band pointed to by an arrow (Fig.2 A, lane 12 [- -]), which represents hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs. It can be seen that the global DNA supercoiling level in the various strains, represented by the topoisomers distributions of pBR322ΔPtet DNA without considering hypernegatively supercoiled DNA, reflects very well the level of gyrase activity within these strains (Fig. 2 A). Indeed, plasmid DNAs extracted from the DM800 strain that carries the gyrB225 mutation are less negatively supercoiled than plasmid DNAs extracted from the DM800gyrB+ derivative (EM176) or the gyrB(Ts) strains (EM169 and RFM475) exposed to temperatures of 28 °C and below (Fig.2 A). It is also obvious that the global negative supercoiling level correlates with the growth defects (Table III). However, this correlation is not complete because the global negative supercoiling level eventually reaches a maximum value even though some bacterial strains are still growing, albeit slowly (EM169 at 28 °C and 21 °C, EM176 at 28 °C, and very slowly at 21 °C), whereas others are not (RFM475 at 28 °C (almost undetectable growth) and 21 °C). Under more restrictive conditions, when the ΔtopA mutant completely fails to grow (RFM475 at 21 °C), hypernegatively supercoiled pBR322ΔPtet DNA is found (Fig. 2, A, lane 12; B,bottom right panel). The formation of such topoisomers is completely dependent on transcription, because it is abolished by rifampicin treatment (data not shown). Such topoisomers are not found when pBR322ΔPtet DNA is either extracted from DM800 carrying the gyrB+ allele (Fig. 2, A,lanes 4-6; B, top middle panel), or DM800 carrying the gyrB(Ts) allele and grown at 21 °C (Fig. 2, A, lane 9;B, top right panel), again supporting our conclusion about the presence of additional compensatory mutation(s) within DM800. Similar results are also obtained when the same set of experiments are performed with pBR322Δtet5′ (Fig.3). A larger proportion of hypernegatively supercoiled topoisomers was detected when pBR322Δtet5′ DNA was extracted from RFM480 grown at 21 °C (and a small amount from cells grown at 28 °C), a strain identical to RFM475, but carrying atopA::Tn10 allele instead of the [Δ(topA cysB)204] found in RFM475 (11Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16659-16664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This is possibly due to the fact that RFM480 is genetically more stable than RFM475.Figure 3Transcription-induced hypernegative supercoiling of pBR322Δtet5′ DNA in various topA null mutant. The varioustopA null mutants carrying pBR322Δtet5′ were grown, and the plasmid DNAs were extracted and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our results show that severe growth inhibition of Escherchia coli in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I correlates with transcription-induced negative supercoiling, but not with global negative supercoiling. Therefore, it suggests that topAmutants fail to grow when DNA gyrase is too active during the process of transcription elongation. Under these conditions, DNA gyrase activity is efficient whether or not genes encode for membrane bound proteins. In fact, under these conditions, we have also detected hypernegatively supercoiled topoisomers for several others plasmid DNAs that do not carry genes encoding for membrane bound proteins. For the moment, we cannot exclude the possibility that the apparent increase in DNA gyrase activity at low temperatures is not, for unknown reasons, only linked to the gyrB(Ts) allele, but to the low temperature itself. Indeed, our preliminary data with DM800 derivatives suggest that this might be the case. 1E. Massé and M. Drolet, unpublished results. Either way, the result of this activity, if not counteracted by DNA topoisomerase I, is inhibitory to cell growth. The results presented in the accompanying manuscript (11Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16659-16664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) show that extensive R-loop formation can occur under these conditions (11Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16659-16664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This is most likely inhibitory to cell growth, because the cellular level of RNase H activity must be properly increased to support growth under conditions where topAmutations are fully expressed (13Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our results also strongly suggest that gyr mutations arose in topA mutants to reduce gyrase activity during transcription elongation. We can also conclude that the increase in the level of global negative supercoiling in some topA mutants (see Ref. 1Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar and this work), is only a secondary consequence of the absence of DNA topoisomerase I and is not linked to the essential function of this enzyme. This notion is further supported by our recent observations that the overproduction of both RNase H (11Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16659-16664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and topoisomerase III (TopB) 2S. Broccoli, P. Phoenix, E. Massé, and M. Drolet, manuscript in preparation. can very well correct the growth defect of topA null mutants without, however, altering the global supercoiling level. In conclusion, although the previous studies with varioustopA null mutants have been very useful to reveal the regulatory potential of negative supercoiling on DNA functions, they did not reveal the essential function of DNA topoisomerase I. In our view, this enzyme should be considered, at least in part, as a transcription factor and not as a regulator of the global supercoiling level.

BVP differs from the metazoan capping enzymes in that it lacks a guanylyltransferase domain and releases both γ- and β-phosphates from mRNA to yield a monophosphate at the 5′ end (3Takagi T. Taylor G.S. Kusakabe T. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). BVP is unlikely to be involved in the capping of viral messages because LEF-4, a subunit of the A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus RNA polymerase, is a bifunctional capping enzyme with RNA triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities (15Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10020-10028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Guarino L.A. Jin J. Dong W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10003-10010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of BVP is unknown, but it is not essential for viral replication (18Li Y. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4533-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Recently, Yuan et al. (19Yuan Y. Da-Ming L. Sun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20347-20353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) identified and cloned human PIR1, a nuclear phosphatase that interacts with RNA or ribonucleoproteins. To identify a human homolog of BVP, we have independently cloned PIR1 and have expressed the recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli for further enzymatic characterization. We demonstrate that at comparable substrate concentrations, the RNA triphosphatase and diphosphatase activities of GST-PIR1 exceed its protein phosphatase activity by 2 or more orders of magnitude. The strong preference for RNA substrates and its nuclear localization suggest a potential role for PIR1 in RNA processing. We also show that the C-terminal, noncatalytic domain of PIR1 is not essential for its RNA phosphatase activity.RESULTSAn expressed sequence tag (GenBank™ accession number H60626) encodes a polypeptide exhibiting 47% amino acid sequence identity to an 87-residue segment of the BVP phosphatase (3Takagi T. Taylor G.S. Kusakabe T. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using a probe derived from the H60626 expressed sequence tag, a 1.6-kilobase cDNA was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH). This cDNA encoded PIR1 (GenBank™AF023917) that was cloned by Yuan et al. (19Yuan Y. Da-Ming L. Sun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20347-20353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) while this work was in progress. In accord with Yuan et al. (19Yuan Y. Da-Ming L. Sun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20347-20353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Northern analysis detected a single 1.7-kilobase PIR1 transcript in eight different human tissues (data not shown). A sequence-tagged site (GenBank™ accession number AA037694) identical to the PIR1 sequence has been mapped to the short arm of human chromosome 2.PIR1 is a 38.9-kDa phosphatase that is localized to the nucleus, is characterized by its ability to bind RNA in vitro and to interact with the 9G8 and Srp30C splicing factors in the yeast two-hybrid system (19Yuan Y. Da-Ming L. Sun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20347-20353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in the sequence alignment of Fig.1 A, an N-terminal segment of PIR1 exhibits a high degree of sequence similarity to corresponding segments from the BVP RNA phosphatase and the RNA triphosphatase domain of the metazoan mRNA capping enzymes. This conserved region of PIR1 encompasses the hallmark PTP active site motif (HCX5R) (1Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.-P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). PIR1 contains a C-terminal segment (residues 207–330) with a polyproline-rich region (residues 276–285) (Fig. 1 B) that might serve as a binding site for SH3/WW domain-containing proteins (23Feng S.

Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar).Protein Phosphatase Activity of PIR1GST-PIR1 dephosphorylates phosphotyrosyl-containing protein substrates and at least one substrate phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues (TableI). The activity of GST-PIR1 toward protein substrates is comparable to that of GST-BVP and the RNA triphosphatase domain of the Caenorhabditis eleganscapping enzyme, CEL-1 (1–236). Of the four phosphotyrosyl substrates tested, the activity of GST-PIR1 was the highest toward the acidic substrate, poly(Glu4:Tyr1).Table ISubstrate specificity of PIR1SubstrateConcentrationSpecific activityCel-1(1–236)aValues taken from Takagi et al.

Analysis of the reaction products by TLC showed that the labeled γ-phosphate was released from this RNA trinucleotide substrate (Fig. 2 A,lanes 9 and 10), indicating that PIR1 possesses RNA triphosphatase activity. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the triphosphatase activity of PIR1 is comparable to that of BVP (3Takagi T. Taylor G.S. Kusakabe T. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Products were analyzed by TLC on PEI-cellulose plates. The position of the 32P label is designated by the asterisk. The position of [32P]inorganic phosphate was determined by treating RNA substrates with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). Radioactivity was detected using a Fuji BasX PhosphorImager.A, [γ-32P]ATP-terminated trinucleotide RNA (3 μm of termini) was incubated with buffer (lane 1), the indicated amounts of wild-type GST-BVP (lanes 2–4), mutant GST-BVP (C119S) (lanes 5–7), wild-type GST-PIR1 (lanes 8–10), or mutant GST-PIR1 (C152S) (lanes 11–13). B,[γ-32P]ATP-terminated trinucleotide RNA (3 μm termini) was incubated with buffer (lane 1), the indicated amounts of GST-BVP (lanes 2–4), GST-PIR1 (lanes 5–7), or GST-PIR1 (1–206) (lanes 8–10).

At a concentration exceeding the wild type protein by 10-fold (Fig. 2 A, lanes 11–13), GST-PIR1 C152S had no detectable RNA triphosphatase activity, confirming that this activity can be ascribed to PIR1 and not contaminating E. coli proteins. Both the RNA and protein phosphatase activities of PIR1 were inhibited by sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine-specific and dual specificity protein phosphatases. The absolute requirement for Cys152 and its sensitivity to vanadate, suggest that PIR1 hydrolyzes RNA substrates via the mechanism utilized by the tyrosine and dual specificity protein phosphatases (24Guan K.L.

In contrast, the RNA phosphatase activity of PIR1 does not require Mg2+ and instead is inhibited about 50% by 100 μmMgCl2 (data not shown). PIR1 did not exhibit significant ATPase activity (Fig. 2 C, lanes 5–7), suggesting that its phosphatase activity is specific to polynucleotides.Using RNA radiolabeled at the α-phosphate (pppApCpC), both BVP and PIR1 produced a product that migrates almost as fast as inorganic phosphate on PEI-cellulose plates (Fig.3 A, lanes 3–5 and6–8). To determine if the observed product contained monophosphate-terminated trimeric RNA (not shown) or free phosphate (lane 1), the reaction products were further digested with RNase T2 prior to analysis by TLC. As shown in Fig. 3 B,lanes 3–5 and 6–8, both BVP-treated and PIR1-treated RNA released pAp. We conclude that PIR1, like BVP, leaves a 5′-monophosphate end on RNA.Figure 3PIR1 possesses RNA 5′-triphosphatase and diphosphatase activities but leaves a 5′- monophosphate end. RNA triphosphatase assays (panels A and B) and diphosphatase assays (panels C and D) were performed with either [α-32P]ATP-terminated trinucleotide RNA or 5′-diphosphate-terminated RNA trinucleotide that was labeled with [32P] at internal phosphates, respectively (label is indicated by asterisk). RNA substrates were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with the following: 1 unit of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (lane 1), buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (lane 2), the indicated amounts of GST-BVP (lanes 3–5) or GST-PIR1 (lanes 6–8). Products were analyzed by PEI-cellulose TLC directly (panel A and C), or after cleavage with RNase T2 (panel B and D). Positions of the authentic markers, adenosine 3′-monophosphate (Ap) and adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate (pAp) (Sigma), were detected by UV light.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PIR1 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 6–8) and BVP (Fig.3 C, lanes 3–5) converted diphosphate-terminated RNA (ppApCpC) to a species that migrated similarly to 5′-hydroxyl-terminated RNA (ApCpC) produced by treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase (Fig.3 C, lane 1). To distinguish 5′-monophosphate-ended trimer from 5′-hydroxyl-ended trimer, the reaction products were digested with RNase T2. This treatment revealed that pAp was released from BVP-treated and PIR1-treated RNA (Fig. 3 D, lanes 3–5 and 6–8), demonstrating that PIR1 also possesses potent RNA diphosphatase activity. Its activity toward diphosphate-terminated RNA was more than an order of magnitude higher than its activity toward triphosphate-terminated RNA, whereas that of BVP is only 3-fold higher (Table I). The presence of a mixture of diphosphate- and monophosphate-terminated RNA in the products from triphosphate-terminated substrate obtained at low concentrations of BVP and PIR1 (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3–5and 6–8), suggests that these two enzymes carry out the triphosphatase and diphosphatase reactions sequentially. The RNA diphosphatase and triphosphatase activities of both BVP and PIR1 are also inhibited to the same extent by magnesium and vanadate (data not shown). Both BVP and PIR1 can be distinguished from the mRNA capping enzyme CEL-1 by their ability to remove the β-phosphate from the diphosphate termini of RNA substrates.A comparison of the protein and RNA phosphatase activities of PIR1 (Table I) reveals that it dephosphorylates triphosphate- and diphosphate-terminated RNA with a specific activity that is 2 and 3 orders of magnitude greater than that obtained with a comparable concentration of poly(Glu4:Tyr1), the best phosphoprotein substrate tested. With artificial protein substrates, the specific activity of GST-PIR1 is about 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of PTP 1B (31Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6731-6737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a typical tyrosine-specific phosphatase and at least 10-fold lower than that of the dual specificity protein phosphatase Cdc14 (20Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24054-24063Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast, PIR1 dephosphorylates the 5′-end of RNA at rates comparable to CEL-1, which acts as a mRNA capping enzyme in vivo (2Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Takagi T. Taylor G.S. Kusakabe T. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). From these in vitromeasurements, we conclude that PIR1 is a poor protein phosphatase and a more efficient catalyst with RNA substrates.Role of the C-terminal Noncatalytic DomainA truncated form of GST-PIR1 containing only the catalytic domain (residues 1–206) was expressed in bacteria and purified in a manner similar to that of the full-length protein. When expressed on a molar basis, the specific activity of GST-PIR1 (1–206) toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate and the best protein substrate, poly(Glu4:Tyr1), was approximately 4- and 3-fold higher than that of the full-length enzyme, respectively (data not shown). The specific activity of GST-PIR1 (1–206) toward both triphosphate- and diphosphate-terminated RNA was 2-fold higher than that of the full-length enzyme (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8–10, and data not shown). Like the full-length enzyme, the PIR1 catalytic domain did not dephosphorylate mononucleotides such as ATP (Fig. 2 C, lanes 8–10).Thus, the C terminus of PIR1 is not required for phosphatase activity and its removal does not significantly alter the strong preference for RNA or the level of RNA triphosphatase activity. The effects of C-terminal truncation on phosphatase activity measured with the small RNA and artificial protein substrates employed in these studies may not reflect the properties of PIR1 with physiologic substrates. Moreover, these findings do not eliminate a role for the noncatalytic domain in modulating activity by serving as a binding site for regulatory proteins or other effectors and/or by providing sites for phosphorylation or other post-translational modifications.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrate herein that PIR1 has both RNA tri- and diphosphatase activities like the viral BVP phosphatase (3Takagi T. Taylor G.S. Kusakabe T. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7057-7063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively poor protein phosphatase activity of PIR1 suggests that it is unlikely to be involved in controlling the level of protein phosphorylation. Instead, PIR1 has the potential to play a direct role in RNA metabolism by using RNA as its substrate.The RNA Phosphatase Subgroup of PTPsAt least 10 proteins exhibiting a high degree of sequence similarity to PIR1 (31–46% identity) have been identified. These include the metazoan capping enzymes from C. elegans (CEL-1) (2Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S.

The corresponding nucleotide sequences have the GenBank™ accession numbersL33180, AF068270, U64896, and U75930, respectively. ; and two predicted proteins (T23G7.5 and F54C8.4) of unknown function from C. elegans (Fig. 1 A). We propose that these 11 proteins constitute a unique subgroup within the PTP superfamily because they exhibit much greater sequence similarity to one another than to other PTPs and all those that have been studied dephosphorylate the 5′-end of RNA much more efficiently than proteins.Based on their common function in mRNA processing, similar domain organization and high degree of sequence similarity within their RNA triphosphatase domains (41% identity between enzymes from worms and man), it is likely that the metazoan capping enzymes (CEL-1, HCE, and MCE) are orthologs. On the other hand, PIR1, BVP, the four viral BVP-like proteins and the T23G7 protein from C. elegansappear to constitute a distinct group of orthologous proteins that exhibit more similarity to one another (40–46% identity) than to the capping enzymes (31–37% identity). Thus, like PIR1 and BVP, C. elegans T23G7 and the BVP-like viral orthologs are expected to have the ability to remove γ- and β-phosphates from RNA and to carry out similar cellular functions. This proposed evolutionary relationship raises the possibility that the nuclear polyhedrosis viruses may have acquired a PIR1-like gene from an insect host through a mechanism involving horizontal gene transfer. The existence of a cellular gene might explain why the BVP gene of A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus is not essential (18Li Y. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4533-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Potential Role for the PIR1 RNA PhosphataseIt is unlikely that PIR1 functions in mRNA capping because its RNA diphosphatase activity leaves a 5′-monophosphate end on RNA, which is incompatible with the formation of the cap structure found on eukaryotic mRNAs. The possibility exists that a small subset of eukaryotic transcripts might form a mRNA cap structure using a 5′-monophosphate end to which GDP is transferred (35Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1976; 9: 645-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). To date, this unique RNA capping mechanism has only been found in some rhabdoviruses, a class of non-segmented, cytoplasmic RNA viruses (36Abraham G. Rhodes D.P. Banerjee A.K.

https://openalex.org/W2329408473,"We have recently shown a close correlation between expression of the Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein (MRP) gene and the MYCN oncogene and provided evidence that high MRP expression is a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome in neuroblastoma (Norris et al., New Engl. J. Med., 334, 231 – 238, 1996). The effect of MYCN down-regulation on MRP expression and response to cytotoxic drugs was investigated in NBL-S neuroblastoma cells transfected wtih MYCN antisense RNA constructs. Concomitant with MYCN down-regulation, the level of MRP expression was decreased in the NBAS-4 and NBAS-5 antisense transfectants. These cells demonstrated significantly increased sensitivity to the high affinity MRP substrates vincristine, doxorubicin, sodium arsenate and potassium antimony tartrate, but not to the poor MRP substrates, taxol or cisplatin. Similarly, transfection of full-length MYCN cDNA into SH-EP neuroblastoma cells resulted in increased MRP expression and significantly increased resistance specifically to MRP substrates. The results provide evidence for the MYCN oncogene influencing cytotoxic drug response via regulation of MRP gene expression. Our data also provide a link between the malignant and chemoresistant phenotypes of this childhood malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1970413776,"We established an in vitro assay for the addition of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors to proteins using procyclic trypanosomes engineered to express GPI-anchored variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). The assay is based on the premise that small nucleophiles, such as hydrazine, can substitute for the GPI moiety and effect displacement of the membrane anchor of a GPI-anchored protein or pro-protein causing release of the protein into the aqueous medium. Cell membranes containing pulse-radiolabeled VSG were incubated with hydrazine, and the VSG released from the membranes was measured by carbonate extraction, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/fluorography. Release of VSG was time- and temperature-dependent, was stimulated by hydrazine, and occurred only for VSG molecules situated in early compartments of the secretory pathway. No nucleophile-induced VSG release was seen in membranes prepared from cells expressing a VSG variant with a conventional transmembrane anchor (i.e. a nonfunctional GPI signal sequence). Pro-VSG was shown to be a substrate in the reaction by assaying membranes prepared from cells treated with mannosamine, a GPI biosynthesis inhibitor. When a biotinylated derivative of hydrazine was used instead of hydrazine, the released VSG could be precipitated with streptavidin-agarose, indicating that the biotin moiety was covalently incorporated into the protein. Hydrazine was shown to block the C terminus of the released VSG hydrazide because the released material, unlike a truncated form of VSG lacking a GPI signal sequence, was not susceptible to proteolysis by carboxypeptidases. These results firmly establish that the released material in our assay is VSG hydrazide and strengthen the proof that GPI anchoring proceeds via a transamidation reaction mechanism. The reaction could be inhibited with sulfhydryl alkylating reagents, suggesting that the transamidase enzyme contains a functionally important sulfhydryl residue.

Hydrazine was shown to block the C terminus of the released VSG hydrazide because the released material, unlike a truncated form of VSG lacking a GPI signal sequence, was not susceptible to proteolysis by carboxypeptidases. These results firmly establish that the released material in our assay is VSG hydrazide and strengthen the proof that GPI anchoring proceeds via a transamidation reaction mechanism. The reaction could be inhibited with sulfhydryl alkylating reagents, suggesting that the transamidase enzyme contains a functionally important sulfhydryl residue.

Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Both sequences are removed during processing of the preproprotein to the mature GPI-anchored form, but cleavage of the N-terminal signal sequence is not strictly necessary (1Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 2Howell S. Lanctot C. Boileau G. Crine P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16993-16996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly of GPI-anchored proteins requires translocation of the nascent polypeptide chain across the ER membrane and replacement of the C-terminal signal sequence with a preassembled, ethanolamine-containing GPI moiety attached to the newly exposed carboxyl group. The reaction is presumed to be catalyzed by an ER-localized transamidase enzyme (3Mayor S. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Brink L. Udenfriend S. J. Biol.

GPI anchoring can be reproduced in cell-free systems that rely on endogenous, membrane protein acceptors for GPI anchors (3Mayor S. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or, alternatively, that involve an in vitro translation system to load microsomal membranes with pro-protein substrates for GPI modification (5Doering T.L. Schekman R. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Kodukula K. Maxwell S.E. Udenfriend S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 536-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using such systems, strong, albeit circumstantial evidence was obtained for a transamidation reaction mechanism. In an early report, Mayor et al. (3Mayor S. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) exploited a trypanosome cell-free system that had been previously used extensively for studies of GPI biosynthesis (7Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1989; 56: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 8Menon A.K. Mayor S. Schwarz R.T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4249-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to show that transfer of in situsynthesized or exogenously supplied radiolabeled GPIs to endogenous protein acceptors did not require ATP or GTP. The apparent lack of an energy requirement for GPI anchoring in this system was the first experimental evidence consistent with a transamidation reaction mechanism. Although this result is qualitatively useful, quantitatively only a low level of GPI anchor addition was observed, and the possibility that a preformed energy source or a preactivated GPI anchoring enzyme existed in the lysate could not be ruled out. Other studies pioneered by Udenfriend and co-workers (1Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 6Kodukula K. Maxwell S.E. Udenfriend S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 536-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) employed a cell-free system consisting of mammalian cell microsomes capable of processing in vitro synthesized preproproteins to a GPI-anchored form. Kodukula et al. (9Kodukula K. Micanovic R. Gerber L. Tamburrini M. Brink L. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4464-4470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) developed a convenient reporter protein for this purpose based on the sequence of placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), a GPI-anchored protein. The reporter, prepromini-PLAP was found to be sequentially processed by microsomal enzymes to promini-PLAP (lacking the N-terminal signal sequence) and GPI-anchored mini-PLAP. The transition from promini-PLAP to mini-PLAP was found to require ATP, GTP, and ER lumenal proteins, consistent with a chaperone-mediated maturation step prior to GPI anchoring (10Amthauer R. Kodukula K. Brink L. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6124-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Amthauer R. Kodukula K. Gerber L. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The less stringent GTP requirement for this process remains enigmatic. However, there appeared to be no requirement for energy in the final conversion from promini-PLAP to mini-PLAP, consistent with a transamidation mechanism for GPI anchoring. The main product of the reaction in the mammalian translation-translocation system described above is GPI-anchored mini-PLAP. However, a small amount of free mini-PLAP (lacking the C-terminal signal sequence as well as the GPI anchor) is invariably formed, probably via a nucleophilic attack by water on the active carbonyl formed as a result of the initial step of the transamidation reaction sequence (13Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Maxwell et al. (4Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Brink L. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19576-19582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) developed this observation further and demonstrated that other nucleophiles such as hydrazine and hydroxylamine could effectively compete with GPI to generate a molecule similar to free mini-PLAP. They presumed that the free mini-PLAP variant generated under these conditions was mini-PLAP hydrazide or mini-PLAP hydroxamate; however, they were unable to demonstrate the nature of these products because of the subpicomole amounts of material generated in their in vitrotranslation-translocation experiments (4Maxwell S.E.

These data, although incomplete, provide the best published evidence thus far that GPI anchoring proceeds via a transamidation reaction mechanism. In this paper we describe a convenient assay for GPI anchoring based on a cell-free system from insect stage African trypanosomes engineered to express a well characterized GPI-anchored protein. We use the assay to demonstrate explicitly that the enzyme-mediated, hydrazine-induced cleavage of the C-terminal GPI signal sequence from a pro-protein occurs in early compartments of the secretory pathway, requires a functional GPI signal sequence, and results in the formation of a soluble protein product that is modified by hydrazine at its C terminus. We also demonstrate that sulfhydryl alkylating reagents block activity, consistent with a role for a free sulfhydryl residue in catalysis. These data provide proof that GPI anchoring proceeds via a transamidation reaction mechanism.

Autofluor was from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The growth and maintenance of procyclic trypanosomes, and the generation of stably transformed procyclic cell lines expressing full-length GPI-anchored variant surface glycoprotein 117 (VSG 117 or 117wt) and a truncated form lacking the C-terminal GPI signal sequence (117Δgpi) have been described previously (14Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Using standard polymerase chain reaction and cloning procedures (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), a peptide transmembrane domain-anchored VSG construct (117tm) was created in which the transmembrane domain of aTrypanosoma brucei lysosomal membrane protein (16Kelley R.J. Alexander D.L. Cowan C. Balber A.E. Bangs J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was fused to the ω amino acid of VSG 117, thereby replacing the GPI anchor addition signal. The C-terminal amino acid sequence of this construct is: … CKDASRSTGIIAVVAALVVGVIAVVLMRPRRRstop, where the ω amino acid is in bold and the hydrophobic domain is underlined. A stable procyclic cell line expressing this construct was generated as described for the 117wt reporter. [35S]Cys/Met metabolic radiolabeling of procyclic cell lines was carried out as described previously (14Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) except that cells were labeled at a density of 108/ml. Cell viability was monitored throughout the labeling period and was consistently >99%. Procyclic cells were labeled with [3H]ethanolamine or [35S]Cys/Met in the absence or presence of mannosamine to obtain GPI-anchored VSG or non-GPI-anchored VSG proprotein, respectively. [3H]Ethanolamine labeling of procyclics was carried out as described previously (17Lisanti M.P. Field M.C. Caras I.W. Menon A.K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For [35S]Cys/Met labeling, procyclics were cultured in glucose-free RPMI 1640 (supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 10 mm glycerol, 5.5 mm proline, and 33 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for 30 min. The cultures were then supplemented with 5 mmmannosamine or water and incubated for a further 90 min. The procyclics were then resuspended in cysteine-, methionine-, and glucose-free RPMI 1640 (supplemented as above) and labeled as described above. Trypanosome membranes (trypanosome cell-free system) were prepared from metabolically radiolabeled cells as described previously (7Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1989; 56: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) except that the cells were not preincubated with tunicamycin prior to lysis. Aliquots of membranes (5 × 108 cell equivalents/ml) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. The trypanosome cell-free system was used as the enzyme source. Trypanosome membranes were washed twice in 0.1 mHepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm tosyl-lysine chloro-methyl ketone and 2 μg/ml leupeptin and then suspended at 109 cell equivalents/ml in 200 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Aliquots (25 μl) of this lysate were added to tubes containing 25 μl of 20 mm hydrazine (5 mm hydrazine for some experiments), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, or 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, only. Protease inhibitors were also added to this solution when they were used. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C (except for the experiment shown in Fig. 1 B where temperature dependence of the reaction was investigated) for 45 min. For incubations with biotin-LC-hydrazide, the hydrazide was dissolved in Me2SO (50 mm) and 5 μl was added to the incubation. Corresponding controls where just Me2SO was added were also carried out. These incubations were for 3 h to maximize the nucleophile-induced release of VSG. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 350 μl of 0.1 m sodium carbonate and placed on ice for 30 min. Sodium carbonate extraction allowed for the isolation of membrane bound components from those that are soluble. The solution was then layered on top of a 0.1m sodium carbonate, 0.5 m sucrose cushion and spun in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor at 90,000 rpm for 30 min. 200 μl of the resulting supernatant was transferred to a tube containing 26.2 μl of 1.3 m NaCl, 0.9% SDS, 4.35% deoxycholate, 4.35% Nonidet P-40. The remaining membrane pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of TEN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS (TEN-detergent or TEN-D). The samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation as described below. Affinity purified rabbit anti-VSG 117 and rabbit anti-VSG 117 antisera were used in these experiments. Antibody was preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose (PAS) beads (14Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) washed once in TEN-D and resuspended to the original volume. Typically 50 μl of PAS:antibody suspension was added to 200 μl of the sodium carbonate washed pellet or supernatant, which was resuspended in TEN-D. Samples were mixed for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with TEN-D and once with TEN. For most of the experiments 25 μl of 2× sample buffer was added to the 25 μl of PAS beads, and the sample was boiled for 10 min. The tubes were then spun in a microcentrifuge, and 22 μl of the supernatant was fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar). Dried gels were analyzed by fluorography. [3H]Myristic acid-labeled, GPI-anchored VSG 117 was purified from metabolically labeled bloodstream stage trypanosomes as described previously (19Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Brodbeck U. Bordier C. Posttranslational Modifications of Proteins by Lipids. Springer Verlag, Berlin1988: 9-15Google Scholar). This material was incubated on ice in 100 mm Hepes, pH 8, for 45 min with either sulfo-NHS-biotin (an amine-reactive compound) or biotin-LC-hydrazide. The mixture was then passed through a prewashed Millipore ultrafree-MC 10,000 NMWL filter (molecular mass cut-off, 10,000 kDa) to wash away any residual biotin-derivatives (biotin-LC-hydrazide or sulfo-NHS-biotin) and precipitated with streptavidin beads or anti-VSG 117 antibody as described below. In experiments using biotin derivatives, VSG was analyzed by precipitation with streptavidin-agarose following immunoprecipitation with anti-VSG antibodies. The sodium carbonate extract was passed through a prewashed Millipore ultrafree-MC 10,000 NMWL filter (molecular mass cut-off, 10,000) to wash away any residual biotin-derivatives (biotin-LC-hydrazide or sulfo-NHS-biotin). The VSG captured on the filter was recovered by washing the filter twice with 400 μl of TEN buffer and then immunoprecipitating as above. The immunoprecipitated VSG was resuspended with 120 μl of Hepes, pH 7.5, and placed in a 100 °C heating block for 10 min, and the boiled sample was then spun at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge to remove the antibody-coated beads. The supernatant (approximately 100 μl containing immunopurified VSG) was then supplemented with 100 μl of 4× TEN-D buffer and 200 μl of water. Streptavidin coupled to 6% agarose beads was washed twice with TEN-D buffer and resuspended (also in TEN-D) to its original volume. 50 μl of this was added to the immunopurified VSG (in TEN-D) and mixed for 9 h at 4 °C. The samples were then washed three times with TEN-D and once with TEN. Subsequently, 25 μl of 2× sample buffer was added to the streptavidin beads, and the sample was boiled for 15 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography or taken directly for liquid scintillation counting. Precipitation efficiency and sample recovery using streptavidin-agarose was ∼4.5% versus ∼90% for precipitation with anti-VSG 117 antibodies. Metabolically radiolabeled VSG hydrazide was analyzed by carboxypeptidase treatment and SDS-PAGE/fluorography as follows. [35S]Cys/Met-labeled VSG hydrazide was generated as described and immunoprecipitated using anti-VSG antibodies preadsorbed to PAS beads. The beads were repeatedly washed with 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.5, to release the bound material. The immunoisolated VSG hydrazide was dialyzed against water (using a dialysis membrane with a 12,000–14,000-Da molecular mass cut-off), dried in a centrifugal evaporator, resuspended in water, boiled, cooled, and then made up to 50 mm NaOAc, pH 4.5. The sample was then incubated with a mixture of carboxypeptidases P and W (140 milliunits and 30 units, respectively) for 18 h at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation period, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. Radiolabeled 117ΔGPI (a VSG molecule lacking the C-terminal GPI signal sequence) was analyzed alongside as a control. Procyclic trypanosomes expressing 117ΔGPI were metabolically labeled with [35S]Cys/Met as described, and lysates were prepared. The lysates were supplemented with TEN-D buffer (without prior washing) and taken for immunoprecipitation with anti-VSG antibodies preadsorbed to PAS beads as above. The immunoprecipitated 117ΔGPI was analyzed by carboxypeptidase treatment as described for VSG hydrazide. Mayor et al. (3Mayor S. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) estimated that lysates from bloodstream stage trypanosomes contain approximately 400–4,000 VSG molecules per cell equivalent that could act as acceptors in the transamidase reaction; the procyclic lysates used in our experiments have ∼5% of the number of acceptors reported for bloodstage cells (22McDowell M.A. Ransom D.M. Bangs J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), i.e. 20–200 molecules/cell equivalent. Under standard assay conditions using 25 μl of lysate (2.5 × 107cell equivalents), this implies release of 5 × 108 to 5 × 109 VSG hydrazide molecules, i.e.0.8–8 fmol (0.05–0.5 ng of protein). Lipids were extracted from radiolabeled trypanosomes as described previously (Ref. 20Field M.C. Menon A.K. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 155-190Google Scholar; see also legend to Fig. 3), and analyzed by TLC using 10-cm glass-backed silica gel 60 high performance TLC plates (Merck) and chloroform/methanol/1m ammonium acetate/13 m ammonium hydroxide/water (180:140:9:9:23, v/v/v/v/v) as the solvent system. Radiolabeled components in the chromatogram were visualized using a Berthold LB2842 linear scanner. GPI-specific phospholipase D treatment was performed as described (21Güther M.L.S. Masterson W.J. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using human serum as the enzyme source. Prepromini-PLAP mRNA (prepared from plasmid pGEM-4Z/mini-PLAPωSer (a gift from Dr. Sidney Udenfriend)) was translated using a nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of rough microsomes (prepared from mouse thymoma cells (BW5147.3)) according to previously published procedures (12Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4686-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine was included in the translation reaction to label the translation product. Translation-translocation was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 27 °C before adding hydrazine,p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (pCMPSA),p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB), or iodoacetamide as indicated and continuing the incubation for an additional 90 min. The samples were then treated with proteinase K (85 μg/ml final concentration) for 20 min on ice, diluted with buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged to recover the membranes as described (12Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4686-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The membrane pellet was resuspended in SDS-containing sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. We describe a cell-free assay for GPI anchoring based on the premise that the putative GPI transamidase (GPIT) can use small nucleophiles such as hydrazine to effect the displacement of the GPI signal sequence or GPI anchor from a GPI proprotein or GPI-anchored protein, respectively, resulting in the release of a water-soluble derivative of the protein (4Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Brink L. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19576-19582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the principle of the assay, we used lysates prepared from procyclic trypanosomes engineered to express VSG 117 (14Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a conveniently detectable GPI-anchored protein. The cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine for 15 min before being washed, osmotically lysed, and washed again. When the labeled crude membranes (containing membrane-associated, radiolabeled VSG) were incubated with hydrazine and then processed by carbonate extraction to separate water-soluble molecules from membrane-associated material, VSG was detected in the carbonate extract. Analysis of the released material by immunoprecipitation with anti-VSG antibodies, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography confirmed that the released material was a ∼58-kDa VSG molecule, comparable in size to an anchorless VSG variant expressed in procyclic trypanosomes (14Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 6). Production of the released material was dependent on hydrazine, time (Fig. 1 A,left panel), and temperature (Fig. 1 B). As we show later (see Fig. 5), the released material is a hydrazide derivative of VSG, lacking a membrane anchor. VSG release was also observed when the labeled membranes were incubated with hydroxylamine instead of hydrazine (Fig. 1 A, right panel,left-hand lane). These results suggest that the production of a soluble derivative of VSG from a membrane-bound precursor in the presence of nucleophiles is due to temperature-dependent enzymatic activity.Figure 5GPIT-mediated biotinylation of VSG in the presence of biotin-LC-hydrazide. A, 5 × 107 cell equivalents of [35S]Cys/Met pulse-labeled trypanosomes were used for the incubations in lanes 1–4. Washed membranes were incubated in the absence (lane 2) or presence of hydrazine (lane 1) or biotin-LC-hydrazide (lane 4). The biotin-LC-hydrazide was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); a control incubation with just Me2SO added was also performed (lane 3). The sodium carbonate extract supernatant from these incubations was processed by washing on a Millipore filter, dissolved in buffer, and immunoprecipitated with anti-VSG 117 antibodies. The immunoprecipitates (IP) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (lanes 1–4). An identical set of incubations was also performed on an 8-fold larger scale, and the immunoprecipitates obtained using anti-VSG 117 antibodies were then subjected to precipitation with streptavidin agarose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The streptavidin-bound material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography (lanes 5–8).B, purified [3H]myristic acid-labeled GPI-anchored VSG 117 (500 cpm) was biotinylated using sulfo-NHS-biotin or biotin-LC-hydrazide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The treated material was subjected to streptavidin-agarose precipitation, and the precipitates were taken for scintillation counting. The [3H] cpm recovered are shown as the means ± error of duplicate determinations. Hz, hydrazine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Additional experiments were performed to confirm that nucleophile-induced release of VSG shared some of the characteristics of the GPI anchoring reaction. We specifically set out to show that nucleophile-induced VSG release depended on (i) the cellular location of the VSG molecule and (ii) the presence of either a GPI signal sequence or a GPI anchor at the C terminus of VSG. A pulse-chase analysis revealed that membranes prepared from cells labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine for 15 min and then chased for 1 h with complete medium showed very little hydrazine-induced release of VSG when compared with lysates from 15 min pulse-labeled cells (Fig. 2 A, comparelanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and4). Samples were prepared from cells metabolically labeled in the presence of 3 mm 1,10-phenanthroline to block the activity of a surface metalloprotease that cleaves VSG molecules when they arrive at the cell surface (14Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on the half-time (∼1.2 h) for export of GPI-anchored VSG to the p"
https://openalex.org/W2069672191,"Two tropinone reductases (TRs) constitute a key branch point in the biosynthetic pathway of tropane alkaloids, which are mainly produced in several solanaceous plants. The two TRs share 64% identical amino acid residues and reduce the 3-carbonyl group of a common substrate, tropinone, but they produce distinct alcohol products with different stereospecific configurations. Previous x-ray crystallographic analysis has revealed their highly conserved overall folding, and the modeling of tropinone within the putative substrate-binding sites has suggested that the different stereospecificities may be determined solely by the different binding orientations of tropinone to the enzymes. In this study, we have constructed various mutant TRs, in which putative substrate-binding residues from one TR were substituted with those found in the corresponding positions of the other TR. Substitution of five amino acid residues resulted in an almost complete reversal of stereospecificity, indicating that the different stereospecificities are indeed determined by the binding orientation of tropinone. Detailed kinetic analysis of the mutant enzymes has shown that TR stereospecificity is determined by varying the contributions from electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and that the present TR structures represent highly evolved forms, in which strict stereospecificities and rapid turnover are accomplished together. Two tropinone reductases (TRs) constitute a key branch point in the biosynthetic pathway of tropane alkaloids, which are mainly produced in several solanaceous plants. The two TRs share 64% identical amino acid residues and reduce the 3-carbonyl group of a common substrate, tropinone, but they produce distinct alcohol products with different stereospecific configurations. Previous x-ray crystallographic analysis has revealed their highly conserved overall folding, and the modeling of tropinone within the putative substrate-binding sites has suggested that the different stereospecificities may be determined solely by the different binding orientations of tropinone to the enzymes. In this study, we have constructed various mutant TRs, in which putative substrate-binding residues from one TR were substituted with those found in the corresponding positions of the other TR. Substitution of five amino acid residues resulted in an almost complete reversal of stereospecificity, indicating that the different stereospecificities are indeed determined by the binding orientation of tropinone. Detailed kinetic analysis of the mutant enzymes has shown that TR stereospecificity is determined by varying the contributions from electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and that the present TR structures represent highly evolved forms, in which strict stereospecificities and rapid turnover are accomplished together. Two tropinone reductases (TRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TR, tropinone reductase; ψ-tropine, pseudotropine. 1The abbreviations used are: TR, tropinone reductase; ψ-tropine, pseudotropine. catalyze key branch point steps in the biosynthesis of tropane alkaloids, which include several medicinally important compounds such as hyoscyamine (its racemic form, atropine) and scopolamine (1Leete E. Planta Med. 1990; 56: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The two enzymes share a common substrate, tropinone, and transfer the pro-S hydrogen atom of the cofactor NADPH to the 3-carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate. However, the resulting alcohol products have opposite configurations at the hydroxyl group, i.e. one enzyme, TR-I (EC 1.1.1.206), produces tropine with a 3α-hydroxyl group, whereas the other, TR-II (EC 1.1.1.236), produces pseudotropine (ψ-tropine) with a β-hydroxyl group (Fig. 1). Tropine and ψ-tropine are not interconverted in vivo (2Yamada Y. Hashimoto T. Endo T. Yukimune Y. Kohno J. Hamaguchi N. Dräger B. Charlwood B.V. Rhodes M.J.C. Secondary Products from Plant Tissue Culture. Clarendon Press, Oxford1990: 227-242Google Scholar) and are further metabolized to various alkaloid products. cDNAs encoding TRs have so far been isolated from two plant species, Datura stramonium and Hyoscyamus niger, both of which belong to the family Solanaceae (3Nakajima K. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9591-9595Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,4Nakajima K. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1993; 103: 1465-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 2K. Nakajima and T. Hashimoto, unpublished observations. 2K. Nakajima and T. Hashimoto, unpublished observations. All four TRs have been expressed in Escherichia coli as native proteins, and gel filtration experiments with these recombinant TRs have revealed that the enzymes of D. stramonium exist as a homodimer, whereas the TRs of H. niger most likely exist as a homotetramer (5Nakajima K. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11695-11698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 In both species, TR-I and TR-II share 64% identical amino acids from the 260–274 residues comprising each subunit, suggesting that the two enzymes diverged relatively recently from the same ancestral protein. The amino acid sequences also indicated that the TRs belong to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family (6Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). The most intriguing questions about the TRs ask how these enzymes have evolved to catalyze opposite stereospecific reductions of the same substrate, and what molecular mechanism enables these homologous enzymes to control the stereospecificity in such a strict manner? A clue to answering these questions was first obtained from the analysis of a series of chimeric TR enzymes, which suggested that the different stereospecificity was conferred by a structural difference in their substrate-binding sites (5Nakajima K. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11695-11698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent x-ray crystallographic analysis of the TRs from D. stramonium has revealed that the two enzymes share almost identical overall protein folding and that both the cofactor-binding site and the catalytically important Tyr residue are structurally very well conserved within their three-dimensional structures (7Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Akama H. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Hashimoto T. Oda J. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4876-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Well conserved positions for both the hydride donor (NADPH) and the proton donor (catalytic Tyr residue) have suggested that the configurations of the reaction products (3α- or 3β-hydroxyl group) are determined solely by the binding orientations of tropinone to the enzymes (7Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Akama H. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Hashimoto T. Oda J. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4876-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the predicted substrate-binding site of each enzyme appears to be consistent with the predicted binding orientation of tropinone that produces the hydroxyl group with the relevant configuration (Fig.2, A and B) (7Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Akama H. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Hashimoto T. Oda J. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4876-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The substrate-binding sites of the TRs have different electrostatic charge distributions that may fix opposite orientations for tropinone; in TR-I, the positive charge of His112 may repulse the positive charge of the tropinone nitrogen atom, whereas in TR-II, the favorable interaction between the negative charge of Glu156and the positive charge of the tropinone nitrogen atom may fix the opposite binding orientation. In addition, the putative tropinone-binding sites of both TRs were composed mostly of hydrophobic amino acids, some of which were replaced with different amino acids in TR-I and TR-II. Such changes may differentially shape the substrate-binding sites and thereby aid in fixing the binding orientation of tropinone. Although bound tropinone is predicted to be surrounded by 11 amino acid residues, comparison of the four TR sequences (two TRs from the two plant species) has revealed that only five residues can be correlated with stereospecificity (Fig.2 C) (7Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Akama H. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Hashimoto T. Oda J. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4876-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A potential method to confirm these hypothetical tropinone binding modes would be the crystallographic analysis of the protein-cofactor-tropinone ternary complexes. However, such complex crystals cannot be obtained in all cases, and even if successful, the structure alone is not sufficient to understand the role of each amino acid residue. Site-directed mutagenesis is another method that could be used to confirm the hypothetical tropinone binding mode and thereby compensate for the present absence of crystallographic studies of the ternary complexes. Here we report the construction and characterization of a series of mutant TR enzymes. Substitution of the five amino acids involved in the putative TR substrate-binding sites was found to be sufficient to switch their stereospecificities. The results confirmed most of the predicted mechanisms controlling the different TR stereospecificities and further revealed different contributions from electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to substrate binding. Mutations were introduced into the TR-coding regions of the expression vectors, pETTR1 and pETTR2, which respectively express the native TR-I and TR-II enzymes ofD. stramonium under the control of the T7 promoter (7Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Akama H. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Hashimoto T. Oda J. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4876-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed by the “splicing by overlap extension” method (8Clackson T. Güssow D. Jones P.T. McPherson M.J. Quirke P. Taylor G.R. PCR, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 207-209Google Scholar), using two complementary primers that contain the desired mutation(s) and two other primers that anneal to either upstream or downstream regions of the vector (T7 promoter or T7 terminator primers). Amplified DNA from the second round of polymerase chain reactions was digested at the XbaI and EcoRI sites derived from the multicloning site of the pET21d vector. The digested DNA was purified by a Chroma Spin 400 column (CLONTECH) and ligated into new pET21d vector at the XbaI and EcoRI sites, so as to reconstruct the vector sequences. Because the mutagenesis was performed using many cycles of polymerase chain reactions with Taq polymerase, all the mutated plasmids were sequenced, and only plasmids without unintended missense mutations were used to express proteins. Mutant and wild-type TR enzymes were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and extracted as described previously (7Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Akama H. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Hashimoto T. Oda J. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4876-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Buffer-soluble proteins were fractionated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. Proteins precipitating at 45–75% saturation of ammonium sulfate were dissolved in buffer A (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 35% saturation ammonium sulfate and loaded onto a butyl-Sepharose fast flow column (1.5 × 0.9 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a stepwise reduction in the ammonium sulfate concentration of the buffer. Fractions enriched with TR proteins were pooled and then purified further by affinity chromatography. For both the wild-type and mutant TR-I, the butyl-Sepharose fraction buffer was first exchanged for buffer B (identical to buffer A, except pH 6.4) using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then loaded onto a Red-Toyopearl 650 ML column (0.9 × 2.0 cm, Toso, Japan). Bound TR protein was eluted with a stepwise gradient of NaCl (0–1.5m) in buffer A. For the wild-type and mutant TR-II, the butyl-Sepharose fraction buffer was exchanged for buffer A, loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column (0.9 × 2.7 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a stepwise gradient of KCl (0–1.0m) in buffer A. Affinity chromatography fractions were desalted by PD-10, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until further use. TR activity was measured by either product quantification with gas-liquid chromatography or photometric measurement of NADPH consumption (9Hashimoto T. Nakajima K. Ongena G. Yamada Y. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1992; 100: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis, the photometric method was used because of its accuracy in measuring the steady state velocity of the reaction. K m andk cat values were determined from [S]versus [S]/v plots using at least five different [S] values, where [S] is the concentration of the substrate and v is the activity at each substrate concentration. A previous x-ray crystallographic study predicted 11 amino acid residues from each TR that would possibly come in contact with tropinone bound to the enzyme. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of TR-I and TR-II from the two plant species revealed that only five of these 11 residues could be correlated with stereospecificity, i.e. the five positions are substituted by different amino acids according to enzyme type but are conserved across the species (Fig. 2 C) (7Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Akama H. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Hashimoto T. Oda J. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4876-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These five residues were classified into two groups: one having different polarities between TR-I and TR-II and the other conserving hydrophobicity. The former group (group A) has three residue pairs: His112–Tyr100, Ala160–Ser148, and Val168–Glu156 (where the order is TR-I-TR-II), whereas the latter (group B) has two residue pairs: Ile223–Leu210 and Phe226–Leu213. These five positions are hereafter, respectively, referred to as A1, A2, A3, B1, and B2 (Fig.2 C). In this study, mutations were first made to individually exchange the three group A residues between TR-I and TR-II, whereas the two group B residues were exchanged together. These mutations were then combined in a single enzyme in various combinations to produce more mutated TR enzymes. The mutant enzymes were expressed in E. coli using the T7 expression system (10Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). As for the wild-type TRs, the mutant enzymes were expressed at very high levels, with the TR-I mutants showing greater expression than the TR-II mutants (Fig. 3 A). Each of the expressed TR proteins was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The final stage of purification involved chromatography using either a Red-Toyopearl or a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column for TR-I and TR-II, respectively. Mutant TR enzymes were purified under fundamentally identical conditions to those used for the corresponding wild-type enzymes (data not shown). These two chromatographic steps resulted in nearly homogenous TR protein preparations (Fig. 3 B). Purified enzymes were first analyzed for their affinity toward tropinone and NADPH (Table I). Because the affinity between TR-I and tropinone has been reported to be dependent on reaction pH (11Portsteffen A. Dräger B. Nahrstedt A. Phytochemistry. 1994; 37: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the following analyses were performed under a physiologically relevant condition, namely pH 7.0 at 28 °C, unless noted otherwise. Whereas most of the mutant enzymes showed several orders of magnitude higher K m values for tropinone as compared with the corresponding wild-type enzymes, affinity for NADPH was not very much affected by any mutation(s), with their K m values remaining within the same order of magnitude as those of the wild types. This observation reflects the fact that mutations were made only to putative tropinone-binding sites. Their relatively constant affinity for NADPH, together with their similar behavior during purification, indicates that the mutant enzymes retained the wild-type tertiary structure.Table IKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant TRsMutationK mk catTropinoneNADPHmmμms −1TR-IWild type0.117 ± 0.01011.6 ± 4.025.6 ± 0.9H112Y0.338 ± 0.04820.7 ± 3.516.4 ± 0.8A160S0.175 ± 0.05545.0 ± 9.315.1 ± 1.0V168E7.40 ± 1.4939.6 ± 7.70.603 ± 0.029H112Y/A160S1.44 ± 0.1182.2 ± 21.08.42 ± 0.21A160S/V168E13.3 ± 3.637.0 ± 2.40.178 ± 0.014V168E/H112Y7.54 ± 0.3656.4 ± 10.10.389 ± 0.007H112Y/A160S/V168E6.01 ± 1.6282.5 ± 14.70.215 ± 0.016I223L/F226L5.11 ± 0.5713.2 ± 2.521.8 ± 1.5H112Y/A160S/V168E/I223L/F226L3.88 ± 0.4841.1 ± 7.90.135 ± 0.003H112F0.500 ± 0.09416.7 ± 3.25.16 ± 0.43TR-IIWild type0.0476 ± 0.012218.7 ± 5.42.73 ± 0.16Y100H4.56 ± 0.2311.2 ± 2.16.84 ± 0.16S148A0.310 ± 0.0231.72 ± 0.621.77 ± 0.07E156V28.7 ± 4.4420.1 ± 2.31.11 ± 0.07Y100H/S148A19.6 ± 1.84.05 ± 1.644.58 ± 0.23S148A/E156V6.56 ± 1.538.17 ± 1.102.52 ± 0.16E156V/Y100H52.5 ± 21.725.5 ± 2.01.02 ± 0.18Y100H/S148A/E156V38.1 ± 3.712.4 ± 1.44.86 ± 0.30L210I/L213F0.0448 ± 0.00724.17 ± 1.721.88 ± 0.11Y100H/S148A/E156V/L210I/L213F>5037.7 ± 3.3 Open table in a new tab Stereospecificity of the mutant enzymes was analyzed by quantifying the reaction products, tropine and ψ-tropine, by gas-liquid chromatography. Because the mutant enzymes had differing affinities for tropinone, as seen in TableI, enzyme reactions were performed at four different tropinone concentrations (0.05, 0.5, and 5 mm, plus theK m of each enzyme). Fig. 4 shows the TR-I/TR-II activity ratios measured as described above. Among the single mutants of the three A residues, only the mutation at A3 affected stereospecificity. In TR-II this position is occupied by Glu, an acidic residue predicted to be the most important determinant of tropinone binding orientation. When mutations at residues A1 and A2, which alone had no effect on stereospecificity, were added to the above A3 mutants, stereospecificity was shifted in a cumulative fashion. At a tropinone concentration of 5 mm, the stereospecificity of the triple mutants of both TR-I and TR-II was shifted by more than 90%. At lower tropinone concentrations, however, the stereospecificity shift was diminished, especially for the TR-II mutant, which possessed two productive tropinone binding orientations, with the one producing ψ-tropine (TR-II orientation) still being of higher affinity. In both TR-I and TR-II, substitution of the B residues alone had no effect on stereospecificity. When these group B mutations and the group A triple mutations were combined in a single enzyme to give quintuple mutants, the stereospecificity shifts were further enhanced, and the dependence on tropinone concentration seen in the triple mutant disappeared. The results obtained above disagreed with our previous prediction concerning the role of His112 in TR-I. The positive charge that would arise from His112 seems to have no direct contribution to stereospecificity, because the H112Y mutant retained wild-type TR-I stereospecificity. To understand the role of His112 in TR-I catalysis, we constructed an additional mutant, H112F, in which His112 was replaced with Phe, an amino acid with similar size but higher hydrophobicity. This mutant retained TR-I stereospecificity, as expected from the H112Y mutant (data not shown), and its affinity for tropinone was also similar to that of the H112Y mutant (Table I). However, the H112F mutant showed a reduced turnover rate, with k cat values at pH 7.0 being 20 and 31% of the wild-type and the H112Y mutant, respectively (Table I). These observations suggest that although the positive charge of His112 was dispensable for stereospecificity, some degree of polarity at this position is necessary for efficient TR-I catalysis (and possibly for TR-II as well). This was confirmed by analyzing the kinetic parameters of the mutants at various pH values. Both H112Y and H112F mutants lost the pH dependence of k cat values that was observed in the wild-type TR-I, especially the sharp increase ink cat at acidic pH (Fig.5 A). Conversely, the Y100H mutation conferred a pH dependence to the k catvalues of TR-II (Fig. 5 B). Given that the pK a of the His side chain is about 6.4 (12Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 155-175Google Scholar), the observed pH dependence of the k cat values likely reflects the change in hydrophobicity of His112. Tyr100 of TR-II (pK a 9.7) is thought to be protonated within the pH range tested, but the ε-hydroxyl group may still exhibit sufficient polarity. These results indicate that some degree of polarity at this position is necessary for efficient catalysis by both TRs. Both H112Y and H112F mutants showed an increase inK m values at acidic pH similar to wild-type TR-I (Fig. 5 C), indicating that the low affinity between TR-I and tropinone at acidic pH is not because of unfavorable contact between the charged His112 residue and the hydrophobic C6-C7 bridge of tropinone but rather because of unfavorable contact between the charged tropinone nitrogen atom and the hydrophobic surface of TR-I (Fig. 2 A). In contrast to TR-I, the K m of TR-II was altered to be pH-dependent by the Y100H mutation (Fig. 5 D). This is consistent with our binding model, where the nitrogen atom of tropinone comes in close contact with Tyr100 of TR-II (Fig. 2 B). At acidic pH, a His residue in place of Tyr100 would introduce an unfavorable repulsion toward the nitrogen atom of tropinone bound in the wild-type orientation. From the x-ray crystallographic analyses of the TR-I-NADPH complex crystal and the TR-II protein crystal, it was predicted that the different stereospecificities of TRs are determined by the binding orientations of tropinone in the enzymes (7Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Akama H. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Hashimoto T. Oda J. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4876-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Comparison of TR substrate-binding sites revealed only a few amino acids that were selectively different according to enzyme type, raising the possibility that TR stereospecificity may be determined by a relatively small number of amino acids. In this study, a series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments proved those predictions to be relevant; by exchanging five amino acid residues between TR-I and TR-II, stereospecificity was reversed by more than 90% irrespective of substrate concentrations. It should be noted, however, that these residues were not solely responsible for binding tropinone with high affinity and reactivity. The quintuple mutants of both TR-I and TR-II showed relatively highK m values for tropinone and in the case of TR-I, a decreased k cat value as well. Therefore, an additional substitution(s) is necessary to attain reversed stereospecificity together with a rapid turnover rate. A candidate for such a residue is Lys214 of TR-I, which is missing from TR-II (Fig. 2 C). This residue is positioned at the edge of the small lobe, a domain that constitutes one side wall of the substrate-binding cleft. Deletion of this residue from TR-I (as in TR-II) would result in the displacement of the two side walls of the cleft and may alter the relative orientations of the tropinone-binding residues. There may be more such residues that indirectly affect substrate binding. Although TR-I and TR-II have an almost identical tertiary structure and use a subset of amino acids that occupy similar three-dimensional positions, they employ different strategies to hold tropinone in its correct orientation. In TR-II, the binding orientation is considered to be fixed primarily by the favorable electrostatic interaction between Glu156 and the nitrogen atom of tropinone, with the other amino acids helping to increase binding affinity and fine-tuning binding orientation. Without these favorable electrostatic interactions, the hydrophobic amino acids of the TR-I substrate-binding site provide a more complementary fit to tropinone than does TR-II. Consistent with this prediction are the results obtained from the group B mutations. The I223L/F226L mutations impaired the affinity of TR-I for tropinone, with the K m value of the mutant being 5.11 mm (a 44-fold increase from the wild-type), whereas the K m of the L210I/L213F TR-II mutant remained low at 0.0448 mm (Table I), indicating these two hydrophobic residues to be relatively more important for substrate binding in TR-I. Furthermore, among the 11 residue pairs that were predicted to form the TR substrate-binding sites, in TR-I, only one pair shows any interspecies variety (Val208–Ile), whereas there are three such residue pairs in TR-II (Val147–Ile, Val153–Leu, and Leu196–Met) (Fig.2 C). The diminished variety of TR-I residues may reflect the importance of these noncharged amino acids for the high affinity binding of tropinone to TR-I. The different substrate recognition mechanisms of TR-I and TR-II raise the question as to why TR-I does not use electrostatic interaction to increase its affinity for tropinone. To address this question, we introduced either Glu or Asp in place of Val203 in TR-I, this being the only possible position where mutagenesis to an acidic residue would provide an electrostatic interaction with the tropinone nitrogen atom. These mutants showed both lower affinity for tropinone and a reduced turnover rate (data not shown). Moreover, a computer modeling experiment demonstrated that neither Glu nor Asp (in place of Val203) was able to locate its side chain carboxyl group at a distance favorable to the tropinone nitrogen. These observations suggest that the TR backbone does not permit TR-I to use an electrostatic interaction in binding tropinone in a correct and productive orientation. The impaired stereospecificity and reactivity (as measured byk cat/K m values) observed in all the mutant enzymes indicate that the wild-type structures of both TRs represent highly evolved forms. For instance, His112 of TR-I, which appeared to have no direct contribution to stereospecificity, was, however, found to be important for both high affinity binding of tropinone and rapid turnover. The corresponding TR-II residue, Tyr100, cannot replace His, because this mutation reduces the affinity for tropinone, and no increase ink cat can be expected at physiological pH (Fig.5 B). This could mean that the metabolism of tropinone may have evolved under strong selective pressure, i.e. the regulated production of two different stereoisomers might have conferred selective advantage to the plants producing them. In H. niger, tropine is esterified to an organic acid to give hyoscyamine and then scopolamine (Fig. 1) (1Leete E. Planta Med. 1990; 56: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ψ-Tropine can also be esterified to different organic acids, but most ψ-tropine is considered to be polyhydroxylated to give calystegines (Fig. 1) (13Dräger B. Funck C. Höhler A. Mrachatz G. Nahrstedt A. Portsteffen A. Schaal A. Schmidt R. Plant Cell Tissue Org. Cult. 1994; 38: 235-240Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Whereas hyoscyamine and scopolamine act on the nervous system of mammals, calystegines have a glycosidase-inhibiting activity and can also serve as nutritional mediators in the rhizosphere (14Molyneux R. Pan Y.T. Goldmann A. Tepfer D.A. Elbein A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Tepfer D. Goldmann A. Pamboukdjian N. Maille M. Lepingle A. Chevalier D. Dénarié J. Rosenberg C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different functions of the tropine- and ψ-tropine-derived alkaloids might have prompted the acquisition of separate TR enzymes to control the metabolic flow at this branching point. Recent random cDNA sequencing projects have revealed that genes highly homologous to TRs are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. We have determined the full-length sequences of five such clones fromArabidopsis and found that they encode proteins with high homology to TRs along the entire polypeptide chain (47–54% identical residues) but have a different set of predicted substrate-binding residues.2 This indicates that the same protein backbone is also utilized for enzymes that function in different metabolic pathways. The original TR enzyme must have arisen from a common ancestor with those enzymes via mutations to the substrate-binding site. This original TR enzyme likely had random stereospecificity, because our mutation experiments indicated that a strict stereospecificity can only be achieved after fine-tuning the substrate-binding structure, which requires mutations at several amino acid residues. After gene duplication, each of the progeny TRs may have evolved strict and opposite stereospecificities. An alternative evolutionary process can also be assumed. Because the stereospecificity of most of the TR mutants was dependent on tropinone concentration, the ancestral TR that potentially had a random stereospecificity might have produced only one stereoisomer, provided that only low concentrations of tropinone were present during the early stages of evolution. Therefore, it is possible that an ancient TR first evolved to have strict stereospecificity for one configuration, and the opposite stereospecificity was later acquired by switching its stereospecificity using a process similar to this mutagenesis experiment. Consistent with this latter evolutionary process is the recent discovery of calystegines (3β-nortropane alkaloids) in well known solanaceous plants such as potato, tomato, and sweet pepper, in which no 3α-tropane alkaloid has been reported (16Dräger B. Almsick A.V. Mrachatz G. Planta Med. 1995; 61: 577-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Asano N. Kato A. Matsui K. Walton A.A. Nash R.J. Molyneux R.J. Hackett L. Topping J. Winchester B. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1085-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Likewise, no plant species has so far been shown to possess only TR-I activity. These observations imply a wider occurrence of TR-II in this plant family, and hence the later divergence of TR-I from TR-II. Exploring the TR gene(s) in such plant species may provide insights into the emergence of the two configurations in the evolution of tropane alkaloid biosynthesis.

https://openalex.org/W1986146402,"The three Gαi subunits were independently depleted from rat pituitary GH4C1 cells by stable transfection of each Gαi antisense rat cDNA construct. Depletion of any Gαi subunit eliminated receptor-induced inhibition of basal cAMP production, indicating that all Gαi subunits are required for this response. By contrast, receptor-mediated inhibition of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-stimulated cAMP production was blocked by selective depletions for responses induced by the transfected serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) (Gαi2 or Gαi3) or endogenous muscarinic-M4 (Gαi1 or Gαi2) receptors. Strikingly, receptor activation in Gαi1-depleted clones (for the 5-HT1A receptor) or Gαi3-depleted clones (for the muscarinic receptor) induced a pertussis toxin-sensitive increase in basal cAMP production, whereas the inhibitory action on VIP-stimulated cAMP synthesis remained. Finally, in Gαi2-depleted clones, activation of 5-HT1A receptors increased VIP-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Thus, 5-HT1A and muscarinic M4 receptor may couple dominantly to Gαi1 and Gαi3, respectively, to inhibit cAMP production. Upon removal of these Gαi subunits to reduce inhibitory coupling, stimulatory receptor coupling is revealed that may involve Gβγ-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase II, a Gi-stimulated cyclase that is predominantly expressed in GH4C1 cells. Thus Gi-coupled receptor activation involves integration of both inhibitory and stimulatory outputs that can be modulated by specific changes in αi subunit expression level.

Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce signals generated by hormone receptors with seven transmembrane domain α-helices to various effectors such as AC, 1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; 5-HT, serotonin; PTX, pertussis toxin; VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; bp, base pairs. 1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; 5-HT, serotonin; PTX, pertussis toxin; VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; bp, base pairs.phospholipase C, and ion channels (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4686) Google Scholar, 2Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 3Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). These G proteins are composed of a Gα subunit and a tight complex of Gβ and Gγ subunits. The binding of agonist to receptors allows them to interact with G proteins, which subsequently accelerates the rate of dissociation of GDP and the binding of GTP to the Gα subunits. Both GTP-liganded Gα subunits and Gβγ dimers then regulate downstream effector activities. The intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα subunits hydrolyzes GTP to GDP to form Gα-GDP, which then associates with Gβγ dimers to inactivate the complex. The cyclic AMP-forming enzyme, adenylyl cyclase, is one of the ubiquitous effectors that is regulated by G protein-coupled receptors. The pathways of Gs-coupled receptor-induced stimulation of AC have been well characterized (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4686) Google Scholar, 4Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory regulation of AC by Gi-coupled receptors is far less clear, and the underlying mechanisms seem to be rather complex. For example, in several cell systems, e.g. mouse Ltk−, Rat-1, and NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells, inhibition of cAMP synthesis by Gi-coupled receptors was only observed when AC was activated by forskolin or Gs-coupled receptors (5Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23689-23697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Milligan G. Carr C. Gould G.W. Mullaney I. Lavan B.E. J. Biol.

On the other hand, in neuronal and endocrine cells, Gi-coupled receptors inhibited both unstimulated and stimulated AC activity (2Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,5Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. J. Biol.

In addition, some Gi-coupled receptors have even been reported to stimulate AC, e.g.α2-adrenergic receptor in PC-12 pheocytochroma cells (7Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 5-HT1A receptors in hippocampus (10Markstein R. Hoyer D. Engel G. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

The specificity of distinct Gi proteins in receptor-AC coupling remains incompletely understood. For example, using anti-Gαi subunit antibodies to block receptor coupling, it has been reported that inhibition of AC by α2-adrenergic receptors in platelet membranes is mediated by Gαi2 (12Simonds W.F. Goldsmith P.K. Codina J. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7809-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and that 5-HT1A receptor-induced inhibition of cAMP synthesis in HeLa cell membranes is preferentially mediated by Gαi3 (13Fargin A. Yamamoto K. Cotecchia S. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. Lapetina E.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 1991; 3: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This approach, however, is limited to cell-free preparations and depends on the specificity of the antibodies used. To assess the roles in receptor coupling of particular G proteins in whole cells, transfection of PTX-insensitive Gαimutant proteins has been used to rescue receptor-mediated signaling following PTX pretreatment. For example, the dopamine-D2S receptor appears to couple to Gαi2 and Gαi3 to mediate inhibition of forskolin and Gs-stimulated AC, respectively (14Senogles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23120-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ghahremani M.H. Cheng P. Lembo P.M.C. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9238-9245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This approach depends on the specificity and functionality of the Gαi mutants. We have used expression of antisense constructs to selectively deplete particular G proteins and assessed their contribution to receptor coupling (16Goetzl E.J. Shames R.S. Yang J. Birke F.W. Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. An S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 809-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liu Y.F. Jakobs K.H. Rasenick M.M. Albert P.R. J. Biol.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of the three known Gαi subunits (19Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in relaying inhibitory signals from 5-HT1A and muscarinic M4 receptors to AC in intact GH4C1 rat pituitary cells. We analyzed Gi protein subtype specificity in receptor-effector coupling by stably introducing distinct full-length rat Gαi antisense constructs into GH4ZD10 cells (GH4C1 cells transfected with the rat 5-HT1A receptor (5Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23689-23697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This approach produced a specific block of the gene expression of these proteins (18Albert P.R. Morris S.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Characterization of these different Gαi-deficient antisense clones indicates that Gαi proteins specifically link receptors to inhibition of cAMP synthesis but not to closure of calcium channels and that the combined presense of all three Gαi subunits is essential for receptor-mediated inhibition of unstimulated but not of VIP receptor-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Strikingly, upon depletion of distinct Gαi subunits, the Gi-coupled 5-HT1A and muscarinic M4 receptors switched to stimulate AC activity. 5-HT, carbachol, VIP, PTX, and isobutylmethylxanthine were purchased from Sigma. Hygromycin B was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). BayK-8644 was from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA). Fura 2-AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). PTX was from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Rat G protein Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 subunits and AC type II cDNAs were gifts of Dr. R. Reed. G protein Gαi subunit antibodies were kindly donated by Dr. D. Manning. All cells were grown as monolayer in Ham's F-10 medium with 8% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Media were changed 12–24 h prior to experimentation. The 2.0-kbEcoRI-EcoRI Gαi1 cDNA fragment, the 1.8-kb EcoRI-EcoRI Gαi2cDNA fragment, or the 3.1-kb EcoRI-EcoRI Gαi3 cDNA fragment (13Fargin A. Yamamoto K. Cotecchia S. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. Lapetina E.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 1991; 3: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) containing the full coding sequences and 0.5 to 0.8 kb of 5′ and 3′ noncoding regions were excised using EcoRI. The cDNA fragments were ligated into pcDNA (Invitrogen) in the reverse orientation with respect to the cytomegalovirus promoter, resulting in Gαi1, Gαi2, or Gαi3 antisense expression vectors. The constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and by DNA sequencing. A modified transfection procedure was used; 300–500 μg of each Gαi antisense construct was cotransfected separately with 30 μg of pY-3 hygromycin B resistance plasmid into G418-resistant GH4ZD10 cells by standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation protocol (20Albert P.R. Zhou Q.Y. Van Tol H.H. Bunzow J.R. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5825-5832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The selection was initiated after 24 h by adding 150 μg/ml hygromycin B into the culture medium to select the clones with expression of the antisense RNAs and to allow the clones to adapt the cytotoxicity of hygromycin B. After 2 weeks, the concentration of hygromycin B was raised to 400 μg/ml to select the clones that have the highest resistance to hygromycin B and that most likely express the highest levels of the antisense RNAs. Isolated clones were propagated, and total RNA was prepared from them and screened by reverse transcription-PCR analysis using a pair of oligonucleotides specific for each Gαi cDNA (Gαi1, 5′-ACCAGACGAGTACTTATA-3′ and 5′-TAGTCTGTGCAACGTTTA-3′; Gαi2, 5′-CACTACCTGTGAGGAAGA-3′ and 5′-ACTCCTCCAGACATAGG-3′; Gαi3, 5′-TGATATCAAATCTAGGGC-3′ and 5′-TAGAACGCATTCCCAGAT-3′) to identify positive clones. Total RNA from GH4ZD10 or the different Gαi antisense clones was reverse-transcribed after annealing the primer (sense or antisense) to RNA by heating the two together at 90 °C and then chilling on ice. One-tenth of the reverse-transcription mixture was used for PCR amplification. 50 μl of PCR mixture contained 50 mm KCl, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm each dCTP, dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1 unit Hot-Tub DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 3 μm primer. The PCR cycle included denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 48 to 52 °C (varied with different pairs of primers), and extension for 20 s at 72 °C. For Western blotting, membranes (50 μg protein/lane) prepared from the positive antisense clones were solubilized, electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocullose sheets, and probed with specific antibodies as described (16Goetzl E.J. Shames R.S. Yang J. Birke F.W. Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. An S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 809-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric scanning of the blots was done on the Scanmaster 3 densitometer (Howtek, Hudson, NH). The data were digitized, quantitated using the Masterscan analysis program (Scanalytric, Billerica, MA), and reconstructed as Masterscan images presented in the figures. This analysis allows enhanced resolution of weak signals. Western blots were quantitated from the Masterscan data. Optical densities of equal area samples from each band of interest were subtracted from background for that lane and normalized (×100) to the control samples to obtain the percentage of control. Measurement of [Ca2+]i was performed as described previously (5Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23689-23697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were harvested by incubation in calcium-free HBSS containing 5 mm EDTA. The cells were washed once with HBSS (118 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmd-glucose and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 μm Fura 2-AM. The cells were then diluted to 10 ml, centrifuged, washed twice with HBSS, resuspended in 2 ml HBSS, and finally placed in a fluorescence cuvette. Change in fluorescence ratio was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer (Buckinghamshire, UK) LS-50 spectrofluorometer and analyzed by computer, based on aK D of 227 nm for the Fura 2-calcium complex. Calibration of R max was performed by addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm Tris base, and calibration of R min was performed by addition of 10 mm EGTA. All experimental compounds were added directly to the cuvette from 200-fold concentrated test solutions. Measurement of cAMP was performed as described previously (5Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23689-23697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were plated in six-well 35-mm dishes. After removal of the medium, the cells were preincubated in 2 ml/well of HBSS for 5–10 min at 37 °C. The buffer was replaced by 1 ml of HBSS containing 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine, a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and the incubation was continued for another 5 min. Then the various test compounds were added to the wells, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The buffer was collected for cAMP assay using a specific radioimmunoassay (ICN) as described before (5Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23689-23697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic RNA was extracted from rat brain tissue and GH4C1 cells using guanidium thiocyanate extraction, and GH4C1 RNA was further purified on oligo(dT) cellulose to obtain poly(A)+ RNA. The RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc.) and random hexamer primers (50 ng). The cDNAs were subjected to PCR with the following primer pairs (2 pmol/μl) designed using the Primer Select program (DNASTAR Inc.) to amplify specific fragments of the Indicated sizes: AC I (444 bp), 5′-CTGCGGGCGTGCGATGAGGAGTTC and 5′-GCGCACGGGCAGCAGGGCATAG; AC II (425 bp), 5′-GCTGGCGTCATAGGGGCTCAAAA and 5′-GGCACGCGCAGACACCAAACAGTA; AC III (418 bp), 5′-GGACGCCCTTCACCCACAACCAA and 5′-AGACCACCGCGCACATCACTACCA; AC IV (454 bp), 5′-CACGGCCGGGATTGCGAGTAGC and 5′-TGCCGAGCCAGGACGAGGAGTGT; AC V (412 bp), 5′-GAGCCCCAATGACCCCAGCCACTA and 5′-CGGGAGCGGCGCAATGATGAACT; and AC VI (362 bp), 5′-CCTGGCGGAAGCTGTGTCGGTTAC and 5′-GCGGTCAGTGGCCTTGGGGTTTG. The PCR reaction was performed with different concentrations of cDNA (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 μg/reaction) and repeated at least twice. The amplified DNA fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced by Sanger dideoxynucleotide chain termination using modified T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern blot analysis was performed on GH4C1 poly(A)+ RNA at high stringency as described (20Albert P.R. Zhou Q.Y. Van Tol H.H. Bunzow J.R. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5825-5832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the 32P-labeled 1.203-kb EcoRI/EcoRV fragment of rat AC II cDNA as probe (21Feinstein P.G. Schrader K.A. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. Reed R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 1991; 88: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis indicated the presence of all three known Gαi subunits in GH4C1 cells (Fig. 1), although Gαi1 may be the least abundant based on the weakness of the signal. The three Gαi subunits are highly homologous in their coding regions but exhibit a clear variability in their 5′- and 3′-noncoding sequences (19Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To specifically block the protein expression of distinct Gαi subunits, the antisense constructs were chosen to include the full coding sequences and, in addition, 500–800 base pairs of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences (18Albert P.R. Morris S.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Selection for stably transfected clones exhibiting the highest levels of antisense RNA expression was accomplished by raising temporarily the concentration of hygromycin B to 400 μg/ml. The expression of antisense RNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR analysis, using a pair of oligonucleotides specific for each Gαi subunit (not shown). The extent of depletion of distinct Gαi subunits was verified by Western blot analysis, using antibodies specific for each Gαi subunit (22Carlson K.E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13298-13305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Law S.F. Manning D. Reisine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17885-17897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that Gαi1 and Gαi2subunits were virtually eliminated in clones Gi1ZD-3 and Gi1ZD-5 (Fig.1 A) and Gi2ZD-4 and Gi2ZD-5 (Fig. 1 B), respectively, whereas Gαi3 subunits were largely depleted in clones Gi3ZD-3 and Gi3ZD-4 (Fig. 1 C). To examine the extent of cross-hybridization of different Gαi antisense RNAs with sense RNAs of other Gαi subunits, the membranes prepared from different Gαi antisense clones were also probed with antibodies specific for other Gαi and Gαo subunits. In Gαi3-depleted cells, the amount of Gαi1 was similar to the control cells (Fig.1 D), whereas in Gαi1- and Gαi3-depleted clones the amount of Gαi2 or Gαo was unchanged (data not shown). Thus, stable transfection of Gαi antisense constructs can specifically eliminate their cognate Gαi proteins without major alterations in the amount of other Gαi subunits. In previous studies (5Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23689-23697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was found that agonist activation of the transfected 5-HT1A receptor inhibits both cAMP accumulation and calcium entry in GH4ZD10 cells. Similarly, activation of endogenously expressed muscarinic M4 receptors (24Pinkas-Kramarski R. Edelman R. Stein R. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 108: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in GH4ZD10 cells also inhibited both cAMP accumulation and calcium entry (Fig. 2, upper panel, and Table I). These receptor actions were sensitive to PTX treatment (Fig. 2, lower panel), suggesting the involvement of Gi/Go proteins. Muscarinic M4 receptors exhibited greater efficacies than 5-HT1A receptors (Fig. 2 and TableI), although the number of endogenously expressed muscarinic M4 receptors in GH4ZD10 cells is 2–3-fold lower than that of the transfected 5-HT1A receptors (5Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23689-23697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly distinct efficacies were observed for agonist-stimulated GTPase activity by these two receptors in membrane preparations (data not shown), suggesting that in this cellular system, muscarinic M4 receptors couple more effectively to G proteins than do 5-HT1A receptors.Table IEffects of elimination of different Gαi subunits on receptor-mediated inhibition of calcium entryGH4ZD10Gi1ZD-3Gi2ZD-5Gi3ZD-5BayK alone2.41 ± 0.232.50 ± 0.122.51 ± 0.142.48 ± 0.115-HT + BayK 86441.83 ± 0.09aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with BayK 8644 alone.1.80 ± 0.08aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with BayK 8644 alone.1.77 ± 0.06aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with BayK 8644 alone.1.84 ± 0.08aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with BayK 8644 alone.Carbachol + BayK 86441.32 ± 0.06aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with BayK 8644 alone.1.27 ± 0.05aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with BayK 8644 alone.1.21 ± 0.07aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with BayK 8644 alone.1.33 ± 0.04aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with BayK 8644 alone.Data are presented as the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments in which the actions of 5-HT (1 μm) and carbachol (10 μm) on the BayK 8644 (1 μm)-induced increase in [Ca2+]i were measured in GH4ZD10 and various Gαi antisense clones as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are expressed as fold basal level of [Ca2+]i.a Significant difference (p < 0.05) compared with BayK 8644 alone. Open table in a new tab Data are presented as the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments in which the actions of 5-HT (1 μm) and carbachol (10 μm) on the BayK 8644 (1 μm)-induced increase in [Ca2+]i were measured in GH4ZD10 and various Gαi antisense clones as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are expressed as fold basal level of [Ca2+]i. To monitor the roles of each Gαi subunit in coupling of 5-HT1A and muscarinic M4 receptors to inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels, the effects of the receptor agonists, 5-HT and carbachol, on calcium entry induced by the calcium channel opener, BayK 8644, in the different Gαi-depleted clones were examined. In any of the Gαi-depleted clones, both 5-HT1A and muscarinic M4 receptors induced similar inhibition of the BayK 8644-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, as observed in GH4ZD10 cells (Table I). These results indicate that no single class of Gαi subunits is essential for 5-HT1A or muscarinic M4 receptor-mediated closure of calcium channels. The consequence of depletion of distinct Gαi subunits on receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation was examined in unstimulated cells and in cells stimulated by the Gs-coupled VIP receptor. In the control cells, GH4ZD10, 5-HT, and carbachol inhibited both basal and VIP-stimulated cAMP formation (Fig. 2). In contrast to calcium entry, receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP synthesis in the different Gαi-depleted clones was clearly and selectively altered. Specifically, in Gαi1-depleted clones, Gi1ZD-3, both 5-HT and carbachol failed to inhibit basal cAMP production (Fig.3 A). Surprisingly, 5-HT induced a 5-fold increase in basal cAMP accumulation in these cells, an action almost as efficacious as that of VIP. The 5-HT-induced stimulation of basal cAMP accumulation was blocked by PTX pretreatment, suggesting mediation by Gi/Go proteins. This novel stimulatory action of 5-HT on basal cAMP formation was also observed in another Gαi1 depleted clone, Gi1ZD-5 (TableII). In the same Gαi1-depleted cells, however, 5-HT inhibited VIP-stimulated cAMP accumulation by some 45%, similar to the results obtained in GH4ZD10 cells. These data indicate that the presence of Gαi1 subunits is not essential for the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated inhibition of Gs-stimulated cAMP accumulation. In contrast to 5-HT1A receptor action, in both Gi1ZD-3 and Gi1ZD-5 clones, carbachol-induced inhibition of VIP-stimulated cAMP accumulation was blocked (Fig. 3 A).Table IIReceptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation in Gαi-depleted cellsCell linecAMPGH4ZD10BasalVIPControl1.08 ± 0.137.0 ± 1.75-HT0.76 ± 0.09aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the respective control value.3.3 ± 0.47aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the respective control value.Carbachol0.50 ± 0.08aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the respective control value.2.3 ± 0.15aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the respective control value.Gi1ZD-5BasalBasal + PTXVIPControl1.16 ± 0.151.12 ± 0.117.8 ± 1.15-HT4.8 ± 0.76aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the respective control value.1.09 ± 0.084.2 ± 1.0aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the respective control value.Carbachol2.31 ± 0.55aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the respective control value.1.05 ± 0.047.4 ± 0.98Gi2ZD-4BasalVIPVIP + PTXControl1.06 ± 0.157.2 ± 0.457.3 ± 1.05-HT1.08 ± 0.1611.1 ± 1.1aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the respective control value.7.2 ± 1.1Carbachol1.13 ± 0.187.0 ± 0.747.4 ± 1.1Gi3ZD-3BasalBasal + PTXVIPControl1.07 ± 0.101.11 ± 0.118.2 ± 1.15-HT1.12 ± 0.161.17 ± 0.099.2 ± 1.2Carbachol4.3 ± 0.85aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the respective control value.1.14 ± 0.143.3 ± 1.2aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the respective control value.The level of cAMP (pmol/dish) was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 2 in parental GH4ZD10 cells (data from Fig. 2), and the indicated Gαi1-, Gαi2-, and Gαi3 antisense cell lines.

Data averaged from three independent experiments each done in triplicate are presented as the means ± S.D. As observed in Gαi1-depleted clones, the ability of 5-HT1A and muscarinic M4 receptors to inhibit basal cAMP synthesis was also ablated in Gαi2-depleted clones, Gi2ZD-4 (Fig.3 B). In addition, both receptors failed to inhibit VIP-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Activation of 5-HT1A receptors potentiated slightly VIP-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 35%, an action sensitive to PTX treatment. In Gαi3-depleted clone Gi3ZD-3, activation of 5-HT1A or muscarinic M4 receptors did not result in inhibition of basal cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3 C). Curiously, carbachol induced a 3-fold increase in cAMP production in these antisense clones. This stimulation was prevented by PTX pretreatment of the cells. In the same Gαi3-depleted clones, however, the inhibitory action of muscarinic M4 receptors on VIP-stimulated cAMP synthesis remained largely unaltered. In Gi3ZD-4 cells, another Gαi3depleted clone, carbachol-induced inhibition of VIP-stimulated cAMP accumulation was also essentially unaltered (Table II). By contrast, 5-HT1A receptor-induced inhibition of VIP-stimulated cAMP accumulation was completely blocked in Gαi3-depleted cells. The possible mechanism of Gi-mediated stimulation of cAMP production upon depletion of specific Gαi subunits was addressed. Certain AC subtypes (types II, IV, and VII) have been demonstrated biochemically to be conditionally stimulated by Gβγ subunits. In addition AC II is known to mediate Gi-induced stimulation of cAMP levels when co-transfected with specific Gi-coupled receptors, such as the α2-adrenergic receptor (26Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar).

To facilitate the interpretation of disulfide cross-linking data, we initially generated a mutant m3 muscarinic receptor (referred to as m3′(3C)-Xa) in which most native Cys residues had been deleted or substituted with Ala or Ser (remaining Cys residues Cys-140, Cys-220, and Cys-532) and in which the central portion of the third intracellular loop had been replaced with a factor Xa cleavage site. Radioligand binding and second messenger assays showed that the m3′(3C)-Xa mutant receptor was fully functional. In the next step, pairs of Cys residues were reintroduced into the m3′(3C)-Xa construct, thus generating 10 double Cys mutant receptors. All 10 mutant receptors contained a Cys residue at position 169 at the beginning of the second intracellular loop and a second Cys within the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop, at positions 484–493. Radioligand binding studies and phosphatidylinositol assays indicated that all double Cys mutant receptors were properly folded. Membrane lysates prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with the different mutant receptor constructs were incubated with factor Xa protease and the oxidizing agent Cu(II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)3, and the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds between juxtaposed Cys residues was monitored by using a combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting strategy. To our surprise, efficient disulfide cross-linking was observed with 8 of the 10 double Cys mutant receptors studied (Cys-169/Cys-484 to Cys-491), suggesting that the intracellular m3 receptor surface is characterized by pronounced backbone fluctuations. Moreover, [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assays indicated that the formation of intramolecular disulfide cross-links prevented or strongly inhibited receptor-mediated G protein activation, suggesting that the highly dynamic character of the cytoplasmic receptor surface is a prerequisite for efficient receptor-G protein interactions.

This is the first study using a disulfide mapping strategy to examine the three-dimensional structure of a hormone-activated G protein-coupled receptor. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptors; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; HA tag, hemagglutinin epitope tag; i1–i4, the four intracellular domains of GPCRs; IP1, inositol monophosphate; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; NMS, N-methylscopolamine; o1–o4, the four extracellular domains of GPCRs; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, phosphatidylinositol; SDSL, site-directed spin labeling; TM I-VII, the seven transmembrane domains of GPCRs; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. form one of the largest protein families found in nature, and current estimates are that approximately one thousand different such receptors exist in mammals (1Watson S. Arkinstall S. Watson S. Arkinstall S. The G-Protein-linked Receptor-Facts Book. Academic Press, London1994: 1-291Google Scholar). Despite the remarkable structural diversity of their activating ligands, all GPCRs are predicted to share a common molecular architecture consisting of seven transmembrane helices (TM I–VII) linked by alternating intracellular (i1–i3) and extracellular (o2–o4) loops (Fig. 1). Whereas residues located on the extracellular receptor surface are known to be involved in ligand binding, the cytoplasmic receptor surface is critical for G protein recognition and activation (2Dohlman H.G.

At present, high resolution structural information is not available for any GPCR, primarily due to the difficulties of studying integral membrane proteins by biophysical techniques such as NMR spectroscopy or x-ray crystallography. However, guided by low-resolution projection density maps of bovine (7Schertler G.F.X. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) and frog (8Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) rhodopsin obtained by electron cryo-microscopy and structural information gathered from the analysis of approximately 500 different GPCRs, Baldwin and coworkers (9Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 10Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) have generated a model for the α-carbon positions in TM I–VII of GPCRs of the rhodopsin family. This model is consistent with the results of a great number of mutagenesis and biochemical studies (10Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 11Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 12Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Whereas the relative positions of the amino acids located within the transmembrane receptor core of GPCRs can be predicted with a relatively high degree of certainty, much less is known about the structural characteristics of the intracellular receptor surface predicted to be involved in G protein coupling. To gain insight into the molecular architecture of the cytoplasmic receptor regions, NMR and circular dichroism studies have been carried out with peptides derived from distinct intracellular GPCR domains (13Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D.

Such studies have shown, for example, that the i1–i4 regions of the photoreceptor, rhodopsin, can adopt defined structures in solution (13Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14621-14625Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Salloum A.C. Ali L. Albert A.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3864-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, whether the isolated peptides fold in a fashion similar to that found in the native receptor and how the different intracellular domains are arranged relative to each other in the full-length receptor. Thus, additional experimental strategies need to be applied to gain deeper insight into the three-dimensional arrangement of the cytoplasmic GPCR domains. One such approach, referred to as “site-directed disulfide mapping,” involves the ability of two Cys residues that are adjacent to each other in the three-dimensional structure of a protein to form disulfide bonds, either spontaneously or upon application of oxidizing conditions. This strategy has been successfully employed, for example, to elucidate key structural features of several bacterial chemoreceptors (18Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 19Lynch B.A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since these proteins form homodimers, disulfide cross-linked homodimers could be detected by their specific migration patterns on SDS gels (non-reducing conditions). Recently, a similar strategy has also been used to study the assembly of the photoreceptor, rhodopsin (22Yu H. Kono M. McKee T.D. Oprian D.D.

Cross-linking between juxtaposed Cys residues located on different receptor fragments (following site-specific Cys mutagenesis) was again monitored via SDS-PAGE (22Yu H. Kono M. McKee T.D.

These investigators took advantage of two native protease cleavage sites present in the i3 and i4 regions of rhodopsin, allowing the monitoring of disulfide bond formation by studying changes in the electrophoretic mobility of oxidized, protease-treated receptors on SDS gels (24Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 25Yang K. Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

A. 1997; 94: 14267-14272Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At present, rhodopsin is the only GPCR that has been subjected to site-directed disulfide cross-linking studies, primarily due to the fact that rhodopsin can be expressed at very high levels in cultured cells, can be readily purified with high yields, and can be assayed functionally by spectrophotometry in a straightforward manner. To examine whether the results of disulfide cross-linking studies obtained with the photoreceptor, rhodopsin, are of broad general relevance, we decided to develop a site-directed disulfide mapping approach that can also be applied to other classes of GPCRs. In the present study, we used a member of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family, the rat m3 muscarinic receptor subtype (34Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 35Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), as a model system. To facilitate the interpretation of disulfide cross-linking data, we initially generated a modified version of the m3 muscarinic receptor (m3′(3C)) in which most native Cys residues (except for Cys-140, Cys-220, and Cys-532) were deleted (Cys residues located within the central portion of the i3 loop) or replaced with Ala or Ser (Fig. 1 and Table I). In the next step, a protease (factor Xa) cleavage site was introduced into the i3 loop of the m3′(3C) construct, yielding the m3′(3C)-Xa mutant receptor. Radioligand binding and second messenger assays showed that the m3′(3C)-Xa mutant receptor was fully functional.Table IStructure of mutant m3 muscarinic receptors investigated in this studyReceptoraNumbers in parentheses indicate the number of remaining Cys residues.Structural modificationm3(wt)HA tagbThe HA epitope tag (see text for details) was introduced after the initiating methionine codon.

Open table in a new tab See text and Fig. 1 for further details. As mentioned above, our knowledge about the structural organization of the intracellular surface of GPCRs is still rather limited. We therefore decided to focus our disulfide scanning analysis on the arrangement of the intracellular regions of the m3′(3C)-Xa mutant receptor. This initial study was designed to define the spatial relationship between residues located at the N terminus of the i2 loop and the C-terminal segment of the i3 domain, two receptor regions known to be critically involved in receptor/G protein recognition and activation (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 3Kobilka B. Annu. Rev.

By using the m3′(3C)-Xa mutant receptor as a template, we generated a total of 10 double Cys mutants. All 10 mutant receptors contained a Cys residue at position 169 at the beginning of the i2 loop (Fig. 1). A second Cys residue was introduced within a receptor segment located at the junction between the i3 loop and TM VI (Fig. 1), by individually replacing amino acids 484–493 with Cys. The mutant receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells, and the ability of juxtaposed Cys residues to form disulfide bonds was then studied using a combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting strategy, involving the use of the oxidizing agent Cu(II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)3 (hereafter Cu(II)-phenanthroline) and factor Xa protease. In addition, the functional consequences of disulfide cross-linking were examined in [35S]GTPγS binding studies. Our results are consistent with the notion that the intracellular surface of the m3 muscarinic receptor is highly dynamic and that this high degree of conformational flexibility is essential for efficient receptor/G protein coupling. Carbamoylcholine chloride (carbachol), acetylcholine chloride, atropine sulfate, copper sulfate, 1,10-phenanthroline, and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B were purchased from Sigma. N-[3H]Methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS; 79 Ci/mmol), myo-[3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol), and [35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. All enzymes used for molecular cloning were obtained from New England Biolabs. Other sources of reagents were as follows: 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), factor Xa (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm) were obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. All other chemicals used for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were purchased from Bio-Rad. All mutations were introduced into Rm3pcD-N-HA (also referred to as m3(wt); Table I), a mammalian expression plasmid coding for the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (35Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) containing a 9-amino acid hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) at the N terminus (30Schöneberg T. Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Most native Cys residues were replaced, in a sequential fashion, with either Ala or Ser, by using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis techniques (36Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 and Table I). To eliminate the three Cys residues (Cys-289, Cys-310, and Cys-419) located within the i3 loop, the central portion of the i3 loop (amino acids Ala-274 to Lys-469) was deleted, as described by Maggio et al. (37Maggio R. Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31055-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, in two of the mutant receptors (m3′(3C) and m3′(3C)-Xa; see Table I), the five N-terminal Asn residues that are predicted to serve as targets forN-linked glycosylation (Asn-6, Asn-15, Asn-41, Asn-48, and Asn-52; Fig. 1) were simultaneously replaced with Gln residues, using a two-step polymerase chain reaction procedure. Three factor Xa cleavage sites ((IEGR)3, triple direct repeat) were introduced into the i3 loop, between Glu-273 and Thr-470, of the m3′(3C) mutant receptor in which Cys-140, Cys-220, and Cys-532 were the only remaining Cys residues (Table I and Fig. 1). The resulting construct was referred to as m3′(3C)-Xa throughout this study. Single Cys residues were reintroduced into m3′(3C)-Xa at positions Ile-169 and Lys-484 to Ser-493, by using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double Cys mutants (in the m3′(3C)-Xa background) were obtained by subcloning a 0.4-kilobase pair BstxI-SacI fragment derived from the mutant m3′(3C)-Xa constructs containing a Cys substitution within the Lys-484 to Ser-493 sequence into the m3′(3C)-Xa construct containing the additional I169C point mutation. The identity of all mutant constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For transfections, 1 × 106 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes. About 24 h later, cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA/dish by using the LipofectAMINETM Plus kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For radioligand binding studies, transfected cells were harvested about 70 h after transfections. Binding assays were carried out with membrane homogenates prepared from transfected cells essentially as described (38Dörje F. Wess J. Lambrecht G. Tacke R. Mutschler E. Brann M.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 256: 727-733PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out for 2–3 h at room temperature in a 0.5-ml volume. Binding buffer consisted of 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 5 mm MgCl2. In [3H]NMS saturation binding assays, six to eight different concentrations (15–2,000 pm) of the radioligand were employed. In competition binding studies, a fixed concentration of [3H]NMS (200 pm) and seven different concentrations (0.01–10 mm) of the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, were used. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm atropine. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least square curve-fitting procedures, using the computer program LIGAND (saturation binding data; Ref. 39Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) or KALEIDAGRAPH (competition binding data; Synergy software), respectively. Transfected COS-7 cells were transferred into 6-well plates (approximately 0.5 × 105 cells/well) about 24 h after transfections, and 3 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol was added to the growth medium. On the following day (20–24 h later), the labeled cells were washed once with 2 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES and then incubated for 20 min (at room temperature) with 1 ml of the same medium containing 10 mmLiCl. Subsequently, different concentrations of carbachol were added, and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After removal of the medium, reactions were terminated by addition of 0.75 ml of 20 mm formic acid, followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C. Samples were then neutralized with 0.25 ml of 60 mmammonium hydroxide, and the inositol monophosphate (IP1) fraction was isolated by anion exchange chromatography as described (40Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar) and counted on an LKB liquid scintillation counter. COS-7 cells were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and collected by centrifugation about 70 h after transfections. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.2% digitonin in PBS, followed by a 20-min incubation on ice. After centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min, supernatants containing soluble as well as peripheral membrane proteins were discarded. Cell pellets were treated with lysis buffer (1% digitonin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2) at 4 °C for 1 h. Cell lysates were then centrifuged in a refrigerated Eppendorf 5417R microcentrifuge at maximal speed for 30 min. Supernatants containing solubilized receptors were used either directly for factor Xa digestion or stored at −80 °C. Membrane extracts (100 μl/100-mm dish) were incubated with 5 μg of factor Xa at room temperature (22 °C) for up to 16 h. Reactions were terminated by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration). Factor Xa-digested membrane extracts were incubated with Cu(II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)3 complex (final concentration, 50 μm), by adding a freshly prepared aqueous mixture of equal volumes of 1 mm CuSO4 and 3 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. Reactions were carried out on ice for 30 min in a 0.1-ml volume and terminated by the addition of 10 mm EDTA and 10 mm NEM (final concentrations) for further experiments (see below) or by adding an equal volume of 2-fold Laemmli sample buffer containing 25 mm NEM and 20 mm EDTA for SDS-PAGE. To monitor the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds in the different double Cys mutant receptors, factor Xa- and Cu(II)-phenanthroline-treated membrane lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by the anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. To eliminate non-covalent interactions between the N- and C-terminal receptor fragments generated by digestion of the solubilized receptors with factor Xa (referred to as m3-trunk and m3-tail, respectively), samples were incubated with 2.0% SDS at 37 °C for 1 h prior to immunoprecipitation. This step ensured that m3-tail fragments were coimmunoprecipitated by the anti-HA antibody only when cross-linked to m3-trunk fragments via disulfide bonds. Following the addition of PBS (containing 0.2% BSA) to reduce the SDS concentration to 0.1%, samples were incubated with the anti-HA antibody under rotation for at least 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% digitonin and once with PBS, incubated with Laemmli sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature for 30 min, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the anti-C-m3 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1) to detect the presence of the m3-tail fragment. SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2-fold concentrated Laemmli sample buffer (composition, 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 100 mm DTT (only if indicated), 4% SDS, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, proteins were resolved on 12% (w/v) acrylamide slab gels in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm) as described (42Burnette W.N.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains distinct SSA and SSBgene families of cytosolic Hsp70s. The nucleocytoplasmic localization of Ssa1p and Ssb1p was investigated using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions. Whereas GFP-Ssa1p localized both to the nucleus and cytoplasm, GFP-Ssb1p appeared only in the cytosol. The C-terminal domain of Ssb1p contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) that is necessary and sufficient to direct nuclear export. The accumulation of GFP-Ssb1p in the nuclei ofxpo1-1 cells suggests that Ssb1p shuttles across the nuclear envelope. Elevated levels of SSA1 but not SSB1 suppressed the NLS-GFP nuclear localization defects of nup188-Δ cells. Studies with Ssa1p/Ssb1p chimeras revealed that the Ssb1p NES is sufficient and necessary to inhibit the function of Ssa- or Ssb-type Hsp70s in nuclear transport. Thus, NES-less Ssb1p stimulates nuclear transport innup188-Δ cells and NES-containing Ssa1p does not. We conclude that the differential function of Ssa1p and Ssb1p in nuclear transport is due to the NES-directed export of the Ssb1p and not to functional differences in their ATPase or peptide binding domains.

The import of proteins into nuclei is mediated by soluble nuclear localization signal (NLS) 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; Kap α and β, karyopherin α and β; NES, nuclear export signal; GFP, green fluorescent protein. receptors. SV40 large T-antigen-like NLSs are bound in the cytoplasm by karyopherin α (Kap α), which serves as an adapter to link NLS-cargo to karyopherin β (Kap β). Kap β mediates docking at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (1Mattaj I.W. Englemeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a single Kap α gene encoded bySRP1. Translocation of the NLS-cargo-Kap α/β ternary complex occurs through the central channel of the nuclear pore complex. Once in the nucleus, the NLS-cargo dissociates and Kap α and β are recycled to the cytoplasm (1Mattaj I.W. Englemeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 2Gorlich D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Only a portion of the cellular import traffic is mediated by Kap α/β heterodimers. Other classes of NLS-cargo, for example shuttling pre-mRNA binding proteins that display M9-type import signals (3Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), are transported by Kap β-like factors that bind directly to cognate NLS-cargo without the aid of Kap α adapters (1Mattaj I.W.

Hsp70/Hsc70s (collectively referred to here as Hsp70s) are conserved molecular chaperones that participate in a variety of cellular functions, including protein folding and transport and the repair of stress-induced damage (5Morimoto R.I.

Hsp70s are composed of a 44-kDa N-terminal ATPase domain, an 18-kDa peptide binding domain, and a C-terminal 10-kDa variable domain of unknown function (8Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B.

Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae contains two families of cytosolic Hsp70 genes,SSA1-4 and SSB1-2 (10Craig E.A. Jacobsen K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Craig E.A. Ziegelhoffer T. Nelson J. Laloray S. Halladay J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The yeast Ssa-type Hsp70s are similar to the cytosolic Hsp70s found in other organisms including bacteria. To date, Ssb-type Hsp70s have been identified only in fungi. In S. cerevisiae, Ssb1 and Ssb2 are associated with translating ribosomes and can be cross-linked to nascent polypeptides (12Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 13Pfund C. Lopez-Hoyo N. Ziegelhoffer T.

Hsp70s have been proposed to function in NLS-directed nuclear transport by promoting the formation and stability of NLS-cargo-Kap α complexes (reviewed in Refs. 1Mattaj I.W. Englemeier L. Annu. Rev.

Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, the ectopic expression of human Hsp70 in mouse cells rescued the import of a protein carrying a mutant NLS (16Jeoung D.-I. Chen S. Windsor J. Pollack R.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2235-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Conversely, the elevated expression of SSA1in yeast suppressed a transport defect in srp1–31 cells (15Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Microinjected antibodies against Hsc70 inhibited NLS-directed import (17Imamoto N. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Khono K. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Okada Y. Tsunasawa S. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the depletion of Hsp70 from cytosolic extracts inhibited import in cell-free assays (18Shi Y. Thomas J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2186-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 19Okuno Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Yang J. DeFranco D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5088-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Finally, the finding that the nuclear localization of Hsp70 is itself dependent on the co-import of NLS-cargo (19Okuno Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) suggests that Hsp70 is imported in association with the NLS-cargo-Kap α/β ternary complex. In the present study we delineate a functional nuclear export signal (NES) in the C-terminal domain of Ssb1p and show that it is responsible both for the different subcellular localizations of Ssa1p and Ssb1p and for their differential function in NLS-directed nuclear transport. Except where noted, all yeast strains used in this study were based in a W303 (strain WHY12) genetic background (MAT a ade2-1 leu2-3, 112 his3-11,and 15 trp1-1 ura3-1 can1-100). Construction of strains containingnup188-Δ (21Nehrbass U. Rout M.P. Maguire S. Blobel G. Wozniak R. J.

Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) were previously described. Chimeras that divided the ATPase domain into two halves according to crystal structure (8Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) were constructed using anEagI site introduced by polymerase chain reaction at the gene sequence corresponding to amino acid 177 in Ssa1p and amino acid 181 in Ssb1p. A BamHI site introduced by polymerase chain reaction at the N terminus of Ssa1 and Ssb1 was used to clone the chimeras into pCUG2, placing them under GAL1 control. pCUG2 was constructed by inserting a 690-base pairEcoRI/BamHI fragment containing theGAL1/GAL10 promoter into the pRS316 (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pGFP-N-FUS plasmid (28Niedenthal R.K. Rihs L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), containing the MET25 promoter and GFP, was used to express GFP-Sssa1p/Ssb1p fusions for localization studies. In pGFP-pA-Ca/Cb plasmids, protein A synthetic analog, the so-called Z-domain (29Nilsson B. Moks T. Jansson B. Abrahmsen L. Elmblad A. Holmgren E. Henrichson C. Jones T.A. Uhlen M. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), was inserted between the GFP and C-terminal sequences of SSA1 and SSB1. Appropriate cloning sites were created by high fidelity polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments and vector junctions in completed plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Standard complete or selective synthetic media were used as described (30Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). NLS-GFP kinetic import assays were performed as described (15Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as indicated in the text. For heat shock, cells grown at 30 °C were pelleted, resuspended in 39 °C pre-warmed medium, and incubated at 39 °C for 1 h. Control cells were resuspended in 30 °C pre-warmed medium and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Induction of protein expression from pGAL1 vectors was achieved by resuspending glucose-grown cells in synthetic medium containing 2% galactose and incubating in a shaking water bath at 30 °C for 2 h. Only fresh exponentially growing cultures were used for fluorescence microscopy study. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus BH-2 microscope, and pictures were taken with a mounted Olympus C-35AD-2 camera. Kodak TMAX 400 film was processed with TMAX developer, Indicator stop bath, and Rapid fixer (Eastman Kodak Co.). Confocal images were obtained with a Leica TCS NT microscope, and digital images were processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA). The subcellular localization of Ssa1p and Ssb1p was determined using GFP fusions. GFP-Ssa1p and GFP-Ssb1p fusion proteins were expressed from aMET25 inducible promoter in WHY12 cells and localized by confocal microscopy. As expected, both Hsp70s were localized in the cytoplasm, but only GFP-Ssa1p accumulated to any significant degree in the nuclei (Fig.1). Both fusions were excluded from vacuoles. The localization of GFP-Ssa1p in both the cytoplasm and nucleus is consistent with the distribution of Ssa-type Hsp70s in other eukaryotes (31Velazquez J.M. Lindquist S. Cell. 1984; 36: 655-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 32Milarski K.L. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1947-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, the exclusive cytoplasmic localization of GFP-Ssb1p is unique among known cytosolic Hsp70s. A feature of the stress response in many eukaryotes is the migration of cytoplasmic Ssa-type Hsp70s from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where they accumulate to high levels (32Milarski K.L. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1947-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3095-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To determine whether this phenomenon occurs in S. cerevisiae, the localization of GFP-Ssa1p and GFP-Ssb1p was observed following heat shock treatment. After a 60-min heat shock treatment, nuclear GFP-Ssa1p levels increased, relative to cytoplasmic levels, but not to a great extent (Fig. 1). Heat shock had no detectable affect on the localization of GFP-Ssb1p (Fig. 1). Hsp70s, including Ssa1p and Ssb1p, can be divided into three structural domains: a 44-kDa ATPase domain, an 18-kDa peptide binding domain, and a 10-kDa C-terminal variable domain (Fig.2 A). The ATPase domain can be further divided into two subdomains (8Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). We constructed chimeric genes containing a mixture of Ssa and Ssb structural domains, most of which are designated by a three-letter code (Ref. 26James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar and this study). For example, “ABA” contains the Ssa ATPase domain, the Ssb peptide binding domain, and the Ssa C-terminal domain. Chimeras that contain subdivided ATPase domains are designated, for example, “(AB)AA” or “(BA)AA.” Chimeras that lack particular domains are designated “-AA,” which, in this example, lacks an ATPase domain. For the purpose of localization studies, each chimera was expressed as a GFP fusion protein. GFP was not fused to the Hsp70 constructs for the purpose of functional studies (see below). Localization of the various GFP-Ssa1p/Ssb1p chimeras was determined by conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy, and the fluorescence in cells was scored as being either equally distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm (N = C), exclusively cytoplasmic (N ≪ C), or significantly more concentrated in the nuclei (N > C) (Fig. 2,B and C). These data indicate that the Ssb1p C-terminal domain is responsible for the low nuclear levels of GFP-Ssb1p. Thus, ABB, (AB)BB, (BA)BB, AAB, BAB, and -BB all showed background levels of nuclear staining. In contrast, (AB)AA, BAA, (BA)AA, ABA, and BBA localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 2 B). The localizations of selected chimeras are shown in Fig. 2 C. Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts expressing these GFP fusion proteins indicates that they are stable (data not shown). In addition to these data, GFP fused to AA- and BB- localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 2 B). It is worth noting here that a previous study (34Mandell R.B. Feldherr C.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) implicated the C terminus of rat Hsc70 in its bidirectional trafficking. To determine whether the Ssb1p C terminus can function autonomously to prevent nuclear accumulation, Ssa1p (“Ca”) and Ssb1p (“Cb”) C-terminal domains were fused to the C terminus of a GFP-protein A (GFP-pA) reporter protein (Fig.3 A) and localized in cells by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3 B). Whereas GFP-pA-Ca (53 kDa) localized both to the nucleus and the cytoplasm, GFP-pA-Cb (51 kDa) did not stain the nuclei (Fig. 3 B). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that these fusions were stable in vivo (not shown). We conclude that the C terminus of Ssb1p can function autonomously to prevent nuclear localization. The Ssb1p C terminus could function either as a cytoplasmic retention sequence to exclude Ssb1p from the nucleus or as a NES to direct the export of any Ssb1p that reaches the nucleus. The minimal Ssb1p C-terminal sequence necessary to prevent nuclear localization was delineated by truncation and deletion analysis of a GFP-Ssb1p reporter protein (Fig. 3 C). These results point to a short sequence that contains a match to the consensus sequence for leucine-rich NESs (35Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 36Zhang M.J. Dayton A.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Ssb1p homologs from other fungi also contain this NES motif (Fig. 3 C). An in vivo assay for NES function based on the approach of Fritz and Green (37Fritz C.C. Green M.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 848-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was developed in the Wente laboratory (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and was generously provided to us prior to publication. In this assay, HIS3 is transcribed only when a plasmid-borne transcriptional activator, composed of the LexA DNA binding domain and the pseudorabies activation domain, is expressed in the nucleus. Cells that express this activator grow on medium lacking histidine (Fig.4). When HIV-1 Rev or Gle1p NESs were inserted between the LexA and pseudorabies domains, the cells failed to grow on selective medium (Fig. 4), presumably because the activator was exported before it could activate HIS3 transcription. Cells expressing an activator with a mutant Rev NES grew well on selective medium (Fig. 4). Significantly, cells expressing activators containing the entire C-terminal domain of Ssb1p (amino acids 546–613), or just the putative NES (amino acids 574–587), failed to grow on selective medium (Fig. 4). These data support the hypothesis that Ssb1p residues 574–587 function as a NES. The export of leucine-rich NES-cargo is mediated by a Kap β-like protein called exportin, encoded in yeast byXPO1/CRM1 (21Nehrbass U. Rout M.P. Maguire S. Blobel G. Wozniak R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). xpo1-1cells exhibit reduced NES-directed export at nonpermissive temperatures. For example, a protein kinase inhibitor NES-GFP-NLS fusion protein, which is normally efficiently exported from nuclei, becomes almost exclusively nuclear in xpo1-1cells shifted to 37 °C (22Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Fig. 5shows the localization of GFP-Ssb1p in XPO1 andxpo1-1 cells following a shift from 30° to 40 °C. GFP-Ssb1p was exclusively cytoplasmic in XPO1cells after 60 min at 40 °C. In contrast, GFP-Ssb1p fluorescence appeared in the nuclei of xpo1-1 cells within 20 min at 40 °C and became equilibrated across the nuclear envelope within 60 min (Fig. 5). As expected, the GFP-Ssb1p was exclusively cytoplasmic in xpo1-1 cells carryingXPO1 on a plasmid (Fig. 5). We conclude that Ssb1p is exported from nuclei in a Xpo1p-dependent fashion. The accumulation of GFP-Ssb1p in the nuclei of xpo1-1cells at a nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 5, panels F andI) indicates that Ssb1p normally shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. NLS-GFP is a small nuclear reporter protein that can be used to monitor nuclear transport kinetics in wild-type and mutant yeast cells using method proposed before (15Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). nup188-Δ cells, which are morphologically normal and double at wild-type rates (not shown), accumulate abnormally high cytoplasmic levels of NLS-GFP (Fig.6 A, panel B). We previously showed that the NLS-GFP import defect ofsrp1-31 cells was suppressed either by heat shock or the induction of GAL1-SSA1. As shown in Fig.6 A, panel D, the induction ofGAL1-SSA1 expression also suppressed the steady state NLS-GFP localization defect of nup188-Δ cells. In contrast, induction of GAL1-SSB1 did not suppress the steady state nup188-Δ defect (Fig. 6 A,panel F). The level of Hsp70 gene expression under these conditions was determined by immunoblot using specific polyclonal antibodies (26James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and revealed that the concentration of Hsp70s increased 3–4-fold following GAL1 induction (data not shown). TheSSA1 induction upon heat shock was comparable withGAL1-SSA1 induction (data not shown). The effects of heat shock and GAL1-SSA1 expression on NLS-GFP re-import kinetics in nup188-Δ cells grown at 30 °C and assayed at 37 °C are shown in Fig. 6 B. NLS-GFP import in NUP188 cells proceeded rapidly and to virtual completion within 5 min. In contrast, NLS-GFP import innup188-Δ cells proceeded with biphasic kinetics, beginning with a “burst” phase, during which 20–40% of the cells rapidly accumulated NLS-GFP, followed by a slower quasi-plateau phase (see Fig.6C). We do not know whether the biphasic nature of these kinetics are a property of all nup188-Δ mutated cells or, alternatively, indicate the presence of different cell populations, perhaps differing in their Hsp70 content. nup188-Δ cells that were heat-shocked, or GAL1-SSA1-expressing cells, showed wild-type import kinetics (Fig. 6 B). The induction ofGAL1-SSB1 expression in nup188-Δ cells resulted in a slight, but reproducible, increase in the fraction of cells showing good import during the burst phase (Fig. 6B). nup188-Δ cells grown at 37 °C showed better nuclear accumulation of NLS-GFP than cells grown at 30 °C (not shown). 37 °C is a heat shock temperature, and cells grown at this temperature contain high levels of Ssa-type Hsp70s (17Imamoto N. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Khono K. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Okada Y. Tsunasawa S. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For this reason we extended the 37 °C NLS-GFP import time course to allow for the full development of a heat shock response. An extended 37 °C time course revealed that after the initial burst phase NLS-GFP nuclear accumulation continued slowly until virtually all of the cells in the culture showed good nuclear localization (Fig. 6 C). The duration of the slow phase roughly corresponds to the rate at which Hsp70 accumulates in cells during heat shock. When assayed at 30 °C, which is not a heat shock temperature, the kinetics of NLS-GFP import began with a burst but quickly reached a plateau of between 20–40% nuclear cells that was stable for at least 3 h (not shown). These results suggest that the slow increase in NLS-GFP nuclear localization at 37 °C is the result of the heat shock induction of Ssa-type Hsp70 gene expression. We conclude that elevated levels of Ssa1p are sufficient to suppress both the steady state and kinetic NLS-GFP localization defects of nup188-Δ cells. The efficient NES-directed export of Ssb1p could provide a basis for the inability of Ssb1p to suppress the NLS-GFP nuclear localization defect in nup188-Δ cells. To test this hypothesis we assayed NLS-GFP import kinetics in nup188-Δ cells expressing various Ssa1p/Ssb1p chimeras and plotted the “% nuclear cells” after a 15-min re-import (Fig.7). The Ssa1p/Ssb1p chimeras for this functional analysis were not fused to GFP. As shown in Fig. 7, the expression of chimeras containing the C terminus of Ssb1p (BBB, ABB, and AAB) failed to suppress the NLS-GFP localization defect. In contrast, chimeras containing the C terminus of Ssa1p (AAA, BAA, and BBA), and truncations of Ssa1p and Ssb1p lacking either C-terminal domain (AA- and BB-), suppressed the nup188-Δ NLS-GFP import defect. We conclude that the C-terminal domain of Ssb1p, which contains a functional NES, is a dominant inhibitor of Hsp70 function in NLS-directed nuclear transport. Together with the GFP-Ssa1p/Ssb1p localization data shown in Fig. 2 B, these experiments demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the steady state nuclear localization of Hsp70 and its functions in NLS-directed nuclear transport. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Hsp70 in NLS-directed nuclear transport and, more specifically, to elucidate the molecular basis for the differential function of Ssa- and Ssb-type Hsp70s. We conclude that an NES in the divergent 8 kDa C-terminal domain of Ssb1p is necessary and sufficient for the low nuclear levels of Ssb1p and for its inability to stimulate NLS-directed nuclear transport. Therefore, the differential function of Ssa1p and Ssb1p in nuclear transport is due to the NES-directed export of the Ssb1p and not to functional differences in their ATPase or peptide binding domains. Previous work showed that certain Ssa1p/Ssb1p chimeras, containing either the ATPase or peptide binding domains of Ssa1p, could rescue phenotypes associated with the double deletion ofSSB1 and SSB2 (26James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, Ssa1p domains can function in Ssb1p-mediated processes. Here, we show that the peptide binding and ATPase domains of Ssb1p can function in a Ssa1p-mediated process. This is not to say that Ssa1p can replace Ssb1p functionin vivo or vice versa. There are no known examples in which one class of Hsp70 can completely replace the function of a second class. Although a truncated Ssb1p that lacks its NES still functions in nuclear transport, it could not rescue the depletion of all fourSSA gene products. In this regard, yeast mitochondrial Hsp70, loaded into reconstituted endoplasmic reticulum vesicles, could not replace endoplasmic reticulum Hsp70 in an in vitroprotein secretion assay (39Brodsky J.L. Bauerle M. Horst M. McClellan A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The inability of mitochondrial Hsp70 to function in BiP-mediated secretion was attributed to the inability of mitochondrial Hsp70 to associate productively with Sec63p, a BiP-specific DnaJ co-chaperone (39Brodsky J.L. Bauerle M. Horst M. McClellan A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The possible role of Hsp70 co-chaperones in nuclear transport has not been explored. The very existence of the Ssb1p NES, and the accumulation of GFP-Ssb1p in the nuclei of xpo1-1 cells, suggests that Ssb1p normally shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Although Ssa-type Hsp70s have previously been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in Xenopus oocytes (40Mandell R.B. Feldherr C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), Ssb-type Hsp70s have been assumed to function exclusively in the cytoplasm (12Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar,13Pfund C. Lopez-Hoyo N. Ziegelhoffer T. Schilke B.A. Lopez-Buesa P. Walter W.A. Wiedmann M. Craig E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These new results suggest that Ssb1p may function in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm. A 2–3-fold increase in cellular Ssa1p levels suppressed the kinetic and steady state NLS-GFP nuclear localization defects of nup188-Δ cells. The severity of thenup188-Δ defect, and its complete suppression, provided a clean, specific in vivo assay for Hsp70 function in nuclear transport. The NLS-GFP nuclear transport defects of strains containing temperature-conditional mutations in other transport factors, specifically srp1-31 andnup82-3 cells (15Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), were also suppressed byGAL1-SSA1 induction, but these defects are less severe and are not, therefore, ideally suited to quantification. The present analysis is restricted to the role of Hsp70 in the import of SV40-type NLSs and does not address the potential involvement, or lack thereof, of Hsp70 in the transport of other classes of import or export cargo (4Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effects of GAL1-SSA1 induction on NLS-GFP import suggest that Hsp70 functions by stimulating at least one rate-limiting step along the nuclear import pathway. This result implies that the concentration of Ssa-type Hsp70s under non-stress conditions is normally limiting for nuclear transport and thatGAL1-SSA1 or stress induction generates an incipient pool of Hsp70 that is available to interact with the nuclear transport apparatus. Under stress conditions in higher eukaryotes, cytosolic pools of Hsp70 are recruited into the nucleus (31Velazquez J.M. Lindquist S. Cell. 1984; 36: 655-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 33Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3095-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to an increase of Hsp70 levels as a result of new synthesis, there is an additive increase in nuclear levels because of compartment redistribution. In yeast, we observed a minor but reproducible increase in relative nuclear GFP-Ssa1p fluorescence following heat shock. Although this result is consistent with a minor redistribution of Hsp70 in yeast, it is possible that under heat shock conditions nuclear levels remained constant and only appeared to increase because cytoplasmic levels decreased through turnover. It is not known whether Hsp70 is absolutely required for the import of NLS-cargo or, alternatively, whether it functions as an enhancer of nuclear transport efficiency. Although the literature is undecided on this issue, a strict requirement for Hsp70 in the nuclear transport of selected NLS-cargo was demonstrated using isolated nuclei and permeabilized cell assays, under which circumstances endogenous Hsp70 levels can be more or less completely depleted (17Imamoto N. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Khono K. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Okada Y. Tsunasawa S. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Shi Y. Thomas J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2186-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 19Okuno Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Yang J. DeFranco D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5088-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The localization of GFP-Ssa1p to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm is consistent with a large body of evidence on the localization of Ssa-type Hsp70s in a variety of organisms and cells. The exclusive cytoplasmic localization of GFP-Ssb1p is unique for non-organelle Hsp70s. A technical weakness in this analysis of Hsp70 localization is its reliance on the use of GFP fusions, which could produce localization artifacts. The validity of the GFP fusion localization results reported here, however, have been corroborated by two lines of evidence. First, the ability of various Ssa1p/Ssb1p chimeras and truncations to suppress thenup188-Δ NLS-GFP nuclear localization defect is correlated perfectly with the localization of the GFP-Ssa1/Ssb1 chimeras. Those chimeras that localized to nuclei suppressed the transport defect, whereas the chimeras that failed to suppress the transport defect also failed to accumulate in nuclei. It is essential to note that the functional assays were performed with Ssa1p/Ssb1p chimeras that were not fused to GFP. Second, the key finding of the GFP-based localization studies was the existence of the Ssb1p leucin-rich NES, which in other experiments was shown to function as an NES out of the context of a GFP fusion protein. Both genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that Ssb1p and Ssb2p are functionally interchangeable and have primary roles in protein synthesis (13Pfund C. Lopez-Hoyo N. Ziegelhoffer T. Schilke B.A. Lopez-Buesa P. Walter W.A. Wiedmann M. Craig E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 41Craig E.A. Baxter B.K. Becker J. Halladay J. Ziegelhoffer T. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 31-52Google Scholar). A large fraction of Ssbp co-sediments with translating ribosomes, and Δssb1 Δssb2 cells are cold- and hygromycin B-sensitive (12Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Why then does Ssb1p contain an NES? The presence of an NES in a cytoplasmic protein suggests that the protein shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and, more interestingly, has a nuclear function. The Ssb1p NES is not required for any known Ssb1p function. An Ssa1p/Ssb1p chimera containing the ATPase and peptide binding domains of Ssb1p and the Ssa1p C-terminal domain, and hence lacking the NES, rescued both Δssb1Δssb2 phenotypes (26James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This experiment did not, however, prevent access of Ssb1p to the nucleus. Ssb1p could serve any number of functions in the nucleus, a few of which are mentioned here. Because Ssb1p associates with ribosomes (12Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and Ssa-type Hsp70s have been observed to localize in the nucleus preferentially to the nucleolus, it is possible that Ssb1p functions in some aspect of ribosome biogenesis. SSB1 was identified in a high copy number screen for suppressors of a mutation in a proteasome subunit (42Ohba M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 43Ohba M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, Ssb1p may participate in proteasome-mediated protein degradation. The proteasome complex is localized both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (44Rivett A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), so it is possible that Ssb1p interacts transiently with a nuclear proteasome pool. In mammalian cells, a link between the heat shock response and proteasome activity has been noted. Specifically, the expression of a transcriptional regulator of the heat shock response, HSF2, is activated in response to proteasome inhibitors (38Mathew A. Mathur S.K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5091-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Hsp70 has also been implicated in the autoregulation of the heat shock response in mammalian cells. Both Hsp70 and the co-chaperone Hdj1p bind Hsf1p and together repress heat shock gene transcription (45Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). By analogy, Ssb1p could function in the nucleus as a regulator of gene expression. With the discovery of the Ssb1p NES, it is apparent now that both Ssa1p and Ssb1p shuttle across the nuclear envelope. Like Kap α and β, Hsp70 would be expected to shuttle during its role in NLS-directed nuclear transport. Thus, it is unclear why the Ssb1p NES would inhibit its function in transport. The induction ofGAL1-SSB1 expression did stimulate a small but reproducible increase in NLS-GFP import in nup188-Δ cells (Fig. 6 B). It is possible that Ssb1p might promote the targeting and translocation of NLS-cargo during its shuttling cycle, but upon entering the nucleus, most of the Ssb1p-associated NLS-cargo complex might be exported before the NLS-cargo could be released to the nucleoplasm. Also, it is possible that a significant steady state concentration of nuclear Hsp70 is required for its function in nuclear transport. For example, Hsp70 may be involved in the recycling of transport factors such as Kap α and Kap β back to the cytoplasm. Normal nuclear levels of Ssb1p may be too low, or simply unavailable, to facilitate factor recycling. Molecular genetic evidence supports the notion that Hsp70 facilitates the formation and stability of the NLS-Kap α complex (15Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 16Jeoung D.-I. Chen S. Windsor J. Pollack R.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2235-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cell biological evidence indicates that Hsp70 is co-imported with the NLS-cargo-Kap α/β ternary complex (19Okuno Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 46Lamian V. Small G.M. Feldherr C.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hsp70s bind with high affinity to bona fide NLS peptides (47Imamoto-Sonobe N. Matsuoka Y. Semba T. Okada Y. Uchida T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16504-16508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Yoneda Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and NLS-like peptides (49Hightower L.E. Sadis S.E. Takenaka I.M. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C.

Standard models of Hsp70 chaperone action predict that cycles of NLS peptide binding and release could function to minimize nonspecific intermolecular interactions between the NLS and cellular constituents. The chaperone cycle could, in effect, increase the concentration of free NLS-cargo available for Kap α binding. Hsp70s normally work in conjunction with co-chaperones that facilitate and regulate peptide binding/release and ATPase activity, and it will be interesting to investigate the potential role of co-chaperones in nuclear transport.

https://openalex.org/W2032080162,"We show here that nonspecific RNA-protein interactions can significantly enhance the biological activity of an essential RNA·protein complex. Bacterial glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase poorly aminoacylates yeast tRNA and, as a consequence, cannot rescue a knockout allele of the gene for the yeast homologue. In contrast to the bacterial protein, the yeast enzyme has an extra appended domain at the N terminus. Previously, we showed that fusion of this yeast-specific domain to the bacterial protein enabled it to function as a yeast enzyme <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. We suggested that the novel yeast-specific domain contributed to RNA interactions in a way that compensated for the poor fit between the yeast tRNA and bacterial enzyme. Here we establish that the novel appended domain by itself binds nonspecifically to different RNA structures. In addition, we show that fusion of an unrelated yeast protein, Arc1p, to the bacterial enzyme also converts it into a functional yeast enzyme<i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. A small C-terminal segment of Arc1p is necessary and sufficient for this conversion. This segment was shown by others to have nonspecific tRNA binding properties. Thus, nonspecific RNA binding interactions in general can compensate for barriers to formation of a specific and essential RNA·protein complex."

Although the association of lipid glycation with this process has been investigated, the effect of specific lipid glycation products on LDL metabolism has not been addressed. This study reports that glucosylated phosphatidylethanolamine (Glc-PtdEtn), the major LDL lipid glycation product, promotes LDL uptake and cholesteryl ester (CE) and triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation by THP-1 macrophages. Incubation of THP-1 macrophages at a concentration of 100 μg/ml protein LDL specifically enriched (10 nmol/mg LDL protein) with synthetically prepared Glc-PtdEtn resulted in a significant increase in CE and TG accumulation when compared with LDL enriched in non-glucosylated PtdEtn. After a 24-h incubation with LDL containing Glc-PtdEtn, the macrophages contained 2-fold higher CE (10.11 ± 1.54 μg/mg cell protein) and TG (285.32 ± 4.38 μg/mg cell protein) compared with LDL specifically enriched in non-glucosylated PtdEtn (CE, 3.97 ± 0.95, p < 0.01 and TG, 185.57 ± 3.58 μg/mg cell protein, p < 0.01). The corresponding values obtained with LDL containing glycated protein and lipid were similar to those of LDL containing Glc-PtdEtn (CE, 11.9 ± 1.35 and TG, 280.78 ± 3.98 μg/mg cell protein). The accumulation of both neutral lipids was further significantly increased by incubating the macrophages with Glc-PtdEtn LDL exposed to copper oxidation. By utilizing the fluorescent probe, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI), a 1.6-fold increase was seen in Glc-PtdEtn + LDL uptake when compared with control LDL. Competition studies revealed that acetylated LDL is not a good competitor for DiI Glc-PtdEtn LDL (5–6% inhibition), whereas glycated LDL gave an 80% inhibition, and LDL + Glc-PtdEtn gave 93% inhibition of uptake by macrophages. These results indicate that glucosylation of PtdEtn in LDL accounts for the entire effect of LDL glycation on macrophage uptake and CE and TG accumulation and, therefore, the increased atherogenic potential of LDL in hyperglycemia. Non-enzymatic glycation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) has been suggested to be responsible for the increase in susceptibility to atherogenesis of diabetic individuals.

After a 24-h incubation with LDL containing Glc-PtdEtn, the macrophages contained 2-fold higher CE (10.11 ± 1.54 μg/mg cell protein) and TG (285.32 ± 4.38 μg/mg cell protein) compared with LDL specifically enriched in non-glucosylated PtdEtn (CE, 3.97 ± 0.95, p < 0.01 and TG, 185.57 ± 3.58 μg/mg cell protein, p < 0.01). The corresponding values obtained with LDL containing glycated protein and lipid were similar to those of LDL containing Glc-PtdEtn (CE, 11.9 ± 1.35 and TG, 280.78 ± 3.98 μg/mg cell protein). The accumulation of both neutral lipids was further significantly increased by incubating the macrophages with Glc-PtdEtn LDL exposed to copper oxidation. By utilizing the fluorescent probe, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI), a 1.6-fold increase was seen in Glc-PtdEtn + LDL uptake when compared with control LDL. Competition studies revealed that acetylated LDL is not a good competitor for DiI Glc-PtdEtn LDL (5–6% inhibition), whereas glycated LDL gave an 80% inhibition, and LDL + Glc-PtdEtn gave 93% inhibition of uptake by macrophages. These results indicate that glucosylation of PtdEtn in LDL accounts for the entire effect of LDL glycation on macrophage uptake and CE and TG accumulation and, therefore, the increased atherogenic potential of LDL in hyperglycemia.

Jenkins A.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The effect of protein glycation in LDL modification and its oxidation has been extensively investigated. Several groups of investigators have shown that glycated LDL is capable of inducing foam cell formation in a variety of cell culture systems (2Sobenin I.A. Tertov V.V. Koschinsky T. Bunting C.E.

Furthermore, LDL from diabetic patients has been shown to increase accumulation of CE in macrophages, and the extent of accumulation has been correlated with the extent of LDL glycation (6Klein R.L. Wohltmann H.J. Lopes-Virella M.F. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7Klein R.L. Lyons T.J. Lopes-Virella M.F. Diabetologia. 1990; 33: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In all these studies it was presumed that the glycated apoB is responsible for the entire altered activity. By using antibodies to advanced glycation end products (AGE), Bucalaet al. (8Bucala R. Makita Z. Koschinsky T. Cerami A. Vlassara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6434-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) have, however, shown that the lipid component of glycated LDL contains most of the AGE present and that the relative amount of this AGE antigen was proportional to the susceptibility of LDL to peroxidation. Since lipid glycation products were not isolated or identified, the significance of lipid glycation in LDL uptake by macrophages could not be investigated or a differentiation attempted between lipid and protein glycation in this process. We have previously demonstrated that the amino phospholipids of plasma and red blood cells (RBC) from diabetic subjects show a 10-fold increase in glycated PtdEtn over control subjects (9Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Marai L. Myher J.J. Lipids. 1995; 30: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Marai L. Myher J.J. Steiner G. Lewis G. Kamido H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and that incorporation of Glc-PtdEtn into LDL (11Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Shaikh N.A. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44 Suppl. 2: A73Google Scholar) facilitates peroxidation of LDL lipids. The present study demonstrates that the presence of Glc-PtdEtn in LDL results in an increased uptake of LDL and a dramatic increase in neutral lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages. THP-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection (TIB 202) and were propagated in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum/penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 10% fetal calf serum medium containing 10−7m phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 72 h. The cells were then washed extensively with serum-free RPMI medium and incubated with or without lipoproteins as indicated for each experiment. In all experiments, cell viability exceeded 90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Glc-PtdEtn was prepared and purified as described previously (9Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Marai L. Myher J.J. Lipids. 1995; 30: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, PtdEtn (2 mg) dissolved in 1 ml of methanol was transferred to a 15-ml test tube, and the solvent evaporated under nitrogen. Four ml of 0.1 mphosphate buffer containing 0–400 mm glucose and 0.1 mm EDTA were added and sonicated at low power for 5 min at room temperature, and the mixture was incubated under nitrogen at 37 °C for various periods. Lipids were extracted into chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) as described by Folch et al.(12Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the solvents evaporated under nitrogen. Samples were redissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and kept at −20 °C until analysis. Glc-PtdEtn (2 mg) was purified by preparative TLC (20 × 20-cm glass plates) coated with Silica Gel H (250-μm thick layer). The chromatoplates were developed using chloroform/methanol, 30% ammonia (65:35:7, by volume) as described (9Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Marai L. Myher J.J. Lipids. 1995; 30: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were identified by co-chromatography with appropriate standards, visualizing any lipid bands under ultraviolet light after spraying the plate with 0.05% 2,7-dichlorofluorescein in methanol. Both glucosylated and non-glucosylated lipids were recovered by scraping the gel from appropriate areas of the plate and extracting it twice with the developing solvent. LDL (1.019–1.069 g/ml) was obtained by density gradient ultracentrifugation (13Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6486) Google Scholar) from plasma of fasted normolipidemic individuals. LDL (2 mg of protein/ml) was subsequently dialyzed against 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm EDTA for 24 h (three buffer changes). LDL samples were sterilized by passing through a 0.22-micron filter (Millipore, Milford, MA), kept at 4 °C, and used within 1 week. Lipoprotein concentration was determined by the method of Lowryet al. (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as mg/ml. Oxidation of LDL (5 mg of protein/5 ml) was performed by dialysis against 5 μmCuSO4·5H2O in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), for 12 h at 37 °C in the dark. LDL (2 mg of protein/ml) in 1 mm EDTA, containing 0.1 mg/ml chloramphenicol and 3 mm NaN3, was incubated with 50 mm glucose at 37 °C for 1 week under nitrogen to obtain glycated LDL. Acetylated LDL (AcLDL) was prepared by the method of Basu et al. (15Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Glucosylated and non-glucosylated PtdEtn was incorporated into LDL essentially as described by Engelmann et al. (16Engelmann B. Kogl C. Kulschar R. Schaipp B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) for enriching human plasma lipoproteins with phospholipids. Glc-PtdEtn (1 mg) in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) was transferred to a 15-ml test tube, the solvent evaporated under nitrogen, and the lipids were dispersed by vortexing in 1.5 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.03 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). The solutions were sonicated in a bath sonicator for 5 min at 1-min intervals while being kept on ice under a stream of nitrogen. The liposome mixture was centrifuged at 3,500 × g and the supernatant collected and passed through a 0.45-μm filter. The liposomal mixture (1 ml) was added to fresh plasma (4 ml) containing 3 mm NaN3 under gentle mixing. The mixture was incubated under nitrogen at 37 °C for 24 h. Lipoproteins were isolated as described above. Normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of phospholipids was performed on a 5-μm Spherisorb column (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter, Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL). The column was installed into a Hewlett-Packard model 1090 liquid chromatograph and eluted with a linear gradient of 100% solvent A (chloroform/methanol/30% ammonium hydroxide, 80:19.5:0.5, by volume) to 100% solvent B (chloroform/methanol/water/30% ammonium hydroxide, 60:34:5.5:0.5, by volume) in 14 min and then at 100% solvent B for 10 min (17Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Shaikh N.A. Jackowski G. Lipids. 1997; 32: 989-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The flow was set at 1 ml/min. The peaks were monitored by on-line ES/MS. Normal phase HPLC with on-line electrospray mass spectrometry (LC/ES/MS) was performed by splitting the HPLC flow by 1/50 resulting in 20 μl/ml being admitted to a Hewlett-Packard model 5988B quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a nebulizer-assisted electrospray interface (HP 59987A) (18Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Marai L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Meth. 1995; 30: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Tuning and calibration of the system was achieved in the mass range of 400–1500 by using the standard phospholipid mix dissolved in the HPLC solvent A and flow-injected at 50 μl/min into the mass spectrometer. Capillary voltage was set at 4 kV, the end plate voltage at 3.5 kV, and the cylinder voltage at 5 kV in the positive mode of ionization. In the negative mode, the voltages were 3.5, 3, and 3.5 kV, respectively. Both positive and negative ion spectra were taken in the mass range 400–1100 atomic mass units. The capillary exit voltage was set at 120 V in the positive and 160 V in the negative ion mode. Nitrogen gas was used as both nebulizing gas (40 pounds/square inch) and drying gas (60 pounds/square inch, 270 °C). Phospholipids were quantified on basis of standard curves established for each phospholipid class. The equimolar ion intensities of different species of each phospholipid class varied by less than 5% in each of the ion modes (18Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Marai L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Meth. 1995; 30: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The LC/ES/MS response to different phospholipid classes varied greatly and required the regular use of standards. LDL was labeled with the fluorescent probe 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) according to the method of Stephan and Yurachek (19Stephan Z.F. Yurachek E.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 325-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to 10 ml of LDL solution (1 mg/ml protein) containing 1 mmEDTA in 0.1 m PBS, 300 μl of DiI solution in Me2SO (30 mg/ml) was slowly added under gentle agitation. The solution was incubated for 8 h at 37 °C under nitrogen and in the dark. The LDL was reisolated by ultracentrifugation. Under these conditions the average labeling efficiency was 20–25 ng of DiI/μg of LDL protein. To study the uptake of DiI-labeled LDL, cells seeded in 24-well culture dishes were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of the lipoprotein (10–200 μg/ml) (20Teupser D. Thiery J. Walli A.K. Seidel D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Specific uptake of DiI LDL in all preparations was determined at 10 μg of lipoprotein/ml with 50-fold excess of unlabeled lipoprotein. Afterward, the cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin and twice with PBS alone. To each well 1 ml of lysis buffer was added (1 g/liter SDS, 0.1 m NaOH). Cells were incubated at room temperature under gentle shaking for 1 h. This allowed both direct fluorescence and protein measurement. The fluorescence of each well was measured in duplicate by a Shimadzu spectrofluorometer (RF5000U). The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 520 and 575 nm, respectively. The detection range for the fluorescence was linear from 0.05 to 20 μg/ml LDL protein. Protein determinations were made in duplicate using the method of Lowry et al. (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin dissolved in lysis buffer as standard. Fluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (21Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Mahly R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 2-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The THP-1 cells were exposed for 24 h to control and modified LDL preparations. After incubation the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin and twice with PBS alone. Cells were scraped from the culture flask into PBS and sonicated. The cellular lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (22Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Geher K. Shaikh N.A. Breckenridge W.C. Jones G.J.L. Little J.A. J. Chromatogr. 1980; 2: 1-26Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For this purpose the lipid extract was digested with phospholipase C (Clostridium welchii), and the digestion mixture was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) containing 100 μg of tridecanoylglycerol as internal standard. The lipid extracts were then reacted for 30 min at 20 °C with SYLON BFT plus 1 part dry pyridine. This procedure converts the free fatty acids into trimethyl silyl esters and the free sterols, diacylglycerols, and ceramides into trimethyl silyl ethers, leaving the cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols unmodified. The free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and triacylglycerols were quantitated using a non-polar capillary column as described previously (23Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Geher K. Breckenridge W.C. Jones G.J.L. Little J.A. J. Chromatogr. Biomed. Appl. 1981; 224: 1-23Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cellular uptake and neutral lipid accumulation assays were done in triplicate, and statistical significance was performed with analysis of variance. Fig.1 shows the results of the LC/ES/MS analysis of phospholipids from control LDL (Fig. 1 A) and from LDL preparations containing Glc-PtdEtn (Fig. 1 B). The Glc-PtdEtn is well resolved from PtdEtn and from other phospholipids seen in the negative ion profile, where the choline phospholipids yield minimal response. The added glucosylated 16:0–18:2 Gro-PEtn (m/z 876) [M − 1]− was easily detected by single ion mass chromatogram (Fig. 1 C). By using appropriate correction factors, it was estimated that the total PtdEtn content of LDL had been increased from 3 to 6% of total phospholipid (20–50% of total PtdEtn) as a result of the enrichment. Fig.2 shows that incubation of Glc-PtdEtn LDL (10–30 nmol of Glc-PtdEtn/mg of LDL protein) with THP-1 cells leads to a specific increase in CE and TC accumulation when compared with LDL containing non-glycated PtdEtn (10.11 ± 1.54 versus3.97 ± 0.35 μg/mg cell protein, p < 0.01). The supplementation of LDL with non-glucosylated PtdEtn did not have any significant effect on CE accumulation. In order to differentiate between the contributions of LDL lipid and protein glycation on CE accumulation, these results were compared with those obtained with LDL that had been glycated in both protein and lipid moieties by incubation with glucose (50 mm, 7 days, 37 °C). The glycated LDL preparation caused a CE accumulation (11.95 ± 1.38 μg/mg cell protein) that was comparable to that obtained when macrophages were incubated with Glc-PtdEtn LDL (10.11±1.54 μg/mg cell protein). Fig. 3 shows that incubation of THP-1 cells with Glc-PtdEtn LDL also causes a significant accumulation of TG (285.32 ± 4.38 μg/mg cell protein) which again was indistinguishable from the accumulation obtained by incubation with LDL glycated in lipid and protein (280.78 ± 3.98 μg/mg cell protein). LDL supplemented with non-glucosylated PtdEtn did not stimulate TG accumulation (185.57 ± 3.42 μg/mg cell protein). Furthermore, the increase in TG content of the macrophages seen at 50 μg/ml LDL was only slightly lower than that seen at 100 μg/ml LDL indicating a leveling off in the response. Interestingly, the TG levels in THP-1 cells represented the major neutral lipid pool contributing up to 85% of the cell neutral lipid content. Previous work done in our laboratory had shown that Glc-PtdEtn is more susceptible to oxidation and also facilitates the oxidation of other LDL phospholipids as well as the CE present in the lipid core of the molecule (11Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Shaikh N.A. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44 Suppl. 2: A73Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the effects of Glc-PtdEtn on LDL oxidation and on foam cell formation. We oxidized Glc-PtdEtn-enriched LDL by copper and measured the CE and TG deposition in THP-1 cells. Fig.4 A shows the effect of incubation of oxidized PtdEtn LDL and oxidized Glc-PtdEtn-enriched LDL upon the accumulation of free cholesterol, CE, and TC by THP-1 cells in comparison to LDL. The greatest increase is seen in the CE. The oxidized PtdEtn LDL caused a 4-fold increase in the CE content of the cells (18.36 ± 1.95 μg/mg cell protein) compared with control LDL (3.97 ± 1.95 μg/mg cell protein). There was a significant further increase after incubation with oxidized Glc-PtdEtn LDL (28.36 ± 3.25 μg/mg cell protein). Fig. 4 B shows the effect of incubation of oxidized PtdEtn-enriched LDL and oxidized Glc-PtdEtn-enriched LDL upon the accumulation of TG by THP-1 cells in comparison to LDL enriched with PtdEtn. The incubation with LDL oxidized after enrichment with Glc-PtdEtn (350.91 ± 26.32 μg/mg cell protein) gave significantly greater accumulation than the incubation with oxidized LDL enriched with PtdEtn (310 ± 21.84 μg/mg cell protein), both values being significantly greater than those obtained for non-oxidized LDL or LDL enriched in PtdEtn. This increase in neutral lipid deposition correlated with the increase in PtdCho oxidation products due to the presence of Glc-PtdEtn in LDL during oxidation. The phospholipids from oxidized Glc-PtdEtn LDL were analyzed by LC/ES/MS. The total positive ion current (Fig.5 A) shows the separation of Glc-PtdEtn LDL phospholipids after oxidation with copper ions. The major phospholipid oxidation products were identified as the PtdCho hydroperoxides (PtdCho OOH), PtdCho core aldehydes (PtdCho Ald), and PtdCho isoprostanes (PtdCho IsoP) in the positive mode of ionization. Fig. 5 B shows representative mass chromatograms. In the absence of reference standards the structures proposed for the isoprostanes and core aldehydes containing hydroxyl groups must remain tentative. The pro-oxidative effect of Glc-PtdEtn resulted in a 4-fold increase in the production of total hydroperoxides, core aldehydes, and isoprostanes, when compared with LDL enriched in PtdEtn (Fig.6).Figure 5LC/ES/MS analysis of oxidized PtdCho in oxidized Glc-PtdEtn LDL .

Glc-PtdEtn LDL was oxidized by incubation with 5 μm CuSO4 in 0.1 m PBS for 12 h at 37 °C. The total lipid extract of the oxidized LDL was dissolved in chloroform/methanol 2:1, and 20 μl of the sample containing 10 μg lipid was analyzed. Structural assignments for aldehydes and hydroperoxides are according to reference standards. Ions 832 and 830 were identified on the basis of retention time and molecular weight.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6Increased oxidative susceptibility of LDL due to Glc-PtdEtn .

Levels represent sum of four of the most abundant ions for each class of oxidized PtdCho.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to quantitate the rate of uptake of LDL, we utilized DiI-labeled lipoproteins. After a 4-h incubation with cells, the fluorescence intensity was measured as an indicator of total cell-associated lipoprotein. Cells incubated with DiI LDL enriched with Glc-PtdEtn (10–200 μg/ml) showed a much more rapid increase in cell-associated lipoprotein when compared with control LDL enriched with PtdEtn (Fig.7). The uptake of DiI LDL enriched in Glc-PtdEtn occurred at the same rate as that for glycated LDL showing that the presence of Glc-PtdEtn in LDL can mimic the properties of glycated LDL. The uptake of all LDL preparations tended to level off in the range of 100–200 μg/ml LDL. Fig. 8 shows the time course (4, 6, 10, and 20 h) of macrophage accumulation of fluorescently labeled lipoprotein. At all time points the average accumulation was consistently higher for the LDL preparation containing Glc-PtdEtn when compared with control LDL. The accumulation of Glc-PtdEtn LDL was parallel to that of glycated LDL at all time points. To explore the specificity Glc-PtdEtn LDL interaction with macrophages, we investigated the ability of AcLDL, PtdEtn LDL, glycated LDL, and LDL + Glc-PtdEtn at increasing concentrations to compete with DiI-labeled Glc-PtdEtn (50 μg/ml) for uptake by macrophages (Fig.9). After the 4-h incubation the AcLDL and control LDL were only able to inhibit 5–6% of the cell association. Glycated LDL led to 80% inhibition of Glc-PtdEtn LDL uptake, whereas the unlabeled Glc-PtdEtn resulted in 93% inhibition of uptake after correction for nonspecific association. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of LDL uptake by THP-1 cells (Fig.10) showed increased fluorescence in cells incubated with DiI Glc-PtdEtn LDL compared with cells incubated with the DiI PtdEtn LDL. The distribution of fluorescence in cells incubated with DiI-labeled Glc-PtdEtn LDL (Fig. 10 C) shows a punctated pattern believed to be indicative of receptor-mediated endocytosis from coated pits and vesicles to endosomes and lysosomes (24Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S.Z. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). This pattern was also observed for glycated LDL and for AcLDL as already reported (24Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S.Z. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Cells incubated with DiI PtdEtn LDL showed a diffuse pattern of fluorescence with less intensity, indicative of lack of uptake.Figure 9Competitive inhibition of Glc-PtdEtn LDL uptake by THP-1 macrophages. Macrophages were incubated 4 h with 50 μg/ml DiI-labeled Glc-PtdEtn LDL together with varying concentrations of unlabeled AcLDL (▪), glycated LDL (▴, LDL incubated with 50 mm glucose, 1 week), and unlabeled LDL enriched with Glc-PtdEtn (●). Values shown are means of triplicate incubations that varied by less than 10%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 10Uptake of Glc-PtdEtn LDL by THP-1 macrophages.

After the incubation for 3 h at 37 °C cells were washed with cold PBS, fixed with formaldehyde in PBS, and then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig.11 shows that the glycation of PtdEtn increases the negativity of the molecule. Injection of equimolar amounts of PtdEtn and Glc-PtdEtn, chromatographed on normal phase silica column, resulted in a 1.5-fold higher response for Glc-PtdEtn when compared with PtdEtn. The calculated molar response of Glc-PtdEtn was comparable to that of other anionic phospholipids, such as PtdIns and PtdSer (Table I).Table ILC/ES/MS relative ionization intensities in negative ionization mode for anionic phospholipids as compared with PtdEtnPhospholipidIonization ratioPtdEtn1Glc PtdEtn1.53 ± 0.32PtdSer1.62 ± 0.41PtdIns1.57 ± 0.38CL2.12 ± 0.37Equimolar amounts of each phospholipid was injected in the LC/ES/MS system.

This study demonstrates that incorporation of Glc-PtdEtn into LDL at a level commonly achieved in hyperglycemia can fully account for the increased uptake of glycated LDL by macrophages. Furthermore, the resulting increased accumulation of CE and TG by macrophages exceeds the amounts of neutral lipids anticipated to be transferred to the cells on the basis of uptake of the lipoprotein. This increase was mainly due to accumulation of TG which contributed over 85% of the cell total neutral lipid (TC + TG). The glycated subfraction of LDL, which is elevated in diabetic subjects, has been reported to promote CE deposition and to increase the rate of CE synthesis in macrophages (25Lyons T.J. Klein R.L. Baynes J.W. Stevenson H.C. Lopes-Virella M.F. Diabetologia. 1987; 30: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but TG levels had not been measured. Although there was a significant increase in CE deposition in our THP-1 cells, the major neutral lipid accumulated was TG. In this connection it may be noted that recent studies have shown that THP-1 cells contain a large and metabolically active TG pool but a relatively inactive pool of CE (26Kritharides L. Christian A. Stoudt G. Morel D. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A large and active TG pool has also been seen in other human macrophage cultures, but the regulation of TG metabolism in these cells is not known. The general effects of glycation on LDL interaction with macrophages have been extensively investigated (4Lopes-Virella M.F. Klein R.L. Lyons T.J. Stevenson H.C. Witztum J.L. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 550-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gonen B. Baenzinger J. Schonfeld G. Jacobson D. Farrar P. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 875-878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-enzymatic glycation of LDL has been shown to increase the fluidity of the phospholipid monolayer, to result in an altered lipid composition (27Rabini R.A. Ferretti G. Galassi R. Taus M. Curatola G. Tangorra A. Fumelli P. Mazzanti L. Clin. Biochem. 1994; 27: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and, possibly, in an increased susceptibility to oxidation. These alterations in biological and physicochemical properties have been attributed solely to ApoB glycation without consideration of LDL phospholipid glycation. The inability of AcLDL to compete with Glc-PtdEtn LDL suggests the participation of receptors other than the LDL or scavenger receptor. Due to the increased negative charge of Glc-PtdEtn compared with PtdEtn and structural similarities to acidic glycerophospholipids, it is possible that receptors for Glc-PtdEtn uptake could be found in the family of receptors that identify anionic phospholipids such as CD 36 (28Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). It has been shown that CD 36 present in photoreceptor outer segment cells binds PtdSer- and PtdIns-rich liposomes resulting in their uptake (29Ryeom S.W. Silverstein R.L. Scotto A. Sparrow J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20536-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). LC/ES/MS shows that glucosylation of PtdEtn increases the negative charge of the amino phospholipid, and with structural and physicochemical similarities to acidic glycerophospholipids, Glc-PtdEtn could increase uptake of LDL by CD 36. In fact, macrophages have already been shown to specifically phagocytose oxidized RBC in which the outer leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer exposes anionic phospholipids, specifically PtdSer. Sambranoet al. (30Sambrano G.R. Terpstra V. Steinberg D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3442-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that peroxidation of RBC results in disruption of the asymmetry of the plasma membrane phospholipid bilayer resulting in PtdSer exposure and recognition of oxidized RBC by macrophages and their subsequent phagocytosis. Inhibition of uptake of oxidized RBC by OxLDL showed that the scavenger receptors on macrophages were responsible for a major part of the oxidized RBC recognition (31Ottnand E. Parthasarathy S. Sambrano G.R. Ramprasad M.P. Quehenberger O. Kondratenko N. Green S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1391-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recently another receptor, SRB1, has been shown to have the capability of binding anionic phospholipids. The inhibition of the selective uptake of high density lipoprotein CE in liver parenchymal cells by modified LDL, in particular OxLDL and ionic phospholipids, has suggested that in liver the SRB1 is responsible for the efficient uptake of high density lipoprotein CE (32Fluiter K. van Berkel T.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The concept that negatively charged molecules can form complexes with LDL is not restricted to negatively charged phospholipids. Basu et al. (15Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that complexes containing LDL and large molecular weight dextran sulfates are avidly metabolized by macrophages via a receptor, which appears to be distinct from the AcLDL receptor. Besides the effects of PtdSer on macrophage uptake, association of other negatively charged phospholipids, like cardiolipin, with LDL increases its uptake and the deposition of cholesteryl esters by macrophages (33Greenspan P. Ryu B.H. Mao F. Gutman R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1257: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It has also been claimed that an alteration in the composition of LDL phospholipids caused by phospholipase D (34Aviram M. Maor I. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and phospholipase A2 (35Aviram M. Maor I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) can influence the metabolism of LDL by macrophages, but it is not clear whether the effect is related to a relative increase in acidic phospholipids or lysophospholipids, which would be anticipated to result from the action of these enzymes. Another possible receptor for Glc-PtdEtn is the newly characterized AGE receptor (36Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This receptor has been demonstrated to have specificity toward protein glycation products (37Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the binding assays performed with this receptor have only focused on the protein glycation products and the interaction of Glc-PtdEtn with AGE receptor-advanced glycation end products has not been investigated. The present study demonstrates that peroxidation increases the neutral lipid deposition due to LDL beyond the extent achieved by glucosylation of PtdEtn alone. We have previously shown that glycation of LDL PtdEtn promotes the oxidation of both surface and core components of LDL (11Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Shaikh N.A. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44 Suppl. 2: A73Google Scholar). The increase in susceptibility of LDL in the presence of Glc-PtdEtn to oxidation was characterized by an increase in products of phospholipid oxidation such as PtdCho core aldehydes, which have been specifically shown to induce increased monocyte-endothelial interactionsin vitro (38Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the observation that both apolipoprotein and lipid in glycated LDL are more susceptible to oxidation in the presence of Fe3+ than non-glycated LDL (39Sakurai T. Kimura S. Nakano M. Kimura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Fe3+ could be coordinated with the endiol group in Amadori compounds and could be converted to ferryl iron with a high redox potential. It was postulated, on the basis of the known chemistry of Schiff base and Amadori products, that during the nucleophilic addition of glucose to protein amino groups, as in the early glycation, the glycation products of proteins deposited in the arterial wall could themselves generate free radicals capable of oxidizing lipids (40Mullarkey C.J. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). This possibility is supported by the demonstration that both Schiff base and Amadori glycation products generate free radicals in a ratio of 1:1.5 and that these radicals cause increased peroxidation of membrane lipids (40Mullarkey C.J. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In similar studies Kobayashi et al.(41Kobayashi K. Watanabe J. Umeda F. Masakado M. Ono Y. Taniguchi S. Yanase T. Hashimoto T. Sako Y. Nawata H. Horm. Metab. Res. 1995; 27: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) demonstrated that oxidation of glycated LDL results in increased binding and degradation by cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells compared with normal or oxidized LDL. The present study demonstrates that glucosylation of the PtdEtn component of LDL exerts a dramatic effect on LDL metabolism which mimics that of total LDL glycation. This is the first direct evidence that glycation of LDL lipids results in increased LDL uptake and in CE and TG accumulation in macrophages. In conclusion, this study suggests that the presence of Glc-PtdEtn in LDL plays an important role in the alteration of the biological activity of LDL and reconciles diverse observations regarding the binding of glycated and peroxidized LDL to macrophages and other cells and may account for the increased atherogenesis in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2329830099,"N-myc gene copy numbers and transcription rates are similar in N (neuroblastic, tumorigenic) and S (non-neuronal, non-tumorigenic) neuroblastoma cells with chromosomally integrated amplified N-myc genes. However, N cells show significantly higher N-myc mRNA levels than S cells. Therefore, post-transcriptional control of N-myc gene expression must differ between these cell types. Since no differences in N-myc mRNA half-life were found between N and S cells from two cell lines, steady-state levels of N-myc pre-mRNA processing intermediates were analysed. Results suggest that the differences in N-myc expression arise primarily at the nuclear post-transcriptional level. The neuronal-specific RNA-binding Hu proteins are present in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of N cells and one of them, HuD, binds specifically to both exonic and intronic N-myc RNA sequences. In sense and antisense HuD-transfected N cells, there are coordinate changes in HuD and N-myc expression levels. Thus, we propose that HuD plays a role in the nuclear processing/stability of N-myc pre-mRNA in N-type neuroblastoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1963836062,"Structural analysis of the 16 S rRNA in the 30 S subunit and 70 S ribosome in the presence of ribosome-specific antibiotics was performed to determine whether they produced rRNA structural changes that might provide further insight to their action. An UV cross-linking procedure that determines the pattern and frequency of intramolecular 16 S RNA cross-links was used to detect differences reflecting structural changes. Tetracycline and spectinomycin have specific effects detected by this assay. The presence of tetracycline inhibits the cross-link C967×C1400 completely, increases the frequency of cross-link C1402×1501 twofold, and decreases the cross-link G894×U244 by one-half without affecting other cross-links. Spectinomycin reduces the frequency of the cross-link C934×U1345 by 60% without affecting cross-linking at other sites. The structural changes occur at concentrations at which the antibiotics exert their inhibitory effects. For spectinomycin, the apparent binding site and the affected cross-linking site are distant in the secondary structure but are close in tertiary structure in several recent models, indicating a localized effect. For tetracycline, the apparent binding sites are significantly separated in both the secondary and the three-dimensional structures, suggesting a more regional effect.

A variety of antibiotics interact with the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis within bacterial and eukaryotic cells (1Gale E.F. Cundliffe E. Reynolds P.E. Richmond M.H. Waring M.J. The Molecular Basis of Antibiotic Action. Wiley, London1981Google Scholar). The point of interruption in the translation cycle has been determined for some antibiotics (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), making them useful in vitro to investigate the nature of elongation in protein synthesis. Some of these antibiotics have been footprinted on the ribosomal RNAs in 30 S and 50 S subunits and in the 70 S ribosome (3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) as well as on model oligomers designed to mimic local regions of 16 S rRNA (4Purohit P. Stern S. Nature. 1994; 370: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 5Recht M.I. Fourmy D. Blanchard S.C. Dahlquist K.D. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Sites of action have also been established by affinity and photoaffinity experiments (6Cooperman B.S. Press U.P. Ribosomes Structure, Function, and Genetics. University Park Press, New York1980: 531-554Google Scholar, 7Oehler R. Polacek N. Steiner G. Barta A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1219-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The binding sites frequently correspond to regions of the ribosome that are implicated by other experiments in ribosome function. In many cases, binding site assignments are supported by resistance-conferring mutations in 16 S and 23 S rRNAs (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 8Triman K.L. Adv. Genet. 1995; 33: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Antibiotics, either directly by binding or indirectly through conformation alterations, must result in the inability of tRNA or translation factors to bind the ribosome or else inhibit some processes needed during translation. However, little is known regarding whether conformational perturbations accompany binding, even in instances in which detailed information supporting binding sites and the nature of translation interruption are known. UV cross-linking of the rRNA in the ribosome provides an opportunity to monitor changes in rRNA conformation and, consequently, the ribosome global structure. We have previously determined the identity of 14 UV-induced cross-links in 16 S rRNA within the 30 S subunit (9Wilms C. Noah J.W. Zhong D. Wollenzien P. RNA. 1997; 3: 602-612PubMed Google Scholar) and 15 cross-links in the 70 S ribosome (10Noah J. Wollenzien P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15442-15448Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because of the gel electrophoresis method used in the detection, all of these cross-links occur between nucleotides that are distant in the primary sequence. These cross-links occur because the partner nucleotides possess a suitable distance and geometry during the lifetime of the excited state (on the order of 1 μs; Ref. 11Budowsky E.I. Axentyeva M.S. Abdurachidova G.G. Simukova N.A. Rubin L.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 159: 95-101Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar); therefore, their frequency provides a method to screen substrates and other agents for their ability to affect ribosomal conformation. In this report, UV irradiation was repeated in the presence of 13 antibiotics to determine whether they produce measurable changes in the ribosome structure that might be related to their activity. These 13 antibiotics were known to bind either the 30 S or 50 S subunit. Some of these antibiotics have localized binding sites on 16 S rRNA, as determined by chemical probing, that are adjacent in the 16 S rRNA secondary structure to nucleotides that participate in cross-links and may affect the frequency of such contacts. Two of these antibiotics, spectinomycin and tetracycline, have discernible effects on the frequency of specific UV cross-linking sites in 16 S rRNA. The implications of these effects with respect to the antibiotic action are discussed. Escherichia coli 70 S ribosomes and ribosomal subunits were prepared according to Makhno et al. (12Makhno V.I. Peshin N.N. Semenkov Y.P. Kirillov S.V. Mol. Biol. 1988; 22: 528-537Google Scholar) and dissolved in CMN 1The abbreviations used are: CMN, 80 mm cacodylic acid, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol; BTBE, 30 mmbis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane, 30 mmboric acid, and 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 6.8. buffer. In some experiments, CMN buffer was used with Mg2+concentrations from 0.5 to 50 mm. 70 S ribosomes were prepared by reassociating equimolar amounts of 30 S and 50 S subunits and were free of mRNA or tRNA. Samples were incubated with the following concentrations of antibiotics (Sigma) that were previously determined to produce specific footprints in the 16 S rRNA or 23 S rRNA by chemical probing (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar): (a) 5 × 10−6m neomycin, (b) 5 × 10−6m paromomycin, (c) 5 × 10−6m streptomycin, (d) 1 × 10−4m gentamycin, (e) 1 × 10−4m kanamycin, (f) 1 × 10−4m spectinomycin, (g) 2.5 × 10−4m tetracycline, (h) 5 × 10−6m erythromycin, (i) 5 × 10−6m thiostrepton, (j) 5 × 10−6m fusidic acid, (k) 5 × 10−6m chloramphenicol, (l) 5 × 10−6m viomycin, and (m) 1 × 10−4m hygromycin. Concentration series have also been investigated for tetracycline and spectinomycin. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, placed on ice for 10 min, and irradiated at 4 °C for 20 min in a quartz cuvette with continuous stirring. Irradiation was performed with a 312 nm trans-illuminator (Fotodyne Corp.) as described previously (9Wilms C. Noah J.W. Zhong D. Wollenzien P. RNA. 1997; 3: 602-612PubMed Google Scholar). Sample concentrations were usually 1 μg RNA/μl, with the exception of samples for preparative separation, which were irradiated at 6 μg RNA/μl. RNA was recovered from the samples by proteinase K digestion, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. The RNA was dephosphorylated with shrimp intestinal phosphatase and purified by proteinase K digestion, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. 16 S rRNA was then isolated on a 1% agarose gel before 5′ end-labeling with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Cross-linked 16 S rRNA was separated by gel electrophoresis on gels made with 3.6% acrylamide:bisacrylamide (70:1), 8.3 murea, and BTBE buffer as described previously (9Wilms C. Noah J.W. Zhong D. Wollenzien P. RNA. 1997; 3: 602-612PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of cross-linking sites, the location of the bands containing un-cross-linked and cross-linked 16 S rRNA were detected with a PhosphorImager, and bands were cut out and eluted by ultracentrifugation through cushions containing 2 m CsCl and 0.2 m EDTA, pH 7.4, for 12 h at 40,000 rpm (13Wilms C. Wollenzien P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 204-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). RNA pellets were redissolved in 250 μl of H20, phenol-extracted, and re-precipitated before further analysis. The cross-linking sites in separated 16 S rRNA were found by primer extension analysis using 11 DNA primers complementary to regions throughout 16 S rRNA (9Wilms C. Noah J.W. Zhong D. Wollenzien P. RNA. 1997; 3: 602-612PubMed Google Scholar). The frequency of cross-linking was determined from PhosphorImager data (ImageQuant; Molecular Dynamics Inc.) of duplicate independent experiments. To normalize for RNA loading, cross-link band intensity was referenced to the same cross-link band (C54×A353) in each respective lane. This reference band showed <10% variance in all lanes when referenced to the un-cross-linked 16 S rRNA parent band in the same lane. Six classes of antibiotics were examined in these experiments: (a) aminoglycoside (neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, gentamycin, kanamycin, spectinomycin, and hygromycin), (b) tetracycline, (c) macrolide (erythromycin), (d) peptide (thiostrepton and viomycin), (e) fusidic acid, and (f) chloramphenicol. The seven aminoglycosides, tetracycline, and the two peptide antibiotics are thought to bind primarily to the 30 S subunit, and the two peptide antibiotics also bind to the 50 S subunit (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Erythromycin and chloramphenicol bind exclusively to the 50 S subunit, and fusidic acid prevents the release of elongation factor G·GDP from the ribosome (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These last three antibiotics were included to test the possibility that an alteration in the 50 S subunit structure may induce changes in the structure of the 30 S subunit, within the 70 S ribosome. Both 30 S and 70 S ribosomes were irradiated in the presence of the listed antibiotics, and, with exceptions noted below, the effects were identical. In all instances in these experiments, empty ribosomes were used to avoid heterogeneity in the ribosomal state and to avoid the complication of possible substrate-mediated structure changes. In addition, previous characterizations of antibiotic binding sites (3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 7Oehler R. Polacek N. Steiner G. Barta A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1219-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and our identification of UV cross-links in 16 S rRNA (9Wilms C. Noah J.W. Zhong D. Wollenzien P. RNA. 1997; 3: 602-612PubMed Google Scholar) have been performed on empty ribosomes. Tetracycline and spectinomycin were the only compounds tested that affected the cross-linking pattern of 16 S rRNA within 30 S subunits or 70 S ribosomes (Fig. 1). At 2.5 × 10−4m, the concentration used for chemical footprinting experiments (3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), tetracycline affected three identified cross-links and one incompletely identified cross-link. The third band from the top of the pattern, which was verified as C967×C1400, was completely inhibited. In this and other gels, there was some decrease in the intensity of the topmost band in the pattern, which was shown to contain U244×G894. The third band from the bottom of the gel, which was shown to contain the cross-link C1402×C1501, increased twofold in intensity in both 30 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes. The fourth band from the top also decreased in the presence of tetracycline. U534 is one part of this cross-link, but we have been unable to find a partner for it. At 1 × 10−4m, the concentration used for chemical footprinting experiments (3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), spectinomycin decreased the intensity of the cross-link found in the second band from the top (Fig. 1), which was shown to contain the cross-link C934×U1345, by 60%. Reverse transcription analyses of the regions of 16 S rRNA containing the cross-links affected by tetracycline are shown in Fig.2. A and B show the results of reverse transcription in the nucleotide intervals 212–265 and 866–914, respectively, in which differences were seen in the tetracycline sample. In lane 7 in each panel, the stops indicating cross-links at U244 and G894 decreased in the tetracycline sample relative to the control sample. C and Dshow the results of reverse transcription reactions in the nucleotide intervals 952–983 and 1387–1409. Lane 5 of each panel contains stops indicating that the cross-link C967×C1400 disappeared.E and F show the results of reverse transcription reactions in the nucleotide intervals 1390–1411 and 1491–1504.Lane 2 of each panel contains stops indicating that the cross-link C1402×C1501 increased in the presence of tetracycline relative to the control. The effects of tetracycline on cross-link intensity are the same in both 30 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes. Reverse transcription analysis of the cross-linked band affected by spectinomycin is shown in Fig. 3. The only reverse transcription stops affected by spectinomycin were in intervals 907–953 (A) and 1330–1365 (B). A decrease in the stops at 935 and 1346 in lane 6 of each panel indicates that the cross-link C934×1345 is affected. The decreases in intensity are consistent with the difference seen in the analytical gel pattern (Fig. 1). Titration experiments were performed with tetracycline to determine the concentration threshold on the 16 S rRNA tertiary structure (Fig.4). At concentrations between 2.5 × 10−4m and 1 × 10−5m, tetracycline specifically affects the cross-links noted above. There was no change in the frequency of any of the cross-links before the low concentration limit was reached. In the sample irradiated in the highest concentration of tetracycline, several cross-links were partially or completely inhibited; this is attributed to the nonspecific binding of tetracycline to the ribosome and/or a decrease in cross-linking due to the high tetracycline absorbance. Titration experiments were also performed at five spectinomycin concentrations (Fig. 4). These show that the decrease in the C934×U1345 cross-link is seen at or above 1 × 10−6m spectinomycin, with a complete recovery of cross-link frequency below 1 × 10−6m. The effects of tetracycline and spectinomycin were determined in 30 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes at Mg2+ concentrations from 0.5 to 50 mm. Mg2+ has been shown to govern the frequency of cross-linking of several cross-links including C967×C1400 and C1402×C1501 (10Noah J. Wollenzien P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15442-15448Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). C967×C1400 was inhibited at all Mg2+ concentrations, except that in 0.5 mmMg2+ in 30 S ribosomes, the frequency of the cross-link, even in the control sample, was too low to detect. The increase in the frequency of C1402×C1501 due to tetracycline was seen in 30 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes at all Mg2+ concentrations above 5 mm. Below 5 mm, no increase in C1402×C1501 could be seen (data not shown). The decrease in frequency of C934×U1345 due to spectinomycin did not change over the stated Mg2+ concentration range (data not shown). Several cross-links, C1400×C1501, C1402×C1501, and C1397×C1497, identified in the decoding region of 16 S rRNA nearly co-migrate in gel electrophoresis (10Noah J. Wollenzien P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15442-15448Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). There was a possibility that neomycin and streptomycin would affect the distribution of conformations in that region. However, no detectable changes in the analytical gel electrophoresis experiments involving these antibiotics were seen, nor were any changes seen in primer extension experiments (data not shown). Of the 13 antibiotics examined in this study, tetracycline and spectinomycin showed specific and different structural effects in 16 S rRNA that were detectable by the UV cross-linking assay. The inhibition of cross-links by these antibiotics correlates well with their known effective concentrations (14Semenkov Y.P. Makarov E.M. Makhno V.I. Kirillov S.V. FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Dragon F. Spickler C. Pinard R. Carriere J. Brakier-Gingras L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), indicating that the 16 S rRNA tertiary structure effects are linked to the loss of small subunit function during translation. For the tetracycline response, all three of the cross-links are affected at the same tetracycline concentration. Tetracycline has been shown to inhibit protein synthesis by interfering with the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Semenkov Y.P. Makarov E.M. Makhno V.I. Kirillov S.V. FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but it does not prevent the binding of tRNAPhe to the P-site (16Wurmbach P. Nierhaus K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, tetracycline has been reported to interfere with initiation factor-dependent tRNAfMet binding (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 17Sarkar S. Thaach R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 60: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In a study in which the binding of a fluorescent analogue of tetracycline, demeclocycline, was monitored, displacement of demeclocycline by tRNAfMet and by A-site tRNAPhebinding was confirmed (18Epe B. Woolley P. Hornig H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tetracycline did have an inhibitory effect on the P-site when the determination was done at high tRNA:70 S stoichiometries, and this was attributed to a fraction of ribosomes that bind tRNA in the P-site with lower affinity (19Geigenmuller U. Nierhaus K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Photochemical cross-linking experiments have shown that tetracycline cross-links primarily to protein S 7 and, to a lesser extent, S 18 and S 4 (20Goldman R.A. Hasan T. Hall C.C. Strycharz W.A. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). S 7 has been footprinted by both base modification and Fe2+/EDTA cleavage experiments to the lower part of domain III in 16 S rRNA (21Powers T. Noller H.F. RNA. 1995; 1: 194-209PubMed Google Scholar). More recent experiments have determined that with tetracycline concentrations lower than 4 × 10−5m, higher UV light flux, and shorter irradiation times (30 s), tetracycline cross-linked to 16 S rRNA itself at nucleotides G693 (near helix 23b), G1300, and G1338 (both of them near helix 42) (7Oehler R. Polacek N. Steiner G. Barta A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1219-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). At concentrations of ≥1.2 × 10−4m, additional cross-linking sites, including one at G890, are seen (7Oehler R. Polacek N. Steiner G. Barta A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1219-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In experiments done at 1 × 10−4m, tetracycline produced a strong chemical protection footprint in 16 S rRNA at nucleotide A892 and a weak reactivity enhancement of nucleotides U1052 and C1054 (3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) (see Fig.5). Recently, a C→G substitution at position 1058 granting resistance to tetracycline was reported (22Ross J.I. Eady E.A. Cunliffe W.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which also indicates that this region is connected to tetracycline function. Footprints for tRNA in the P-site include C1400, G1338, C967, and G693 (23Moazed D. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Because two of the three affected UV cross-links and all three tetracycline-RNA cross-links are associated with the tRNA P binding site, it is worthwhile to consider how tetracycline might interfere with A-site tRNA binding. Rodnina et. al. (24Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12267-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have investigated EFTu·aminoacyl tRNA·GTP binding and found that the rate and strength of the initial complex and the codon recognition complex were both enhanced by cognate tRNA bound to the P-site. This suggests an effect by the P-site-bound tRNA or some change in the ribosome that depends on P-site occupancy that influences the ternary complex-ribosome interaction. Therefore, alteration of the P-site by tetracycline may not affect the binding of tRNA in the P-site itself but may inhibit some conformational adjustment needed for tRNA binding to the A-site. The reported antibiotic binding sites (3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 7Oehler R. Polacek N. Steiner G. Barta A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1219-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the affected RNA cross-linking sites are compared in a 16 S rRNA three-dimensional model (Fig.6), 2M. A. Dolan, P. Babin, and P. Wollenzien, unpublished data. which shows the locations of the helices containing the tetracycline and spectinomycin binding sites and the RNA-RNA cross-links affected by their binding. This model is different from recent models (26Mueller F. Brimacombe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 524-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Malhotra A. Harvey S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 308-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Fink D.L. Chen R.O. Noller H.F. Altman R.B. RNA. 1996; 2: 851-866PubMed Google Scholar) in several regions because it incorporates new information including the UV cross-links C967×C1400 (9Wilms C. Noah J.W. Zhong D. Wollenzien P. RNA. 1997; 3: 602-612PubMed Google Scholar, 10Noah J. Wollenzien P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15442-15448Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), U793×G1517, and G976×G1361 3T. Shapkina, unpublished data. and site-specific psoralen cross-links (25Mundus D. Wollenzien P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 4D. Mundus, unpublished data. Approximate distances from G1300, G1338, and G693 to C1400 (the P-site) are 45, 35, and 25 Å, respectively, and distances from G1300, G1338, and G693 to A1408 (associated with the A-site) are 57, 50, and 36 Å, respectively. In another recently proposed model (26Mueller F. Brimacombe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 524-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the distances to C1400 are 67, 40, and 81Å, and the distances to A1408 are 95, 70, and 82 Å. In both models, the distances between the sites of tetracycline-RNA cross-linking (7Oehler R. Polacek N. Steiner G. Barta A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1219-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the P-site nucleotide C1400 (3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) are less than those to the A-site nucleotide A1408 (23Moazed D. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The molecular dimensions of tetracycline measure approximately 8 × 12 Å. Spectinomycin causes a structural change in domain III that results in a decrease in the frequency of cross-link C934×U1345. Spectinomycin causes a strong protection from chemical reactivity at C1063 and G1064 (see Fig. 5) and a weak enhancement of reactivity at G973 (3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). In addition, spectinomycin resistance is conferred by a C→A, G, U mutation at position 1192 in 16 S rRNA. Because overexpression of a fragment of helix 34 corresponding to nucleotides 1047–1067 and 1189–1210 (linked by a hairpin loop) also confers spectinomycin resistance (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the binding site is most likely located in helix 34. In addition, it was shown that susceptibility to spectinomycin could be restored in C1192 mutants by an additional U1351→C mutation in the top of helix 43 (15Dragon F. Spickler C. Pinard R. Carriere J. Brakier-Gingras L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The partial inhibition of cross-link C934×U1345 by spectinomycin supports evidence for an interplay between helix 34b and 43. The helix that contains the spectinomycin footprint at C1063 (helix 34b) and the nucleotides that form the C934×U1345 cross-link at the end of helix 28 are highlighted in the model (Fig. 6). The distance between these two regions is 12 Å in the model shown (Fig. 6), compared with 20 Å in the Mueller and Brimacombe (26Mueller F. Brimacombe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 524-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) model. A surprising result is that spectinomycin has no effect on the U1052×C1200 cross-link, which is in close proximity to both the resistance mutation site (C1192) (3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) and the proposed binding site in 16 S rRNA. In addition, there are no changes in the cross-links U1052×C1200, A1093×G1182, or U1126×C1281, all of which are located in domain III. This indicates that spectinomycin is not producing a global rearrangement of the domain III tertiary structure but rather some specific alteration of the structure near the junctions of helices 28, 29, and 43. It is known that spectinomycin interferes with elongation factor G binding during early rounds of protein synthesis (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that elongation factor G interacts with the 30 S subunit near the 1338 region (29Wilson K.S. Noller H.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); therefore, it also possible that the structural perturbation caused by spectinomycin alters elongation factor G association. The neomycin-type aminoglycosides (hygromycin, gentamycin, neomycin, and paromomycin) protect 16 S rRNA nucleotides A790, A791, A909, A1394, A1413, and G1487 and enhance reactivity at C525 (3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). These antibiotics are generally thought to induce miscoding by inhibiting A-site occupation and to inhibit translocation (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Streptomycin causes miscoding (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and protects 16 S rRNA nucleotides 911–915, nucleotides in the 1408–1418 and 1482–1494 regions, and nucleotide 1468 in 30 S subunits in 20 mm Mg2+ (3Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 30Spickler C. Brunelle M. Brakier-Gingras L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and binds to naked 16 S rRNA fragments of the decoding region in 20 mmMg2+. Viomycin and thiostrepton induce protections in both 16 S and 23 S rRNA (for viomycin, these are known to be protections at nucleotides 912–915), and both antibiotics also inhibit A-site occupation and cause miscoding (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It is thought that their binding restricts the ribosome conformation, thereby preventing A-site occupation or translocation (2Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). None of those antibiotics produces an observable effect in this experiment, so it is possible that these antibiotics interact with only a local region of the ribosome. Alternatively, the tertiary structure effects for the other antibiotics may be too subtle to detect by the present cross-linking, may be elicited only in the ribosome under working conditions, or may affect parts of the ribosome not monitored by the cross-links that are made by UV irradiation.

We cloned and sequenced cDNA encoding the small subunit of the chicken CAF-1, chCAF-1p48. It consists of 425 amino acid residues including a putative initiation Met, possesses seven WD repeat motifs, and contains only one amino acid change relative to the human and mouse CAF-1p48s. The immunoprecipitation experiment followed by Western blotting revealed that chCAF-1p48 interacts with chicken histone deacetylases (chHDAC-1 and -2) in vivo. The glutathione S-transferase pulldown affinity assay revealed the in vitro interaction of chCAF-1p48 with chHDAC-1, -2, and -3. We showed that the p48 subunit tightly binds to two regions of chHDAC-2, located between amino acid residues 82–180 and 245–314, respectively. We also established that two N-terminal, two C-terminal, or one N-terminal and one C-terminal WD repeat motif of chCAF-1p48 are required for this interaction, using deletion mutants of the respective regions. These results suggest that chCAF-1p48 is involved in many aspects of DNA-utilizing processes, through alterations in the chromatin structure based on both the acetylation and deacetylation of core histones.

Understanding the process of chromatin assembly in eukaryotes is a fundamental goal, because alterations in the chromatin structure have been thought to be predominantly involved in DNA-utilizing processes, such as replication, recombination, repair, and gene expression (1Svaren J.

CAF-1 is a complex of three polypeptides of 150 kDa (p150), 60 kDa (p60), and 48 kDa (p48) (12Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Kessler N. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1105-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). During DNA replication, CAF-1 assembles new nucleosomes through a two-step reaction (10Stillman B. Cell. 1986; 45: 555-565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Coupled to DNA replication, as the first step, histones H3 and H4 are deposited through a reaction that is preferentially dependent upon CAF-1, but histones H2A and H2B are added later to this immature nucleosome precursor, even in the absence of CAF-1 (12Kaufman P.D.

These results indicate that CAF-1 interacts preferentially with H3 and H4, whereas NAP-1 binds to H2A and H2B (2Krude T. Curr.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The WD protein family members, which are made up of highly conserved WD repeating units, found in eukaryotes, but not in prokaryotes, are involved in numerous biological processes such as signal transduction, RNA processing, gene expression, vesicular trafficking, and cell division (17Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Boguski M.S. Proteins. 1992; 13: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18van der Voorn L. Ploegh H.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Numbudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Thus, most of them seem to be regulatory, and none is an enzyme. The consensus core of the repeating unit, the WD repeat, usually ends with the characteristic sequence, Trp-Asp (WD), and such a conserved unit occurs four to ten times within each polypeptide (19Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Numbudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Each repeat comprises a region of variable length preceding a conserved core of about 30 amino acids (maximum range, 23–41 amino acids), ending with Gly-His (GH) and WD dipeptide residues. In addition, the number of amino acids from WD to the next downstream GH is very variable (6–94 amino acids), although shorter sequences are more common (112 residues long). All of these WD repeat proteins have been proposed to fold into propellers in which the internal β-strands form a rigid skeleton that is fleshed out on the surface by specialized loops to which other proteins bind (19Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Numbudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 20Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

The amino acid residues in the WD repeats of Tup1, the yeast repressor, that are required for the interaction of Tup1 with homeodomain protein α2 have been genetically identified (23Komachi K. Johnson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6023-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the WD40 domains of the Eed (embryonic ectoderm development) protein block its interaction with Ezh2, a mammalian homolog of theDrosophila enhancer of zeste [E(z)] (24Denisenko O. Shnyreva M. Suzuki H. Bomsztyk K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5634-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CAF-1p48, with seven WD repeat motifs, is a member of this WD repeat protein family. In recent years, knowledge concerning the characteristics of CAF-1s in the DNA-utilizing processes has been rapidly accumulated (9Ito T. Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For instance, CAF-1p48 was identified as a polypeptide that is tightly associated with the catalytic subunit of human histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1) (25Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). In addition, the smallest subunit of Drosophila CAF-1, p55, is homologous to a mammalian factor, RbAp48, associated with HDAC (26Tyler J.K. Bulger M. Kamakaka R.T. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6149-6159Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly,Drosophila p55 was reported to be an integral subunit of the nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) (27Martinez-Balbas M.A. Tsukiyama T. Gdula D. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, there was little information concerning the detailed mechanisms for the protein-protein interaction of CAF-1p48 in higher eukaryotes. In this study we first cloned the cDNA encoding chicken CAF-1p48, chCAF-1p48, and demonstrated that it tightly binds to chHDACs in vivo and in vitro. We describe the in vitrointeraction of chCAF-1p48 with two regions of chHDAC-2, comprising amino acid residues 82–180 and 245–314, respectively. We also describe that this interaction requires two N-terminal, two C-terminal, or one N-terminal plus one C-terminal WD repeat of chCAF-1p48, as deletion of the respective regions results in a loss of the binding activity. In this study the XL1-Blue MRF′ Escherichia coli strain, E. coli SORL strain (Stratagene), andE. coli BL-21 strain (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. pBluescript II SK(−) and pCite4a(−) were purchased from Promega. The pGEX-2TK gene fusion vector and glutathione-Sepharose beads were products of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Based on conserved amino acid sequences (LVMTHALEWP and PNEPWVICSV) in the mouse and human CAF-1p48s deduced from their cDNAs (15Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 25Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), sense and antisense degenerate oligonucleotide primers containing sequences 5′-YYTGGTBATGACCCATGCYCTKSAGTGGCCC-3′ and 5′-AYACDGARCAAATSACCCAAGGYTCATTGGG-3′, respectively, were constructed. A PCR product of 1082 base pairs, corresponding to a part of the coding regions of mammalian CAF-1p48s, was prepared from the chicken DT40 cDNAs using the two degenerate primers. To obtain full-length chCAF-1p48 cDNAs, using the resultant PCR product as a probe, we screened the DT40 λZAP II cDNA library constructed by us, 2Y. Takami, H. Kikuchi, and T. Nakayama, manuscript in preparation. using poly(A) mRNAs prepared from the chicken DT40 cell line, essentially as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The entire nucleotide sequences of both strands of the largest cDNA insert were sequenced by the dye terminator method (Applied Biosystems Division, Perkin-Elmer). To construct a vector, designated ptetHAchCAF-1p48, expressing chCAF-1p48 under the control of the tetracycline operator (tetO) and cytomegalovirus minimal promoter, cDNA encoding influenza HA epitope-tagged chCAF-1p48 was inserted into pUHD13-3 plasmid (29Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), concurrently replacing its constituent luciferase gene. To construct ptTA-bleo, a cassette of the bleomycin-resistant gene driven by β-actin promoter was inserted into the pUHD15-1 plasmid that contains tet-transactivator gene controlled by cytomegalovirus promoter (29Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). DT40 cells were co-transfected with ptet-HAchCAF-1p48 and ptTA-bleo, and the DT40 cell lines that express the HA-tagged chCAF-1p48 were selected by incubation in medium containing 0.3 mg/ml phleomycin (Sigma). Of these subclones, the clone (designated tetHAp48) that overexpresses the HA-tagged chCAF-1p48 in the absence of tetracycline was further selected. Cells (1.5 × 107) were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with occasional inversion. After standing for 30 min at 4 °C, the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant obtained was divided into two equal portions. To each portion, 5 μg of anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-FLAG antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) were added. After standing for 60 min on ice, protein G-Sepharose beads (40 μl) were added to the incubation mixture. Following gentle rotation for 5 h at 4 °C, the protein G-Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with 1 ml of RIPA buffer 4 times, and boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. The resultant immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, essentially as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Upon transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, proteins were probed with anti-HA antiserum or rabbit anti-chHDAC-1 and -2 antisera (against, respectively, recombinant chHDAC-1 and -2 C-terminal peptide-GST fusion proteins),2 using an ECL kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for HA antibody (Dako) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for chHDACs antibody were used as secondary antibodies. To construct the pGEX-2TKchCAF-1p48 plasmid, the NcoI/ScaI fragment containing the full-length chCAF-1p48 cDNA was excised from the parental chimeric plasmid (pB(II)SKp48), blunt-ended with T4 polymerase, and then subcloned into the SmaI site of the pGEX-2TK plasmid in frame. We also constructed the pGEX-2TKchHDAC-2 plasmid as follows. The parental chimeric plasmid (pB(II)SKchHDAC-2) carrying the full-length chHDAC-2 cDNA2 was digested with KpnI, followed by treatment with T4 polymerase. From the resultant blunt-ended material, the KpnI blunt-end/XbaI fragment containing the full-length chHDAC-2 cDNA was excised and subcloned between the BamHI (blunt-ended by T4 polymerase) and XbaI sites of the pGEX-2TK plasmid. We constructed the pCiteHDAC-1, -2, and -3 plasmids as follows. The three parental plasmids, pB(II)SKchHDAC-1, -2, and -3,2were digested with ClaI, blunt-ended with T4 polymerase, and then digested with NotI. The resultant blunt-endedClaI/NotI fragments, carrying the full-length chHDAC-1, -2, and -3 cDNAs, respectively, were subcloned between the MscI and NotI sites of the pCite4a(−) plasmid. Deletion mutants of chHDAC-2 were constructed as follows. TheStuI/PstI fragment encoding amino acids 82–488, the HincII/PstI fragment encoding amino acids 115–488, the XcmI/PstI fragment encoding amino acids 181–488, the NdeI/PstI fragment encoding amino acids 315–488, and the FspI/PstI fragment encoding amino acids 371–488 of chHDAC-2, respectively, were deleted by digestion of pCiteHDAC-2 with the corresponding enzymes and religated after being blunt-ended with T4 polymerase to generate pCiteHDAC-2-(1–81), pCiteHDAC-2-(1–114), pCiteHDAC-2-(1–180), pCiteHDAC-2-(1–314), and pCiteHDAC-2-(1–370). pCiteHDAC-2-(82–370), pCiteHDAC-2-(162–370), and pCiteHDAC-2-(245–370), respectively, were generated by digestion of pCiteHDAC-2-(1–370) with NcoI plus StuI, NcoI plus XcmI, and NcoI plus HincII, followed by religation. pCiteHDAC-2-(315–488) was generated by digestion of pCiteHDAC-2 with NcoI plusNdeI to delete the NcoI/NdeI fragment encoding amino acids 1–314, followed by religation. pCiteHDAC-2-(82–180) and pCiteHDAC-2-(245–314), respectively, were generated from pCiteHDAC-2-(82–370) and pCiteHDAC-2-(245–370) by digestion with XcmI plus BamHI andNdeI plus BamHI, followed by religation after being blunt-ended with T4 polymerase. We constructed the pCiteHAp48 plasmid, carrying both the full-length chCAF-1p48 cDNA and the HA fragment, as follows. TheNcoI/ScaI fragment carrying the full-length chCAF-1p48 cDNA was first excised from the parental pB(II)SKp48 plasmid, blunt-ended with T4 polymerase, and then ligated into theSmaI site of pGBT9 to yield pGBT9p48. TheNcoI/SalI fragment carrying the full-length chCAF-1p48 cDNA was excised from the resultant plasmid and introduced between the NcoI and SalI sites of the pCiteHA plasmid, carrying the HA sequence derived from pAS.1 (kindly provided by Dr. C. M. Tiree), which we constructed. We generated deletion mutants of chCAF-1p48 as follows. pCiteHAp48-(1–267) and pCiteHAp48-(1–375), respectively, were generated by excision of the XcmI/SalI fragment encoding amino acids 268–425 and the EcoRV/BamHI fragment encoding amino acids 376–425 from pCiteHAp48 by digestion with XcmI plus SalI and EcoRV plusBamHI, followed by religation after blunt-ending with Klenow polymerase. To generate pCiteHAp48-(1–328), theNcoI/BsaI fragment of chCAF-1p48 cDNA was excised from pCiteHAp48 and introduced between the NcoI andSalI sites of the same plasmid. pCiteHAp48-(55–425), pCiteHAp48-(139–425), and pCiteHAp48-(268–425), respectively, were generated by digestion of pCiteHAp48 with NcoI plusStuI, NcoI plus NsiI, andNcoI plus XcmI, and blunt-ended with T4 polymerase before religation. To generate pCiteHAp48-(181–425), we first constructed sense and antisense primers, containing sequences 5′-TATGGGTTGTCATGGAACCCAAACC-3′ and 5′-CATGGCCATATGACCACCCAAGCTA-3′, respectively, corresponding to amino acids 181–188 of chCAF-1p48 and amino acids 12–19 of HA. Next we prepared the DNA fragment without that encoding amino acids 1–180, by PCR using pCiteHAp48 as a template with these two primers and then ligated the resultant PCR product to yield pCiteHAp48-(181–425). pCiteHAp48-(55–375) and pCiteHAp48-(139–375) were generated by excision of theEcoRV/BamHI fragment encoding amino acids 376–425 from pCiteHAp48-(55–425) and pCiteHAp48-(139–425), respectively, and religated after blunt-ending with T4 polymerase. Each end point of the deletions was determined by sequence analysis involving the dye terminator method. E. coli BL-21 cells were transformed with pGEX-2TKchCAF-1p48 and pGEX-2TKchHDAC-2, respectively, harboring the full-length chCAF-1p48 and chHDAC-2 cDNAs and grown to A 600 nm = ∼0.2 in 400 ml of LB medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin. Upon induction with 50 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at 20 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% (v/v) phenylbenzosulfonyl fluoride and 1 mg/ml lysozyme, in liquid N2 for 2 min, followed by ultrasonication for 3 min. Continuously, the cell lysate was added to Sarkosyl to a final concentration of 1%. After standing for 60 min, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and then the cell lysate was allowed to stand for an additional 30 min. The cell homogenate thus prepared was subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant obtained was mixed with 1 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads for 4 h with gentle rotation. The GST fusion protein-bound beads were collected by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 2 min and washed with the lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% phenylbenzosulfonyl fluoride four times, then with phosphate-buffered saline buffer once. The GST fusion proteins were eluted with 4 ml of 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and the resultant eluate was concentrated with a Millipore membrane, followed by the addition of glycerol to a final concentration of 20%. The samples obtained were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, essentially as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To produce [35S]Met-labeled full-length chCAF-1p48 and chHDAC-1, -2, and -3, a set of truncated mutants of chCAF-1p48, and a set of truncated mutants of chHDAC-2, the TnT-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) was used. In vitro binding assays were performed using 5 μl of [35S]Met-labeled protein fractions and 4 μg of the GST fusion proteins or 6 μg of GST, prepared as described, in 200 μl of bead-binding buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 450 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA). After 1 h of standing, the reaction mixture was added to 20 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads, containing 10 mg/ml BSA and 4 μg of EtBr, followed by gentle rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The affinity beads were collected by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 2 min and then washed with 1 ml of the bead-binding buffer without BSA and EtBr but containing 0.1% phenylbenzosulfonyl fluoride five times. The beads were suspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and then boiled for 5 min. Aliquots (15 μl) of the resultant eluates were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, and then the gels were stained, dried, and subjected to fluorography. To determine unequivocally the identification of chCAF-1p48 as a novel subunit of CAF-1, we cloned and sequenced its cDNA. Based on conserved amino acid sequences (the corresponding sequences in the chicken homolog areunderlined in Fig.1 A) in the mouse and human CAF-1p48s (15Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 25Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), we prepared the 1082-base pair PCR fragment, corresponding to a part of cDNAs encoding the mammalian p48 subunits, by PCR using cDNAs from DT40 cells with degenerate primers, i.e. a sense primer and an antisense primer. Our screening, using the resultant PCR product, of a DT40 λZAP II cDNA library2 yielded 11 positive cDNA clones. Sequence analysis of the largest cDNA insert of 2405 base pairs of the 11 cDNA clones revealed that the clone designated as 5 contained both an initiation codon and a 3′ poly(A) tail and thus appeared to contain the full-length sequence of the chicken CAF-1p48 cDNA. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are presented in Fig.1 A. The chicken protein comprises 425 amino acid residues including a putative initiation Met and contains only one amino acid alteration relative to the human and mouse CAF-1p48s (15Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 25Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The alteration in the amino acid sequence is Asn, instead of Tyr, at position 409. Thus, this protein exhibits 99.8%, 93.9%, and 90.4% identity in amino acid sequence to the human and mouse CAF-1p48s, human and mouse CAF-1p46s (15Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 25Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), and Drosophila CAF-1p55 (or NURF-55) (26Tyler J.K. Bulger M. Kamakaka R.T. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6149-6159Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Martinez-Balbas M.A. Tsukiyama T. Gdula D. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), respectively. Therefore, it is the chicken homolog of mammalian CAF-1p48s and is designated as chCAF-1p48 (GenBankTM accession number AF097750). Therefore, chCAF-1p48 is a member of the WD repeat protein family and possesses seven copies of the WD motif, a motif of 37–61 amino acid residues, including a WD, FD, or WN dipeptide (Fig. 1 B). Like most proteins containing WD repeats, chCAF-1p48 is expected not only to physically associate with other proteins but also to act as a scaffold upon which multimeric complexes can be built. To determine whether or not chCAF-1p48 binds to these chHDACs in vivo, Western blotting, using anti-chHDAC-1 and -2 antisera, against, respectively, recombinant chHDAC-1 and -2 C-terminal peptide-GST fusion proteins was carried out. DT40 cells were first co-transfected with ptet-HAchCAF-1p48 and ptTA-bleo, and the transfected cells that express the HA-tagged chCAF-1p48 were selected with phleomycin. A cell line (tetHAp48) overexpressing the HA-tagged protein in the absence of tetracycline was established. Proteins in the lysate of tetHAp48 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antiserum. The immunoprecipitated samples, together with the tetHAp48 lysate and the DT40 cell lysate, were subjected to Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2 A, anti-HA antiserum recognized a protein species of the same size as the HA-tagged chCAF-1p48 present in the tetHAp48 cell lysate and the anti-HA antiserum-precipitated sample, but not the anti-FLAG antiserum-precipitated sample or the DT40 cell lysate. In the case of the immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antiserum, the band corresponding to the HA-tagged chCAF-1p48 migrated very closely to that of mouse IgG heavy chain present in the sample immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antiserum. In contrast, anti-chHDAC-1 antiserum recognized the protein band corresponding to chHDAC-1 in the cell lysates of both tetHAp48 and DT40 cells (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, as expected, the same (chHDAC-1) band showed up for the sample immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antiserum but not that immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antiserum. Similarly, anti-chHDAC-2 antiserum recognized the band corresponding to chHDAC-2 in the lysates of both tetHAp48 and DT40 cells, as well as the sample immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antiserum (Fig. 2 C). Reasonably, no band showed up for the sample immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antiserum. These results indicate clearly that both chHDAC-1 and -2 were present in the sample immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antiserum, suggesting that the two enzymes bind tightly to chCAF-1p48 in vivo. To construct a chimeric plasmid, pGEX-2TKchCAF-1p48, expressing the GST-chCAF-1p48 fusion protein, chCAF-1p48 cDNA was subcloned into the pGEX-2TK plasmid in frame. GST fusion proteins were synthesized in E. coli, extracted, and purified essentially as described above. As shown in Fig. 3, the electrophoretic patterns on SDS-PAGE of whole cell lysates before and after the induction with IPTG revealed that GST-chCAF-1p48 fusion proteins of approximately 74 kDa were dramatically accumulated inE. coli BL-21 cells containing the pGEX-2TKchCAF-1p48 plasmid. In addition, the GST-chCAF-1p48 fusion proteins were purified to more than 95% homogeneity, using glutathione-agarose beads (seelane 3 in Fig. 3). We cloned and sequenced three cDNAs, encoding chHDAC-1, -2, and -3, respectively, which comprise 480, 488, and 428 amino acid residues, including a putative initiation Met.2 Compared with chHDAC-1 and -2, the C-terminal region of chHDAC-3 is about 50 amino acids shorter. However, in the corresponding regions all three chHDACs exhibit extensive homology (95%). Furthermore, we recently developed E. coli systems with which all of chHDAC-1, -2, and -3 could be dramatically synthesized. These recombinant chHDAC-1, -2, and -3, like recombinant maize HDAC-2 expressed in E. coli (30Lusser A. Brosch G. Loidl A. Haas H. Loidl P. Science. 1997; 277: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), exhibited little enzymatic activity in vitro(data not shown). As discussed previously (30Lusser A. Brosch G. Loidl A. Haas H. Loidl P. Science. 1997; 277: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the problem may be due to (i) the fact that the chicken and maize enzymes are active only when assembled as correct complexes, (ii) the incorrect folding of recombinant HDACs, or (iii) the requirement of certain post-translational modifications, e.g. phosphorylation, for the active enzymes. Despite their lack of enzymatic activities, recombinant chHDAC-1, -2, and -3 probably have maintained the correct conformations to interact with chCAF-1p48. To determine whether or not the p48 subunit binds to these three chHDACs, therefore, the GST pulldown affinity assay was carried out. chHDAC-1, -2, and -3 were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]Met and then assayed as to their abilities to interact with chCAF-1p48. Each sample was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue, followed by fluorography. As shown in Fig. 4, the GST-chCAF-1p48 fusion protein bound to all of chHDAC-1, -2, and -3, whereas under the same conditions β-galactosidase did not bind to it, and GST alone also exhibited no interaction with these three chHDACs. These findings were confirmed by an immunoprecipitation experiment involving anti-chCAF-1p48 antiserum (data not shown), suggesting the existence of a region(s) conserved in chHDAC-1, -2, and -3 to which chCAF-1p48 binds. To determine the putative binding region(s), which should be conserved in the three chHDACs, we first constructed a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of chHDAC-2 and studied their in vitro interaction with the GST-chCAF-1p48 fusion protein (Fig.5). Three deletion mutant proteins, ΔchHDAC-2-(1–370), ΔchHDAC-2-(1–314), and ΔchHDAC-2-(1–180), exhibited similar binding activity toward the parental chHDAC-2 protein. On the other hand, two other mutant proteins, ΔchHDAC-2-(1–114) and ΔchHDAC-2-(1–81), exhibited no binding activity. These findings suggested that the region comprising amino acids 115–180 of chHDAC-2 is necessary for its binding to chCAF-1p48. Next we constructed a series of mutants with simultaneous deletion of both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of chHDAC-2 and assayed their binding activities essentially as described above. Fig. 5 shows that ΔchHDAC-2-(245–370), like ΔchHDAC-2-(82–370) and ΔchHDAC-2-(162–370), exhibited binding activity, although it even lacks the region comprising amino acids 115–180. In addition, ΔchHDAC-2-(315–488), lacking the N-terminal region comprising amino acids 1–314, exhibited no activity, whereas ΔchHDAC-2-(1–314) bearing the same N-terminal region exhibited the binding ability. These results suggested that two possible binding regions of chHDAC-2 as to chCAF-1p48 are located between amino acids 115–180 and amino acids 245–314, respectively, and that either is enough as the binding region. Finally, to confirm these results we constructed two mutant proteins, ΔchHDAC-2-(82–180) and ΔchHDAC-2-(245–314), and studied their binding activities. As expected, the two regions definitely interacted with chCAF-1p48, indicating that either is enough for thein vitro interaction with chCAF-1p48. Moreover, the findings that both regions were extensively conserved within chHDAC-1 and -3,2 as in homologs from other organisms, and that chCAF-1p48 bound to the two chHDACs (see Fig. 4) suggest the possible involvement of the two corresponding domains of all HDACs in theirin vitro interactions with CAF-1p48. To clarify the putative binding domain(s) of chCAF-1p48 as to chHDAC-2, we first constructed a series of C-terminal truncated mutants of HA-tagged chCAF-1p48 and studied the in vitrointeraction with the GST-chHDAC-2 fusion protein, essentially as described above. Two truncated proteins, ΔchCAF-1p48-(1–328) and ΔchCAF-1p48-(1–267), exhibited no binding activity, although the other one (ΔchCAF-1p48-(1–375)) exhibited binding activity similar to that of the parental chCAF-1p48 protein (Fig.6). These findings suggested that the deletion of the region comprising amino acids 329–375, in addition to the C-terminal region comprising amino acids 376–425, resulted in the loss of the binding activity. Next we constructed a series of N-terminal truncated mutants of HA-tagged chCAF-1p48 and studied their binding abilities as to chHDAC-2, essentially as described above. As shown in Fig. 6, the abilities of two truncated mutant proteins, ΔchCAF-1p48-(55–425) and ΔchCAF-1p48-(139–425), were the same as that of the parental chCAF-1p48 protein. On the other hand, two other truncated proteins, ΔchCAF-1p48-(181–425) and ΔchCAF-1p48-(268–425), did not exhibit the ability. These results indicated that the deletion of the region comprising amino acids 139–180, in addition to the N-terminal region comprising amino acids 1–138, resulted in the loss of the binding ability. Moreover, we constructed two truncated mutants, respectively, with simultaneous deletion of both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of chCAF-1p48 and assayed their binding activities. The results obtained indicated that ΔchCAF-1p48-(55–375) exhibited the activity but ΔchCAF-1p48-(139–375) had lost it, whereas both mutants similarly lacked the C-terminal region comprising amino acids 376–425. Our analyses, like these, of a series of deletion mutant proteins of chCAF-1p48 revealed several noticeable features regarding its binding ability as to chHDAC-2 as follows. First the finding that ΔchCAF-1p48-(1–375) exhibited the binding activity but ΔchCAF-1p48-(1–328) did not revealed that a lack or disruption of two C-terminal WD repeats causes loss of the binding ability. Second, the finding that ΔchCAF-1p48-(139–425) possessed the binding activity but ΔchCAF-1p48-(181–425) had lost it revealed that a lack or disruption of two N-terminal WD repeats results in loss of the binding ability. Third, the finding that the two mutants, ΔchCAF-1p48-(139–425) and ΔchCAF-1p48-(55–375), exhibited the binding activity but ΔchCAF-1p48-(139–375) did not revealed that the simultaneous lack of an N-terminal WD repeat and a C-terminal one also causes loss of the binding ability. Taken together our results indicate that among the seven WD repeats of chCAF-1p48, two N-terminal, two C-terminal, or one N-terminal and one C-terminal, one is necessary for the in vitro interaction of the p48 subunit with chHDAC-2. Eukaryotic HDACs, like acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases, are members of a deacetylase superfamily of proteins that not only recognize an acetylaminopropyl group and catalyze the removal of an acetyl group by cleaving a non-peptide amide bond but also that share nine blocks, 1 to 9, exhibiting considerable sequence homology (31Leipe D.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3693-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). All of them are located in the approximately two-thirds N-terminal region of each of three chHDACs.2 Two binding domains, designated as BD1 and BD2, comprising amino acids 82–180 (in fact, probably 115–180) and amino acids 245–314 of chHDAC-2 (Fig. 5), respectively, contain blocks 3, 4, and 5 plus approximately half of the N-terminal region of block 6 and approximately half of the C-terminal region of block 8 plus block 9. BD1 and BD2 are also both located in the corresponding regions of chHDAC-1 and -3 as in those of other mammalian HDAC homologs (25Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 32Bartl S. Taplick J. Lagger G. Khier H. Kuchler K. Seiser C. Mol. Cell.

To determine how this interaction of BD1 and/or BD2 with chCAF-1p48 is involved in DNA-utilizing processes, such as replication, recombination, repair, and gene expression, further studies must be performed. The amino acid sequence of chCAF-1p48 shows that it is a member of the superfamily of WD repeat proteins (Fig. 1). All of the seven WD repeats found in it well match those in the small subunits of CAF-1s in most eukaryotes (15Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 25Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 27Martinez-Balbas M.A. Tsukiyama T. Gdula D. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). chCAF-1p48 exhibits binding ability as to chHDAC-2 (and chHDAC-1 and 3) when the second WD dipeptide motif and the shorter region of 13 amino acids preceding it remain, but the p48 subunit loses the ability when both the first and second WD repeats with the variable region of 27 amino acids just behind the second WD dipeptide motif are lacking (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the binding ability of chCAF-1p48 disappears when the region of 16 amino acids preceding the sixth WD dipeptide motif, together with this motif and the seventh one, is lacking. Conversely, the ability does not change even when the shorter region of 6 amino acids preceding the seventh WD dipeptide motif, together with both this motif and the C-terminal region of the protein, is lacking. Interestingly, even when the first WD repeat plus the region of 44 amino acids just behind the first FD dipeptide motif, or the shorter region of 6 amino acids preceding the seventh WN dipeptide motif plus the C-terminal region is independently deleted, no influence is observed on the binding ability of chCAF-1p48; however, the simultaneous deletion of the two N-terminal and C-terminal portions abolishes the binding ability of chCAF-1p48 (Fig. 6). The findings made based on the in vitro assay system most likely reflected what happens in vivo because chCAF-1p48 also interacted with chHDAC-1 and -2 in the in vivo experiment (see Fig. 2). Based on the results obtained for a series of truncated mutant proteins of chCAF-1p48, we propose a model for its interaction with chHDAC-2. As in most WD proteins (19Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Numbudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), the WD repeat motifs of chCAF-1p48 should form a β-propeller structure, wherein each of the seven “blades” contains the amino acid residues of one WD repeat unit and probably function as a common platform for the protein-protein interaction involved in chromatin metabolism. At least two N-terminal WD repeats and two C-terminal WD repeats, respectively, are predominantly involved in maintaining the propeller structure. Deletion of the two N-terminal WD repeats with the shorter region preceding the second FD dipeptide motif or that of the two C-terminal WD repeats with the shorter region preceding the sixth WD dipeptide motif causes destruction of the proper surface loops and turns. This structural change does not allow the interaction of chCAF-1p48 with chHDAC-2, probably with BD1 and/or BD2. Similarly, simultaneous deletion of the first N-terminal WD repeat with the shorter region preceding the second FD dipeptide motif and of the last C-terminal WN dipeptide motif with the shorter region preceding the motif does not allow the propeller structure to be maintained properly, resulting in loss of the binding activity. The overall picture concerning the in vivo interaction of chCAF-1p48 with chHDACs will be clarified, using gene targeting techniques, with the DT40 chicken B cell line, which incorporates foreign DNA by targeted integration at frequencies similar to those for random integration (34Buerstedde J.-M.

The full-length human DDI A121 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 113 amino acids, corresponding to a protein of 12.7 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of A121 shows high homology to the yeast translation initiation factor (eIF) sui1 and also exhibits perfect identity to the partial sequence of recently purified human eIF1. Expression of human A121 corrected the mutant sui1 phenotype in yeast, demonstrating that human A121 encodes abona fide translation initiation factor that is equivalent to yeast sui1p. The mammalian A121/SUI1 gene exhibits two transcripts (1.35 kilobases and 0.65 kilobases) containing a common coding region but differing in their 3′-untranslated region. The long and short A121/SUI1 mRNAs are differentially regulated by genotoxic and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The genotoxic stress induction of A121/SUI1 mRNA is conserved in both humans and rodents and occurs in a p53-independent manner. Our identification of a stress-inducible cDNA that encodes eIF1 suggests that modulation of translation initiation appears to occur during cellular stress and may represent an important adaptive response to genotoxic as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Our identification of a stress-inducible cDNA that encodes eIF1 suggests that modulation of translation initiation appears to occur during cellular stress and may represent an important adaptive response to genotoxic as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress. DNA damage (genotoxic stress) can be induced by exogenous agents including radiation and chemicals or by endogenous processes involving the generation of reactive oxygen species (reviewed in Ref. 1Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Cellular response to genotoxic stress is complex and affects a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, replication, transcription, signal transduction, DNA repair, mutagenesis, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Fornace Jr., A.J.

A number of different genes have been identified which are believed to affect these cellular processes in response to genotoxic stress (reviewed in Ref. 1Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Low ratio hybridization subtraction has been previously used in this laboratory to isolate and clone a number of genotoxic stress-inducible genes including five GADD (growth arrest andDNA damage-inducible) genes (3Fargnoli J.

Lord K.A. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The hamsterGADD33 gene is equivalent to the human cornifin gene that is involved in keratinocyte differentiation (1Fornace Jr., A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), whereas GADD7 does not appear to code for a protein product (7Hollander M.C. Alamo I. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 12: 387-395Google Scholar). The expression of theGADD genes has been shown to be regulated by a number of genotoxic and nongenotoxic stresses (Ref. 8Sheikh M.S. Carrier F.

In addition to GADD genes, the cDNAs representing p21 WAF1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, initiation factor 5 (eIF5), 2The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factor; MMS, methylmethane sulfonate; DDI, DNA damage-inducible; EST, expressed sequence-tagged; DBHQ, 2, 5-di-tert-butylhydroquninone; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. and thrombomodulin genes were also detected as genotoxic stress-inducible transcripts in the same enriched library (8Sheikh M.S.

In an attempt to identify and clone the genes corresponding to the remaining novel genotoxic stress-inducible transcripts present within the same library, we have recently cloned and characterized a novel genotoxic stress-inducible gene (8Sheikh M.S.

This gene, named A18 heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein(18hnRNP) is specifically regulated by UV and UV-mimetic agents and encodes a putative glycine-rich RNA and DNA-binding protein (8Sheikh M.S.

In the current study, we report the cloning and characterization of another human gene that corresponds to one of the previously uncharacterized genotoxic stress-inducible transcripts named A121. The full-length cDNA of human A121 encodes translation eIF1, showing a high homology to the yeast translation initiation factor sui1. The following cell lines were used in this study: MCF-7, breast carcinoma cells; RKO, colon carcinoma cells; A549 and H1299 lung carcinoma cells; Sk-N-SH, neuroblastoma cells; OVCAR, ovarian carcinoma cells; HL60, promyelocytic leukemia cells; ML-1, myeloid leukemia cells; WMN, Burkitt's lymphoma cells; GM536, lymphoblastoma cells. Cellular exposure to UV or ionizing radiation and treatment with MMS were as described previously (4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 9Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell.

For treatment with thapsigargin (LC Laboratories) and 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquninone (DBHQ) (Sigma), exponentially growing cells were treated with 2 μm thapsigargin or 50 μm DBHQ for various time points, and cells were harvested for RNA extraction. The low ratio hybridization subtraction procedure and construction of the original DDI library have been described previously (4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In brief, Chinese hamster ovary cells in logarithmic phase of growth were exposed to 14 J/m2 UV, and 4 h later, poly (A)+ RNA was extracted. Poly(A)+ RNA from UV-irradiated cells was reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cDNAs, which were then hybridized at a high Rot with poly(A)+ RNA from unirradiated cells. The single-stranded cDNA was obtained from cDNA:RNA hybrids after alkali treatment and hybridized to the original irradiated poly(A)+ RNA, and the resulting DNA:RNA duplexes were obtained using a hydroxylapatite column. Single-stranded DNA was isolated from the cDNA:RNA duplex and subsequently used for second strand synthesis. The double-stranded cDNAs were subcloned into a plasmid pXF3 using a GC-tailing method (3Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The partial-length clones in the DDI library were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method as described previously (4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The hamster DDI A121 clone was 298 base pairs long; a human EST clone 117124 (accession numberT87717) showing high homology to the nucleotide sequence of hamster DDI A121 was obtained from IMAGE Consortium, LLNL (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) and sequenced in its entirety. The sequence information from the EST clone revealed the presence of a polyadenylation signal and a poly(A) tail, suggesting that the EST clone 117124 corresponded to the 3′-end of the gene. Based on the EST sequence information, we synthesized primers corresponding to the most 5′-end of the EST sequence to amplify the remaining 5′-end of the cDNA from a human placenta Marathon-Ready cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). This library contains adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNA and the adaptor sequence serves as the 5′ or 3′ primer. The adaptor sequence specific primer 5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′ was used as 5′-primer, and the gene-specific primer 5′-CTATCACCTCGCTAGCGG-3′ was used as 3′-primer in the amplification reactions. The amplification conditions were as follows: one cycle of 1 min at 94 °C; 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 4 min at 68 °C; and then 1 cycle of 4 min at 68 °C. The amplified products were gel-purified and cloned into a TA-cloning vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Several independent clones were analyzed for the presence of the amplified inserts, and the two largest cDNA clones representing the 5′-end of human A121 were sequenced in their entirety. Both of these clones, which were otherwise identical, differed in length from each other at their 5′-ends by 107 nucleotides and were collinear at their 3′-ends with the EST clone 117124. Homology searches using GenBank™/EBI and EST data banks identified a number of EST clones exhibiting nucleotide sequence corresponding to the coding region of our human A121 cDNA. These EST sequences have also been aligned to obtain a computer-generated open reading frame (10Fields C. Adams M.D. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). RNA extraction and Northern and quantitative dot blot hybridizations were performed as we have described previously (11Sheikh M.S. Burns T.F. Huang Y. Wu G.S. Amundson S. Brooks K.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1593-1598PubMed Google Scholar). A phosphoimager, β-scope, and a light densitometer were used to quantitate the signals. The cDNA probes used in this study include a hamster 298-base pair A121 cDNA clone corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region and a human A121 cDNA clones corresponding to the complete open reading frame and the 3′-untranslated region. For human eIF1A cDNA probe, a human EST clone (380394) carrying the human eIF1A cDNA was obtained from IMAGE consortium, LLNL. The following strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used in this study: Y157, MATαleu2 trp1 his4–303(AUU) ura3–52::his4(AUU)-lacZ sui1–1; Y158,MAT αleu2 trp1 his4–303(AUU) ura3–52::his4(AUU)-lacZ sui2–1; Y244, MAT αleu2 trp1 his4–303(AUU) ura3–52::his4(AUU)-lacZ SUI3–3; Y159, MAT αleu2 trp1 his4–303(AUU) ura3–52::his4(AUU)-lacZ. YPAD and synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophans (H-trp) were as previously reported (12Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Peltz S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5726-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,13Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. Peltz S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1506-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Temperature sensitivity of yeast strains was confirmed by plating them onto (H-leu, -trp) medium and by testing their growth at 30 or 37 °C. The yeast expression vector pG-1 (14Schena M. Yamamoto K. Science. 1988; 241: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) carries the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter and the phosphatidylglycerol kinase 1 terminator sequences. Human A121 cDNA carrying the entire open reading frame and the 3′-untranslated region up to the first poly(A) signal was subcloned into pG-1 under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter to create pJD176F. Transformation of yeast and Escherichia coliwere performed as described previously (12Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Peltz S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5726-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. Peltz S. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5726-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. Peltz S. Mol. Cell.

Carrier F. Papathanasiou M.A. Hollander M.C. Zhan Q. Yu K. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the cDNAs representing the DDI transcripts in the original hamster library were only partial length and ranged in size from 0.2–0.5 kilobases. These cDNAs were sequenced, and the sequence information was used to search the sequence data banks. The partial-length sequence of the original hamster DDI clone named A121 exhibited high homology (84.3%) to several human EST sequences. These EST clones did not show homology to the sequences of known genes deposited in the public data banks, suggesting that they represented a potentially novel gene. The sequence information from EST clone 117124 (accession number T87717) was used to screen a human placenta cDNA library as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The complete nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA of human DDI A121 is shown in Fig.1. The 1312-nucleotide-long human A121 cDNA contains an open reading frame predicted to code for a 113-amino acid-long protein of 12.7 kDa. The BLASTX alignment of the predicted protein sequence of the human A121 cDNA with other protein sequences in the data banks revealed that human A121 is homologous to a less well characterized yeast translation initiation factor named sui1 (16Yoon H.J. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 248-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, the deduced amino acid sequence of human A121 is aligned with the predicted amino acid sequences from various species. As is shown, human A121 (hereafter referred to as A121/SUI1) shows a high degree of homology to the corresponding proteins from other species including mouse, chick, mosquito, flower, and yeast.Figure 2Amino acid sequence alignment of human A121/SUI1 with the corresponding amino acid sequences from other species.

Chick and mouse sequences are partial-length, and the dashesrepresent gaps that were introduced to achieve better sequence alignment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A121/SUI1 gene displayed two major transcripts of ∼1.35 and ∼0.65 kilobases in size, with some heterogeneity occurring in their expression in various tissues (Fig.3). The two A121/SUI1 transcripts could result from alternative splicing or from the differential usage of polyadenylation signals. Sequence analysis of the 3′-untranslated region of the human A121/SUI1 cDNA revealed the presence of two polyadenylation signals, suggesting that the latter possibility was more likely. To further investigate this issue, we performed Northern analyses using two cDNA probes corresponding to the different regions of human A121/SUI1 cDNA. Probe A (Fig. 3) corresponds to the entire open reading frame and part of the 3′-untranslated sequence up to the first polyadenylation signal, whereas probe B (Fig. 3) represents the 3′-untranslated sequence downstream of the first polyadenylation signal. The results of Northern analyses shown in Fig.3 demonstrate that probe A detects two transcripts, whereas probe B detects only the larger 1.35-kilobase transcript on the same blots; this was true in both human and mouse tissues. These results highlight that indeed the two A121/SUI1 transcripts differ from each other at their 3′-untranslated region and most likely result because of the alternative use of polyadenylation signals. These results also explain why the hamster cDNA probe, which correspond to the 3′-untranslated region, detected only the larger transcript. Because the human EST sequences correspond to the 3′-untranslated region of human A121/SUI1 and not to the coding region, the above findings may also explain why the former did not display homology to sui1 from yeast and other species. The expression of hamster A121 transcripts was induced by the genotoxic agents UV, UV mimetic agents, and MMS in Chinese hamster ovary cells; a number of other agents, by contrast, did not modulate A121 expression in hamster cells. TableI summarizes the overall effects of various stress-inducing agents on A121 mRNA regulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells. We next sought to investigate the regulation of human A121/SUI1 in response to genotoxic and nongenotoxic stress in human cells. Our results demonstrated that human A121/SUI1 mRNA was induced by MMS in all the cell lines tested, whereas its induction in response to UV was cell type-specific. Ionizing radiation (γ-rays, 5 to 20 gray), on the other hand, did not regulate human A121/SUI1 expression in any of the human cell lines tested. The overall effects of MMS and UV on A121/SUI1 mRNA expression in the various cell lines are outlined in Table II.Table IA121 mRNA regulation by different stress-inducing agents in Chinese hamster ovary cellsAgentDoseTimeA121 mRNA inductionUV and UV mimeticUV14 J/m24 h+Near UV300 J/m24 h+N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorine20 μm4 h+Cisplatin45 μg/ml4 h+Nitrogen mustard40 μm4 h+Base damagingMMS100 μg/ml4 h+IR and radiomimeticIR5 gray4 hNo inductionAdriamycin0.4 μg/ml1 hNo inductionBleomycin50 μg/ml1 hNo inductionOthersSerum starvation48 hNo inductionHeat shock45.5 °C9 minNo inductionH2O20.4 mm1 hNo inductionCells were treated with the indicated agents and harvested for poly(A)+ RNA extraction and quantitative dot blot hybridization.

A partial-length hamster cDNA probe was used in the hybridization reactions; values were normalized with respect to corresponding poly(U) signals. The cut-off value for A121 mRNA induction (“+” sign) was considered 2-fold and higher. Cells were exposed to MMS (100 μg/ml) or UV irradiation (14 J/m2) and 4 h later were harvested for RNA extraction and quantitative dot blot hybridization. Values of one representative experiment are given, which were normalized with respect to the corresponding poly(U) signals. ND, not determined. MMS up-regulates only the larger A121 transcript and not the smaller transcript (see below), suggesting that MMS appears to mediate A121 regulation via elements that reside in the 3′-untranslated region. We next investigated the effects of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on the MMS induction of human A121/SUI1 mRNA. As shown in Fig.4, actinomycin D blocked the MMS induction of A121/SUI1 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells; cycloheximide alone, by contrast, enhanced the mRNA levels of A121/SUI1 and further potentiated the MMS effect on A121/SUI1 mRNA levels. These results suggest that new protein synthesis is not required for the MMS-mediated increase in the A121/SUI1 mRNA levels. These results also suggest that the constitutive A121/SUI1 mRNA levels appear to be negatively regulated by certain labile protein factors. Similar experiments were also performed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and identical results were obtained (data not shown). We next sought to determine whether the expression of A121/SUI1 can also be modulated by conditions that primarily cause ER stress. Thapsigargin and DBHQ are specific inhibitors of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport ATPases. By inhibiting sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport ATPases, these agents block the re-uptake of cytosolic Ca2+ into the ER, resulting in depletion of Ca2+ from the ER Ca2+ storage compartments. Stress inflicted upon cells by depletion of these Ca2+pools can have profound effects on cell growth (18Hussain A. Garnett C. Klein M.G. Tsai-Wu J.-J. Schneider M.F. Inesi G. J. Biol.

Treatment of MCF-7 cells with either thapsigargin or DBHQ for 4 and 24 h results in induction of A121/SUI1 mRNA levels when compared with untreated cells (Fig.5), and the degree of increase in the A121/SUI1 mRNA levels appear to parallel that seen with MMS (Fig.5). These data suggest that the induction of A121/SUI1 may represent a stress response that occurs when cells are exposed to injury (genotoxic or otherwise). It is also of note that unlike MMS and UV irradiation (see below), which up-regulate only the larger transcript, the ER stress-inducing agents up-regulate both transcripts (Fig. 5), suggesting that the potential mechanisms of A121/SUI1 mRNA regulation by genotoxic stress and ER stress might be different. The levels of wild-type p53 protein are enhanced by genotoxic agents such as ionizing radiation, UV, and MMS (Ref. 11Sheikh M.S. Burns T.F. Huang Y. Wu G.S. Amundson S. Brooks K.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1593-1598PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). p53 in turn transcriptionally up-regulates the expression of its downstream effector genes (11 and references therein). To ascertain whetherA121/SUI1 is a p53-regulated gene, we investigated the genotoxic stress regulation of A121 in p53 wild-type and p53 knock-out cells. Primary keratinocytes obtained from p53 wild-type and p53-knock-out mice were exposed to MMS and UV irradiation, and the effect on A121/SUI1 expression was investigated. As shown in Fig.6, MMS and UV induction of A121/SUI1 mRNA was noted in both genotypes, and the lack of p53 did not considerably affect the extent of A121/SUI1 mRNA induction. Again, the data in Fig. 6 show that both MMS and UV irradiation predominantly up-regulate the larger A121/SUI1 transcript. These results demonstrate that the genotoxic stress regulation of A121/SUI1 mRNA is conserved in humans and rodents and that it occurs in a p53-independent manner. Pestova et al. (20Pestova T.V. Borukhov S. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) recently purified and partially sequenced the human eIF1 and eIF1A proteins. The sequence (GDDLLPAGT and TLTTVQGIA) of two tryptic peptides representing human eIF1 show exact identity to the corresponding amino acid sequence predicted for A121 protein. The molecular mass (13 kDa) of purified eIF1 is also similar to the predicted molecular mass (12.7 kDa) of the A121 protein product. Human eIF1 and eIF1A were reported to have distinct yet synergistic activities that were required for recognition of the initiation codon (20Pestova T.V. Borukhov S. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Human eIF1 alone has been reported to be necessary for ensuring the fidelity of translation initiation by recognizing and destabilizing the incorrectly assembled ribosomal complexes at the initiation codon. Similar function has been reported for yeast sui1p. Deletion of the sui1 gene is lethal (16Yoon H.J. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell.

Genetics. 1990; 124: 483-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); temperature-sensitive mutations within the sui1 gene have been identified that do not allow the mutant strains to grow at 37 °C (13Cui Y.

Yoon H.J. Donahue T. Genetics. 1990; 124: 483-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, sui1 mutant strains carrying the exogenous wild-type sui1 gene were able to grow at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures (13Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. Peltz S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1506-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Yoon H.J. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 248-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Castilho-Valavicius B. Yoon H.J. Donahue T. Genetics. 1990; 124: 483-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that if A121/SUI1 cDNA encodes a bona fidetranslation initiation factor equivalent to yeast sui1p, then human A121/SUI1 should function in yeast and correct mutant sui1 phenotype. To test this contention, we subcloned the human A121 cDNA into a yeast single copy expression vector pG-1 (13Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. Peltz S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1506-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Schena M. Yamamoto K. Science. 1988; 241: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and tested its ability to suppress translation ofhis4 UUG -lacZ gene. The reporter vector his4 UUG -lacZ contains theHis4 gene fused in-frame with the lacZ gene, and the AUG start codon of the His4 gene is replaced with UUG as a start codon (16Yoon H.J. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 248-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Castilho-Valavicius B. Yoon H.J. Donahue T. Genetics. 1990; 124: 483-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cui Y.

Various yeast strains carrying the plasmid borne human A121(pJD176F) or expression plasmid without A121 insert (pG-1) were transformed with the reporter vectorhis4 UUG -lacZ, and the β-galactosidase activities were determined. From the results summarized in Table III, it is clear that human A121/SUI1 suppresseshis4 UUG -lacZ β-galactosidase activity only in the sui1 strain and not in the sui2 and SUI3 mutant strains. sui2 and SUI3 encode the α and β subunits of eIF2, respectively (22Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Feng L. Donahue T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2784-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and mutations in both sui2 and SUI3 also allow translation to initiate at the UUG codon, although only sui1 and sui2 mutations confer growth related temperature sensitivity (16Yoon H.J.

The plasmid expressing human A121/SUI1 only allowed the sui1–1 strain and not the sui2–1 to grow at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures (Table IV). The ability of human A121/SUI1 to correct only the sui1 phenotype and not the sui2 and SUI3 phenotypes not only highlights the specificity of A121/SUI1 function but also demonstrates that human A121/SUI1 can function in yeast.Table IIIWhen expressed in yeast the A121 cDNA clone (pJD176F) complements the sui1–1 allele but not sui2–1 or SUI3–3Strainhis4 UUG-lacZβ-galactosidase activitypG-1pJD176FY157(sui1–1)0.1910.026Y158(sui2–1)0.1880.189Y244(SUI3–3)0.1040.109Y159 (wild type)0.0280.029 Open table in a new tab Table IVWhen expressed in yeast, the A121 cDNA clone (pJD176F) allows growth at both permissive and nonpermissive temperature only in sui1–1 background and not in sui2–1 backgroundStrainsGrowth at 30 °CGrowth at 37 °CpG-1pJD176FpG-1pJD176FY157 sui1–1++−+Y158 sui2–1++−−Y159 wild type++++ Open table in a new tab Previously, we have reported the cloning and characterization of several important genotoxic stress-inducible genes from the hamster DDI library originally made using a low ratio hybridization subtraction technique (Refs. 3Fargnoli J.

The clones in this library represent transcripts that are induced within 4 h after exposure to UV irradiation (4Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we report the identification and molecular cloning of the full-length cDNA of a previously uncharacterized DDI A121 transcript from the same library. The deduced amino acid sequence of human A121 shows high homology to the yeast translation initiation factor sui1 (16Yoon H.J. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 248-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and the corresponding proteins from other species including mouse (direct submission, accession numberP48024), chick (23Wu S.V. Walsh J.H. Campbellm B.J. Dimaline R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), mosquito (24Besansky N.J. Hamm D.M. Collins F.H. Gene. 1994; 141: 299-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and Arabadopsis thaliana(direct submission, accession number P41568). The tissue distribution of A121/SUI1 mRNA in human and mouse tissues revealed that A121/SUI1 is expressed in most tissues; whether A121/SUI1 is absolutely required for protein translation in mammalian cells or is dispensable must await the results of A121/SUI1 gene knock-out studies. Yeast sui1 has been shown to be an essential gene (16Yoon H.J. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 248-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Castilho-Valavicius B. Yoon H.J. Donahue T. Genetics. 1990; 124: 483-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was originally identified as a translation initiation suppressor locus (21Castilho-Valavicius B. Yoon H.J. Donahue T. Genetics. 1990; 124: 483-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to sui1, two other genes, namely sui2 andSUI3, have also been identified in yeast (21Castilho-Valavicius B. Yoon H.J. Donahue T. Genetics. 1990; 124: 483-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Feng L. Donahue T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2784-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mutations at all these three unlinked loci restored expression of the HIS4 allele lacking the canonical AUG translation initiation start site (21Castilho-Valavicius B. Yoon H.J. Donahue T. Genetics. 1990; 124: 483-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a finding that implicates their role in controlling the fidelity of translation initiation (21Castilho-Valavicius B. Yoon H.J. Donahue T. Genetics. 1990; 124: 483-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike sui1, the sui2 and SUI3 genes have been reported to encode the α and β subunits of eIF2, respectively (22Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Feng L. Donahue T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2784-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although sui1p has been reported to enhance the function of eIF3, sui1p may not be a bona fide subunit of eIF3 (25Naranda T. Macmillan S.E. Donahue T.F. Hershey W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2307-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently Cui et al. (13Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. Peltz S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1506-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reported the characterization of a novel allele of sui1 named mof2–1. The sequence of the wild-type mof2 gene was identical to that of sui1, and both were able to independently correct mof2–1 or sui1 phenotypes and ensure translation fidelity (13Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. Peltz S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1506-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fact that the partial amino acid sequence of the recently purified human eIF1 (20Pestova T.V. Borukhov S. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) is identical to the predicted amino acid sequence of A121/SUI1 suggests that the latter is likely to encode human eIF1. It has recently been reported that human eIF1 and eIF1A act in concert to promote 48 S ribosomal complex formation at the initiation codon (20Pestova T.V. Borukhov S. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar); 43 S complex lacking eIF1 and eIF1A does not reach the initiation codon (20Pestova T.V. Borukhov S. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Furthermore, eIF1 alone was able to recognize and destabilize the aberrantly formed complexes at the initiation codon, a function that is consistent with that reported for yeast sui1 (16Yoon H.J. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 248-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. Peltz S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1506-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our findings that expression of human A121/SUI1 in yeast was able to correct the sui1 but not the sui2 or SUI3 phenotypes demonstrate that A121/SUI1 encodes the human equivalent of yeast sui1p. The A121/SUI1 gene exhibits two transcripts of varying abundance in different tissues. Using cDNA probes corresponding to different regions of A121/SUI1, we have demonstrated that these transcripts result from alternative usage of two poly(A) signals present in the 3′-untranslated region. It is interesting that both transcripts are differentially regulated by genotoxic and ER stress. For example, the genotoxic agents MMS and UV induced expression of only the larger transcript, whereas ER stress-inducing agents up-regulate both transcripts. These results would suggest that genotoxic stress either exerts a transcriptional influence or enhances the A121/SUI1 mRNA stability via elements residing within the 3′-untranslated region. ER stress-inducing agents, on the other hand, may transcriptionally up-regulate the levels of A121/SUI1 transcripts from the common 5′-end. Future studies will illuminate the molecular basis for the differential regulation of A121/SUI1 transcripts by genotoxic and ER stress-inducing agents. Although the transcripts encoding human eIF5 were also present in the original DDI library, eIF5 mRNA expression was not induced by MMS and only minimally induced by UV in some human cell lines (8Sheikh M.S. Carrier F. Papathanasiou M.A. Hollander M.C. Zhan Q. Yu K. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). eIF1A is the interacting partner of human eIF1; however, eIF1A expression was not regulated by genotoxic or ER stress (data not shown). From the results presented in this study, it is evident that (a) only the expression of A121/SUI1 is regulated by genotoxic and ER stress, whereas that of eIF1A is not, (b) the A121/SUIgene expression is regulated in an agent-specific manner, and (c) its induction is not a general cellular response to all types of stresses. Because of the lack of the availability of antibodies against eIF1, we were unable to test its regulation at the protein levels. Conceivably, genotoxic and ER stress induction of A121/SUI1 mRNA and protein is coupled and may represent part of the defense mechanism of a cell to provide a translational checkpoint control to modulate the expression of certain proteins at the translational level. Further studies are needed to test this contention and should lead to a better understanding of the process of translation initiation during various cellular stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2095352111,"Chromosomal translocations involving genes coding for members of the HMG-I(Y) family of high mobility group non-histone chromatin proteins (HMG-I, HMG-Y, and HMG-IC) have been observed in numerous types of human tumors. Many of these gene rearrangements result in the creation of chimeric proteins in which the DNA-binding domains of the HMG-I(Y) proteins, the so-called A.T-hook motifs, have been fused to heterologous peptide sequences. Although little is known about either the structure or biophysical properties of these naturally occurring fusion proteins, the suggestion has been made that such chimeras have probably assumed an altered in vivo DNA-binding specificity due to the presence of the A.T-hook motifs. To investigate this possibility, we performed in vitro domain-swap experiments using a model protein fusion system in which a single A. T-hook peptide was exchanged for a corresponding length peptide in the well characterized B-box DNA-binding domain of the HMG-1 non-histone chromatin protein. Here we report that chimeric A. T-hook/B-box hybrids exhibit in vitro DNA-binding characteristics resembling those of wild type HMG-I(Y) protein, rather than the HMG-1 protein. These results strongly suggest that the chimeric fusion proteins produced in human tumors as a result of HMG-I(Y) gene chromosomal translocations also retain A.T-hook-imparted DNA-binding properties in vivo."

Inhibition of IRP inactivation by cycloheximide or by the specific proteasome inhibitor MG132 correlated with the stabilization of TfR mRNA.

This rise in receptor expression is mediated by a dramatic increase in TfR mRNA stability and is dependent on the presence of the 3′-untranslated region of the TfR transcript (10Owen D. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Five RNA motifs termed iron-responsive elements (IREs) were identified within this region (11Mullner E.W. Kuhn L.C.

Science. 1988; 240: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In iron-deprived cells, specific RNA-binding factors, the iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), bind to these regions and prevent the degradation of TfR mRNA, presumably by masking a rapid turnover determinant (13Koeller D.M. Casey J.L. Hentze M.W. Gerhardt E.M. Chan L.N. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 14Mullner E.W. Neupert B.

IRPs also recognize IREs located in the 5′-UTR of ferritin, erythroid δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase, and succinate dehydrogenaseb mRNAs; in these cases, binding causes translational repression (15Walden W.E.

IRP-1 binds equally well to IREs from ferritin, TfR, m-aconitase, and erythroid δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase, whereas IRP-2 has a higher affinity for the ferritin IRE. In addition the RNA binding activities of IRP-1 and IRP-2 are regulated by distinct molecular mechanisms (27Henderson B.R. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20509-20515Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29Guo B.

In iron-replete cells, IRP-1 contains an iron-sulfur cluster and has low affinity to IREs; in iron-deprived cells, in contrast, the protein is converted into its apo-protein form with high RNA binding activity (31Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 32Gray N.K. Quick S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). IRP-2, on the other hand, is stable in iron-depleted cells but is ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by a proteasome-dependent mechanism when iron is abundant (28Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,29Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

A similar type of IRP regulation was previously observed in rabbit cells in response to modulation of cell growth (35Goessling L.S. Daniels McQueen S. Bhattacharyya Pakrasi M. Lin J.J. Thach R.E.

Finally, the IRE binding activities of IRP-1 and IRP-2 were shown to be differentially regulated in response to non-iron environmental conditions, such as nitric oxide signaling (37Weiss G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Under high iron conditions, in the absence of active IRPs, TfR mRNA is rapidly degraded. A potential endonucleolytic cleavage site has been identified within the 3′-UTR of the TfR transcript (45Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The cutting site was mapped within a previously characterized destabilizing domain close to the IREs (46Casey J.L. Koeller D.M. Ramin V.C. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3693-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The corresponding endonuclease, however, still awaits identification. As inhibition of transcription by high concentrations of α-amanitin interferes with TfR mRNA decay, it was suggested that RNA polymerase III transcripts may play a role in the degradation process (47Seiser C. Posch M. Thompson N. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29400-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of translation by cycloheximide and puromycin was reported to block TfR mRNA decay (11Mullner E.W. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 47Seiser C. Posch M. Thompson N. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 7778-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This effect could either be due to the involvement of highly unstable factors in the degradation of the transcript (trans effect) or to the fact that translation per se is necessary for the decay of TfR mRNA (cis effect). Manipulating the translatability by insertion of an ferritin IRE within the 5′-UTR of TfR transcripts, Koeller et al. (48Koeller D.M. Horowitz J.A. Casey J.L. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7778-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhibition of translation in cis had no effect on the rapid turnover of constitutively unstable TfR mutant constructs and TfR/c-fos hybrids. These results would point toward atrans effect of protein synthesis in the case of transferrin receptor mRNA and also of the AU-rich elements (AREs) containing c-fos transcript. However, the constructs used in their study did not allow one to distinguish whether inhibition of translation affects the degradation step or the regulatory system. We designed a novel reporter system that reflects all aspects of the iron-dependent regulation of TfR transcripts. To this end, the 3′-UTR of human transferrin receptor gene containing all five IREs and the rapid turnover determinant (11Mullner E.W. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 46Casey J.L. Koeller D.M. Ramin V.C. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3693-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) was linked to the coding part of mouse thymidine kinase (TK) cDNA. Efficient inhibition of TK protein synthesis could be easily assayed by enzyme activity assays, immunoblots, and, on a cellular level, by selection for HAT-sensitive transfectants. Using this reporter system, we set out to characterize the translation-dependent step during the iron-dependent decay of TfR mRNA. All expression vectors are based on the mammalian expression vector pSVL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 2.3-kb BamHI/BglII fragment of the plasmid pcD-TR1 (49Kuhn L.C. McClelland A. Ruddle F.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), representing the 3′-UTR of the human transferrin receptor cDNA with the complete regulatory region, was ligated in the correct orientation into the BamHI site of the construct pSVLTKΔ30 described previously in Ref. 50Sutterluety H. Bartl S. Karlseder J. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar. This parental reporter plasmid was termed pTK-hTfR. The frameshift constructs pSTOP1 and pSTOP2 were obtained by linearization with ApaI and ClaI, respectively, of the plasmid pTK-hTfR, followed by a Klenow fill-in reaction and religation. The changes in the TK open reading frame were confirmed by sequencing and expression of the encoded polypeptides by in vitro transcription/translation in reticulocyte lysates (Promega). To create the construct pSL, the original NcoI site at position 333 of pSVL was converted to a StuI site by standard PCR reaction. 1130 base pairs of the pSVL vector containing the SV40 intron were deleted by ligation to the StuI site at position 1463. The resulting plasmid pSL lacks the SV40 intron and a stretch of untranslated nucleotides of pSVL; it encodes a transcript with a 5′ leader sequence shortened from 265 to 50 bases. For the plasmids pSTEM1 and pSTEM2, encoding for mRNAs with stem-loop structures in their 5′-UTR, synthetic oligonucleotides were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega), annealed, and ligated into the XhoI site of pTK-hTfR. Oligonucleotides 1s (5′-TCG ACG GCG GCG GCC GGC CGC GCA AAC AAA GCG CGG CCG GCC GGC CGG G-3′) and 1a (5′-TCG ACC CCG GCC GGC CGG CCG CGC TTT GTT TGC GCG GCC GGC CGG CCG CCG-3′) were annealed for stem-loop STEM1, which corresponds to STEMB in Ref. 51Lang V. Zanchin N.I. Lunsdorf H. Tuite M. McCarthy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Oligonucleotide 2 (5′-TCG AGC AGC GGA CGC CCG CCA AAT TTG GCG GGC GTC CGC TGC-3′) of stem-loop STEM2 is similar to STEMN in Ref. 51Lang V. Zanchin N.I. Lunsdorf H. Tuite M. McCarthy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The presence of inserted oligonucleotides was confirmed by sequencing. Mouse LTK−fibroblasts (ATCC CCL 1.3) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (30 μg/liter penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin-sulfate). Transfection and selection for TK expressing transformants was done as described (50Sutterluety H. Bartl S. Karlseder J. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing TK frameshift mutants and stem-loop constructs were established by co-transfection with 20 ng of a plasmid conferring hygromycin resistance. Stable transformants were selected in medium containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Pools of 50–100 clones and single colonies were propagated for analysis in further experiments. The regulation of reporter gene expression was essentially the same in mixed cell populations and single clones. Iron chelation was performed by the addition of 50 μm desferrioxamine (Desferal; gift from Ciba-Geigy), whereas iron was added as ferric ammonium citrate at 20 μg/ml. Where indicated, cells were treated with the transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB, Sigma) at 30 μg/ml. To inhibit protein synthesis, cycloheximide was added to the medium at 10 μg/ml. For proteasome inhibition studies, cells were treated with 50 μm MG132 (Peptides International, Louisville, KY). Isolation and analysis of cytoplasmic RNA was performed as described previously (52Seiser C. Teixeira S. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13074-13080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.2-kb fragment of the murine TK cDNA (53Hofbauer R. Mullner E. Seiser C. Wintersberger E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the 2.25-kb cDNA of the murine transferrin receptor cDNA clone TR2 (54Stearne P.A. Pietersz G.A. Goding J.W. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3474-3479PubMed Google Scholar), and the 1.4-kb fragment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (55Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. el-Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) were used as probes. DNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Rotem Industries, Israel) using the random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Iron-deprived cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. To prepare cytoplasmic lysates, cells were thoroughly resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1 mmpotassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 150 μg/ml cycloheximide) by pipetting 10 times. Cells were kept on ice for 10 min; then the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was layered on a continuous sucrose gradient (15–40% sucrose in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide) and separated by centrifugation at 38,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman). 22 fractions (500 μl) were collected, and each fraction was vigorously mixed with 200 μl of a buffer containing 7 m urea, 1% SDS, 0.35 mNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 400 μl of phenol-chloroform. After centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, 600 μl of the aqueous phase were precipitated with 1 ml of ethanol containing 20 μg of yeast tRNA carrier. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of water and loaded on 1.2% denaturing gels. RNA of all fractions was separated by electrophoresis, transferred to GeneScreen nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products), and submitted to Northern blot analysis. A similar protocol was used for the analysis of transcripts after EDTA-induced ribosome release. Cycloheximide was substituted by 10 mmEDTA in both the lysis buffer and the 15–40% sucrose gradients in these experiments. Similarly, high salt gradients contained 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm EDTA. Cytoplasmic proteins were prepared according to the procedure described by Sherley and Kelly (56Sherley J.L. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized, pelleted at 200 ×g for 4 min, washed, and lysed in digitonin buffer (0.8 mg/ml digitonin, 250 mm sucrose, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 160 mm KCl, 3 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm ε-amino-n-caproic acid, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) by incubating the cells for 15 min on ice. Cell fragments were removed by centrifugation at 1.000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Brilliant Blue protein assay (Bio-Rad). Thymidine kinase enzyme assays, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis of the epitope-tagged mouse thymidine kinase protein have been described (50Sutterluety H. Bartl S. Karlseder J. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled RNA was transcribed from the linearized plasmid pSPT-fer containing the IRE from the 5′-UTR of human ferritin H chain mRNA as described by Mullner et al. (14Mullner E.W. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Transcription was carried out in the presence of 1.5 mm ATP, GTP, and UTP, 60 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), and T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). The IRP-IRE interaction was analyzed as described previously (14Mullner E.W. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein extract (1–2 μg) was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with an excess (0.2 ng) of 32P-labeled IRE in vitro transcript in a total volume of 20 μl. After addition of heparin for another 10 min, RNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and processed for autoradiography. To analyze the effect of translation on the iron-dependent decay of RNA molecules containing TfR control elements, we established a selectable reporter system. The coding region of the mouse thymidine kinase cDNA was fused to the entire 3′-UTR of human TfR cDNA to give the construct TK-hTfR (Fig.1 A). This mRNA, which is expressed from the constitutive SV40 promoter, contains all elements that have been demonstrated to be essential for iron-dependent regulation of mRNA stability (11Mullner E.W. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12Casey J.L. Hentze M.W. Koeller D.M. Caughman S.W. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Science. 1988; 240: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The open reading frame encodes a highly stable COOH-terminally truncated murine thymidine kinase protein TKΔ30 which contains a c-myc epitope at its amino terminus (50Sutterluety H. Bartl S. Karlseder J. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The expression of this protein has been shown to be independent of growth conditions (50Sutterluety H. Bartl S. Karlseder J. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cellular levels of the epitope-tagged TK polypeptide can be easily monitored by immunological techniques. Mouse LTK− cells were stably transfected with the construct TK-hTfR to give the corresponding cell line LTK-hTfR. To test whether levels of TK-hTfR mRNA were regulated by iron availability, logarithmically growing cells were depleted of iron by the addition of 50 μm desferrioxamine to the medium. After different periods of time, cytoplasmic RNA was prepared and analyzed by Northern hybridization. LTK− cells stably transfected with the parental construct pSVLTKΔ30 giving cell line LTK served as a control to rule out an effect of the iron status on the coding region of the reporter transcript. TK-hTfR mRNA was about 12-fold induced upon iron deprivation (Fig. 1 A), whereas the expression of TK transcripts in the control cells was not increased by desferrioxamine (Fig. 1 B). As shown in the lower panel, rehybridization with a probe specific for the coding part of murine TfR mRNA revealed a similar induction pattern for the endogenous mTfR transcript. TK-hTfR mRNA expression is therefore clearly dependent on intracellular iron levels. To confirm that the iron-dependent regulation of TK-hTfR reporter mRNA is due to a change in the mRNA stability, we determined the mRNA half-life both under conditions of iron deprivation and abundance. TK-hTfR cells were iron-starved by addition of the iron chelator desferrioxamine for 18 h or iron-loaded by addition of ferric ammonium citrate to the medium for 12 h. Transcription was inhibited by the addition of DRB, and TK-hTfR mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis after different periods of time. In iron-depleted cells, we observed a half-life of TK-hTfR reporter mRNA of about 6 h (Fig. 1 C, left panel). The presence of ferric ammonium citrate in the culture medium dramatically reduced the half-life to about 50 min (Fig.1 C, right panel). Similar data have previously been shown for murine TfR mRNA (47Seiser C. Posch M. Thompson N. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29400-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and were confirmed by rehybridization with a probe specific for the endogenous murine TfR transcripts (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the reporter mRNA and the endogenous TfR mRNA both are regulated by the same mechanism. A number of rapidly degraded transcripts are markedly stabilized upon the addition of global translation inhibitors. A similar effect of cycloheximide on iron-mediated decay of TfR mRNA has been reported previously (11Mullner E.W. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Similarly, we observed inhibition of TK-hTfR mRNA degradation by cycloheximide and puromycin in the course of iron repletion in our reporter system (data not shown). Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for the ability of inhibitors of protein synthesis to stabilize labile mRNAs; either highly unstable proteins are involved in the degradation of these mRNAs (trans effect), or translation of the labile mRNAs itself is required for decay (cis effect). In order to distinguish between these alternatives, two approaches to influence protein synthesis from our reporter mRNA were chosen. First, we investigated whether complete translation of the coding region is a prerequisite for TK-hTfR mRNA degradation by introducing stop codons into the open reading frame of pTK-hTfR. Plasmids pSTOP1 and pSTOP2 encode truncated TK proteins of 51 and 128 amino acids, respectively. In vitro expression in a reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system yielded polypeptides of the calculated sizes of 5.6 and 14 kDa, respectively (data not shown). The corresponding cell lines LSTOP1 and LSTOP2 expressed no full-length TK protein, as judged by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A) and enzyme activity assays (data not shown), and were not viable in HAT medium, which selects for transfectants expressing functional TK protein. Although truncated TK protein could be immunoprec"
