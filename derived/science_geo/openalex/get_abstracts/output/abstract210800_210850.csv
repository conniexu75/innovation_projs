The adrenal medulla is not necessary for the maintenance of tissue stores of this catecholamine1, and it is likely that synthesis of norepinephrine occurs in the sympathetic nervous tissue throughout the body. Norepinephrine in the plasma originates from discharge of the neurohumour from the sympathetic nerve endings. The circulating catecholamine is excreted, metabolically inactivated (predominantly by O-methylation), or rebound in the tissues2,3. A portion of the norepinephrine present in each organ is derived from the circulating pool of catecholamine. The ability of the heart to take up, concentrate, and store intravenously administered norepinephrine has been amply demonstrated4–6. It has recently been shown that the isolated perfused heart is capable of synthesis of norepinephrine from tyrosine, at a sufficiently rapid rate to account for a considerable portion of the norepinephrine in this organ7. Thus norepinephrine stores in the heart could be maintained in part by extraction of the catecholamine from the circulation and in part by synthesis. We have used an isotope dilution technique to demonstrate that in the normal rat about 60 per cent of the norepinephrine present in the heart is synthesized in this organ, while the remainder is derived from the circulating pool of norepinephrine"

https://openalex.org/W2009211469,"THE kidney of the hagfish (Myxine glutinosa L.) consists of about 70 extraordinarily large Malpighian corpuscles, which through short ducts are connected with the ureters. The latter extend from the level of the heart to the cloaca. It is assumed that two ureters (Wolffian ducts) carry out functions which in higher vertebrates are performed by kidney tubules. This theory is based on an alleged histological resemblance of the hagfish ureters to renal tubules1. However, it has not yet been confirmed electron-microscopically that the resemblance is a real one and not only superficial."
https://openalex.org/W1982235877,"THE preservation of chromatograms is one aspect of thin-layer chromatography which cannot be translated directly from the paper chromatographic technique. It is obviously impracticable to store the glass plates themselves and the answer to the problem lies in removing the completed thin-layer chromatogram from its glass support. Techniques have been described which rely on spraying the thin layer with suitable polymer dispersion, which hardens on drying to coat the layer with a clear film. The coating, plus the layer, is then removed mechanically from the glass plate. The method which is described here is an alternative means of preserving thin layer chromatograms which obviates the need for any spraying of the completed chromatogram and which is, in consequence, particularly useful for thin layers of a brittle nature."

https://openalex.org/W2080475462,"CERTAIN problems have induced us to prepare the chromosomes of bovine leucocytes. Using the methods of other authors1–3 the following technique was adopted: 20.0–40.0 ml. blood were collected from the jugular vein of an ox, to which was added 2.0–4.0 ml. heparin solution (200 mg heparin, 100 mg streptomycin, 10,000 units penicillin, 100.0 ml. of a 0.85 per cent saline solution) or an appropriate amount of ‘Vetren’ or ‘Thrombovetren’ (Promonta, Hamburg). This was put in a vessel containing 0.12–0.24 ml. phytohæmagglutinin P or 0.4–0.8 ml. phytohæmagglutinin M (Difco), well mixed, stored for 20 min in a refrigerator, centrifuged afterwards for 10 min at about 900g and the leucocyte-layer obtained. (Bovine erythrocytes were not agglutinated by phytohæmagglutinin.)"

https://openalex.org/W2039589949,"IT has been reported1 that crude Cryptococcus neoformans capsular polysaccharide when injected by the subcutaneous route was incapable of protecting mice against a lethal challenge dose of the parent organism. Purified polysaccharide, on the other hand, elicited a minimal protective response which was markedly increased by coupling to an ion exchange resin adjuvant. Both polysaccharides were obtained by direct recovery from cell-free culture medium. More recently it was shown indirectly that the protective antigen appeared to be concentrated in an area of the capsule immediately surrounding the cell wall2. It was therefore of interest to determine if fractionation of the capsule by repeated grinding would provide antigens with increased stimulatory properties."

https://openalex.org/W1971339151,"IN their recent article in Nature, Andersen, Eccles and Løyning1 claim to have unequivocally identified the basket cells of the hippocampus as the inhibitory neurones of this brain structure. They claim that “there is no alternative” to this interpretation and that it therefore “seems possible for the first time to give an example from the mammalian nervous system of a recurrent inhibitory pathway where both the inhibitory neurone and its synapses are histologically identifiable”."

Experiments have also indicated the possibility of obtaining in neoplastic cells an artificial aggregation of the particles1–3. Work on oocytes has shown the ribosomal nature of the particles, and it is thus possible that RNA is present in the product of protein synthesis."
