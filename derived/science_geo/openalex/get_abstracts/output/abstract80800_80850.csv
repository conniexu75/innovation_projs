https://openalex.org/W2160720263,"Recent studies have uncovered a synaptic process with properties required for an intermediate step in memory storage. Calcium rapidly and irreversibly increases the number of receptors for glutamate (a probable neurotransmitter) in forebrain synaptic membranes by activating a proteinase (calpain) that degrades fodrin, a spectrin-like protein. This process provides a means through which physiological activity could produce long-lasting changes in synaptic chemistry and ultrastructure. Since the process is only poorly represented in the brain stem, it is hypothesized to be responsible for those forms of memory localized in the telencephalon."

https://openalex.org/W2049732058,"Depletion of intracellular potassium (K+) caused a marked reduction in the rate of endocytosis of receptor-bound low density lipoprotein (LDL) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in human fibroblasts. K+ could be depleted slowly by a 3-hr incubation of cells in isotonic K+-free buffer. Rapid K+ depletion was induced by incubation of cells for 5 min with hypotonic medium, followed by transfer to isotonic K+-free buffer. Within 30 min of this treatment, cellular K+ levels fell by more than 60%. When the K+ level fell below a threshold of 40% of normal, the number of coated pits declined by 80% and the rate of endocytosis of 125I-LDL decreased by 70 to 95% despite normal to increased receptor binding. Similar results were obtained with 125I-epidermal growth factor. Addition of KCl to the culture medium up to 2 hr after K+ depletion restored cellular K+ levels and returned endocytosis of 125I-LDL promptly to normal. RbCl was as effective as KCl, but CsCl, LiCl, and (CH3)4NCl had no effect. Restoration by KCl was blocked by ouabain, indicating that uptake via the Na+/K+ ATPase was required. These data demonstrate that depletion of intracellular K+ reversibly arrests coated pit formation and receptor-mediated endocytosis in human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2033302775,"Extinction is an operational term that refers to the lack of expression of tissue-specific traits that is generally observed in hybrid cells formed by fusing dissimilar cell types. To define the genetic basis of this phenomenon, a series of rat hepatoma x mouse fibroblast hybrids has been isolated and characterized. We report here that the extinction of hepatic marker traits in these clones was strictly correlated with the retention of five particular fibroblast chromosomes (autosomes 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13). In order to dissect this correlation into its component parts, hepatoma microcell hybrids containing single, specific fibroblast chromosomes were constructed. Hepatoma clones retaining only fibroblast chromosome 11 were specifically extinguished for liver-specific tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) expression, while expression of four other hepatic traits and of numerous constitutive markers was unaffected. Furthermore, removal of fibroblast chromosome 11 from the populations by back-selection resulted in reexpression of TAT activity to full parental levels. These data define and localize a genetic locus, tissue-specific extinguisher-1 (Tse-1), which regulates hepatic TAT expression in trans. We also provide evidence that human Tse-1 resides on the homologous chromosome (human chromosome 17), and that hybrids retaining active Tse-1 loci lack TAT-specific mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2068681505,"The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was examined by measuring the density of dopamine receptors in the postmortem brains of 81 control subjects and 59 schizophrenics from four different countries. The densities of dopamine receptors in the tissues from the schizophrenic patients had a bimodal distribution in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. One mode occurred 25 percent above the control density, and a second mode occurred at a density 2.3 times that of the control density for all three regions. Although almost all the patients had been medicated with neuroleptics, the two modes had the same dissociation constant for the labeled ligand used, suggesting that the neuroleptic doses were similar for the two populations of schizophrenics. The results thus provide direct evidence for two distinct categories of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2010398513,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent mitogen with hormonal activity in the gastrointestinal tract. Material cross-reacting with EGF was detected in the central nervous system of the developing and adult albino rat by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. High concentrations of EGF-cross-reacting material were identified in forebrain and midbrain structures of pallidal areas of the brain. These include the globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, and the islands of Calleja . Thus, EGF may represent another gut-brain peptide with potential neurotransmitter-neuromodulator functions in pallidal structures of the extrapyramidal motor systems of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1490395456,"gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (rat kidney; Mr approximately 104,000) is composed of 2 nonidentical subunits. In the present work, a procedure was developed for the reversible dissociation of the enzyme into its subunits (Mr = 73,000 and 27,700) under nondenaturing conditions. Students in which gel electrophoresis was used, in conjunction with an enzyme activity stain and elution and re-electrophoresis of protein bands, showed that the heavy subunit contains all of the structural requirements for enzymatic activity and also for feedback inhibition of the enzyme activity by glutathione. The light subunit, which may be formed from a precursor protein, has a significantly lower content of Trp, Phe, Tyr, Val, and Ala residues than the heavy subunit, while its content of Lys, His, Met, and Asx residues is higher."
https://openalex.org/W1524956043,"Previously, we have described an ATP-dependent recognition and binding of mRNA by eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF)-4A, eIF-4B, and eIF-4F (Grifo, J. A., Tahara, S. M., Leis, J. P., Morgan, M. A., Shatkin, A. J., and Merrick, W. C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5246-5252; Grifo, J. A., Tahara, S. M., Morgan, M. A., Shatkin, A. J., and Merrick, W. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5804-5810). This finding was consistent with other studies which implicated eIF-4A and eIF-4B in binding mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, an ATP-requiring process. As part of ongoing studies of this step, and, in particular its ATP requirement, we have examined ATPase activity of various initiation factors. In this communication we describe an RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by eIF-4A and eIF-4F. Although eIF-4B has little or no ATPase activity it can stimulate the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of either eIF-4A or eIF-4F. Similar to the ATP-dependent mRNA binding assay, the RNA-dependent ATPase activity is inhibited by the cap analogue m7GDP when globin mRNA is used as the activator. In addition, a variety of polynucleotides stimulate the ATPase activity of these factors including rRNA, tRNA, poly(U), and poly(A) but not poly(dA). Finally, an attempt has been made to discern whether phosphorylation or ATP hydrolysis is responsible for the ATP-stimulated binding of mRNA by eIF-4A and eIF-4B. We present evidence which is consistent with the interpretation that ATP hydrolysis and not protein phosphorylation correlates with ATP-stimulated binding of mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1585242164,"The murine pre-B-lymphocyte cell line 70Z /3 may be induced to differentiate to a surface immunoglobulin-positive phenotype by the polyclonal B-cell mitogen, lipopolysaccharide. This is accomplished via activation of an amiloride-sensitive Na+-uptake system ( Rosoff , P. M., and Cantley , L. C. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 7547-7550). Here we show that the active tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) also induces surface IgM expression in 70Z /3 cells. TPA also appears to work by activating a plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange system. A significant increase in cellular Na+ was detected within 10 min after TPA addition and by 2 h an 80% increase was observed. Amiloride blocked both the induction of surface IgM and the increase in cellular Na+. Further evidence that both TPA and lipopolysaccharide activate Na+/H+ exchange was provided by measurements of intracellular pH with carboxyfluorescein. Both TPA and lipopolysaccharide caused a 0.15 unit increase in cytoplasmic pH within 5 min after addition to the cells at 37 degrees C. The pH change required high extracellular Na+ and was inhibited by amiloride. These data suggest a mechanism by which phorbol esters affect cellular growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1509382673,"After 10 wash cycles, 0.8 u.e. of creatine kinase activity remained bound per mg of chicken pectoralis myofibrils which had been freed of soluble creatine kinase, mitochondria, and membranes. The bound creatine kinase is located at the M-band and contributes to the electron density of this sarcomeric structure (Wallimann, T., Pelloni, G.W., Turner, D.C., and Eppenberger, H. M. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 4296-4300). By measuring the combined actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase and creatine kinase reactions of myofibrils by pH-stat, it was shown that the amount of M-line-bound creatine kinase activity was sufficient to rephosphorylate the ATP hydrolyzed in vitro by the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase. The amount of M-line-bound creatine kinase and thus the ATP regeneration potential depended on the muscle type. It was higher in fast muscles and lower in slow muscles. Inhibition of myofibrillar creatine kinase or extraction of the M-line-bound enzyme abolished the ATP regeneration potential without affecting ATPase activity. Inhibitors of myokinase, mitochondrial ADP/ATP translocase, and respiration did not affect the ATP regeneration potential or the ATPase. M-line-bound creatine kinase, sufficient to support an ATP turnover rate of 6s-1 per myosin head, seems to have the capacity for the intramyofibrillar regeneration of most or all of the ATP hydrolyzed by the myofibrillar ATPase during muscle contraction. Thus, M-line-bound creatine kinase at the myofibrillar receiving end of the phosphorylcreatine shuttle is of physiological significance."
https://openalex.org/W1566146794,"Work in several laboratories has shown that Gi, the inhibitory guanyl nucleotide-binding protein of the adenylate cyclase system, is similar in many ways to transducin, the guanyl nucleotide-binding protein of the retinal light-activated cGMP phosphodiesterase system. Separated subunits of purified transducin, T alpha (approximately 39 kDa) and T beta gamma (approximately 35 and approximately 10 kDa), do not exhibit GTPase activity; GTPase activity is observed when the subunits are combined in the presence of rhodopsin ( Fung , B. K.-K. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10495-10502). Subunits of Gi, Gi alpha (approximately 41 kDa), and Gi beta gamma (approximately 35 and approximately 10 kDa) were prepared from rabbit liver membranes. It was found that Gi beta gamma could replace T beta gamma in reconstituting the rhodopsin-stimulated GTPase activity of T alpha. Gi alpha exhibited rhodopsin-stimulated GTPase activity when reconstituted with Gi beta gamma or T beta gamma. GTPase activity was a function of Gi alpha concentration when Gi beta gamma or T beta gamma was constant, and the GTPase activity of a given amount of Gi alpha was dependent on Gi beta gamma concentration. These studies demonstrate that the GTPase activity of Gi resides in Gi alpha and further establish that Gi alpha and Gi beta gamma are functionally analogous to T alpha and T beta gamma, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2118398515,"beta-Adrenergic receptors and the inhibitory GTP-binding protein, Gi of the adenylate cyclase system were reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles by the method described previously for reconstituting receptors and the stimulatory GTP-binding protein, Gs (Brandt, D. R., Asano, T., Pedersen, S. E., and Ross, E. M. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 4357-4362). In the receptor-Gi vesicles, beta-adrenergic agonists stimulated both the high-affinity binding of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) to Gi and GTPase activity to an extent similar to that observed in vesicles containing beta-adrenergic receptors and Gs. Stimulation required receptors and displayed appropriate beta-adrenergic specificity. The prior treatment of receptor-Gi vesicles with islet-activating protein (pertussis toxin) plus NAD markedly inhibited both the isoproterenol-stimulated binding of GTP gamma S and the isoproterenol-stimulated GTPase activity. No contamination of Gi by Gs was apparent. These data suggest that receptors that typically stimulate adenylate cyclase activity may also activate the inhibitory system, perhaps as one mechanism of desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2079380104,"In N. gonorrhoeae, the expression of pilus and opacity (Op) proteins can be switched on and off and a single cell apparently has a whole repertoire of genes to express many serologically distinguishable protein types. We describe the isolation of several different Op genes and of nonexpressing gene equivalents, all derived from isogenic gonococcal variants. In the E. coli host, Op proteins identical with those made in the respective N. gonorrhoeae strain are produced. The Op genes map near the pilus expression locus. Genomic blotting experiments with an Op gene probe reveal complex hybridization patterns but little heterogeneity among the genes of Op variants. It appears that colonial variation involving the Op protein of N. gonorrhoeae is based on minor sequence alterations, in contrast to the pilus variation system, in which changes in the expression can be evoked by substantial genomic rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W1539198960,"Tiazofurin, a C-nucleoside, was cytotoxic in hepatoma 3924A cells grown in culture with an LC50 = 7.5 microM. In the culture, a closely linked dose-related response of tumor cell-kill and depletion of GTP pools was observed after tiazofurin treatment. In rats carrying subcutaneously transplanted hepatoma 3924A solid tumors, a single intraperitoneal injection of tiazofurin (200 mg/kg) caused a rapid inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.14) activity and depleted GDP, GTP, and dGTP pools in the tumor; concurrently, the 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and IMP pools expanded 8- and 15-fold, respectively. Tiazofurin decreased tumoral IMP dehydrogenase activity and dGTP pools in a dose-dependent manner over a range of 50-200 mg/kg; by contrast, the depletion of GTP and the accumulation of IMP and PRPP pools were near maximum at 50 mg/kg. The increase in PRPP pools may be attributed to an inhibition by IMP of the activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8). The IMP dehydrogenase activity and the pools of ribonucleotides returned to the normal range by 24-48 h after the single injection of tiazofurin. However, the markedly depleted dGTP pools remained low for 72 h. Tiazofurin treatment resulted in significant anti-tumor activity in rats inoculated with hepatoma 3924A. The decrease in GTP levels and particularly the sustained depletion in the dGTP pools may explain, in part at least, the chemo-therapeutic action of tiazofurin on hepatoma 3924A. This is the first report showing that a marked therapeutic response was achieved against rapidly growing hepatoma 3924A by treatment with a single anti-metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W1602802145,"Taxol was used to prepare microtubules from unfertilized eggs of sea urchins Lytechinus pictus, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis , and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. By electron microscopy, these microtubules possessed normal morphology and were decorated with projections. The polypeptides present were tubulin plus microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) which included various high molecular weight polypeptides, and a Mr = 80,000 polypeptide. These MAPs were extracted from the microtubules by differential centrifugation in high ionic strength buffers, yielding a pellet of microtubules which were not decorated with projections. The Mr = 80,000 and high molecular weight MAPs were separated using Bio-Gel A-1.5 m chromatography, and shown to bind taxol-stabilized microtubules assembled from purified bovine brain tubulin. A dynein-like MgATPase activity is present in sea urchin egg extracts. 10-20% of this MgATPase co-pelleted with the taxol-assembled microtubules, under conditions where greater than 90% of the tubulin pelleted. During subsequent fractionation of the microtubules, by (i) high salt extraction followed by gel filtration or sucrose density gradient fractionation or (ii) ATP extraction, the MgATpase co-purified with high Mr MAPs. The MgATPase which remained in the microtubule-depleted egg extract was partially purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, followed by Bio-Gel A-5 m and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The high Mr MAP MgATPase and the hydroxylapatite MgATPase both contained a prominent polypeptide (Mr approximately 350,000), which co-migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with the major heavy chain of dynein extracted from sperm axonemes. Our data suggest that this Mr approximately 350,000 polypeptide is cytoplasmic dynein."

https://openalex.org/W1604700543,"Somatostatin binding to its receptors on rat pancreatic acinar membranes was characterized with [125I-Tyr1]somatostatin. Binding at 24 degrees C was rapid reaching a maximum after 60 min and was reversible upon the addition of 1 microM unlabeled ligand. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of binding sites, with a Kd of 0.32 +/- 0.03 nM and a binding capacity of 600 +/- 54 fmol/mg of protein. Specificity for the somatostatin was demonstrated with the inhibition of labeled hormone binding by somatostatin analogs in proportion to their biological activities. When [125I-Tyr1]somatostatin was cross-linked to its receptors with the photoreactive cross-linker n-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate, the hormone was associated with Mr = 90,000 protein. Similar mobilities of the radioactive band were observed in the presence and absence of dithiothreitol. In contrast to other unrelated peptides, cholecystokinin (CCK) and its analogs directly reduced [125I-Tyr1] somatostatin binding to isolated membranes. The effect of CCK was one-half-maximal at 3 nM and maximal at 100 nM. In the presence of 3 nM CCK8, the binding capacity for somatostatin was decreased to 237 +/- 39 fmol/mg of protein without a significant change in affinity. Dibutyryl cyclic GMP, a CCK receptor antagonist, blocked this action of CCK8 indicating that the CCK receptor mediated the decrease in [125-Tyr1]somatostatin binding. In contrast cerebral cortex membranes, which also possess a somatostatin receptor, were not regulated by CCK. These results indicate, therefore, that 1) purified pancreatic acinar plasma membranes contain specific receptors for somatostatin, 2) the receptor has an apparent Mr of about 90,000, and 3) the binding of somatostatin to its receptor on pancreatic plasma membranes is regulated by CCK analogs acting via the CCK receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1604174475,"The subcellular distribution of cytochrome b and ubiquinone in resting human neutrophils was investigated by rate zonal sedimentation of postnuclear supernatants on continuous sucrose gradients. Both cytochrome b and ubiquinone were mainly localized in small organelles, tertiary granules, that were resolved from the specific and azurophilic granules as well as from the cell membrane fraction. This cytochrome b- and ubiquinone-rich granule was shown to contain dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)-sensitive, Mg2+-dependent ATPase as well as low amounts, less than a third, of the acid hydrolases beta-glucuronidase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. Cytochrome b was also found in smaller proportions in plasma membranes and specific granules. A significant proportion of the ubiquinone was located in the region of the gradients where specific granules and mitochondria sedimented. However, quantitative measurements of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase indicated that this second localization of ubiquinone could not be entirely attributed to mitochondrial contamination. Plasma membrane contained small amounts of ubiquinone. In addition, the existence and location of a putative proton pump ATPase were also investigated. The ATPase was mainly located in the plasma membrane and in the upper half of the gradients (tertiary and specific granules), with the highest specific activity occurring in the tertiary granules. This activity was inhibited by 100 microM DCCD. Furthermore, ATP-dependent uptake of [14C]methylamine by tertiary and specific granules was observed. These results suggest that the DCCD-sensitive ATPase may function as a proton pump. DCCD inhibited the release of enzymes from specific granules that occurred when human neutrophils were activated by phorbol myristate acetate. However, higher concentrations of DCCD were required to achieve the same degree of inhibition of O2 uptake (I50 of 0.4 mM for secretion versus 1 mM for O2 uptake). These results suggest that specific granules do not play a crucial role in oxygen metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2082630503,"Regulation of the putative peptide neurohumour [Leu]enkephalin and the catecholaminergic enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl-transferase was examined in the rat adrenal medulla in vivo and in vitro. Surgical denervation of the adrenal gland or pharmacologic blockade of synaptic transmission, treatments known to decrease catecholamine traits, increased [Leu]enkephalin content. Medullas explanted to culture exhibited a 50-fold rise in [Leu]enkephalin in 4 days, whereas tyrosine hydroxylase remained constant, and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase decreased to a new baseline level. Veratridine-induced depolarization prevented the accumulation of [Leu]enkephalin, an effect that was blocked by tetrodotoxin, which antagonizes transmembrane Na+ influx. These studies suggest that enkephalinergic and catecholamine characters are differentially regulated by impulse activity and depolarization in the adrenal medulla."
https://openalex.org/W2104714234,"The (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum has been reconstituted into phospholipid bilayers of different fatty acyl chain length and degree of unsaturation, and ATPase activity was found to vary about 10-fold. Order parameters for bilayers of these lipids measured using the ESR probe 5-doxylstearic acid varied from 0.5 to 0.6 at 37 degrees C. There was no correlation between phospholipid order parameter and ATPase activity, and we conclude that phospholipid structure is a more important determinant of protein activity than is membrane fluidity."
https://openalex.org/W1516045875,"Amino acid residues at several locations in close primary vicinity to a substrate glutamine residue have been recognized as important determinants for the specificities of human plasma factor XIIIa and guinea pig liver transglutaminase (Gorman, J. J., and Folk, J. E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2712-2715). The present studies measure the influence on transglutaminase specificity of some changes in amino acid side chains in a small synthetic glutamine peptide amide, Leu-Gly-Leu-Gly-Gln-Gly-Lys-Val-Leu-GlyNH2, which was designed to contain most of the known elements needed for enzyme recognition. The results are in agreement with previous findings and show that full catalytic activity of each enzyme may be retained upon replacement of the lysine residue by certain other amino acid residues. Evidence is provided that serine in place of glycine at one or more positions causes a significant increase in specificity with factor XIIIa, but not with liver enzyme. The effective substrate property for factor XIIIa seen with the model peptide amide is lost upon reversal of the sequence Val-Leu. This is not the case with the liver enzyme even though replacement of either of these amino acids by alanine causes a pronounced loss in activity with this enzyme. These differences and the effects of various other substitutions in the model peptide amide on the enzymes' specificities points up the relatively stringent structural requirements of factor XIIIa and the rather broad requirements for liver transglutaminase."
https://openalex.org/W2081492316,"Mouse tumor macrophages (J774) exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) exhibited a marked increase in cell spreading. Correlated with this phenomenon was an increase in the number of cell surface transferrin (Tf) receptors and a corresponding decrease in the number of Tf receptors located intracellularly in membrane-bound endosomes. Similar effects were noted when J774 cells were exposed to the calcium ionophore A23187. Rabbit alveolar macrophages did not respond to PMA but did respond to A23187 by increasing cell spreading, which was accompanied by increases on the cell surface of four different receptors. These results demonstrate that phorbol esters and calcium ionophores can induce a redistribution of cellular receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1549334240,"A cell-surface modulator with the ability to mimic the reciprocal effects of cell density on cell growth and liver-specific functions of mature rat hepatocytes in primary culture (Nakamura, T., Yoshimoto, K., Nakayama, Y., Tomita, Y., and Ichihara, A. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 7229-7233) was solubilized with 4% octyl glucoside and 4 M guanidine HCl from plasma membranes purified from adult rat liver. The membrane-free modulator showed activities for inhibition of DNA synthesis stimulated by insulin with epidermal growth factor and stimulation of tyrosine aminotransferase induction by dexamethasone. The apparent Mr of the factor was estimated as 670,000 by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-400 column equilibrated with 0.5% octyl glucoside and 4 M guanidine HCl. The modulator was heat-labile and sensitive to trypsin. These results suggest that the reciprocal regulations of cell growth and hepatocyte-specific functions are mediated via cell to cell contact by a cell-surface modulator(s) that is an integral membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1580165073,"The proton gradient (delta pH) and electrical potential (delta psi) across the neurosecretory vesicles were measured using the optical probes 9-aminoacridine and Oxanol VI, respectively. The addition of neurosecretory vesicles to 9-aminoacridine resulted in a rapid quenching of the dye fluorescence which was reversed when the delta pH was collapsed with ammonium chloride or K+ in the presence of nigericin. From fluorescence quenching data and the intravesicular volume, delta pH across the membrane was calculated. Mg2+ ATP caused a marked carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-sensitive change in the membrane potential measured using Oxanol VI (plus 100 mV inside positive), presumably due to H+ translocation across the neurosecretory vesicle membrane. Imposition of this membrane potential was responsible for the lysis of vesicles in the presence of permeant anions. The effectiveness of these anions to support lysis reflected the relative permeability of the anion which followed the order acetate greater than I- greater than Cl greater than F- greater than SO4- = isethionate = methyl sulfate. These data showed that the neurosecretory vesicles possess a membrane H+-translocating system and prompted the study of Mg2+-dependent ATPase activities in the vesicle fractions. In intact vesicles a Mg2+ ATPase appeared to be coupled to electrogenic proton translocation, since the enzyme activity was enhanced by uncoupling the electrical potential, using proton ionophores. Inhibition of this enzyme with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide also inhibited the carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-sensitive delta psi across the vesicle membrane caused by H+ translocation. A second Mg2+ ATPase was also found on the vesicle membranes which is sensitive to vanadate. Complete inhibition of this enzyme with vanadate had little effect on the proton ionophore-uncoupled ATPase activity or on the Mg2+ ATP-induced membrane potential change."

(1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 1300-1303) is further characterized. 7-Chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) was identified as a potent inhibitor of both ATP-dependent proton uptake and Mg2+-ATPase activity of coated vesicles. Thus, incubation with 10 microM NBD-Cl for 10 min at 23 degrees caused the loss of 80% of the Mg2+-ATPase activity and 95% of the proton pumping activity. The observed protection from NBD-Cl inhibition by ATP suggests that NBD-Cl may react at the catalytic site, and reversal of NBD-Cl inhibition by 2-mercaptoethanol is consistent with reaction at either a tyrosine or cysteine residue. In addition, no stable phosphorylated intermediate was observed during turnover of the coated vesicle proton pump and neither Na+ nor K+ was countertransported by the pump during ATP-dependent proton uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1543137167,"The transferrin receptor of sheep reticulocytes is released in vesicular form during in vitro incubation of the reticulocytes. A polyclonal antibody against the transferrin receptor slows down the release of the vesicles bearing the receptor, whereas transferrin and calf serum accelerate vesicle release. Vesicle formation and receptor release are inhibited at low temperatures and by the presence of inhibitors of ATP formation. In addition, lysosomotropic agents or transglutaminase inhibitors block receptor externalization. The externalized receptor has the same molecular size and peptide map as the receptor isolated from the membrane, suggesting that an intact receptor is removed and released from the cell. An unidentified peptide of 70 kDa is externalized with the transferrin receptor. Peptide maps show that the 70-kDa species is not a degradation product of the receptor. No function has yet been assigned to the 70-kDa peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1590305530,"The ATP-dependent calcium transport in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from rat liver was inhibited by 0.1 to 10 microM glucagon. Inhibition of the high affinity (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase was observed concomitantly. This effect was neither mimicked by cyclic AMP nor by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. A study of the structure-activity relationships of six glucagon derivatives demonstrated the specificity of glucagon action since only one or two analogs markedly altered the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activity. The study also demonstrated the total absence of correlation between adenylate cyclase activation and (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase inhibition induced by these glucagon derivatives. The decrease in the maximal velocities induced by glucagon of both calcium transport and (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activity were related to a reduction in the rate of dephosphorylation of the Ca-dependent phosphorylated intermediate of the enzyme. This phosphorylated intermediate was characterized as a 32P-labeled 110,000-dalton protein which accumulated to 50 to 150% over the basal level in the presence of glucagon. The present results demonstrate a novel aspect of the role of glucagon as a calcium-mobilizing agent."
https://openalex.org/W106439688,"The biosynthesis of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was investigated in hepatoma tissue culture cells. Pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine labeling have shown that the two glycosylated subunits of the enzyme (Mr = 58,000 and 29,000) derive from a single glycosylated precursor (Mr = 79,000 at early times). Only one polypeptide chain was immunoprecipitated from cell-free translation products and was shown to correspond to the nonglycosylated precursor (Mr = 64,000). Treatment with endoglycosidase H was used to probe for the transfer of the proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and demonstrated: (i) that the precursor is at least partially cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum; (ii) that part of the precursor is transferred to the Golgi where the processing of the oligosaccharide chains takes place. None of the precursor forms were detected at the surface of the cell where the mature enzyme was found. Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation, did not prevent the proteolytic processing of the enzyme, but delayed the appearance of the mature enzyme at the cell surface. Monensin, which is known to alter Golgi functions, significantly delayed the acquisition of complex type oligosaccharides and the appearance of the enzyme at the cell surface. It did not, however, alter the proteolytic processing of the precursor of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Taken together, these results show that gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is synthetized as a single precursor which is at least partially cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum. Part of the precursor is transferred to the Golgi where its oligosaccharide chains are processed."
https://openalex.org/W1521506765,"Lysyl oxidase from human placentas gave four catalytically active forms on DEAE-cellulose chromatography in 6 M urea. The first tow of these were combined to form pool I and the remaining two to form pool II. Pool I was purified to homogeneity, while the final pool II enzyme usually had one minor contaminant. The molecular weight of both enzyme pools was identical, being about 30,000 by gel filtration in 6 M urea and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No distinct differences were found between the two pools in amino acid composition, specific activity, or the use of various substrates. Two antisera were prepared, one to the total enzyme protein (pools I and II) and the other to pool I. Both antisera inhibited and precipitated crude placental lysyl oxidase, the two enzyme pools, and crude human skin fibroblast enzyme, there being no differences between the various enzyme forms. Both antisera also stained the two enzyme pools in immunoblotting of denatured proteins. The data suggest that there are no major catalytic, molecular, or immunological differences between the multiple forms of human lysyl oxidase. An antiserum prepared to any of the enzyme forms can, therefore, probably be used to study the total enzyme protein."
https://openalex.org/W1634231612,"Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (EC 5.4.99.2; mutase), a cytoplasmically synthesized mitochondrial matrix enzyme, is translated in a cell-free system programmed with rat liver RNA as a larger precursor polypeptide, designated pre-mutase, which appears to be 3-4 kDa larger than the subunit of purified mutase (77.5 kDa). When pre-mutase is incubated with intact rat liver mitochondria, it is taken up by them and proteolytically processed to the size of the mature subunit. The overall reaction is inhibited by compounds such as dinitrophenol which disrupt mitochondrial energy metabolism. The final, proteolytic step can be carried out by the mitochondrial matrix in the presence of added Zn2+ and is inhibited by metal ion chelators and by certain protease inhibitors (e.g. leupeptin and p-aminobenzamidine). Newly synthesized mutase was also detected in intact, cultured Buffalo rat liver cells labeled with [3H] leucine in the presence of dinitrophenol. When dinitrophenol is removed in a pulse-chase protocol, the accumulated pre-mutase is rapidly (t1/2 = 6-9 min) converted to mutase. On the other hand, when the chase is performed in the presence of the inhibitor, the labeled pre-mutase persists for greater than 5 h. This long term stability of pre-mutase contrasts sharply with the instability previously reported for unprocessed precursors of two other mitochondrial enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1603102817,"We describe the isolation of recombinant cDNA clones containing sequences corresponding to mouse thymidylate synthase mRNA. Double-stranded cDNA was made from poly(A+) RNA isolated from the 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-resistant mouse cell line LU3 -7 that overproduces thymidylate synthase 50- to 100-fold as compared to the parental mouse 3T6 fibroblasts. The cDNA was inserted into pBR322 using the poly(dC)-poly(dG) tailing procedure and transformed into Escherichia coli HB101. A library of 30,000 colonies was screened for thymidylate synthase cDNA sequences by differential colony hybridization. Plasmid DNA was purified from a colony that gave a positive signal. RNA corresponding to this plasmid was isolated by hybridization and translated in vitro to yield a protein that coelectrophoresed with authentic thymidylate synthase. The identity of the translation product was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with thymidylate synthase antiserum and by peptide analysis. A restriction fragment from this plasmid was used to rescreen the library to give a collection of thymidylate synthase cDNA plasmids with overlapping restriction maps. Several plasmids contained cDNA inserts greater than 1 kilobase pair in length. The size and content of thymidylate synthase mRNA in the overproducing and parental cell lines was determined by RNA blot analysis. Multiple thymidylate synthase mRNA species were identified. The predominant species was 1.3 kilobase pairs in length. Thymidylate synthase mRNA was 50 times more abundant in LU3 -7 than in 3T6 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1536345188,"The mechanism of activation of soluble guanylate cyclase purified from bovine lung by phenylhydrazine is reported. Heme-deficient and heme-containing forms of guanylate cyclase were studied. Heme-deficient enzyme was activated 10-fold by NO but was not activated by phenylhydrazine. Catalase or methemoglobin enabled phenylhydrazine to activate guanylate cyclase 10-fold and enhanced activation by NO to over 100-fold. Heme-containing enzyme was activated only 3-fold by phenylhydrazine but over 100-fold by NO. Added hemoproteins enhanced enzyme activation by phenylhydrazine to 12-fold without enhancing activation by NO. Reducing or anaerobic conditions inhibited, whereas oxidants enhanced enzyme activation by phenylhydrazine plus catalase, and KCN had no effect. In contrast, enzyme activation by NO and NaN3 was inhibited by oxidants or KCN. NaN3 required native catalase, whereas phenylhydrazine also utilized heat-denatured catalase for enzyme activation. Thus, the mechanism of guanylate cyclase activation by phenylhydrazine differed from that by NO or NaN3. Guanylate cyclase activation by phenylhydrazine resulted from an O2-dependent reaction between phenylhydrazine and hemoproteins to generate stable iron-phenyl hemoprotein complexes. These complexes activated guanylate cyclase in the absence of O2, but lost activity after acidification, basification, or heating. Gel filtration of prereacted mixtures of [U-14C]phenylhydrazine plus hemoproteins resulted in co-chromatography of radioactivity, protein, and guanylate cyclase stimulating activity, and yielded a phenyl-hemoprotein binding stoichiometry of four under specified conditions (one phenyl/heme). [14C]Phenyl bound to heme-containing but not heme-deficient guanylate cyclase and binding correlated with enzyme activation. Moreover, reactions between enzyme and iron-[14C] phenyl hemoprotein complexes resulted in the exchange or transfer of iron-phenyl heme to guanylate cyclase and this correlated with enzyme activation."

(1981) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 882-886). Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the FSBA-inactivated enzyme in 70% HCOOH produced a large peptide (Mr congruent to 4600) in approximately 75% yield containing N epsilon-4-carboxybenzenesulfonyl (CBS) lysine. The CBS-peptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography on the basis of its relatively high UV absorbance at 246 nm (delta epsilon congruent to 19,000 M-1 cm-1). The appearance of the labeled peptide coincided with the loss of a peptide (lacking tyrosine and tryptophan) from the unmodified, active enzyme; the CBS-peptide also could be distinguished from cysteine-containing peptides labeled with thionitrobenzoate and from the adenylylated peptide. The identical peptide was labeled when the unadenylylated enzyme was inactivated with FSBA in the absence or presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+ (+/- L-glutamate) or when the enzyme was adenylylated. Conformational differences among these enzyme forms therefore are not detected by affinity labeling of ATP sites. The FSBA-labeled peptide spans residues 9-48 from the N-terminal end of the subunit polypeptide chain, and sequence analysis by automated Edman degradation revealed that CBS-lysine was at position 47. Thus, lysyl residue 47 appears to be near the subunit gamma-phosphate-binding site for ATP in the native glutamine synthetase structure. The primary structure of the CBS-labeled peptide is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1509446057,"Purified plasma membrane vesicles from GH3 rat anterior pituitary cells exhibit a Mg2+-ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport activity. Concentrative uptake of Ca2+ is abolished by exclusion of either Mg2+ or ATP or by inclusion of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Furthermore, addition of A23187 to vesicles which have reached a steady state of ATP-supported Ca2+ accumulation rapidly and completely discharges accumulated cation. Ca2+ uptake is unaffected by treatment of vesicles with oligomycin, the uncoupler CCCP, or valinomycin and is greatly reduced in non-plasma membrane fractions. Likewise, Ca2+ accumulation is not stimulated by oxalate, consistent with the plasma membrane origin of this transport system. (Na+, K+)-ATPase participation in the Ca2+ transport process (i.e. via coupled Na+/Ca2+ exchange) was eliminated by omitting Na+ and including ouabain in the reaction medium. Ca2+ transport activity in GH3 vesicles has a similar pH dependence as that seen in a number of other plasma membrane systems and is inhibited by orthovanadate in the micromolar range. Inhibition is enhanced if the membranes are preincubated with vanadate for a short time. A kinetic analysis of transport indicates that the apparent Km for free Ca2+ and ATP are 0.7 and 125 microM, respectively. The average Vmax is 3.6 nmol of Ca2+/min/mg of protein at 37 degrees C. Addition of exogenous calmodulin or calmodulin antagonists had no significant effect on these kinetic properties. GH3 plasma membranes also contain a Na+/Ca2+ exchange system. The apparent Km for Ca2+ is almost 10-fold higher in this system than that for ATP-driven Ca2+ uptake. When both processes are compared under similar conditions, the Vmax of the exchanger is approximately 2-3 times that of ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation. Similar results are obtained when purified plasma membranes from bovine anterior pituitary glands were investigated. It is suggested that both Na+/Ca2+ exchange and the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase are important in controlling intracellular levels of Ca2+ in anterior pituitary cells."
https://openalex.org/W1593274505,"Glutamine synthetase from ovine brain has a critical arginine residue at the catalytic site (Powers, S. G., and Riordan, J.F. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 72, 2616-2620). This enzyme is now shown to be a substrate for a purified NAD:arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase from turkey erythrocyte cytosol that catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to arginine and purified proteins. The transferase catalyzed the inactivation of the synthetase in an NAD-dependent reaction; ADP-ribose and nicotinamide did not substitute for NAD. Agmatine, an alternate ADP-ribose acceptor in the transferase-catalyzed reaction, prevented inactivation of glutamine synthetase. MgATP, a substrate for the synthetase which was previously shown to protect that enzyme from chemical inactivation, also decreased the rate of inactivation in the presence of NAD and ADP-ribosyltransferase. Using [32P]NAD, it was observed that approximately 90% inactivation occurred following the transfer of 0.89 mol of [32P]ADP-ribose/mol of synthetase. The erythrocyte transferase also catalyzed the NAD-dependent inactivation of glutamine synthetase purified from chicken heart; 0.60 mol of ADP-ribose was transferred per mol of enzyme, resulting in a 95% inactivation. As noted with the ovine brain enzyme, agmatine and MgATP protected the chicken synthetase from inactivation and decreased the extent of [32P]ADP-ribosylation of the synthetase. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that the NAD:arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase modifies specifically an arginine residue involved in the catalytic site of glutamine synthetase. Although the transferase can use numerous proteins as ADP-ribose acceptors, some characteristics of this particular arginine, perhaps the same characteristics that are involved in its function in the catalytic site, make it a favored ADP-ribose acceptor site for the transferase."
https://openalex.org/W1608499286,"The partially purified preparation of messenger RNA guanylyltransferase from Artemia salina contains, as in the case of the rat liver enzyme (Yagi, Y., Mizumoto, K., and Kaziro, Y. (1983) EMBO J. 2, 611-615), the RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity which specifically removes the gamma-phosphoryl group from the 5'-triphosphoryl end of the newly synthesized mRNA molecule. The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain of Mr = 73,000 and forma a covalent enzyme-GMP complex as an intermediate for the guanylyltransferase reaction. Upon limited hydrolysis with trypsin, the enzyme-[32P]GMP complex is converted to a smaller 32P-containing fragment of Mr = 44,000. When the free enzyme, not complexed with GMP, is digested with trypsin under the same condition as above, the digests retain almost full activities of both guanylyltransferase and RNA 5'-triphosphatase and can form an enzyme-[32P]GMP complex of the size of Mr = 44,000 on incubation with [alpha-32P]GTP. Functional domains harboring the activities of guanylyltransferase and RNA 5'-triphosphatase are separated by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column at positions corresponding to Mr = 44,000 and 20,000, respectively. They can be separated completely from each other by CM-Sephadex column chromatography. While the native, undigested enzyme can transfer the GMP moiety to mRNA molecules with either triphosphoryl (pppN-) or diphosphoryl (ppN-)5'terminal, the purified Mr = 44,000 domain with the guanylyltransferase activity can utilize only the latter as an acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1525400828,"4-Thioflavins (oxygen at position 4 replaced by sulfur) have been studied as potential active site probes of flavoproteins. They react readily with thiol reagents, with large spectral changes, which should be useful for testing the accessibility of the flavin 4-position in flavoproteins. They have an oxidation-reduction potential at pH 7 of -0.055 V, approximately 0.15 V higher than that of native flavins. The spectral characteristics in the fully reduced state show two clear absorption bands, dependent on the ionization state (pK = 4.5). The lowest energy band of the neutral dihydroflavin has a maximum at approximately 485 nm while that of the anion is approximately 425 nm. This should be useful in defining the ionization state of the reduced flavin in flavoproteins. The spectral characteristics of the semiquinoid forms of 4-thioflavins have been determined bound to the apoproteins of flavodoxin and D-amino acid oxidase. The neutral radical has an absorption maximum at 730 nm, while the anion radical has an unusually sharp peak at 415 nm. The reduced forms of 4-thioflavins, free and enzyme bound, react with O2 to regenerate oxidized 4-thioflavin. Reduced 4-thio-FAD p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, however, in its reaction with O2, undergoes a substantial conversion to the native FAD-enzyme. 4-Thioflavins are unusually susceptible to attack by nucleophiles such as hydroxylamine and amines to form the respective 4-hydroxyimino- and 4-aminoflavins, offering the possibility of forming stable covalent flavin-protein linkages with suitably positioned protein residues. Thiols also react with 4-thioflavins, promoting their conversion to the normal (4-oxo) flavin coenzymes. Such reactivity has been found with the apoenzymes of glucose oxidase and lactate oxidase, providing evidence for a thiol residue in the active site of these enzymes."

Of the nucleoside triphosphates commonly found in DNA and RNA, only dUTP acted as a substrate for the enzyme, and the apparent Km was 4 microM. While the HSV-1-induced dUTPase exhibited activity in the absence of added divalent cations, the activity was stimulated by Mg2+ and inhibited by EDTA. The inhibition caused by EDTA was reversed by Mg2+, Co2+, or Mn2+. The HSV-1-induced dUTPase was also inhibited by hydroxymercuribenzoate and to a lesser degree by pyrophosphate but not by orthophosphate. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 53,000, and its isoelectric point was 5.8. The enzyme exhibited maximal activity over the pH range of 6.5-8.5. The enzyme was thermolabile at 45 degrees C, exhibiting a t1/2 of 35 min. The HSV-1-induced dUTPase was distinguishable from the KB dUTPase by its elution pattern on the various chromatography matrixes, isoelectric point, migration in polyacrylamide gels, thermostability, and response to divalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W1481495819,"Actin-activated ATP hydrolysis by phosphorylated arterial myosin is Ca2+-dependent at Mg2+ concentrations which allow myosin to bind 2 mol of Ca2+ per mol (S. Chacko and A. Rosenfeld (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 292-296). The possible effects of myosin filament formation and conformational change involving the rod portion of the myosin molecule on actin-myosin interaction and actin-activated ATP hydrolysis was eliminated by utilizing soluble heavy meromyosin (HMM). HMM was prepared from phosphorylated arterial myosin by chymotryptic digestion and purified by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B. Actin-activated ATPase activity of the phosphorylated HMM was measured either at constant Mg2+ and variable Ca2+ or at constant Ca2+ and variable Mg2+ concentrations. At constant (0.05 M) ionic strength and pCa 5, the actin-activated ATPase activity increased until the free Mg2+ reached between 0.5-1 mM; this was followed by a decrease in activity to a very low level at 7 mM free Mg2+. Removal of Ca2+ at 1 mM free Mg2+ lowered the actin-activated ATPase activity (40-60% inhibition). These experiments demonstrated that Mg2+ and Ca2+ had a direct effect on actin-activated ATP hydrolysis. This effect was not due to myosin filament formation and was independent of the conformational change involving the rod portion of the myosin molecule."

The stimulation of the autolysin activity by dodecylglycerol mimics the activation of the autolysin from a latent to an active form by trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes. This stimulation of autolytic activity by dodecylglycerol can be reversed by specific proteinase inhibitors. Dodecylglycerol also markedly stimulates the proteinase activity endogenous to S. faecium, and this stimulation can be reversed by several proteinase inhibitors. It is concluded that one primary antibacterial mode of action of dodecylglycerol is to stimulate the proteinase of S. faecium which activates the cell's autolysin and thereby prevents bacterial growth."
https://openalex.org/W1516371094,"Tyrosine hydroxylase is activated in the adrenal gland in vivo after acute stresses, such as decapitation or electroconvulsive shock. In nonstressed animals that are anesthetized with pentobarbital prior to surgical removal of the adrenals, approximately 5-10% of the enzyme molecules are in the activated form, whereas in stressed animals, approximately 40-50% of the enzyme molecules are in the activated form. In the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that the stress-induced activation of the adrenal enzyme in vivo is due to the phosphorylation of the enzyme by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Soluble adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase prepared from either stressed or nonstressed rats is incubated in vitro with [gamma-32P]ATP and purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase under optimal conditions for the phosphorylation of the enzyme. Using this assay, we have measured the number of vacant sites remaining on the enzyme, which are available for in vitro phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. These studies suggest that the initial, in vitro rate of phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase isolated from stressed rats is less than the initial rate of phosphorylation of the enzyme isolated from nonstressed rats. However, there is no significant difference in the final level of 32P phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase isolated from either stressed or nonstressed rats. We conclude that, even though phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase leads to the activation of the enzyme under in vitro conditions, this mechanism cannot account for the activation of the enzyme in vivo in the adrenal gland following decapitation."
https://openalex.org/W70642836,"5-Oxo-L-prolinase catalyzes a reaction in which the endergonic cleavage of 5-oxo-L-proline to form L-glutamate is coupled to the exergonic cleavage of ATP to ADP and Pi. In the present research, the enzyme present in a strain of Pseudomonas putida isolated from soil by enrichment culture was found to be composed of two protein components. Neither component alone could catalyze the 5-oxoprolinase reaction, but the reaction was effectively catalyzed when they were mixed. One component (A) exhibited 5-oxo-L-proline-dependent ATPase activity indicating that Component A can interact with both ATP and 5-oxo-L-proline. The other component (coupling protein; B) does not exhibit ATPase activity nor is there evidence that it binds 5-oxo-L-proline. The findings are consistent with (but do not prove) the hypothesis that the Component A catalyzes an initial step in the reaction which involves 5-oxoproline and ATP, such as phosphorylation of 5-oxoproline. The coupling protein (B) may function as a catalyst that converts a phosphorylated form of 5-oxoproline to glutamate, or it might alter the conformation of Component A so as to facilitate the reaction."

The rate of inactivation reaches a limiting value of 0.021 min-1 (pH 7.7, 22 degrees C) as the concentration of inhibitor is increased, consistent with a two-step mechanism with complex formation prior to covalent inactivation. This rate decreases with decreasing pH in a manner that suggests that the basic form of a group within the enzyme, with an apparent pKa of 6.7, is required for inactivation. Approximately three [14C]methyl residues are covalently incorporated at maximal inactivation.

Chem. 257, 7922-7925). In this study we examine the biosynthesis of binding protein in human fibroblasts, human hepatoma HepG2 cells, and a human kidney tumor cell line. Binding protein immunoprecipitated from radioiodinated detergent-extracted fibroblast membranes has a molecular weight of 120,000 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An additional band of Mr 100,000 is also present which we believe is a result of proteolysis of the 120,000 band. Purified soluble kidney binding protein has an Mr of 112,000. Binding protein from fibroblasts pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min migrates as a 110-kDa band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Within 30-60 min of chase, the intensity of the 110-kDa band is diminished, and a 120-kDa band has appeared. Binding protein reaches the cell surface of fibroblasts within 30-60 min of chase. The same results are obtained with the other cell lines studied. Thus, binding protein is initially synthesized as a precursor of 110 kDa which chases into a 120-kDa mature form. The shift of 10 kDa is probably due to processing of its oligosaccharide chains since soluble kidney-binding protein contains 7-9 complex N-linked chains. Upon endoglycosidase H treatment, the 110,000 precursor shifts to a Mr of 89,000 while the 120,000 mature band shifts to 115,000, consistent with the presence of 7-9 high mannose chains on the precursor and 1-2 high mannose chains on the mature form. These results and the presence of complex N-linked chains on binding protein were confirmed by lectin affinity chromatography of glycopeptides derived from [2-3H]mannose-labeled binding protein. Analysis of [6-3H]glucosamine-labeled binding protein indicates the presence of 1 sialic acid residue per chain."

The observed rate constants are independent of subfragment 1 concentration under pseudo first-order conditions for ATP with respect to protein. The fraction of protein which hydrolyzes ATP rapidly is not a function of the nucleotide or protein concentration and appears to be constant irrespective of ionic strength or temperature within the range studied (50-100 mM KCl, pH 7.0, 15-20 degrees C).

https://openalex.org/W1617980870,"Clathrin, the major structural protein associated with both coated pits and coated vesicles, has been implicated in the dynamics of various endocytotic processes. In an attempt to define the mechanisms involved in the transition from uncoated membranes to clathrin-coated pits and then to coated vesicles, we investigated by infrared spectroscopy the lipid perturbations arising from the interactions of the clathrin coat with the bilayers of intact membrane assemblies. A comparison of the lipid acyl chain symmetric methylene stretching modes at approximately 2850 cm-1 for isolated clathrin-coated vesicles, uncoated vesicles, and synaptic membranes at 21, 38, and 50 degrees C indicated that clathrin significantly increases the number of gauche chain conformers in the bilayer matrix of the coated vesicle system. The increase in lipid disorder at 21 degrees C, accompanying the observed 0.44-cm-1 frequency increase for coated vesicles compared to uncoated vesicles, is approximately equivalent to the intrachain disorder incurred in heating liquid crystalline dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine multilayers by approximately 10 degrees C. The implications of these results on coated vesicle formation are discussed."

It sediments in a glycerol gradient as a single species of 4.5 S. The enzyme has considerable activity at 0 degree C and has a Q10 of 3.8. In the presence of a DNA effector and magnesium ion, the enzyme will hydrolyze ATP, dATP, GTP, or dGTP to a nucleoside diphosphate plus orthophosphate with a Km of 0.20, 0.50, 0.60, and 1.30 mM, respectively. The guanine nucleotides, however, are only 25-35% as effective as substrates compared with the adenine nucleotides. ATPase IV shows strong substrate inhibition by ATP, but not dATP, above 0.2 mM. The polynucleotide effector requirement can be satisfied by either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA. The enzyme binds the effector very tightly with a Km of 3 X 10(-8) M (nucleotide) for G4 DNA.
