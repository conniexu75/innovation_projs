https://openalex.org/W2006641366,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans at the cell surface and to receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. Prevention of binding between cell surface heparan sulfate and bFGF (i) substantially reduces binding of fibroblast growth factor to its cell-surface receptors, (ii) blocks the ability of bFGF to support the growth of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, and (iii) induces terminal differentiation of MM14 skeletal muscle cells, which is normally repressed by fibroblast growth factor. These results indicate that cell surface heparan sulfate is directly involved in bFGF cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2081704409,"The mechanism by which Ca2+ mediates gene induction in response to membrane depolarization was investigated. The adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB) was shown to function as a Ca(2+)-regulated transcription factor and as a substrate for depolarization-activated Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaM kinases) I and II. CREB residue Ser133 was the major site of phosphorylation by the CaM kinases in vitro and of phosphorylation after membrane depolarization in vivo. Mutation of Ser133 impaired the ability of CREB to respond to Ca2+. These results suggest that CaM kinases may transduce electrical signals to the nucleus and that CREB functions to integrate Ca2+ and cAMP signals."
https://openalex.org/W2041190857,"Neurotrophic factors are essential for neuronal survival and function. Recent data have demonstrated that the product of the tyrosine kinase trk proto-oncogene binds NGF and is a component of the high affinity NGF receptor. Analysis of the trkB gene product, gp145trkB, in NIH 3T3 cells indicates that this tyrosine kinase receptor is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon exposure to the NGF-related neurotrophic factors BDNF and NT-3. Furthermore, gp145trkB specifically binds BDNF and NT-3 in NIH 3T3 cells and in hippocampal cells, but does not bind NGF. Thus, the trk family of receptors are likely to be important signal transducers of NGF-related trophic signals in the formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2059110341,"The DNA from a wide variety of human tumors has sustained mutations within the conserved p53 coding regions. We have purified wild-type and tumor-derived mutant p53 proteins expressed from baculovirus vectors and examined their interactions with SV40 DNA. Using DNAase I footprinting assays, we observed that both human and murine wild-type p53 proteins bind specifically to sequences adjacent to the late border of the viral replication origin. By contrast, mutant p53 proteins failed to bind specifically to these sequences. SV40 T antigen prevented wild-type p53 from interacting with this region. These data show that normal but not oncogenic forms of p53 are capable of sequence-specific interactions with viral DNA. Furthermore, they provide insights into the mechanisms by which viral proteins might regulate the control of viral growth and cell division."

https://openalex.org/W2084381419,"The alpha subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase plays a major role in the subunit assembly. Carboxyterminal deletion derivatives lacking 73 or 94 amino acid residues were assembled in vitro into enzyme molecules. Core enzymes consisting of these C-terminal-truncated alpha subunits were as active in RNA synthesis as native core enzyme. By the addition of sigma 70 subunit, these mutant enzymes initiated transcription from certain promoters. The mutant RNA polymerases, however, did not show cAMP-CRP activated transcription. These results demonstrate that the N-terminal region of the alpha subunit is involved in the formation of active enzyme molecule, while the C-terminal region plays an essential role in response to transcription activation by cAMP-CRP."
https://openalex.org/W1550906650,"During the wound healing process lysis of basement membranes precedes keratinocyte migration into the wound bed. We studied, in vitro, whether this degradation of basement membranes could be regulated by transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), which is known to accelerate wound healing in vivo. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 was found to increase the expression of both 92- and 72-kDa type IV collagenases (gelatinases) in cultured human mucosal and dermal keratinocytes. The 92-kDa enzyme predominated in both unstimulated and stimulated cultures. The 92-kDa form was stimulated over 5-fold, and the other form by a factor of 2-3. This increase in the synthesis of type IV collagenases was associated with a marked increase in the mRNA levels of these enzymes as well. The induction of the 92-kDa enzyme was similar in culture medium containing either 0.15 or 1.2 mM calcium chloride. Rat mucosal keratinocytes secreted only 92-kDa type IV collagenase, the secretion of which was not regulated by TGF-beta 1. Also, TGF-beta 1 did not cause any significant induction (maximum about 1.2-fold) of either type IV collagenase in human gingival fibroblasts. The induction levels of both collagenases in human keratinocytes were independent of the type of the extracellular matrix the cells were grown on. However, the basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) activated about half of the 92-kDa type to its 84-kDa active form. The data suggest that TGF-beta 1 has a specific function in up-regulating the expression of type IV collagenases in human keratinocytes, offering a possible explanation of how keratinocytes detach from basement membranes prior to the migration over the wound bed."
https://openalex.org/W1592646667,"Abstract Occupancy-induced down-regulation of cell surface epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors attenuates signal transduction. To define mechanisms through which down-regulation of this class of growth factor receptors occurs, we have investigated the relative roles of ligand-induced internalization and recycling in this process. Occupied, kinase-active EGF receptors were internalized through a high affinity, saturable endocytic system at rates up to 10-fold faster than empty receptors. In contrast, full length EGF receptors lacking tyrosine kinase activity underwent internalization at a rate independent of occupancy. This kinase-independent internalization rate appeared to reflect constitutive receptor internalization since it was similar to the internalization rate of both receptors lacking a cytoplasmic domain and of antibodies bound to empty receptors. EGF internalized by either kinase-active or kinase-inactive receptors was efficiently recycled and was found within endosomes containing recycling transferrin receptors. However, targeting of internalized receptors to lysosomes did not require receptor kinase activity. All receptors that displayed ligand-induced internalization also underwent down-regulation, indicating that the proximal cause of down-regulation is occupancy-induced endocytosis. Tyrosine kinase activity greatly enhances this process by stabilizing receptor association with the endocytic apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1541707791,"A Na+/H+ antiporter coded by the nhaA (ant) gene of Escherichia coli has been overproduced and purified. The amino-terminal sequence of the protein has been determined and shown to correlate with initiation at a GUG codon, 75 bases upstream from the previously suggested AUG initiation codon. The purified protein, when reconstituted into proteoliposomes, has Na+/H+ antiport activity. It can mediate sodium uptake when a transmembrane pH gradient is applied. Downhill sodium efflux is shown to be highly dependent on pH and is accelerated by a transmembrane pH gradient. An imposed membrane potential negative inside accelerates Na+ efflux at all pH values tested. These findings suggest that the antiporter is electrogenic both at acid and alkaline pH. The activation at alkaline pH values (2000-fold increase) is consistent with the proposed role of the antiporter in regulation of internal pH at the alkaline pH range."

https://openalex.org/W1592358009,"alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors (alpha 2-AR) exist as subtypes that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and differ in 1) their ligand recognition properties, 2) their extent of receptor protein glycosylation, and possible 3) their mechanism of signal transduction. Genomic or cDNA clones encoding three receptor subtypes have been characterized; however, both functional and radioligand binding studies in rodents suggest the existence of a fourth receptor subtype. To isolate the rat genes encoding receptor subtypes we screened a rat genomic library with an oligonucleotide probe encompassing the third membrane span of the human C-4 alpha 2-AR. Two intronless rat genes were isolated that encode distinct receptor subtypes (RG10, RG20). RG10 and RG20 encode proteins of 458 and 450 amino acids, respectively, that are 56% homologous and possess the structural features expected of this class of membrane-bound receptors. RG10 identifies a mRNA species of approximately 2500 nucleotides that is found primarily in brain, whereas RG20 identifies a larger mRNA species (approximately 4000 nucleotides) that is found in several tissues including brain, kidney, and salivary gland. RG10 is 88% homologous to the human C-4 alpha 2-AR and exhibits similar binding properties ( [3H]rauwolscine KD = 0.7 +/- 0.3 nM) as determined following transient expression of the receptor in COS-1 cells. RG20 exhibits ligand binding properties distinct from the three receptor subtypes identified by molecular cloning. Saturation binding studies indicate an affinity constant of 15 +/- 1.2 nM for the alpha 2-AR antagonist [3H]rauwolscine, a value 6-20 times higher than that observed for the three cloned receptor subtypes. In competition binding studies the potency order of competing ligands for RG20 is phentolamine greater than idazoxan greater than yohimbine greater than rauwolscine greater than prazosin. Of the three previously cloned alpha 2-AR, RG20 is most closely related to the human C-10 alpha 2-AR (89% homology) and is also capable of mediating adenylylcyclase inhibition as determined following its stable expression in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. However, in contrast to RG20, [3H] rauwolscine exhibits a KD of 2 nM for the C-10 receptor, and the potency order for competing ligands is rauwolscine greater than or equal to yohimbine greater than idazoxan greater than phentolamine greater than prazosin. RG20 and C-10 are also distinguished by their affinity for SKF-10478 (RG20 Ki = 531 nM, C-10 Ki = 101 nM), a compound that may functionally distinguish pre- and postsynaptic alpha 2-AR. These data suggest that RG20 represents a fourth alpha 2-AR subtype distinct from the known alpha 2A-C receptor subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W1513212892,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) activates neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PMN) through a receptor that specifically recognizes short sn-2 residues. We oxidized synthetic [2-arachidonoyl]phosphatidylcholine to fragment and shorten the sn-2 residue, and then examined the phospholipid products for the ability to stimulate PMN. 1-Palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was fragmented by ozonolysis to 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. This phospholipid activated human neutrophils at submicromolar concentrations, and is effects were inhibited by specific PAF receptor antagonists WEB2086, L659,989, and CV3988. 1-Palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine next was fragmented by an uncontrolled free radical-catalyzed reaction: it was treated with soybean lipoxygenase to form its sn-2 15-hydroperoxy derivative (which did not activate neutrophils) and then allowed to oxidize under air. The secondary oxidation resulted in the formation of numerous fragmented phospholipids (Stremler, K. E., Stafforini, D. M., Prescott, S. M., and McIntyre, T. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11095-11103), some of which activated PMN. Hydrolysis of sn-2 residues with phospholipase A2 destroyed biologic activity, as did hydrolysis with PAF acetylhydrolase. PAF acetylhydrolase is specific for short or intermediate length sn-2 residues and does not hydrolyze the starting material (Stremler, K. E., Stafforini, D. M., Prescott, S. M., and McIntyre, T. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11095-11103). Neutrophil activation was completely blocked by L659,989, a specific PAF receptor antagonist. We conclude that diacylphosphatidylcholines containing an sn-2 polyunsaturated fatty acyl residue can be oxidatively fragmented to species with sn-2 residues short enough to activate the PAF receptor of neutrophils. This suggests a new mechanism for the appearance of biologically active phospholipids, and shows that PAF receptor antagonists block the action of both PAF and these PAF-like lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2147359801,"Abstract The gene coding for bacteriorhodopsin was modified in vitro to replace Asp212 with asparagine and expressed in Halobacterium halobium. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the major lattice dimension of purple membrane containing the mutated bacteriorhodopsin was the same as wild type. At pH greater than 7, the Asp212----Asn chromophore was blue (absorption maximum at 585 nm) and exhibited a photocycle containing only the intermediates K and L, i.e. a reaction sequence very similar to that of wild-type bacteriorhodopsin at pH less than 3 and the blue form of the Asp85----Glu protein at pH less than 9. Since in the latter cases these effects are attributed to protonation of residue 85, it now appears that removal of the carboxylate of Asp212 has similar consequences as removing the carboxylate of Asp85. However, an important difference is that only Asp85 affects the pKa of the Schiff base. At pH less than 7, the Asp212----Asn protein was purple (absorption maximum at 569 nm) but photoexcitation produced only 15% of the normal amount of M and the transport activity was partial. The reactions of the blue and purple forms after photoexcitation are both quantitatively accounted for by a proposed scheme, K in equilibrium with L1 in equilibrium with L2----BR, but with the addition of an L1 in equilibrium with M reaction with unfavorable pKa for Schiff base deprotonation in the purple form. The latter hinders the transient accumulation of M, and the consequent branching at L1 allows only partial proton transport activity. The results are consistent with the existence of a complex counterion for the Schiff base proposed earlier (De Groot, H. J. M., Harbison, G. S., Herzfeld, J., and Griffin, R. G. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 3346-3353) and suggest that Asp85, Asp212, and at least one other protonable residue participate in it."
https://openalex.org/W2074594806,"We have developed a cell-free system in which the bacterial transposon Tn7 inserts at high frequency into its preferred target site in the Escherichia coli chromosome, attTn7; Tn7 transposition in vitro requires ATP and Tn7-encoded proteins. Tn7 transposes via a cut and paste mechanism in which the element is excised from the donor DNA by staggered double-strand breaks and then inserted into attTn7 by the joining of 3' transposon ends to 5' target ends. Neither recombination intermediates nor products are observed in the absence of any protein component or DNA substrate. Thus, we suggest that Tn7 transposition occurs in a nucleoprotein complex containing several proteins and the substrate DNAs and that recognition of attTn7 within this complex provokes strand cleavages at the Tn7 ends."
https://openalex.org/W1491415846,"The first step in the production of eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor is the hydrolysis of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipid by phospholipase A2. We previously purified from the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 an intracellular phospholipase A2 that preferentially hydrolyzes sn-2-arachidonic acid. The enzyme exhibits a molecular mass of 100 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.6. When assayed for other activities, the phospholipase A2 was found to exhibit lysophospholipase activity against palmitoyllysoglycerophosphocholine, and both activities copurified to a single band on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. An antibody against the macrophage enzyme was found to quantitatively immunoprecipitate both phospholipase A2 and lysophospholipase activities from a crude cytosolic fraction. When the immunoprecipitated material was analyzed on immunoblots, a single band at 100 kDa was evident, further suggesting that a single protein possessed both enzyme activities. When assayed as a function of palmitoyllysoglycerophosphocholine concentration and plotted as a double-reciprocal plot, two different slopes were apparent, corresponding to concentrations above and below the critical micellar concentration (7 microM) of the substrate. Above the critical micellar concentration, lysophospholipase exhibited an apparent Km of 25 microM and a Vmax of 1.5 mumol/min/mg. Calcium was not required for lysophospholipase activity, in contrast to phospholipase A2 activity. The enzyme, when assayed as either a phospholipase A2 or lysophospholipase, exhibited nonlinear kinetics beyond 1-2 min despite low substrate conversion. Readdition to more substrate after the activity plateaued did not result in further enzyme activity, ruling out substrate depletion. Readdition of enzyme, however, resulted in another burst of enzyme activity. The results are not consistent with product inhibition, but suggest that the enzyme may be subject to inactivation during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2128393563,"Previous results have demonstrated the binding of a 76- and 80-kDa serum protein to the Heymann nephritis autoantigen, gp330. This 76-kDa serum protein was purified by column chromatography and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A rabbit polyclonal antibody for the serum protein was produced and used to screen a rat liver cDNA expression library. Sequence analysis of an isolated clone identified the serum protein as plasminogen. Plasminogen was isolated from rat serum by standard techniques, and the binding of plasminogen to gp330 was confirmed by Western analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results demonstrated a time-dependent, saturable, and specifically inhibitable binding of plasminogen to gp330. There was no significant difference in the binding of the two carbohydrate forms of plasminogen to gp330. Plasminogen binding to gp330 could be completely inhibited by the addition of exogenous gp330. This binding could also be partially inhibited by benzamidine but only slightly by the lysine analogue, epsilon-aminocaproic acid. However, even a combination of these two inhibitors could not completely block the binding of plasminogen to gp330 indicating that gp330 may be binding to plasminogen through some other unknown interactions. These results demonstrate that gp330 is a receptor site for plasminogen."
https://openalex.org/W1985954201,"The MuA and MuB proteins collaborate to mediate efficient transposition of the phage Mu genome into many DNA target sites. MuA (the transposase) carries out all the DNA cleavage and joining steps. MuB stimulates strand transfer by activating the MuA-donor DNA complex through direct protein-protein contact. The C-terminal domain of MuA is required for this MuA-MuB interaction. Activation of strand transfer occurs irrespective of whether MuB is bound to target DNA. When high levels of MuA generate a pool of free MuB (not bound to DNA) or when chemical modification of MuB impairs its ability to bind DNA, MuB still stimulates strand transfer. However, under these conditions, intramolecular target sites are used exclusively because of their close proximity to the MuA-MuB-donor DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W1544960301,"Two proteins have been identified in rat liver plasma membranes that bind a photoreactive GTP analogue, [32P]gamma-azidoanilido GTP, in response to incubation with the Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonist, vasopressin. The labeled proteins possess apparent molecular masses of 42 and 43 kDa. Their labeling requires Mg2+ and can be inhibited by GTP, its analogues, and GDP but not by other nucleotides. Vasopressin-stimulated labeling is attenuated by a V1 receptor-selective antagonist. The concentration of vasopressin required to stimulate labeling is in the same range (EC50 = 4 nM) as that required for activation of GTPase and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activities in liver plasma membranes. Immunodetection and immunoprecipitation of the [32P]gamma-azidoanilido GTP-labeled 42- and 43-kDa proteins with antisera raised against peptide sequences in alpha q indicate that these proteins are members of the recently described Gq class of G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1572791624,"Formation of the covalently stabilized alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT)-neutrophil elastase complex, the archetype of serpin-enzyme complexes, results in a structurally rearranged alpha 1-AT molecule that possesses chemo-attractant activities, mediates an increase in synthesis of alpha 1-AT by mononuclear phagocytes and hepatocytes, and is more rapidly cleared from the circulation than is the native alpha 1-AT molecule. We have recently identified an abundant, high affinity cell surface receptor on human hepatoma HepG2 cells and human monocytes that binds alpha 1-AT-elastase complexes, mediates endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of alpha 1-AT-elastase complexes, and induces an increase in synthesis of alpha 1-AT. We have referred to this receptor as the serpin-enzyme complex, or SEC, receptor because it also recognizes complexes of serpins antithrombin III, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and C1 inhibitor with their cognate enzymes. In the current study, we show that a pentapeptide domain in the carboxyl terminal fragment of alpha 1-AT (amino acids 370-374, FVFLM) is sufficient for binding to the SEC receptor. A synthetic analog of this pentapeptide (peptide 105C, FVYLI) blocks binding and internalization of alpha 1-AT-125I-trypsin complexes by HepG2 cells. 125I-Peptide 105C binds specifically and saturably to HepG2 cells, and its binding is blocked by alpha 1-AT-trypsin or alpha 1-AT-elastase complexes. Alterations of this sequence introduced into synthetic peptides (mutations, deletions, or scrambling) demonstrate that binding of the pentapeptide domain is sequence-specific. Comparisons with the sequences of other serpins in the corresponding region indicate that this pentapeptide neodomain is highly conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1510045468,"Peptides derived from various regions of the alpha 2A-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2A-AR) were used to study receptor-G protein interactions. Binding of the partial agonist [125I]-p-iodoclonidine and the full agonist [3H]bromoxidine (UK14,304) to membrane preparations from human platelet was potently reduced by peptides (12-14 amino acids) from the second cytoplasmic loop (A) and the C-terminal side of the third cytoplasmic loop (Q). Binding of the antagonist [3H]yohimbine was significantly less affected. Five other peptides had no significant effects on ligand binding at concentrations less than 100 microM. The IC50 values for peptides A and Q were 7 and 27 microM for [125I]-p-iodoclonidine binding at the platelet alpha 2A receptor, 15 and 71 microM for the neuroblastoma-glioma (NG108-15) alpha 2B receptor, and greater than 300 microM for yohimbine binding at both alpha 2A and alpha 2B receptors. Competition studies demonstrate that at concentrations of 100 microM, peptides A and Q reduce the affinity of bromoxidine for the platelet alpha 2A-AR and this effect was abolished in the presence of guanine nucleotide. Alpha 2A-AR-stimulated GTPase activity in platelet membranes was inhibited by peptide Q with an IC50 of 16 microM but A was inactive. These data suggest that both the second cytoplasmic loop and the C-terminal part of the third cytoplasmic loop of the alpha 2A-AR are important in the interaction between the alpha 2-AR and Gi protein. Peptide Q appears to destabilize the high affinity state of the alpha 2-AR by binding directly to Gi thus preventing it from coupling to the receptor under both binding and GTPase assay conditions. The peptide from the second cytoplasmic loop (A) also reduces high affinity agonist binding in a G protein-dependent manner but its interaction with receptor and G protein is distinct in that it does not prevent activation of the G protein. These results provide new information about regions of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor involved in G protein coupling and high affinity agonist binding."
https://openalex.org/W1586938023,"We studied the structure and function of the human insulin receptor (IR) and a mutant which lacked the last 43 amino acids of the beta-subunit (IR delta ct). This deletion removed tyrosine (Tyr1322, Tyr1316) and threonine (Thr1336) phosphorylation sites. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, insulin binding to the mutant receptor was normal, and [35S]methionine labeling indicated that both the IR and IR delta ct were processed normally; however, the beta-subunit of IR delta ct was 5 kDa smaller than that of the IR. The time course of insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the partially purified IR delta ct was normal, but the maximum autophosphorylation was reduced 20-30%. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping confirmed the absence of the C-terminal phosphorylation sites and indicated that phosphorylation of the regulatory region (Tyr1146, Tyr1150, Tyr1151) occurred normally; kinase activity of the IR and IR delta ct was activated normally by insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation. In the intact CHO cells, insulin-stimulated serine and threonine phosphorylation of the IR delta ct was reduced 20%, suggesting that most Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites are located outside of the C terminus. During insulin stimulation, the wild-type and mutant insulin receptor activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Moreover, insulin itself or human-specific anti-insulin receptor antibodies stimulated glycogen and DNA synthesis equally in both CHO/IR and CHO/IR delta ct cells. These data suggest that the C terminus plays a minimal role in IR function and signal transmission in CHO cells."
https://openalex.org/W2144794307,"The gene (tesB) encoding Escherichia coli thioesterase II, a low-abundance enzyme of unknown physiological function which can hydrolyze a broad range of acyl-CoA thioesters, has been localized by transposon mutagenesis, cloned and sequenced. A two-cistron construct containing both the lac and tesB promoters was used successfully to overexpress the 286-residue polypeptide. The recombinant enzyme constituted up to 25% of the soluble proteins of E. coli and was readily purified to homogeneity as a tetramer of approximately 120,000 Da. Amino-terminal sequence analysis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry confirmed the identity of the thioesterase and revealed that the amino-terminal formyl-methionine had been removed yielding a subunit species of average molecular mass 31,842 Da. The protein does not contain the GXSXG motif found characteristically in animal thioesterases which function as chain-terminating enzymes in fatty acid synthesis and exhibits no sequence similarity with these or any other known proteins. Activity of the recombinant enzyme was inhibited by iodoacetamide and diethylpyrocarbonate. The carboxamidomethylated residue was identified as histidine 58, and a role for this amino acid in catalysis is suggested. E. coli strains having a large deletion within the genomic tesB gene grew normally but retained a low level of thioesterase activity toward decanoyl-CoA. This residual activity indicates the presence of an additional decanoyl-CoA hydrolase in E. coli. Over-expression of the recombinant enzyme, under control of the lac promoter, did not alter the fatty acids synthesized by E. coli at any stage of cell growth and the physiological role of this enzyme remains an enigma."
https://openalex.org/W1606768961,"Nitric oxide reductase was purified from Paracoccus denitrificans very nearly to homogeneity by a simple method that involved the use of octyl glucoside to solubilize the enzyme from membranes and required a single hydroxyapatite column. The enzyme had specific activities of about 10 mumol NO reduced x min-1 x mg-1 at pH 6.5 in an amperometric assay system using phenazine methosulfate/ascorbate as the reducing agent and about 22 mumol NO reduced x min-1 x mg-1 at pH 5.0, which is the optimum pH. These values are based on average rates over kinetically complex progress curves and would be about three times greater if based on maximum rate values. The enzyme appeared to be reversibly inhibited by NOaq and to have a Km too low (probably less than or equal to 1 microM) to measure reliably by the amperometric method. The effective second-order rate constant of the enzyme lay within 1 to 2 orders of magnitude of the diffusion controlled limit. The enzyme was composed of a tight complex of two cytochromes: a cytochrome c (Mr = 17,500) and a cytochrome b (Mr = 38,000). The mole ratios of cytochrome c to cytochrome b and Mr 17,500 peptide to Mr 38,000 peptide were both about 1.7, and the heme content was about 3 mol/73,000 g (38,000 + 2(17,500)). Each subunit therefore contained only one heme group. The Mr 38,000 peptide aggregated when heated in the sample buffer used for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ascorbate-based activity, the enzyme showed a little NADH-NO oxidoreductase activity which was not inhibited by antimycin A. The enzyme lost activity with a half-life of about 2 days at 4 degrees C but could be preserved at -20 degrees C and in liquid nitrogen. It seemed not to be inactivated by aerobic solutions. These observations, and the recent ones by Carr and Ferguson (Carr, G.J., and Ferguson, S.J. (1990) Biochem. J. 269, 423-429) with a partially purified preparation of nitric oxide reductase, establish that the enzyme from Pa. denitrificans is a cytochrome bc complex which resembles that from Pseudomonas stutzeri (Heiss, B., Frunzke, K., and Zumft, W.G. (1989) J. Bacteriol. 171, 3288-3297). There would appear to be no functional relationship between nitric oxide reductase and a Mr = 34,000 peptide of Pa. denitrificans membranes reported previously to be present in purified preparations of a nitric oxide reductase (Hoglen, J., and Hollocher, T.C. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7556-7563)."
https://openalex.org/W1494731431,"Single pituitary gonadotrophs exhibit episodes of spontaneous fluctuations in cytoplasmic calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) due to entry through voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) and show prominent agonist-induced oscillations in [Ca2+]i that are generated by periodic release of intracellular Ca2+. Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) elicited three types of Ca2+ responses: at low doses, subthreshold, with an increase in basal [Ca2+]i; at intermediate doses, oscillatory, with dose-dependent modulation of spiking frequency; and at high doses, biphasic, without oscillations. Elevation of [Ca2+]i or activation of protein kinase C (PKC) did not influence the frequency of agonist-induced [Ca2+]i spikes but caused dose-dependent reductions in amplitude for all types of Ca2+ response. Stimulation of transient Ca2+ spikes by GnRH was followed by inhibition of the spontaneous fluctuations. GnRH also reduced the ability of high extracellular K+ to promote Ca2+ influx through VSCC. Activation of PKC by phorbol esters stimulated Ca2+ influx in quiescent cells but inhibited influx when VSCC were already activated, either spontaneously or by high K+. In contrast to their biphasic actions on [Ca2+]i, phorbol esters exerted only stimulatory actions on gonadotropin release, even when Ca2+ influx was concomitantly reduced. However, pituitary cells had to be primed with an appropriate [Ca2+]i level before exocytosis could be amplified by PKC. In PKC-depleted cells, all actions of phorbol esters on Ca2+ entry and amplitude modulation, and on LH release, were abolished. GnRH-induced LH secretion was also significantly reduced, especially the plateau phase of the response. These data indicate that Ca2+ and PKC serve as interacting signals during the cascade of cellular events triggered by agonist stimulation, in which Ca2+ turns cell responses on or off, and PKC amplifies the positive and negative effects of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1501935523,"Abstract We have studied insulin receptor-mediated signaling in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants that expressed either of two naturally occurring mutant human insulin receptors: Trp1200----Ser1200 and Ala1134----Thr1134. Compared with overexpressed normal human insulin receptors, both mutant receptors displayed normal processing and normal binding affinity; however, neither was capable of detectable insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation or tyrosine kinase activity toward endogenous (pp185) or exogenous substrates. Several biologic actions of insulin were evaluated in transfected cells. Compared with neomycin-only transfected CHO cells (CHO-NEO), cells expressing normal receptors demonstrated increased insulin sensitivity for 2-deoxyglucose uptake, [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen, [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, and specific gene expression (accumulation of glucose transporter GLUT-1 mRNA). Cells expressing either Ser1200 or Thr1134 receptors showed no increase in insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation or GLUT-1 mRNA accumulation compared with CHO-NEO. Surprisingly, cells expressing Ser1200 receptors showed increased insulin stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake and glucose incorporation into glycogen compared with CHO-NEO, whereas Thr1134 receptors failed to signal these metabolic responses. We conclude that 1) transfected kinase-deficient insulin receptor mutants derived from insulin-resistant patients have distinct defects in the ability to mediate insulin action in vitro; 2) divergence of insulin signaling pathways may occur at the level of the receptor; and 3) normal activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase by insulin is not necessarily required for signaling of certain important biologic actions."
https://openalex.org/W1570901130,"The topology of the cytochrome b subunit of the bc1 complex from Rhodobacter sphaeroides has been examined by generating gene fusions with alkaline phosphatase. Gene fusions were generated at random locations within the fbcB gene encoding the cytochrome b subunit. These fusion products were expressed in Escherichia coli and were screened for alkaline phosphatase activity on chromogenic plates. 33 in-frame fusions which showed activity were further characterized. The fusion junctions of all those fusions which had a high specific activity were clustered in three regions of the cytochrome b polypeptide, and thus these regions were tentatively assigned as being near the periplasmic surface. The data are consistent with a model containing eight transmembrane helices. In order to explore the validity of the gene fusion approach for a protein not normally expressed in E. coli, the topology of the L-subunit of the photosynthetic reaction center from R. sphaeroides was also explored using phoA gene fusions. A similar protocol was used as with the cytochrome b subunit. The gene fusions with high specific activity were shown to be in regions of the L-subunit polypeptide known to be at or near the periplasmic surface, as defined by the high resolution structure determined by X-ray crystallography. These data demonstrate the utility of this approach for determining membrane protein topology and extend potential applications to include at least some proteins not normally expressed in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1539438534,"Physiological control of the plasma membrane sodium pump, (Na+,K+)-ATPase, is essential for proper function of eukaryotic cells. In the electric organ of the elasmobranch Narcine brasiliensis, the normal demands placed upon the pump during the process of generation of electrical currents call for large and rapid changes in activity of this enzyme, making this a good model for the study of its cellular regulation. 31P NMR spectroscopic techniques were used to study metabolic regulation of membrane pump function in resting and stimulated electric organ and in skeletal muscle of the live, intact N. brasiliensis. Because the ATP synthetic abilities of the electric organ by glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation are extremely limited, depletion of phosphocreatinine (PCr) could be used to determine the activity of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase after the electric organ was stimulated to discharge, and to measure the net flux from PCr to ATP through the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) reaction in the electric organ. Saturation transfer, an NMR technique which measures exchange rates, was applied to determine the unidirectional flux in the forward direction through the same reaction in the electric organ and in skeletal muscle as a control. The pseudo first-order rate constant kf for the CPK reaction at 24 degrees C in resting electric organ was 0.000 +/- 0.002 s-1 (n = 10) and in skeletal muscle was 0.08 +/- 0.03 s-1 (n = 3). The results demonstrate that in resting electric organ, which is well supplied with CPK, there was no measurable flux through this reaction, although CPK when extracted is highly active. Measured and calculated levels of all substrates for the creatine kinase reaction in the electric organ are similar to those in unstimulated skeletal muscle, where the creatine phosphokinase reaction rates are high in vivo. In contrast to the resting electric organ, during stimulation of the electric organ the measured net rate constant was greater than 0.08 s-1. In addition, as shown by lack of PCr depletion, there was virtually no net turnover of ATP in the resting organ compared to the stimulated organ. The marked difference in the (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity in the resting and activated electric organ confirmed earlier results (Blum, H., Nioka, S., and Johnson, R. G., Jr. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 1247-1251). Together, these results suggest that there is a novel method of coordinate regulation of cellular enzymes of great sensitivity and rapidity."
https://openalex.org/W1566171899,"We have cloned and sequenced the 2175-nucleotide, full-length cDNA for the mouse 46-kDa Man 6-P receptor (46MPR) and studied its functional properties in stably transfected mouse L cells which do not express the insulin-like growth factor-II receptor/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF-IIR/MPR). The 278-amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA for the murine 46MPR shows 19 amino acid differences from that of the human 46MPR, none of which are found in the 68-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. Binding of ligand to the murine 46MPR in permeabilized cells showed a pH optimum of 6.5, was completely inhibited by Man 6-P, and was stimulated by divalent cations. Mn2+ was more effective than Ca2+ or Mg2+. Endocytosis was demonstrated at pH 6.5 and was stimulated 4-7-fold by Mn2+. In its responsiveness to divalent cations and its preference for Mn2+, the murine 46MPR resembled the bovine 46MPR more than the human 46MPR. It was even less efficient than the human receptor in its ability to mediate endocytosis in transfected murine cells. It was also no more efficient than the human 46MPR in correcting the sorting defect of IGF-IIR/MPR-deficient mouse L cells. We conclude that the previously observed relative inefficiency of the human 46MPR in sorting enzymes to lysosomes in murine cells is a property of the 46MPR itself and not a manifestation of studying its expression in a heterologous cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1487925028,"Human LAR is a transmembrane receptor-like protein whose cytoplasmic region contains two tandemly duplicated domains homologous to protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). Whereas the membrane-proximal domain I has enzymatic activity, the membrane-distal domain II has no apparent catalytic activity but seems to have a regulatory function. In order to study structure-function relationships of the LAR PTPase, LAR domain I was expressed in Escherichia coli, and mutants that have reduced catalytic activity or reduced thermostability were isolated and characterized. We isolated 18 unique hydroxylamine-induced missense mutations in the LAR domain I segment, of which three were temperature-sensitive. Five additional temperature-sensitive mutations were isolated using N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. All eight temperature-sensitive mutations are confined within a short segment of the LAR domain I sequence between amino acid positions 1329 and 1407. To examine whether this region is particularly prone to temperature-sensitive mutations, tyrosine at amino acid position 1379 was changed to a phenylalanine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. This mutant, Y1379-F, was indeed temperature-sensitive. We also isolated a revertant of a temperature-sensitive mutant. The revertant contained a second-site mutation (C1446-Y) that suppresses several temperature-sensitive mutations and also enhances the folding of LAR protein produced in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1521863250,"In some G-protein-coupled receptors (e.g. beta-adrenergic receptor (beta 2 AR)), the ligand-binding pocket is contained within the hydrophobic transmembrane domain. In others (e.g. luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR)), the relative roles of the extracellular N-terminal domain and the transmembrane region in hormone binding are unknown. To study the roles of these domains, we prepared vectors encoding the rat LHR N-terminal domain alone (L- -), the LHR N-terminal domain fused to the transmembrane and C-terminal domains of the vesicular stomatitis virus-G protein (LVV), the LHR N-terminal domain fused to the transmembrane and C-terminal domains of the hamster beta 2 AR (LAA), and the beta 2 AR N-terminal domain fused to the transmembrane and C-terminal domains of the rat LHR (ALL). Membrane preparations obtained from COS-7 cells expressing the beta 2 AR or LAA bound the beta-adrenergic antagonist 125I-cyanopindolol with equal affinity, confirming the observation that the beta 2 AR transmembrane domain forms the hormone-binding site. Membranes from COS-7 cells transfected with LHR bound 125I-human choriomic gonadotropin (hCG). However, membranes from LAA-, L(- -)-, and LVV-transfected cells had low capacity to bind 125I-hCG unless they were solubilized with Triton X-100. The affinity of the detergent-solubilized receptors for 125I-hCG was similar to that of the LHR. We were unable to detect binding of 125I-hCG to ALL in the presence or absence of detergent. These observations suggest that, whereas the transmembrane region of the beta 2 AR is sufficient to bind adrenergic ligands, the N-terminal region of the LHR is required for binding of hCG. Although the N terminus of the LHR is sufficient to bind hCG, both the N terminus and the transmembrane domains of the LHR are required for receptor expression on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1530346494,"The Calvin Cycle enzyme phosphoribulokinase is activated in higher plants by the reversible reduction of a disulfide bond, which is located at the active site. To determine the possible contribution of the two regulatory residues (Cys16 and Cys55) to catalysis, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to replace each of them in the spinach enzyme with serine or alanine. The only other cysteinyl residues of the kinase, Cys244 and Cys250, were also replaced individually by serine or alanine. A comparison of specific activities of native and mutant enzymes reveals that substitutions at positions 244 or 250 are inconsequential. The position 16 mutants retain 45-90% of the wild-type activity and display normal Km values for both ATP and ribulose 5-phosphate. In contrast, substitution at position 55 results in 85-95% loss of wild-type activity, with less than a 2-fold increase in the Km for ATP and a 4-8-fold increase in the Km for ribulose 5-phosphate. These results are consistent with moderate facilitation of catalysis by Cys55 and demonstrate that the other three cysteinyl residues do not contribute significantly either to structure or catalysis. The enhanced stability, relative to wild-type enzyme, of the Ser16 mutant protein to a sulfhydryl reagent supports earlier suggestions that Cys16 is the initial target of the oxidative deactivation process."
https://openalex.org/W1568560878,"Treatment of murine peritoneal macrophages with 100 nM prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) produced a rapid biphasic increase in intracellular cAMP that was maximal at 1 min and sustained through 20 min. Pretreatment of macrophages with 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 60 min prior to PGE2 decreased the magnitude of cAMP elevation by 50%, accelerated the decrease of cAMP to basal levels, and abolished the sustained phase of cAMP elevation. The effect of LPS was concentration-dependent, with maximal effect at 10 ng/ml in cells incubated in the presence of 5% fetal calf serum and at 1 microgram/ml in the absence of fetal calf serum. LPS also inhibited cAMP accumulation in cells treated with 100 microM forskolin, but the decrease was about half that seen in cells treated with PGE2. LPS concentrations that inhibited cAMP accumulation produced a 30% increase in soluble low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase activity while having no effect on particulate phosphodiesterase activity. The nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, as well as the more specific inhibitors rolipram and Ro-20-1724 were effective in inhibiting soluble phosphodiesterase activity in vitro, producing synergistic elevation of cAMP in PGE2-treated cells, and blocking the ability of LPS to inhibit accumulation of cAMP. Separation of the phosphodiesterase isoforms in the soluble fraction by DEAE chromatography indicated that LPS activated a low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase. The enzyme(s) present in this peak could be activated 6-fold by cGMP and were potently inhibited by low micromolar concentrations of Ro-20-1724 and rolipram. Using both membranes from LPS-treated cells and membranes incubated with LPS, no decrease in adenylylcyclase activity could be attributed to LPS. Although effects of LPS on the rate of synthesis of cAMP cannot be excluded, the present evidence is most consistent with a role for phosphodiesterase activation in the inhibitory effects of LPS on cAMP accumulation in murine peritoneal macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1585001807,"Abstract Based on competition analysis of gel shift assays utilizing nuclear extracts from the mouse adrenal Y1 cell line, the cAMP-responsive element of the human CYP21B gene (-129/-96 base pairs (bp] is found to contain two overlapping nuclear protein binding elements. One, -126/-113 bp, interacts specifically with an adrenal-specific protein factor (ASP) while the other, -119/-110 bp, contains a GC boxlike sequence and binds Sp1. The nucleotide replacements (GG----CC at -113 and -112 bp) introduced within the sequence -129/-96 bp greatly decreased the binding affinities of both Sp1 and ASP to the fragment and resulted in a loss of cAMP-enhanced transcription of a reporter gene in transient transfection experiments. When the 14-bp ASP-binding sequence was inserted in front of the reporter gene, induced transcription by cAMP was observed that could be increased by multimerization of this -126/-113-bp sequence. The -126/-113-bp fragment revealed specific binding only with nuclear extracts from adrenal Y1 cells among various types of cells tested, indicating that the protein factor ASP is specifically expressed in adrenal cells. The nucleotide replacement (G----C at -117 bp) of the -126 -113-bp sequence not only abolishes the binding to ASP but also the cAMP-dependent transcription, strongly supporting the hypothesis that ASP is a tissue-specific transacting protein that directly functions as a transcription factor essential to the cAMP-dependent transcription. Furthermore, the -129/-115-bp sequence of the bovine cytochrome P450C21 gene corresponding to the human -126/-113-bp sequence is demonstrated to be functionally conserved with respect to both cAMP-dependent enhancement of transcription and ASP binding."
https://openalex.org/W1482051045,"Acylphosphatase, purified from human erythrocytes, actively hydrolyzes the acylphosphorylated intermediate of human red blood cell membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase. This effect occurred with acylphosphatase amounts (up to 10 units/mg membrane protein) that fall within the physiological range. Furthermore, a very low Km value, 3.41 +/- 1.16 (S.E.) nM, suggests a high affinity in acylphosphatase for the phosphoenzyme intermediate, which is consistent with the small number of Ca(2+)-ATPase units in human erythrocyte membrane. Acylphosphatase addition to red cell membranes resulted in a significant increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Maximal stimulation (about 2-fold over basal) was obtained at 2 units/mg membrane protein, with a concomitant decrease in apparent Km values for both Ca2+ and ATP. Conversely, similar amounts of acylphosphatase significantly decreased (by about 30%) the rate of Ca2+ transport into inside-out red cell membrane vesicles, albeit that reduced apparent Km values for Ca2+ and ATP were also observed in this case. A stoichiometry of 2.04 Ca2+/ATP hydrolyzed was calculated in the absence of acylphosphatase; in the presence of acylphosphatase optimal concentration, this ratio was reduced to 0.9. Acylphosphatase activity, rather than just protein, was essential for all the above effects. Taken together these findings suggest that, because of its hydrolytic activity on the phosphoenzyme intermediate, acylphosphatase reduces the efficiency of the erythrocyte membrane Ca2+ pump. A possible mechanism for this effect is that the phosphoenzyme is hydrolyzed before its transport work can be accomplished."
https://openalex.org/W1573485994,"A neuronal Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase-Gr) undergoes autophosphorylation on a serine residue(s) in response to Ca2+ and calmodulin. Phosphate incorporation leads to the formation of a Ca(2+)-independent (autonomous) activity state, as well as potentiation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent response. The autonomous enzyme activity of the phosphorylated enzyme approximately equals the Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated activity of the unphosphorylated enzyme, but displays diminished affinity toward ATP and the synthetic substrate, syntide-2. The Km(app) for ATP and syntide-2 increased 4.3- and 1.7-fold, respectively. Further activation of the autonomous enzyme by Ca2+/calmodulin yields a marked increase in the affinity for ATP and peptide substrate such that the Km(app) for ATP and syntide-2 decreased by 14- and 8-fold, respectively. Both autophosphorylation and the addition of Ca2+/calmodulin are required to produce the maximum level of enzyme activation and to increase substrate affinity. Unlike Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II that is dephosphorylated by the Mg(2+)-independent phosphoprotein phosphatases 1 and 2A, CaM kinase-Gr is dephosphorylated by a Mg(2+)-dependent phosphoprotein phosphatase that may be related to the type 2C enzyme. Dephosphorylation of CaM kinase-Gr reverses the effects of autophosphorylation on enzyme activity. A comparison between the autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions of CaM kinase-Gr and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II provides useful insights into the operation of Ca(2+)-sensitive molecular switches."
https://openalex.org/W1556961396,"Exposure of Clone 9 cells, a nontransformed rat liver cell line, to 10(-8) M dexamethasone resulted at 3 h in 1.8 +/- 0.2- and 40 +/- 5-fold increases in mRNA alpha 1 and mRNA beta 1 content, respectively, an effect that was not mimicked by 10(-8) M aldosterone. The increments in mRNA alpha 1 and mRNA beta 1 abundances in total cell RNA were half-maximal at 5 x 10(-9) M dexamethasone and persisted for more than 24 h. Na,K-ATPase activity, however, increased only slightly (by 9%) at 24 h. The induction of mRNA beta 1 by dexamethasone was not prevented by the presence of cycloheximide. mRNA beta 1 abundance increased earlier in the nuclear RNA pool (becoming apparent within 45 min) than in the cytoplasmic RNA pool, consistent with a precursor-product relationship. Moreover, putative pre-mRNA beta 1 bands of approximately 4,600 and approximately 12,000 nucleotides accumulated in the nRNA pool after 1 h of exposure to dexamethasone. Incubation in the presence of dexamethasone for 3 h enhanced the incorporation of [3H]uridine into total cell mRNA alpha 1 and mRNA beta 1 by 1.3- and 12-fold, respectively. In nuclear run-on assays, however, transcription of mRNA alpha 1 and mRNA beta 1 was not altered after 30 min of exposure to 10(-8) M dexamethasone. The abundance of mRNA beta 1 in rat liver also increased markedly (greater than 30-fold) in rats treated with the hormone for 6 h. We conclude that dexamethasone causes an induction of Na,K-ATPase subunit mRNAs, an effect that is markedly greater for mRNA beta 1 than for mRNA alpha 1. The increases in subunit mRNA content, however, are associated with, at most, a small increase in Na,K-ATPase activity, suggesting that the increments in mRNA abundances, especially that of mRNA beta 1, do not play a determining role in the regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1503964763,The primary amino acid sequence of the major herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-infected cell polypeptide 8 (ICP8) deduced from the DNA sequence of the unique long open reading frame 29 (UL29 ORF) contains a potential metal-binding domain of the form Cys-X2-5-Cys-X2-15-A-X2-4-A where A may be either histidine or cysteine and X is any amino acid. The putative metal-binding sequence in ICP8 encompasses residues 499-512 as follows: C-N-L-C-T-F-D-T-R-H-A-C-V-H-. Atomic absorption analysis of several preparations of ICP8 indicates the presence of 1 mol of zinc/mol of protein. The zinc is resistant to removal by dialysis against concentrations of EDTA which deplete zinc from alcohol dehydrogenase. The bound zinc can be removed by reaction with the reversible sulfhydryl reagent p-hydroxymercurimethylsulfonate and the zinc-depleted protein transiently retains DNA binding activity. Digestion of both native and zinc-depleted ICP8 with V8 protease indicates that the bound zinc is required for the structural integrity of the protein.
https://openalex.org/W1559251346,"The effect of sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) on dolichol biosynthesis by rat liver microsomes was investigated. cis-Prenyltransferase activity was stimulated 7-fold in the presence of 5 micrograms of purified SCP-2/mg of microsomal protein, which was similar to the increase obtained by adding detergent. The polyisoprenoid pattern obtained in the presence of SCP-2 was the same as that present in rat liver, in contrast to the pattern appearing upon incubation of microsomes with detergent, which gave shorter polyisoprenoids. Like SCP-2, the cytosolic fraction from rat liver also stimulated cis-prenyltransferase. Incubation with cytosol pretreated with anti-SCP-2 showed no stimulatory effect and led to the accumulation of shorter polyisoprenoids. SCP-2 had no appreciable effect on polyprenol alpha-saturase, dolichol kinase, dolichyl phosphate phosphatase, or acyl-CoA:dolichol acyltransferase. The results demonstrate that SCP-2 greatly stimulates and may regulate the condensation reactions mediated by cis-prenyltransferase in the process of dolichol biosynthesis and permits polymerization of the polyisoprenoid to its natural chain length."
https://openalex.org/W1510419597,"Three biologically active isoforms of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) exist: PDGF-AB, the predominant form in human platelets; PDGF-BB, the product of the c-sis protooncogene; and PDGF-AA. PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB interact with two distinct PDGF receptors (termed alpha and beta) of similar size, whereas PDGF-AA binds alpha receptors only. To dissect alpha and beta receptor-mediated signals, we compared the biological activities of PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB in density-arrested BALB/c-3T3 cells, which possess a 4:1 ratio of beta to alpha receptors, and assessed the contribution of alpha receptors to PDGF-BB- and PDGF-AB-induced responses. In addition, we describe a convenient method for resolving alpha and beta receptors on one-dimensional protein gels. This protocol involves treatment of cells with neuraminidase, a desialylating agent, and subsequent in vitro autophosphorylation of solubilized cells, and was used to monitor the presence or absence of alpha and beta receptors under various experimental conditions. Our data show that although higher concentrations were required, PDGF-AA stimulated DNA synthesis to the same extent as did PDGF-BB. Both isoforms induced inositol phosphate formation, epidermal growth factor transmodulation, and PDGF receptor autophosphorylation; PDGF-AA, however, was less effective than was PDGF-BB even at doses causing maximal mitogenesis. Pretreatment of cells with PDGF-AA for 30-60 min at 37 degrees C effectively down-regulated alpha receptors as verified by the absence of desialylated alpha receptor phosphorylation. Depletion of alpha receptors did not affect the capacity of PDGF-BB or PDGF-AB to activate the beta receptor tyrosine kinase, as assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation of an endogenous substrate, or stimulate the formation of inositol phosphates. We suggest that alpha and beta receptors independently mediate similar biological responses in BALB/c-3T3 cells, and that alpha receptors are not required for responses induced by PDGF-BB or PDGF-AB."
https://openalex.org/W1565718719,"Strong, albeit indirect, evidence suggests that a GTP-binding (G) protein(s) can act directly on the secretory machinery by a post-second messenger mechanism. The type and function of this putative Ge (exocytosis) protein were investigated in streptolysin-O-permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. The exocytotic response to calcium was first characterized both morphologically and biochemically using the release of preloaded [3H]serotonin as an index of exocytosis. Calcium-induced secretion (EC50 about 3 microM) in RBL cells requires ATP (EC50 about 2.5 mM) and is modulated by pH, the optimal value being 7.2. Another requirement for calcium-induced secretion is an activated G protein, since inactivators of G proteins such as GDP beta S (EC50 about 800 microM) inhibit the secretagogue effect of 10 microM free calcium. Conversely, GTP gamma S (EC50 about 1 microM) and other nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP, which keep G proteins in a permanently active conformation, potentiate the effect of calcium. GTP gamma S alone is without effect. The effect of GTP gamma S on exocytosis is apparently not mediated by known second messengers, suggesting that a Ge protein is involved. Electron microscopic images show that in resting cells, secretory granules are clustered in the perinuclear area, whereas they become scattered upon calcium stimulation. A paradoxical effect of GTP gamma S is observed when applied during permeabilization; under these conditions, in fact, the nucleotide inhibits the subsequent secretory response to calcium. The scattering of granules is also inhibited. This effect of GTP gamma S is counteracted by coadministration of GTP. These responses to guanine nucleotides are typical of vectorially acting G proteins involved in protein synthesis and in intracellular vesicle transport. Taken together, the data presented suggest that calcium-dependent release requires a vectorially acting G protein controlling the movement of secretory granules. This and alternative models are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1561398154,Phosphorylation of the RAF-1 protooncogene product and activation of its associated serine/threonine kinase are common features of the response of cells to peptide growth factors. We have used wild-type and mutant epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors to investigate mechanisms of RAF-1 phosphorylation. In vivo EGF treatment rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of RAF-1 exclusively on serine residues. Stimulation of RAF-1 phosphorylation occurred at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C and persisted after dissociation of EGF from its receptor. EGF-induced RAF-1 serine phosphorylation required the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor but was independent of EGF receptor self-phosphorylation and of ligand-induced receptor internalization. Down-regulation of protein kinase C did not affect the EGF-induced increase in RAF-1 phosphorylation. These data suggest that the activated tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor enhances serine phosphorylation of RAF-1 via an intermediary molecule(s).
https://openalex.org/W1507714029,"The alpha 1-subunit of the voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channel has distinct, allosterically coupled binding domains for drugs from different chemical classes (dihydropyridines, benzothiazepines, phenylalkylamines, diphenylbutylpiperidines). (-)-BM 20.1140 (ethyl-2,2-di-phenyl-4-(1-pyrrolidino)-5-(2-picolyl)- oxyvalerate) is a novel Ca2+ channel blocker which potently stimulates dihydropyridine binding (K0.5 = 2.98 nM) to brain membranes. This property is shared by (+)-cis-diltiazem, (+)-tetrandrine, fostedil and trans-diclofurime, but (-)-BM 20.1140 does not bind in a competitive manner to the sites labeled by (+)-cis-[3H]diltiazem. (+)-cis-Diltiazem and (-)-BM 20.1140 have differential effects on the rate constants of dihydropyridine binding. (+)-BM 20.1140 reverses the stimulation of the positive allosteric regulators (pA2 value for reversal of (-)-BM 20.1140 stimulation = 7.4, slope 0.72). The underlying molecular mechanism of the potentiation of dihydropyridine binding has been clarified. The K0.5 for free Ca2+ to stabilize a high affinity binding domain for dihydropyridines on purified L-type channels from rabbit skeletal muscle is 300 nM. (+)-Tetrandine (10 microM) increases the affinity 8-fold (K0.5 for free Ca2+ = 30.1 nM) and (+)-BM 20.114 (10 microM) inhibits the affinity increase (K0.5 for free Ca2+ = 251 nM). Similar results were obtained with membrane-bound Ca(2+)-channels from brain tissue which have higher affinity for free Ca2+ (K0.5 for free Ca2+ = 132 nM) and for dihydropyridines compared with skeletal muscle. It is postulated that the dihydropyridine and Ca(2+)-binding sites are interdependent on the alpha 1-subunit, that the different positive heterotropic allosteric regulators (by their differential effects on Ca2+ rate constants) optimize coordination for Ca2+ in the channel pore and, in turn, increase affinity for the dihydropyridines."
https://openalex.org/W1597983404,"An in vitro transcription system has been developed to study the transcriptional control of steroid hydroxylase gene expression in steroidogenic tissues using upstream sequences of these genes in rabbit beta-globin promoter/reporter constructs. Analysis of deletion mutants of the upstream region of the bovine CYP17 (p45017 alpha) gene in whole cell extracts prepared from mouse Y1 adrenocortical cells revealed that sequences activating transcription in vitro are identical to those previously identified in vivo, namely the novel cAMP-responsive sequences crsI (-243 to -225 base pairs) and crsII (-80 to -40 base pairs). These sequences do not contain the known cAMP response elements, CRE or AP-2. In similar extracts from nonsteroidogenic mouse SVT2 cells, crsI was unable to activate transcription. Partially purified protein factor(s) binding to crsI were prepared from Y1 extracts by crsI-specific DNA affinity chromatography. This fraction activated transcription in vitro in SVT2 extracts only when crsI was present in the template. This in vitro transcription system will permit further investigation of crsI and its cognate factors and of the transcriptional regulation of the other steroid hydroxylase genes."
https://openalex.org/W1532615936,"During the process of enhancing monocytic differentiation of the human leukemia line HL-60, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) also primes the cell for respiratory burst by increasing the uptake of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane (Hruska, K.A., Bar-Shavit, Z., Malone, J.D., and Teitelbaum, S.L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16039-16044). The present study asked if the maturational effect of vitamin D is dependent upon this priming phenomenon. To this end, we exposed HL-60 to either 1,25(OH)2D3 or its synthetic analogue (1 alpha, 3 beta, 5Z, 7E)-9-10-Secocholesta-5,7,10(19)-triene-1, 3, 25-triol (22-oxa). We found that 22-oxa induced HL-60 maturation as effectively as does the natural steroid. As expected, 48 h of 1,25(OH)2D3 exposure more than doubles (p less than 0.005) HL-60 basal cytosolic Ca2+ and increases inositol triphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores approximately 4-fold (p less than 0.01). 22-oxa in contrast alters neither Ca(2+)- nor inositol triphosphate-mobilizable deposits. Moreover, 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment prompts a transient Ca2+ in response to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and a marked increase in superoxide (O-2) generation when exposed to the chemotactic peptide (p less than 0.01) or phorbol ester (p less than 0.02). Treatment with 22-oxa does not enable HL-60 to respond to fMLP with a Ca2+ spike or prime the cell for respiratory burst unless it is co-incubated with the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin. Similarly, phorbol ester impacts more profoundly on O-2 generation by 1,25(OH)2D3 than 22-oxa preincubated cells (p less than 0.02), unless the latter is added with ionomycin. Our findings indicate that the maturational effects of vitamin D sterols are independent of their capacity to prime cells for respiratory burst and that the Ca2+ ionophoretic effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 play a major role in such priming."
https://openalex.org/W1560277497,"The bovine gene encoding the type C atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor was isolated and characterized. The gene appears to exist as a single copy in the haploid genome and is comprised of eight exons distributed over more than 85 kilobases. The transcription start site was identified by primer extension and ribonuclease protection assay. A TATA box-like sequence was found just upstream of the start site (at position -32); however, no CAAT box was apparent. Exon boundaries of the ANP receptor gene correlated well with the functional domain boundaries of the receptor protein; for example, exon 1 contains coding information for a large proportion of the ANP-binding domain and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are encoded by separate exons, namely by exon 7 and exon 8, respectively. These structural features suggest that the organization of the ANP receptor gene reflects the domain structure of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W44310695,"Peptide YY (PYY) receptors were solubilized from rat jejunal crypts using 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS). The binding of [125I-Tyr36]monoiodo-PYY ([125I]PYY) to CHAPS extracts was time-dependent and reversible. The order of potency of PYY-related peptides for inhibiting [125I]PYY binding was PYY greater than neuropeptide Y much greater than pancreatic polypeptide. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data indicated the presence in soluble extracts of a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 1.02 +/- 0.26 nM and a Bmax of 79 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein. Gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 and ultracentrifugation on sucrose density gradients of soluble [125I] PYY-receptor complexes revealed a single binding component with the following hydrodynamic parameters: Stokes radius, 4.43 nm; s20,w, 2.48 S; Mr, 48,000; frictional ratio, 1.82. Solubilized PYY receptors bound specifically to concanavalin A-, wheat germ agglutinin-, and soybean-coupled Sepharose, supporting their glycoproteic nature. After cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate, electrophoresis of covalent [125I]PYY-receptor complexes in membranes or CHAPS extracts revealed the presence of two bands of Mr 49,000 or 28,000 whose labeling was completely abolished by 1 microM unlabeled PYY. The Mr 49,000 band probably corresponded to the Mr 48,000 PYY-receptor complex evidenced by hydrodynamic studies. Assuming one molecule of [125I]PYY (Mr 4,000) was bound per molecule of receptor, these data show that intestinal PYY receptor consists of a Mr 44,000 glycoprotein after solubilization with CHAPS. The availability of this CHAPS-soluble receptor from rat jejunum represents a major step toward the purification of this newly characterized receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1598512662,"To investigate the biological role of variants of human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), an extended form designated IGF-IIE21, with a molecular mass of 9.8 kDa, was produced in Escherichia coli as a stable and soluble secreted fusion protein. After site-specific cleavage of the affinity purified fusion protein, followed by purification using ion exchange and reversed phase chromatography, it could be demonstrated that IGF-IIE21 and IGF-II have similar or identical activities according to radioimmunoassay and radioreceptor assay. However, IGF-IIE21 showed only 1% growth promotion activity as compared with IGF-II in a clonal expansion assay using human K562 cells which lacks IGF-I receptors. These results suggest that this extended variant of IGF-II can bind to the receptor but has limited growth promoting activity."
https://openalex.org/W1515375183,"Two phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases C (PI-PLC) have been purified from human spleen. PI-PLCm represents the main activity detected in the membrane, while PI-PLCc is the main activity present in the cytoplasm. PI-PLCm can be resolved into two peaks of activity of high Mr (60,000-70,000) and low Mr (16,000-18,000). High salt concentration ((NH4)2SO4, 2M) dissociates the high Mr form yielding the low molecular form and increasing the specific activity. The same effect of dissociation and potentiation of the activity is observed when membranes solubilized by n-octyl glucoside are subjected to the high voltage conditions of an isoelectric focusing run. The purified Pi-PLCm has a Mr of about 18,000 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or gel filtration and a basic pI (9.0-9.2). Purified PI-PLCc has a Mr of 57,000 (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or gel filtration) and a slightly acid pI (6.2). Other characteristics of both enzymes, such as cations dependence, substrate specificity, optimum pH, and kinetic parameters, are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1584765360,"We sought to assess the effect of an increase in cAMP on sodium channels on adult rat cardiac ventricular myocytes. Sodium channels were studied with the use of the radiolabeled sodium channel-specific toxin [3H] batrachotoxinin benzoate ([3H]BTXB). Forskolin, isoproterenol, prostaglandin E1, cholera toxin, and pertussis toxin each increased cAMP levels and decreased the number of [3H]BTXB binding sites without changing the affinity of [3H]BTXB for the sodium channel. The cAMP analog 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP) reduced the number of [3H]BTXB binding sites from 19 fmol/10(5) cells to 11 fmol/10(5) cells. [3H]BTXB binding site down-regulation was reversible, cAMP dose-dependent, and time-dependent. To test the hypothesis that the cAMP effect was mediated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, we determined the effect of 8-Br-cAMP on [3H]BTXB binding after preincubation of myocytes with N-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride (H8), a protein kinase A inhibitor. H8 inhibited 70% of the decrease in the number of [3H]BTXB binding sites induced by 8-Br-cAMP. Thus increases in intracellular cAMP in cardiac myocytes reversibly induced a decrease in the number of [3H]BTXB binding sites via cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation, possibly of the sodium channel."
