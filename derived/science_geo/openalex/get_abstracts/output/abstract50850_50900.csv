https://openalex.org/W1491533120,"Two Rauscher murine leukemia virus polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 69,000 and 71,000 have been purified and characterized. These polypeptides contained a previously undescribed interspecies antigenic determinant of mammalian oncogenic C type RNA viruses (interspec II), as was demonstrated by the reaction of the murine antigen with anti-feline leukemia virus serum. Radioimmunoassay analysis showed that both polypeptides were precipitated by the anti-feline virus serum, indicating that they each contained the interspecies determinant or that they were closely associated and coprecipitated. The interspec II antigen was distinguished from the known gs-3 interspecies antigen (interspec I) and the virus RNA-dependent DNA polymerase by protein purification, physical properties, and immunological analysis. The new antigen was not detected by competition radioimmunoassay in uninfected mouse cells or mouse cells productively infected with vesicular stomatitis virus."
https://openalex.org/W2025929378,Rats of the inbred strains Lewis and DA are highly susceptible to the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) while Brown Norway rats are resistant to this disease. Evidence has been obtained which suggests that a single dominant gene is associated with susceptibility to EAE. The locus controlling EAE susceptibility is closely linked to the Ag-B histocompatibility locus but is not identical to it.

Studies of isotopic composition indicate that lead pollutants in coastal sediments are derived mainly from the combustion of lead additives in gasoline."
https://openalex.org/W2026514455,"Factor VIII corrects both the clotting defect in hemophilia A and an abnormality of platelet aggregation in von Willebrand's disease. These two activities of factor VIII (antihemophilic factor and von Willebrand factor) are both detected in the void volume when human plasma or cryoprecipitate is chromatographed on Bio-Gel 5M under conditions of isotonic salt concentration. In contrast, antihemophilic factor procoagulant activity is detected with proteins of lower molecular weight when the chromatography is performed with a buffer containing 0.8M NaCl. In this way, the two activities of factor VIII can be dissociated. It remains to be determined whether these components are separate molecules associated as a complex of high molecular weight in plasma or whether they are subunits of a complex macromolecule."

https://openalex.org/W1999238822,"The models we have discussed in detail demonstrate specific suppression of immune reactivity produced in normal adult animals by antibody and antigen. The mechanism of homeostasis of suppression in these models depends on continued exposure to antigen and on an active response by the host. The active response may include production of antibody directed against specific receptors as well as antibody directed against antigen. Thus, specific regulation of both antibody and cell mediated immunity to an antigen might be achieved by the use of only the biological agents of the response: antigen, antibody, and possibly antibody to receptors. The general implication is that these same biological agents are responsible for autoregulation of immune reactions occurring in nature. Presumably, these agents may be used to suppress or reverse immune responses for appropriate clinical objectives."
https://openalex.org/W1500065361,"Abstract In an effort to determine the essential structural features of human fibrinogen, plasmic hydrolysis was carried out and degradation products were identified and analyzed. In agreement with previous work, the initial attack was shown to occur in the Aα chains with the release of portions of their COOH-terminal regions (designated /α chains in the terminology developed to describe the present findings), whereas simultaneous, but slower, degradation occurs in the NH2-terminal region of the Bβ/ chains) and results in the removal of remnants (designated Bβ/ chains) containing peptide B. These changes, plus internal cleavages leading eventually to the separation of Fragments D and E (terminology of Nussenzweig et al.), produce a series of high molecular weight derivatives which can be separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of unreduced samples in sodium dodecyl sulfate. (These were designated Bands II through VII in order of decreasing molecular size; Band VII was identified as Fragment X in the terminology of Marder et al.) Upon further hydrolysis derivative Band VII can lose the COOH-terminal portion of one of its Bβ chains (as remnant /β6, molecular weight 32,000) to form derivative Band VIII (Fragment Y in the terminology of Marder et al.) or, alternatively, can undergo cleavage to yield early forms of Fragments D and E (designated D1 and E1, respectively). Derivative Band VIII, in turn, is degraded to Fragment E1 plus a later form of Fragment D. Once cleaved from the parent molecule, these Fragments D continue to release /β chains. These degradative pathways lead to a series of Fragments D (D1 through D5) which differ in molecular weight. Additional cleavages occur in Fragment E1 to form a smaller fragment (E2) which, unlike E1, lacks peptide A. Immunochemical studies of derivatives obtained at successive phases of digestion demonstrated the presence of at least five antigenic determinants on the fibrinogen molecule. One of these is located on /α chains; another, on Fragment E; three others, on Fragment D. Of the latter, one is associated with /β6 chains; a second (designated F) is associated with Fragments F, which arise by further degradation of Fragments D; the third (designated D) is that lost when Fragment F is evolved. Electrophoretic behavior of plasmic derivatives before and after reduction revealed at least one intrachain disulfide bridge in each /α15 and /β6 chain. Studies of Fragment D subunit composition and recovery at various phases of digestion indicated that it is a dimeric structure containing substantial portions of the COOH-terminal region of both γ chains (as /γ1 remnant chains, each having a molecular weight of 42,000) and hence that only one such fragment (linked by at least five interchain disulfide bridges) can be generated by each fibrinogen molecule. These results, plus those reported by others, led to the conclusion that fibrinogen itself has a dimeric structure, the backbone of which consists of a pair of γ chains linked directly to each other by disulfide bridging in the NH2-terminal region and covalently linked (enter directly or indirectly) with the Aα and Bβ chains in at least two regions of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1537582264,"Abstract Preparations of mitochondrial ATPase from rat liver mitochondria contain five classes of polypeptide chains. Consistent with previous results, the three major classes of polypeptide chains, designated subunits A, B, and C, have apparent molecular weights of 62,500, 57,000, and 36,000, respectively, as determined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. These subunits have been isolated in purified form. They comprise approximately 97% of the mass of the enzyme preparation and are present in the enzyme complex in the stoichiometry A3B3C. The two minor classes of polypeptide chains have molecular weights of 12,500 and approximately 7,500 as determined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. They appear to comprise less than 3% of the mass of the enzyme preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1490463836,"Abstract The binding of porphyrins by two serum proteins, hemopexin and albumin, has been compared using a fluorescence method in order to clarify the biological roles of the proteins in the disposal of these pigments. The affinity of hemopexin for metalloporphyrins increases in the order: nickel-deuteroporphyrin IX l cobalt-deuteroporphyrin IX l iron-deuteroporphyrin IX (deuteroheme) ≃ iron-protoporphyrin IX (heme); and the binding of nickel-deuteroporphyrin IX is approximately equal to that of deuteroporphyrin IX and protoporphyrin IX. The data are consistent with a single binding site on the hemopexin molecule for all porphyrins except cobalt-deuteroporphyrin. The titration behavior of 0.5 µm and 1 µm hemopexin indicates that the dissociation constant (Kd) for the interaction with deuteroheme ≤ 10-8 m. The results of both dialysis equilibrium and fluorescence quenching experiments demonstrate that the Kd for the binding of deuteroporphyrin IX by hemopexin is 1 to 2 µm. Like hemopexin, albumin binds deuteroheme more strongly than protoporphyrin. The avidity of hemopexin for deuteroheme, an analogue whose structure is closely related to heme, is at least 60-fold higher than that of albumin. The affinity of both proteins for protoporphyrin is similar and characterized by a Kd ∼2 µm. Hemopexin can be implicated definitely in the metabolism of heme and possibly also in that of its precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1567007453,"Abstract Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II has been partially purified. Its properties have been found to differ from those of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (EC 2.3.1.23) in the following ways. (a) Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II catalyzes the reaction only in the direction towards long chain fatty acyl-CoA formation. (b) Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II requires preincubation with CoA-SH for manifestation of catalytic activity. (c) Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II shows greater chain-length substrate specificity for the transfer of long chain fatty acyl groups from (-)-acylcarnitine derivatives to CoA-SH, with greatest activity being obtained in the transfer of stearoyl and palmitoyl groups. (d) Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II activity is inhibited by shorter chain-length fatty acylcarnitine derivatives. The apparent molecular weight of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II, the same as that of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, is 150,000. Antibodies were prepared from the serum of each of three rabbits injected with apparently homogeneous preparations of purified carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. Sera obtained from all rabbits inhibited the activity of carnitine palmitoyl-transferase I. However, serum obtained from one rabbit unexpectedly inhibited the activity of carnitine palmitoyl-transferase II. The data were discussed in relation to the possibility that carnitine palmitoyltransferase II is a transformed product of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, since carnitine palmitoyltransferase II could be obtained from carnitine palmitoyltransferase I by treatment with urea or guanidine under certain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2071578493,"The herbicides atrazine, simazine, monuron, and 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) enhanced the toxicity of selected insecticides to Drosophila melanogaster Meigen, Musca domestica L., and larvae of Aedes aegypti L. The insecticides-nine organophosphorus compounds, two chlorinated hydrocarbons, and one carbamate-were used at dosages that resulted in low insect mortalities, while the herbicides by themselves were nontoxic. Atrazine was most effective. With increasing amounts of this herbicide and constant amounts of some insecticides, increasing mortalities of fruit flies were observed. Exposure of the insects for 24 hours to carbofuran (0.5 microgram), p,p'-DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane] (4 micrograms), parathion (0.35 microgram), and diazinon (0.2 microgram) alone resulted in mortalities of 7.5, 9.5, 8, and 10.5 percent, respectively. Based on dosage mortality curves obtained with increasing amounts of atrazine, mortalities of 50 percent of the insect populations would have been achieved with 23, 40, 6, and 10 micrograms of atrazine added to the abovementioned dosages of carbofuran, DDT, parathion, and diazinon, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1496584831,"Abstract We have detected and localized in situ lymphocyte proteins with antigenic determinants similar to those of the cortisol-binding globulin of human plasma. All lymphocyte fractions, obtained by differential centrifugation and ammonium sulfate fractionations exhibited cortisol-binding capacities and were recognized by transcortin-specific antibody. Inasmuch as the 40 to 65% ammonium sulfate fraction of the 105,000 x g lymphocyte cytosol accounted for over 90% of the total binding capacity of the cell, this fraction was further purified by the procedure employed for the purification of plasma transcortin. These procedures yielded a protein with about 20% the cortisol-binding capacity of transcortin, migrated more rapidly than transcortin in disc acrylamide electrophoretic systems, and formed a line of identity with transcortin when treated with transcortin-specific antibody. Fluorescein-labeled transcortin antibody applied to sectioned lymphocytes showed almost exclusive cytoplasmic localization of transcortin-like protein. These results show for the first time the existence of cortisol-binding proteins within the human lymphocyte antigenically identical with transcortin."

https://openalex.org/W1518690772,"Abstract An NH2-terminal fragment produced by thrombin digestion of purified normal and of dicoumarol-induced prothrombin was isolated and characterized. These fragments which were found to have a molecular weight of approximately 27,000 had an identical amino acid and carbohydrate composition. The fragment from normal prothrombin binds Ca2+ while the corresponding fragment from the dicoumarol-induced prothrombin does not. Furthermore the fragment from normal prothrombin had Ca2+-dependent antigenic determinants but not the fragment from the dicoumarol-induced prothrombin. In addition a large COOH-terminal fragment was produced by thrombin digestion, which had identical electrophoretic and immunochemical properties from both prothrombins. In peptide maps prepared from thermolysin digests of the NH2-terminal fragments, untreated as well as reduced and aminoethylated, clear-cut differences were observed. These differences presumably reflect a postribosomal vitamin K-dependent modification of the normal prothrombin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1593520090,"Abstract Four Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan mutants have been analyzed to assess the effect of the mutations on the properties of the cells and to determine the complementation patterns. The mutants were defective in the formation of an α-1→3-mannosyltransferase (mnn1), two different α-1→2-mannosyltransferases (mnn2 and mnn3), and a mannosylphosphate transferase (mnn4). The latter mutant was obtained from S. cerevisiae 4484-24D, while the first three came from S. cerevisiae X2180-1A and X2180-1B in a previous study (Raschke, W. C., Kern, K. A., Antalis C., and Ballou, C. E. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4660). These two parent strains possess easily distinguishable immunochemical determinants in their mannans, X2180 being characterized by a mannotetraose unit [αMan(1→3)αMan(1→2)αMan(1→2)Man] while 4484-24D has a mannosylphosphorylmannotriose unit [see PDF for equation] instead of the mannotetraose side chain. It was shown previously (Antalis, C., Fogel., S., and Ballou, C. E. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4655) that the diploid cross between these two strains had on its surface mannan of the X2180 chemotype. We now find that the mnn1 mutants of X2180 make mannan of the 4484-24D chemotype, which indicates that the mannosylphosphate transferase gene is present in the X2180 strain but is not expressed on the cell surface in the presence of an active α-1→3-mannosyltransferase, either in the wild type X2180 haploid or in the heterozygous diploid of X2180 x 4484-24D. Thus, these two structural features of the mannan have an epistatic relationship, with the mannotetraose unit appearing to be dominant. The various mutant strains have been analyzed for their ability to bind alcian blue dye. Strain 4484-24D binds very strongly and X2180 very weakly, reflecting the relative surface accessibility of mannosylphosphate groups in their cell walls. On the other hand, the mutants lacking phosphate (4484-24D-1 because it had a defective mannosylphosphate transferase, and X2180-1A-5 because it made no side chains to which mannosylphosphate groups could be attached) did not bind the dye at all. Thus, in these strains of S. cerevisiae it is clear that the primary ability to bind this dye was directly related to the presence of mannosylphosphate groups on the cell surface or in the cell wall. The diploid formed from a cross of X2180-1A-5, and 4484-24D-1 had the properties of the X2180 wild type, while the X2180 mnn1 mutants bound the dye in a manner characteristic of the 4484-24D wild type, a result that is consistent with the increased amount or accessibility of the mannosylphosphate group in the mnn1 mutants. Tetrad analysis of the hybrid diploids obtained from crosses between the various mutants, and between the mutants and the wild type parent, gave preliminary evidence that mnn1, mnn2, and mnn4 mutants are not linked."

https://openalex.org/W2065439196,"Tumor cell lines exposed to immunoglobulins specific for cell surface antigens developed increased cellular incorporation of [(125)I]iododeoxyuridine and [(3)H]thymidine (up to 200-fold increases over cells treated with normal rabbit immunoglobulins). Antibody-stimulated cells multiplied more rapidly and lived longer than control cells in tissue culture. These observations were made both with cells substituted with 2,4,6-trinitrophenol and purified antibody against 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, and with several cell lines and their respective whole-cell antibodies. Antibodies that were stimulatory at low concentrations were cytotoxic at high concentrations. These observations may have significance in regard to enhancing effects of antibodies on tumor cell growth in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1481388024,"Abstract Two lines of evidence suggest that the high molecular weight activator of prekallikrein (large activator) (Bagdasarian, A., Talamo, R. C., and Colman, R. W. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3456–3463) is derived from coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor). Large activator could not be isolated from plasma congenitally deficient in factor XII, and partial immunologic identity was demonstrated between factor XII and the large activator. When the factor XII molecule was denatured, reduced, and run in disc gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, no molecule the size of large activator was obtained. This observation suggested that the large activator might be formed by the digestion of factor XII by a plasma proteolytic enzyme. Incubation of plasmin with factor XII resulted in the formation of the large activator which accounted for 22% of the total activators formed. Whether isolated from plasma or generated by plasmin digestion of factor XII, the large activator was not further attacked by plasmin, indicating that it is an end product. In contrast, kallikrein digestion of factor XII failed to produce large activator but did yield low molecular weight activators. Thrombin, even at very high concentrations, failed to generate any activator. Pancreatic trypsin also formed the large activator, which comprised only 10% of the total activators of prekallikrein produced. The results suggest that factor XII exhibits differential susceptibility to plasma proteolytic enzymes with both quantitative and qualitative changes in the prekallikrein activators formed. Moreover, the kallikrein formed might exert positive feedback control by converting factor XII to low molecular weight prekallikrein activators."

https://openalex.org/W2141208541,"Abstract The isolated rat liver perfused for 12 hours has been used to study effects of added thyroxine and effects of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism in the liver donor on net biosynthesis of five specific plasma proteins, namely, rat serum albumin, fibrinogen, α1-acid glycoprotein, α2-(acute phase) globulin, and haptoglobin. Hypothyroidism was produced either by surgical thyroidectomy or by feeding methimazole (0.5 g per kg) in the powdered diet; hyperthyroidism was induced by injecting normal rats with thyroxine (10µg/100g body weight subcutaneously per day). The metabolic status of each animal was confirmed by O2 consumption measurements. The basic perfusate consisted of washed bovine red cells suspended in Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate solution containing bovine serum albumin (3.0 g/100 ml) to which was added nutritional (glucose, amino acids) and hormonal (cortisol, insulin) constituents. When used, thyroxine was added along with the other hormones at the start of perfusion as well as by constant infusion throughout the experiment. Livers from hyperthyroid liver donors synthesized significantly more albumin than those from hypothyroid rats; however, addition of thyroxine to the perfusion of livers from euthyroid and hyperthyroid rats decreased albumin synthesis. Fibrinogen synthesis was not altered significantly among the experimental groups studied here, nor was there any change in the phenomenon of induction, shown previously to be dependent upon the presence of cortisol. Synthesis of α1-acid glycoprotein and α2-(acute phase) globulin was somewhat higher by livers from hypothyroid rats than by those from euthyroid controls, and maximum rates occurred in hyperthyroid livers given a total of 4.0 µg of thyroxine. Haptoglobin synthesis was greater by livers from hyperthyroid rats than by those from normal and hypothyroid donors; the addition of 4.0 µg of thyroxine to the perfusate of normal and hyperthyroid livers increased haptoglobin synthesis while 22.0 µg caused a decrease. Nitrogen balance was estimated for the perfusion system in terms of net cumulative changes in amino acid nitrogen and urea nitrogen in the perfusate and bile. Hyperthyroidism in the liver donor and 4.0 µg of thyroxine in the perfusate resulted in negative nitrogen balance, simultaneously with maximum uptake of glucose and increased oxidation of l-[1-14C]lysine to 14CO2. Positive nitrogen balance was not a requirement for normal or enhanced net synthesis of specific plasma proteins; however, under conditions of extremely negative nitrogen balance, synthesis of acute phase proteins was impaired. Limited data on the dose-response relationship between thyroxine added to the perfusate and the metabolic response of the liver revealed that the addition of 2.0 µg of thyroxine at zero time plus the continuous infusion of an additional 2.0 µg over a 12-hour period elicited optimal anabolic responses."
https://openalex.org/W1566498709,"Abstract The enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from both vegetative amoebae and cells at the culmination stage of differentiation in Dictyostelium discoideum. The two purified enzyme protein preparations, having higher specific activities than any preparation previously reported, were clearly resolvable by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Immunological analysis, however, indicated a high degree of similarity in antigenic determinants between the two forms of the enzyme. Comparison of the rates of incorporation of [35S]methionine into UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and into acid-insoluble protein suggests that the maintenance of enzyme protein at a constant level during the transition period from growth to multicellular differentiation is attributable to a rapid turnover of enzyme protein, rather than to a cessation of enzyme synthesis. A decrease in the rate of enzyme degradation as opposed to an induction of enzyme synthesis is suggested as the mechanism of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase accumulation during multicellular differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1593296072,"Abstract The cortisol induction of the enzyme glutamine synthetase (EC 6.4.1.2) in the embryonic chick neural retina is controlled initially at the transcriptional level, as previously demonstrated by the unique appearance of a 15 S RNA species which codes for a single and identical polypeptide chain of glutamine synthetase. This is found only on polyribosomes of cortisol-treated retinas. Recent experiments based on the apparent paradoxical effects of actinomycin D have suggested that glutamine synthetase synthesis may also be regulated translationally. It was proposed that a translational repressor and degrader of glutamine synthetase messenger existed with properties which allowed it to be synthesized at low concentrations of actinomycin D, but blocked at high actinomycin D levels. A derepressor molecule was postulated which is induced by the addition of cortisol to the retina. It purportedly acts to nullify the repressor and is blocked at low actinomycin D concentrations (Moscona, A. A., Moscona, M. H., and Saenz, N. (1968) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 61, 160). Actinomycin D in high concentrations in culture with cortisol-induced retina allowed glutamine synthetase to be rapidly synthesized only for 4 hours, while low doses allowed glutamine synthetase synthesis to continue for over 20 hours at a slow but continuous rate. Low concentrations of actinomycin D did not selectively repress glutamine synthetase synthesis, in comparison with other supernatant proteins, as would be suggestive of specific translational control. However, the treatment caused an over-all reduction in protein synthesis. A translational theory cannot be supported in the face of data presented here of deleterious effects of actinomycin D on oxidative respiration, the ATP pool size, the polyribosome content, and the histological appearance of the retina. The disappearance of polyribosomes and the severe decrease in protein synthesis after actinomycin D treatment is considered to be a poor index of messenger RNA stability, since undegraded messengers inhibited in translation were found in actinomycin D-treated retinas. Actinomycin D not only acts as an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, but also as a nonspecific metabolic poison."

https://openalex.org/W2020068110,"The major internal virion polypeptide from feline and RD-114 type C viruses has been subjected to amino terminal sequence analyses with the Beckman automated sequencer. These proteins, as well as their homologs in rat and mouse viruses, begin with the sequence prolylleucylarginyl (Pro-Leu-Arg). Virus RD-114 differs from conventional feline type C viruses that show about 80 percent relatedness based on calculation of the minimum number of base changes to give equivalent coding for the protein segments analyzed. In addition, insertion of a gap in the RD-114 sequence is necessary to maintain positional homology. The difference between RD-114 and feline leukemia virus appears as great as the difference between mouse type C viruses and either of these two viruses. Thus, even though current evidence suggests that RD-114 is of feline origin, the sequence differences between RD-114 and conventional feline virus group-specific proteins is well beyond that based on one or a few point mutations."

https://openalex.org/W1601130548,"Abstract The purpose of this investigation was to find out why hemin catalyzes the oxidation of linoleic acid or its esters by O2 only in the biphasic oil-in-water system but not in homogeneous solutions. We find that only those molecules of linoleic acid or methyllinoleate which form a monomolecular film at the oil-water interface react with hemin and O2. The high affinity of hemin and hemoglobin for the xylene-water interface (Haurowitz, F., Dicks, M., and Therriault, D. (1957) Nature 180, 437–438) facilitates their combination with the molecules of the interfacial oil film. Microscopic observation revealed that increase in the amount of methyllinoleate results in coalescence of small oil spherules and a concomitant decrease in the area of the oil-water interface. Consequently, increase in the amount of methyl-linoleate by a factor, n, leads to an increase in the rate of O2 uptake by a factor smaller than n⅔, close to n½. The initial rate of O2 uptake, V, in the continually shaken manometric flasks at 37° is strictly proportional to pO2 up to pO2 = 0.06 atm; further increase in pO2 does not raise V. Kinetic analysis reveals that the rate-limiting step is the transfer of linoleate molecules from the inside of oil spherules into the interfacial film. During the catalytic process hemin is degraded to non-heme iron which consists of free or loosely bound ferrous ions; their catalytic effect is lower than that of hemin. No evidence for the presence of radicals or for chain reactions in the hemin-catalyzed oxidation was found. We conclude that hemin acts in the oxidation of linoleate not only as an oxygen-oxidoreductase but also as a peroxidase which catalyzes the destruction of linoleate hydroperoxides and thus prevents the formation of free radicals. Since hemin can be replaced by hemoglobin, cytochrome c, or ferrous ions, the mechanism of the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in vivo is most likely identical with that proposed for the hemin-catalyzed process in vitro."

Prominent differences of proteins in the α1-globulin region were detected in sera from larva and adult species. The α1-globulin fraction of the adult serum was composed mainly of a single glycoprotein designed as α1-glycoprotein. The α1-glycoprotein was purified from adult bullfrog serum and characterized. From the results of cellulose acetate and acrylamide disc electrophoreses, ultracentrifugation, and immunological experiments, the purified α1-glycoprotein was homogeneous. The molecular weight was estimated to be approximately 200,000 by disc electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. This was also confirmed by gel filtration. The sedimentation coefficient (s20, w0) was 9.5 S and the isoelectric point was 4.5. Results of amino acid and carbohydrate analyses are presented. α1-Glycoprotein increases from 0.3 mg per ml at the tadpole stage to 3.1 mg per ml at the adult stage."
