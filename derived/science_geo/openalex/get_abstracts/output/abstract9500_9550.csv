They could not do this when denied use of the symbols. The chimpanzees then spontaneously requested specific foods of one another by name. Requests resulted in cooperative and reciprocal symbolically mediated food exchange."

GC-MS is theoretically capable of the greatest specificity, but in general suffers from insufficient sensitivity. Negative chemical ionization, a new technique, provides a 150-fold increase in GC-MS sensitivity for electron-capturing compounds. Negative chemical ionization GC-MS permits routine measurement in human plasma of melatonin at a concentration as low as 1 picogram per milliliter."
https://openalex.org/W2065610663,"Human opsonic alpha2-surface binding glyoprotein (alphs2SB-glycoprotein), a molecule having immunologic identity with an amino acid composition similar to cold-insoluble globulin, is concentrated in a cryoprecipitate of plasma. Septic surgical and trauma patients manifesting opsonic alpha2SB-glycoprotein deficiency and associated reticuloendothelial system dysfunction were treated by intravenous infusion of cryoprecipitate. This therapy restored circulating bioreactive and immunoreactive opsonin and improved their septicemia, pulmonary insufficiency, and duration of recovery. Cryoprecipitate infusion may offer a new approach to the treatment of septic injured patients in preventing multiple organ failure; measurement of immuno-reactive serum opsonic alpha2SB-glycoprotein may provide a noninvasive index of reticuloendothelial system function and patient status during servere sepsis that follows trauma."

https://openalex.org/W2016594427,"Human populations native to areas of intense sunlight tend to be heavily melanized. Previous explanations for this relationship have invoked only weak selective pressures. To test the hypothesis that dark pigmentation may protect against photolysis of crucial light-sensitive vitamins and metabolites by ultraviolet light, folate was used as a model. It was found that exposure of human plasma in vitro to simulated strong sunlight causes 30 to 50 percent loss of folate within 60 minutes. Furthermore, light-skinned patients exposed to ultraviolet light for dermatologic disorders have abnormally low serum folate concentrations, suggesting that photolysis may also occur in vivo. Deficiency of folate, which occurs in many marginally nourished populations, causes severe anemia, fetal wastage, frank infertility, and maternal mortality. Prevention of ultraviolet photolysis of folate and other light sensitive nutrients by dark skin may be sufficient explanation for the maintenance of this characteristic in human groups indigenous to regions of intense solar radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1608805997,"Low salt extracts from homogenates of bovine cardiac muscle contain two protease inhibitors, one specific for the calcium-activated protease from this tissue and the other for trypsin and chymotrypsin, but no other serine proteases, including plasmin, thrombin, and subtilisin. The former, which can be separated from the protease by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, is a protein with a molecular weight of 270,000. Its action is not based on the sequestering of calcium, and it is present in large excess over the amount of calcium-activated protease in this tissue. The trypsin inhibitor, which has a molecular weight of 70,000, is estimated to be present at approximately 300 microgram/g, wet weight, of tissue. The identification of inhibitors such as these in the cytoplasm may explain why nonlysosomal proteolytic activity has been thought to be insignificant in the overall turnover of intracellular protein and suggests that a re-evaluation of this possibility is necessary."

https://openalex.org/W1616699992,"The binding of D-glucosyl-neoglycoproteins and D-galactose-terminated glycoproteins to the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor of rabbit liver membranes were characterized and compared. The binding of both types of glycoproteins showed the same dependence on calcium concentration, sensitivity to neuraminidase, and degree of inhibition by various carbohydrate derivatives. These results, along with the observation that the rabbit liver membranes bound both the D-glucosyl- and D-galactosyl-terminated glycoproteins to the same extent, indicated that both types of glycoproteins bound to the same receptor. To confirm this hypothesis, receptors were isolated from rabbit livers by affinity chromatography using D-galactosyl-bovine serum albumin or D-glucosyl-bovine serum albumin immobilized on Sepharose. These receptors were shown to be identical by several chemical and immunological criteria as well as in their ability to bind equal amounts of D-galactosyl- and D-glucosyl-terminated glycoproteins. The conclusion is that the rabbit hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor cannot discriminate between D-galactosyl and D-glucosyl-terminated glycoproteins and binds both."

https://openalex.org/W1484730408,"The glycoproteins of human erythrocyte membrane have two groups of sugar chains with blood type ABH determinants, which are quite distinct in their molecular sizes. A neutral sugar chain and an acidic sugar chain, which belong to the small size group, were isolated from the glycoproteins obtained from the erythrocyte of blood type O individuals, and their structures were elucidated as Fucalpha1 leads to 2Galbeta1 leads to 3N-acetylgalactosaminitol and Fucalpha1 leads to 2Galbeta1 leads to 3(AcNeualpha2 leads to 6)N-acetylgalactosaminitol, respectively. The molecular weight of the large sugar chains with ABH determinants were estimated to be more than 4000. Both large and small neutral sugar chains of membrane glycoproteins obtained from blood type O erythrocyte could serve as acceptors of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases purified from milk of blood type A1 and A2 individuals, producing the same radioactive sugar chain distribution patterns. However, the acidic sugar chain with the H determinant could not serve as an acceptor of these enzymes."

Since similar spectrophotometric observations have been made on the whole molecule the data with CB9 confirm our previous suggestion that binding site III of TnC is one of the strong binding sites for Ca2+. The estimate of the binding constant of Ca2+ for CB9 is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than in whole TnC, indicating further stabilization in the intact molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1533496027,"Initial velocity, product, dead-end, and substrate inhibition studies are described for gentamicin acetyltransferase I in the forward reaction. Initial velocity patterns were linear with tobramycin (Km acetyl-CoA = 1.7 micron, Km tobramycin = 1.6 micron), concave upward with sisomicin (V/K.Et = 1.7 X 10(7) M-1 s-1, indicative of nonrapid equilibrium conditions), and showed partial uncompetitive substrate inhibition with gentamicin C1a (Km acetyl-CoA = 1.3 micron, Km gentamicin C1a = 0.12 micron, KI = 6.5 micron). Product inhibition by CoA and acetyltobramycin consists of two competitive and two noncompetitive patterns. Dead-end inhibition by butyryl-CoA and neomycin consists of two competitive and two uncompetitive patterns. However, the uncompetitive pattern between neomycin and acetyl-CoA became noncompetitive when sisomicin rather than tobramycin was the nonvaried substrate. These results are consistent with a Random BiBi mechanism with synergism between binding sites which is nonrapid equilibrium with gentamicin C1a and sisomicin and rapid equilibrium with poor substrates such as tobramycin. The substrate inhibition by gentamicin C1a arises from a reduction in the rate of product (CoA) release which is partially rate-determining under nonrapid equilibrium conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1510099903,"The distribution of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity was investigated in various parts of the rabbit brain using the supernatant fraction (30,000 X g, 30 min) of homogenates. A low but significant activity was detected in all parts of the brain. The highest activity was associated with the pineal gland and choroid plexus. Specific activities of the supernatant fractions derived from the pineal gland and choroid plexus were 84.8 and 34.2 pmol/h/mg of protein at 37 degrees C, respectively, with L-tryptophan as substrate. When the pineal gland was cultured with L-[methylene-14C]tryptophan, L-[methylene-14C]kynurenine formed by the action of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was found as one of the major products. It was isolated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography and identified by thin layer chromatography with and without the treatment by kynureninase from a pseudomonad. The amount of kynurenine thus measured accounted for approximately one-third of the total amount of tryptophan metabolites, indicating that the kynurenine pathway is one of the major metabolic pathways of tryptophan in the rabbit pineal gland."

The new, abnormal arbors arise from the terminal segments of arbors that lie within the nondenervated layer and make patterns of synaptic contacts that appear normal."
https://openalex.org/W2119236704,"The determination of binding constants of metal ions to biomolecules is approachable via many techniques. Metal ion NMR spectroscopy is an alternative to more traditional techniques and is complementary to them, particularly in investigations of the interactions of metal ions with relatively small peptides containing multiple ionizing groups. The method requires relatively small amounts of material, is fairly fast, and is carried out at equilibrium. Our study has been of calcium and magnesium ion binding to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing peptides. Dissociation constants of approximately 0.6 mM for the binding of either metal ion to Z-D-Gla-D-Gla-OMe have been obtained. The procedure for determination of these constants via metal ion NMR is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2083865437,"Riboflavin and 12 of its derivatives have been shown to form solvated electrons under ultraviolet irradiation (253.7 nanometers) in various water-methanol solvent mixtures. The highest quantum yield of solvated electrons (about 0.03) was obtained for flavins containing tyrosine on a side chain in the isoalloxazine N-3 or N-10 position. The splitting of hydrogen atoms from excited flavin molecules was also observed. From the results presented here, it can be determined that the semiquinone transients are formed not only by way of the flavin triplet, as usually suggested, but also by the attack of the electrons and hydrogen atoms on flavin molecules in the ground state. This is important, because the flavin radicals remaining after the electron-ejection or hydrogen-splitting processes must also be considered in the subsequent reaction mechanisms. The electron-ejection process from electronically excited flavins has important implications in the photobiology of these compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1530258695,"Hydrodynamic, chemical, and optical properties of arginine deiminase (EC 3.5.3.6) from Mycoplasma arthritidis are reported for the enzyme isolated from log phase cells. The S020,w and D020,w values of the enzyme are 5.48 S and 5.87 X 10(-7) cm3/s, respectively; the molecular weight is 87,300. Determination of the amino acid composition shows that about 45% of the residues are nonpolar. Another unique feature of the composition is the presence of 36 half-cystine residues. The state of oxidation of the half-cystines appears to be well established as 16 disulfide and 4 sulfhydryl groups. The reaction of 1 sulfhydryl group with 0.3 mM 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) has a half-life of about 50 min at pH 8. The modified enzyme retains full activity. Two -SH groups are accessible to this reagent in 2 M guanidine hydrochloride, whereas all 4 -SH groups react immediately in 4 M guanidine hydrochloride. Reduction of disulfide bonds with dithiothreitol occurs only to a limited extent in 8 M urea, but is complete in 4 M guanidine hydrochloride. The enzyme loses activity immediately at pH 2.5, but retains full activity upon standing 8 h at pH 9.5 in several buffers. The large number of cystine residues leads to a complex near ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum with cystine contributions apparently superimposed on contributions from aromatic residues. The far ultraviolet spectrum suggests that the molecule contains about 18% alpha helix. At pH 2.5, beta conformation and disulfide contributions are dominant. Aromatic and alpha bands are reduced considerably at pH 9.5."
https://openalex.org/W2017531942,"IN Pseudomonas bacteria, the plasmids of the P-2 incompatibility group (IncP2) are notable for several reasons: they include both antibiotic resistance plasmids of nosocomial origin (R plasmids) and degradative plasmids that allow dissimilatory oxidative metabolism of unusual carbon sources; they are a naturally occurring high frequency transfer system with a host range restricted primarily to Pseudomonas; they are reported to be the most frequent incompatibility group of R plasmids found in nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates; and they show a wide geographical distribution1–4. Until now, their classification as plasmids has primarily been on the basis of genetic evidence: cotransfer of plasmid phenotypic markers independent of chromosome transfer; and co-curing of plasmid markers by another IncP2 plasmid. We have developed a novel method to permit routine physical isolation of these plasmids5. Using this method, a survey of the sizes of 12 different IncP2 plasmids reveals them to be notable in another way: they constitute an unique group of very large bacterial plasmids, generally having a homogeneous, unprecedented size range between approximately 280 and 312 megadaltons."

The kinetic constants Km, kcat, and kcat/Km for the arginine deiminase-catalyzed hydrolysis of L-arginine are equal to 4 micron, 29 s-1, and 7.4 X 10(7) M-1 s-1, respectively, at 25 degrees C and pH 7.2. The enzyme also catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-canavanine, Nalpha-methyl-L-argine, D-arginine, L-homoarginine, L-argininic acid, and guanidine, in order of decreasing second order rate constants (kcat/Km); the second order rate constants for these substrates are 10(-3) to 10(-10) smaller than the rate constant for L-arginine. Twenty-two arginine and guanidine analogs were tested for inhibitory capacity. Only 13 are competitive inhibitors having Ki values in the range 3.2 to 40 mM. These results show that binding of ligands to the enzyme is dominated by electrostatic or hydrogen bonding interactions, or both, of the guanidino and alpha-amino group. Neither citrulline nor ornithine, the end product of arginine degradation in M. arthritidis, is an inhibitor of arginine deiminase from this organism."

Antiserum dilution experiments indicated that antibodies to native tubulin were raised, and maximal binding was observed to microtubules fixed with 1 mM glutaraldehyde. Competition experiments, using iodinated fixed microtubules as tracer, demonstrated that equivalent binding occurred with microtubules at protein concentrations 100- to 1000-fold lower than those for monomeric tubulin. A rabbit antiserum raised to sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated axonemal tubulin was also characterized. The serum bound maximally (90%) to either sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated or native iodinated hog brain tubulin, and competition for antibody binding has been observed with tubulin from diverse sources (Tetrahymena pyriformis ciliary axonemes, Lytechinus pictus flagellar axonemes, and mouse neuroblastoma extracts).

https://openalex.org/W2128107914,"The oxidation of a-ketoglutarate in rat liver mito- chondria incubated in State 3 and in the uncoupled state in the absence and presence of oligomycin was inhibited by the simultaneous oxidation of fatty acids. Palmitylcarnitine inhibited a-ketoglutarate oxidation by up to 80% and octanoate by up to 30%. Various possibilities for the mechanism of this inhi- bition were experimentally evaluated. The inhibition was not associated with the damage of mitochondrial membranes due to the detergent action of fatty acids or with a restriction of a-ketoglutarate translocation. Also, a severe depletion of intramitochondrial CoASH did not occur. a-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase extracted from liver mitochondria which was stabilized with rabbit serum was inhibited by (listed from the highest to the lowest potency) palmityl-CoA, NADH, succinyl-CoA, GTP, and ATP. The intramitochondrial content of these inhibi- tory metabolites was examined in mitochondria oxidiz- ing a-ketoglutarate in the absence and presence of fatty acids. The addition of octanoate increased the content of only one inhibitor, NADH. The addition of palmityl- carnitine resulted in an accumulation of long chain acyl-CoA and the elevation of the succinyl-CoA/CoASH ratio while the NADH content increased less than in the case of octanoate. A definitive correlation between the rate of a-keto- glutarate oxidation and the succinyl-CoA/CoASH ratio was not found at similar NADH levels in various ener- getic states of mitochondria. The significant suppres- sion of the process by palmitylcarnitine was not nec- essarily associated with the high succinyl-CoA/CoASH ratio but it was correlated with the level of long chain acyl-CoA. Hence, the strong inhibition of the a-ketoglutarate oxidation in rat liver mitochondria by long chain fatty acids is postulated to be primarily due to a direct effect of long chain acyl-CoA on a-ketoglutarate dehydrogen- ase. The elevation of the succinyl-CoA/CoASH ratio and NADH level as well as the competition for CoASH have only secondary importance for this inhibition. The much weaker inhibition of the process by medium chain fatty acids is mediated exclusively by the increase of NADH content. It has been demonstrated that the tricarboxylic acid cycle is suppressed during rapid /? oxidation of fatty acids in the"

So great is the demand from the accrediting bodies that universities and academic health centers find that the cost in terms of money, time, and duplication of effort has become exhorbitant, and thereby a major problem in the management of educational institutions. The duplication of effort leads to fragmentation of the entire accrediting process, and this, in turn, fosters inadequate sharing of health professions educational experiences.
