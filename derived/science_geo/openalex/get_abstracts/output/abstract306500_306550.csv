https://openalex.org/W1991602497,"A Bose-Einstein condensate was produced in a vapor of rubidium-87 atoms that was confined by magnetic fields and evaporatively cooled. The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 x 10(12) per cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction."
https://openalex.org/W2087167697,"Determination of the atmospheric concentrations and lifetime of trichloroethane (CH(3)CCI(3)) is very important in the context of global change. This halocarbon is involved in depletion of ozone, and the hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations determined from its lifetime provide estimates of the lifetimes of most other hydrogen-containing gases involved in the ozone layer and climate. Global measurements of trichloroethane indicate rising concentrations before and declining concentrations after late 1991. The lifetime of CH(3)CCI(3) in the total atmosphere is 4.8 +/- 0.3 years, which is substantially lower than previously estimated. The deduced hydroxyl radical concentration, which measures the atmosphere's oxidizing capability, shows little change from 1978 to 1994."

Comparison of the climate records from these cores suggests that, near the beginning of the last deglaciation, warming in Antarctica began approximately 3000 years before the onset of the warm Bølling period in Greenland. Atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane concentrations began to rise 2000 to 3000 years before the warming began in Greenland and must have contributed to deglaciation and warming of temperate and boreal regions in the Northern Hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W2010450283,"The herbicide bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile) is a photosynthetic (photosystem II) inhibitor in plants. A gene, bxn, encoding a specific nitrilase that converts bromoxynil to its primary metabolite 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, was cloned from the natural soil bacterium Klebsiella ozaenae. For expression in plants, the bxn gene was placed under control of a light-regulated tissue-specific promoter, the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit. Transfer of this chimeric gene and expression of a bromoxynil-specific nitrilase in leaves of transgenic tobacco plants conferred resistance to high levels of a commercial formulation of bromoxynil. The results presented indicate a successful approach to obtain herbicide resistance by introducing a novel catabolic detoxification gene in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2080900253,"The H + H2 exchange reaction constitutes an excellent benchmark with which to test dynamical theories against experiments. The H + D2 (vibrational quantum number v = 0, rotational quantum number j = 0) reaction has been studied in crossed molecular beams at a collision energy of 1.28 electron volts, with the use of the technique of Rydberg atom time-of-flight spectroscopy. The experimental resolution achieved permits the determination of fully rovibrational state-resolved differential cross sections. The high-resolution data allow a detailed assessment of the applicability and quality of quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) and quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the QM results and in slightly worse agreement with the QCT results. This theoretical reproduction of the experimental data was achieved without explicit consideration of geometric phase effects."
https://openalex.org/W1989395589,"Coral reefs are considered to be a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide because of their high calcium carbonate production and low net primary production. This was tested by direct measurement of diurnal changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco(co2)) in reef waters during two 3-day periods, one in March 1993 and one in March 1994, on Shiraho reef of the Ryukyu Islands, Japan. Although the Pco(co2) values in reef waters exhibited large diurnal changes ranging from 160 to 520 microatmospheres, they indicate that the reef flat area is a net sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. This suggests that the net organic production rate of the reef community exceeded its calcium carbonate production rate during the observation periods."
https://openalex.org/W2024261051,"Concentrations of toxaphene and other organochlorine compounds are high in fishes from subarctic Lake Laberge, Yukon Territory, Canada. Nitrogen isotope analyses of food chains and contaminant analyses of biota, water, and dated lake sediments show that the high concentrations of toxaphene in fishes from Laberge resulted entirely from the biomagnification of atmospheric inputs. A combination of low inputs of toxaphene from the atmosphere and transfer through an exceptionally long food chain has resulted in concentrations of toxaphene in fishes that are considered hazardous to human health."
https://openalex.org/W2081323867,"The coastal uplift(approximately 40 to 60 centimeters) associated with the Chilean earthquake of 3 March 1985 caused extensive mortality of intertidal organisms at the Estación Costera de Investigaciones Marinas, Las Cruces. The kelp belt of the laminarian Lessonia nigrescens was particularly affected. Most of the primary space liberated at the upper border of this belt was invaded by species of barnacles, which showed an opportunistic colonization strategy. Drastic modifications in the environment such as coastal uplift, subsidence, or the effects of the El Niño phenomenon are characteristic of the southern Pacific. Modifications in the marine ecosystem that generate catastrophic and widespread mortalities of intertidal organisms can affect species composition, diversity, or local biogeography."
https://openalex.org/W2074443661,"Nesquehonite, a hydrous magnesium carbonate, occurs as a weathering product on the surface of the Antarctic meteorite LEW 85320(H5 chondrite). Antarctic meteorites have resided on the earth for periods of 10(4) to 10(6) years, but the time needed for weathering products to form has been uncertain. Isotopic measurements of delta(13)C and delta(18)O indicate that the nesquehonite formed at near freezing temperatures by reaction of meteoritic minerals with terrestrial water and carbon dioxide. Results from carbon-14 dating suggest that, although the meteorite has been in Antarctica for at least 3.2 x 10(4) to 3.3 x 10(4) years, the nesquehonite formed after A.D.1950."
https://openalex.org/W2081206279,"Experiments show that diamond floats in a primitive mantle melt at around 20 gigapascals and 2360 degrees C and in a melt formed by partial melting of the transition zone at about 16 gigapascals and 2270 degrees C. These observations constrain magma densities at high pressure. Diamond precipitated or trapped in a silicate melt at the base of the transition zone or the lower mantle floats and has been accumulating in the transition zone since early in Earth's history. Thus, the transition zone could be a reservoir of diamond."
https://openalex.org/W2082756978,"Commenting on our work with isotope tracers and the origin of moisture in general circulation model simulations suggest that changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation may provide strong control on isotopic variability in Greenland ice cores. In principle, we agree with the thrust of their comment. In a broad sense, without consideration of specific processes, the seasonality effects discussed and the moisture source effects described in our report are two classes of the same general phenomenon: evaporation, distillation, and transport of isotopes over different temperature regimes. Although the analysis for Greenland precipitation over the last century suggests that seasonal effects are a significant component of interannual isotopic variability, general circulation model (GCMs) represent one of the few means of assessing the importance of this phenomenon for interpreting the isotopic record over glacial cycles. The GCM approach is important for understanding the relationship between {delta}{sup 18}O and temperature because (1) thermodynamic principles and analysis of modern isotopic data suggest that present-day spatial {delta}{sup 18}O-temperature correlations cannot be considered an exact surrogate for the temporal relationship between these variables (2) geographic isotopic variability-for example, the differences in isotopic values among ice cores-can best be examined with a three-dimensional mode.

https://openalex.org/W2010863062,"All too frequently we hear the term {open_quotes}Holy Grail{close_quotes} breathlessly invoked to describe one goal or another in science. However, objections can be held back in using this term for the recent experimental achievements at JILA of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado. Atomic physicists at JILA have been able, using the techniques of laser and evaporative cooling, to put thousands of atoms into the same quantum state. In short, they have observed the phenomenon called Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in a gas of atoms for the first time. The term Holy Grail seems quite appropriate given the singular importance of this discovery. This article describes the research program, how it was developed and the future possibilities. 8 refs."
https://openalex.org/W2042496049,"By cooling a crowd of atoms to within a hair of absolute zero, researchers have made the crowd behave as one, opening a new arena for physics. On 5 June Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman created a Bose-Einstein condensate in which atoms come to a near standstill. As they slow to a stop, the quantum-mechanical waves that describe each atom spread out and merge until the entire gas is locked in the same quantum state. This article describes the history of the research, how the experiment was developed, and the future for this research."

This observation, reported by Prinn and co-workers elsewhere in this issue, is based on data from surface-level monitoring stations. The observed trends in methyl chloroform abundance have a few straightforward scientific consequences and substantial policy relevance as discussed in this article. 6 refs., 1 fig."

(17 June 1994, p. 1772)(1), a systematic, 10-fold error was made in calculating the dilutions of brain extract used for determinations of total brain superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity shown in column 6 of table 1 (p. 1774). Each value reported should have been reduced by that factor, for example, the total SOD activity reported for the G1 line should have been 4.26 +/- 0.2 SOD (U)/total protein (microg), not 42.6 +/- 2.1 U/microg, and so forth."

https://openalex.org/W2095379244,"The hottest spot on Earth is the interior of a huge, donut-shaped vessel at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The device, called a tokamak, uses a spiraling magnetic field to trap million-degree plasma, or ionized gas, allowing some of the plasma`s ions to fuse-a process that could someday be a practical source of energy. In the field of plasma physics, though, the hottest thing right now is an assessment of the field released this week by the National Research Council (NRC) suggesting that an exclusive focus on applications like tokamak fusion may actually pose a threat to the field as a whole. The pan suggest that $15 million should be shifted from fusion and other applied research into basic plasma science."

https://openalex.org/W2068612956,"A $47 million marine research and rehabilitation facility being built near Prince William Sound in south central Alaska is at the center of a debate about how to spend $900 million from Exxon to help the region recover from the 40 million liters of crude oil that gushed from the supertanker Exxon Valdez in 1989. On one side are scientists, who say that studying the region`s marine mammal, sea bird, and fish genetics is the only way to obtain the data needed to protect and preserve the sound`s ecosystem. Squaring off against them are fishing industry and environmental groups, which argue that the facility is an expensive scientific toy and that the money could be better spent protecting the region by acquiring land and making it off-limits to loggers and developers. This article describes the conflicting interests and ideas about the center."
