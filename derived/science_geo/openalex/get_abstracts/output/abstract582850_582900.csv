https://openalex.org/W2600669583,"Platelets are critical for haemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammatory responses, but the events that lead to mature platelet production remain incompletely understood. The bone marrow has been proposed to be a major site of platelet production, although there is indirect evidence that the lungs might also contribute to platelet biogenesis. Here, by directly imaging the lung microcirculation in mice, we show that a large number of megakaryocytes circulate through the lungs, where they dynamically release platelets. Megakaryocytes that release platelets in the lungs originate from extrapulmonary sites such as the bone marrow; we observed large megakaryocytes migrating out of the bone marrow space. The contribution of the lungs to platelet biogenesis is substantial, accounting for approximately 50% of total platelet production or 10 million platelets per hour. Furthermore, we identified populations of mature and immature megakaryocytes along with haematopoietic progenitors in the extravascular spaces of the lungs. Under conditions of thrombocytopenia and relative stem cell deficiency in the bone marrow, these progenitors can migrate out of the lungs, repopulate the bone marrow, completely reconstitute blood platelet counts, and contribute to multiple haematopoietic lineages. These results identify the lungs as a primary site of terminal platelet production and an organ with considerable haematopoietic potential."

However, whether many MPAs are being effectively and equitably managed, and how MPA management influences substantive outcomes remain unknown. We developed a global database of management and fish population data (433 and 218 MPAs, respectively) to assess: MPA management processes; the effects of MPAs on fish populations; and relationships between management processes and ecological effects. Here we report that many MPAs failed to meet thresholds for effective and equitable management processes, with widespread shortfalls in staff and financial resources. Although 71% of MPAs positively influenced fish populations, these conservation impacts were highly variable. Staff and budget capacity were the strongest predictors of conservation impact: MPAs with adequate staff capacity had ecological effects 2.9 times greater than MPAs with inadequate capacity. Thus, continued global expansion of MPAs without adequate investment in human and financial capacity is likely to lead to sub-optimal conservation outcomes. Although 71% of marine protected areas are benefiting fish populations, their effects are highly variable, with staff capacity proving to be the most important explanatory variable. Marine protected areas are proliferating quickly in the hope of safeguarding marine resources. Here David Gill and colleagues show that inadequate staffing capacity is compromising the efficacy of marine protected areas globally. They analyse fish biomass and management data for marine protected areas around the world and find that, although 71% of these protected areas are benefiting fish populations, the effects are highly variable. Staff capacity was identified as the most important explanatory variable, accounting for around 19% of the variation in the benefits of marine protection. They suggest that continued expansion of marine protected areas around the globe without adequate investment in human and financial capacity could limit marine conservation outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2595342131,"Aging and obesity induce ectopic adipocyte accumulation in bone marrow cavities. This process is thought to impair osteogenic and hematopoietic regeneration. Here we specify the cellular identities of the adipogenic and osteogenic lineages of the bone. While aging impairs the osteogenic lineage, high-fat diet feeding activates expansion of the adipogenic lineage, an effect that is significantly enhanced in aged animals. We further describe a mesenchymal sub-population with stem cell-like characteristics that gives rise to both lineages and, at the same time, acts as a principal component of the hematopoietic niche by promoting competitive repopulation following lethal irradiation. Conversely, bone-resident cells committed to the adipocytic lineage inhibit hematopoiesis and bone healing, potentially by producing excessive amounts of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4, a protease that is a target of diabetes therapies. These studies delineate the molecular identity of the bone-resident adipocytic lineage, and they establish its involvement in age-dependent dysfunction of bone and hematopoietic regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2597428467,"The metabolism of carbohydrate polymers drives microbial diversity in the human gut microbiota. It is unclear, however, whether bacterial consortia or single organisms are required to depolymerize highly complex glycans. Here we show that the gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron uses the most structurally complex glycan known: the plant pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan-II, cleaving all but 1 of its 21 distinct glycosidic linkages. The deconstruction of rhamnogalacturonan-II side chains and backbone are coordinated to overcome steric constraints, and the degradation involves previously undiscovered enzyme families and catalytic activities. The degradation system informs revision of the current structural model of rhamnogalacturonan-II and highlights how individual gut bacteria orchestrate manifold enzymes to metabolize the most challenging glycan in the human diet."
https://openalex.org/W2600889385,"Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is driven by the activity of the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncoprotein. ABL1 kinase inhibitors have improved the clinical outcomes for patients with CML, with over 80% of patients treated with imatinib surviving for more than 10 years. Second-generation ABL1 kinase inhibitors induce more potent molecular responses in both previously untreated and imatinib-resistant patients with CML. Studies in patients with chronic-phase CML have shown that around 50% of patients who achieve and maintain undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcript levels for at least 2 years remain disease-free after the withdrawal of treatment. Here we characterize ABL001 (asciminib), a potent and selective allosteric ABL1 inhibitor that is undergoing clinical development testing in patients with CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In contrast to catalytic-site ABL1 kinase inhibitors, ABL001 binds to the myristoyl pocket of ABL1 and induces the formation of an inactive kinase conformation. ABL001 and second-generation catalytic inhibitors have similar cellular potencies but distinct patterns of resistance mutations, with genetic barcoding studies revealing pre-existing clonal populations with no shared resistance between ABL001 and the catalytic inhibitor nilotinib. Consistent with this profile, acquired resistance was observed with single-agent therapy in mice; however, the combination of ABL001 and nilotinib led to complete disease control and eradicated CML xenograft tumours without recurrence after the cessation of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2591366729,"Molecular crystals cannot be designed in the same manner as macroscopic objects, because they do not assemble according to simple, intuitive rules. Their structures result from the balance of many weak interactions, rather than from the strong and predictable bonding patterns found in metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks. Hence, design strategies that assume a topology or other structural blueprint will often fail. Here we combine computational crystal structure prediction and property prediction to build energy-structure-function maps that describe the possible structures and properties that are available to a candidate molecule. Using these maps, we identify a highly porous solid, which has the lowest density reported for a molecular crystal so far. Both the structure of the crystal and its physical properties, such as methane storage capacity and guest-molecule selectivity, are predicted using the molecular structure as the only input. More generally, energy-structure-function maps could be used to guide the experimental discovery of materials with any target function that can be calculated from predicted crystal structures, such as electronic structure or mechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2602668040,"The brain's ability to associate different stimuli is vital for long-term memory, but how neural ensembles encode associative memories is unknown. Here we studied how cell ensembles in the basal and lateral amygdala encode associations between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli (CS and US, respectively). Using a miniature fluorescence microscope, we tracked the Ca2+ dynamics of ensembles of amygdalar neurons during fear learning and extinction over 6 days in behaving mice. Fear conditioning induced both up- and down-regulation of individual cells' CS-evoked responses. This bi-directional plasticity mainly occurred after conditioning, and reshaped the neural ensemble representation of the CS to become more similar to the US representation. During extinction training with repetitive CS presentations, the CS representation became more distinctive without reverting to its original form. Throughout the experiments, the strength of the ensemble-encoded CS-US association predicted the level of behavioural conditioning in each mouse. These findings support a supervised learning model in which activation of the US representation guides the transformation of the CS representation."
https://openalex.org/W2603764892,"Somatic cells acquire mutations throughout the course of an individual's life. Mutations occurring early in embryogenesis are often present in a substantial proportion of, but not all, cells in postnatal humans and thus have particular characteristics and effects. Depending on their location in the genome and the proportion of cells they are present in, these mosaic mutations can cause a wide range of genetic disease syndromes and predispose carriers to cancer. They have a high chance of being transmitted to offspring as de novo germline mutations and, in principle, can provide insights into early human embryonic cell lineages and their contributions to adult tissues. Although it is known that gross chromosomal abnormalities are remarkably common in early human embryos, our understanding of early embryonic somatic mutations is very limited. Here we use whole-genome sequences of normal blood from 241 adults to identify 163 early embryonic mutations. We estimate that approximately three base substitution mutations occur per cell per cell-doubling event in early human embryogenesis and these are mainly attributable to two known mutational signatures. We used the mutations to reconstruct developmental lineages of adult cells and demonstrate that the two daughter cells of many early embryonic cell-doubling events contribute asymmetrically to adult blood at an approximately 2:1 ratio. This study therefore provides insights into the mutation rates, mutational processes and developmental outcomes of cell dynamics that operate during early human embryogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2599601523,"Cancer somatic mutations can generate neoantigens that distinguish malignant from normal cells. However, the personalized identification and validation of neoantigens remains a major challenge. Here we discover neoantigens in human mantle-cell lymphomas by using an integrated genomic and proteomic strategy that interrogates tumour antigen peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules. We applied this approach to systematically characterize MHC ligands from 17 patients. Remarkably, all discovered neoantigenic peptides were exclusively derived from the lymphoma immunoglobulin heavy- or light-chain variable regions. Although we identified MHC presentation of private polymorphic germline alleles, no mutated peptides were recovered from non-immunoglobulin somatically mutated genes. Somatic mutations within the immunoglobulin variable region were almost exclusively presented by MHC class II. We isolated circulating CD4+ T cells specific for immunoglobulin-derived neoantigens and found these cells could mediate killing of autologous lymphoma cells. These results demonstrate that an integrative approach combining MHC isolation, peptide identification, and exome sequencing is an effective platform to uncover tumour neoantigens. Application of this strategy to human lymphoma implicates immunoglobulin neoantigens as targets for lymphoma immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2598984514,"Post-mitotic, differentiated cells exhibit a variety of characteristics that contrast with those of actively growing neoplastic cells, such as the expression of cell-cycle inhibitors and differentiation factors. We hypothesized that the gene expression profiles of these differentiated cells could reveal the identities of genes that may function as tumour suppressors. Here we show, using in vitro and in vivo studies in mice and humans, that the mitochondrial protein LACTB potently inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Its mechanism of action involves alteration of mitochondrial lipid metabolism and differentiation of breast cancer cells. This is achieved, at least in part, through reduction of the levels of mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, which is involved in the synthesis of mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine. These observations uncover a novel mitochondrial tumour suppressor and demonstrate a connection between mitochondrial lipid metabolism and the differentiation program of breast cancer cells, thereby revealing a previously undescribed mechanism of tumour suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2601085257,"Power systems for South and Central America based on 100% renewable energy (RE) in the year 2030 were calculated for the first time using an hourly resolved energy model. The region was subdivided into 15 sub-regions. Four different scenarios were considered: three according to different high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission grid development levels (region, country, area-wide) and one integrated scenario that considers water desalination and industrial gas demand supplied by synthetic natural gas via power-to-gas (PtG). RE is not only able to cover 1813 TWh of estimated electricity demand of the area in 2030 but also able to generate the electricity needed to fulfil 3.9 billion m3 of water desalination and 640 TWhLHV of synthetic natural gas demand. Existing hydro dams can be used as virtual batteries for solar and wind electricity storage, diminishing the role of storage technologies. The results for total levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) are decreased from 62 €/MWh for a highly decentralized to 56 €/MWh for a highly centralized grid scenario (currency value of the year 2015). For the integrated scenario, the levelized cost of gas (LCOG) and the levelized cost of water (LCOW) are 95 €/MWhLHV and 0.91 €/m3, respectively. A reduction of 8% in total cost and 5% in electricity generation was achieved when integrating desalination and power-to-gas into the system."
https://openalex.org/W2600996894,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a critical role in cell signaling and proliferation. NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a membrane-bound flavin dehydrogenase that generates O2·−, is highly expressed in colon cancer. To investigate the role that NOX1 plays in colon cancer growth, we used shRNA to decrease NOX1 expression stably in HT-29 human colon cancer cells. The 80–90% decrease in NOX1 expression achieved by RNAi produced a significant decline in ROS production and a G1/S block that translated into a 2–3-fold increase in tumor cell doubling time without increased apoptosis. The block at the G1/S checkpoint was associated with a significant decrease in cyclin D1 expression and profound inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Decreased steady-state MAPK phosphorylation occurred concomitant with a significant increase in protein phosphatase activity for two colon cancer cell lines in which NOX1 expression was knocked down by RNAi. Diminished NOX1 expression also contributed to decreased growth, blood vessel density, and VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) expression in HT-29 xenografts initiated from NOX1 knockdown cells. Microarray analysis, supplemented by real-time PCR and Western blotting, revealed that the expression of critical regulators of cell proliferation and angiogenesis, including c-MYC, c-MYB, and VEGF, were down-regulated in association with a decline in hypoxic HIF-1α protein expression downstream of silenced NOX1 in both colon cancer cell lines and xenografts. These studies suggest a role for NOX1 in maintaining the proliferative phenotype of some colon cancers and the potential of NOX1 as a therapeutic target in this disease.

Intracellular oxidation-reduction balance in epithelial cells has for more than 30 years been viewed predominantly as a dynamic equilibrium between the production of potentially toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesPMAphorbol myristate acetateFDRfalse discovery rateDCF2′,7′-dichlorofluoresceinDCF-DA2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetatehpfhigh-powered fieldIHCimmunohistochemistryPTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseSCscrambled cloneCREBcAMP-response element-binding protein. and the detoxification of reactive species by a broad range of antioxidant enzymes and small molecules (1Dröge W. Free radicals in the physiological control of cell function.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7493) Google Scholar). A more physiological appreciation of the role of ROS has developed over the past decade; it is now clear that low levels of ROS, especially H2O2, play a critical role in signal transduction for most receptor tyrosine kinases and many cytokines (2Nathan C.

However, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying the formation of reactive oxygen in tumors remained incomplete until the discovery of a family of epithelial NADPH oxidases that are, to varying degrees, structural homologs of gp91phox, the major membrane-bound component of the respiratory burst oxidase of leukocytes (14Lambeth J.D.

The presence of NOX1 in surface mucosal cells of the distal large bowel provides an appropriate physiological milieu from which to influence the killing of pathogenic bacteria and the innate immune response (32Kawahara T.

In contrast, based on the available experimental evidence, NOX1 also plays an essential role in oxidant-mediated signal transduction involving the RAS/MAPK pathway (34Chamulitrat W. Schmidt R. Tomakidi P. Stremmel W. Chunglok W. Kawahara T. Rokutan K.

Lambeth J.D. Kamata T. The superoxide-generating oxidase Nox1 is functionally required for Ras oncogene transformation.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3580-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activated NOX1 in colonic epithelial cells, producing ROS, could contribute to genetic instability (11Chiera F. Meccia E. Degan P. Aquilina G. Pietraforte D. Minetti M. Lambeth D. Bignami M. Overexpression of human NOX1 complex induces genome instability in mammalian cells.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In a previous study, transient knockdown of NOX1 expression with siRNA was shown to produce a modest effect on cell proliferation in HT-29 cells and evidence of enhanced apoptosis in Caco2 human colon cancer cells in vitro (39Wang R. Dashwood W.M. Nian H. Löhr C.V. Fischer K.A. Tsuchiya N. Nakagama H. Ashktorab H. Dashwood R.H. NADPH oxidase overexpression in human colon cancers and rat colon tumors induced by 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP).Int. J. Cancer. 2011; 128: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of NOX1 in colon cancer growth further, we utilized NOX1 shRNA in HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells to evaluate the effect of stable, silenced NOX1 expression on reactive oxygen production, tumor cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, gene expression, signal transduction, and angiogenesis in both a cell culture model and in HT-29 xenografts. Our results demonstrate that down-regulation of NOX1 expression significantly diminishes reactive oxygen metabolism and markedly decreases the proliferation of HT-29 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Growth delay of tumor cells following knockdown of NOX1 expression appears to be due to a profound block at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle that is related to cyclin D1 down-regulation, and alterations in other components of the G1 checkpoint that may reflect a protein phosphatase-mediated inactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Stable NOX1 knockdown is also accompanied by significant alterations in the expression of a broad portfolio of genes critical to cell proliferation and to the angiogenic process. The effect of decreased NOX1 expression in vivo is demonstrable both as a significant alteration in the growth of HT-29 xenografts as well as the development of their supporting blood vessels. HT-29 cells were utilized for these experiments because previous investigations had demonstrated that this cell line expressed high levels of NOX1 mRNA (27Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Brenner S. Hewitt S.M. Dana R. Malech H.L. Leto T.L.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We found that the mean mRNA expression ratios of NOX1 or its accessory genes in HT-29 cells (normalized to β-actin) were ≈15,000 (×10−6) for NOX1; ≈20,000 (×10−6) for NOXO1; and 1100 (×10−6) for NOXA1 (Table 1); these experiments, in conjunction with our previous study (40Doroshow J.H. Juhasz A. Ge Y. Holbeck S. Lu J. Antony S. Wu Y. Jiang G. Roy K. Antiproliferative mechanisms of action of the flavin dehydrogenase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium and di-2-thienyliodonium based on molecular profiling of the NCI-60 human tumor cell panel.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2012; 83: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), strongly suggest that among human tumor cells lines, NOX1 is most frequently expressed in those originating from the colon (31Juhasz A.

Expression of NADPH oxidase homologues and accessory genes in human cancer cell lines, tumours and adjacent normal tissues.Free Radic.

The expression ratios of other members of the NADPH oxidase gene family (NOX2–5, Duox1, and Duox2) in HT-29 cells were either undetectable or <1000 (×10−6) (Table 1).Table 1Expression of NADPH oxidase isoforms in HT-29 cells and stable clones transfected with shRNAs normalized to β-actin (×10−6)GenesHT-29SC6AG6NOX114,81317,3289924172NOXA11113124125143116NOXO120,402891464,40143,250NOX2966148211207091NOX300312NOX40000NOX5371830DUOX17837569DUOX21512DUOXA20346 Open table in a new tab To down-regulate NOX1 expression, NOX1-specific or scrambled shRNA constructs were developed, transfected into HT-29 cells, and selected in G418. Clones exhibiting stable growth were expanded from cells transfected with target sequence 6 (clones shNOX1 6A and shNOX1 G6) and the scrambled sequence (clone shSC). NOX1 mRNA expression did not change through 20 passages for clones 6A, G6, and SC; levels of NOX1 expression were significantly lower in clones 6A and G6 (Fig. 1A) than in parental HT-29 cells or cells expanded from the SC clone (p < 0.001 for either 6A or G6 compared with either parental HT-29 cells or cells from the SC clone). NOX1 knockdown resulted in a nearly complete inhibition of NOX1 expression at the protein level (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the decrease in NOX1 expression was not accompanied by significant changes in the expression of any other members of the NOX gene family (Table 1) or a variety of important antioxidant genes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase 1, superoxide dismutase, or peroxiredoxin; data not shown). The oxidative conversion of the non-fluorescent indicator dye 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) to the highly fluorescent species 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) was used to measure constitutive levels of ROS in HT-29, SC, 6A, and G6 cells (Fig. 1B). DCF production from DCF-DA represents the net effect of cellular oxidant metabolism from all sources, including the mitochondrial electron transport chain and cytoplasmic flavin dehydrogenases, in addition to the NOX1 complex. Inhibition of NOX1 expression in both 6A and G6 cells was associated with a substantial decrease in steady-state ROS levels when compared with the parental HT-29 line or tumor cells derived from the SC clone (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, activation of NOX1 activity with PMA (previously shown to enhance ROS production in HEK293 cells with a fully reconstituted NOX1 complex (41Cheng G. Diebold B.A. Hughes Y. Lambeth J.D. Nox1-dependent reactive oxygen generation is regulated by Rac1.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17718-17726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)) demonstrated that PMA-enhanced reactive oxygen formation in HT-29 cell clones with significantly diminished NOX1 expression was decreased by ≥80% (Fig. 1C), p < 0.01. Down-regulation of NOX1 in HT-29 cells was also accompanied by a significant decline in cell proliferation (Fig. 1D). The doubling times of G6 and 6A cells, compared with cells from the parental HT-29 line or from clone SC, were increased ≈2–3.5-fold, respectively. To elucidate potential mechanisms responsible for the prolongation of tumor cell doubling time in the 6A cell line, we examined cell cycle progression by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). Parental HT-29 and stable cloned cell lines were synchronized by serum starvation and then either collected or serum-stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle. Cell cycle progression was followed for 72 h; 24 h following release from serum starvation, cells from clone 6A demonstrated a block at the G1/S interface, with 5% of the cells progressing into G2/M compared with 16–18% of SC or parental HT-29 cells. Consistent with our doubling time results, the parental and SC cells completed a full cell cycle approximately every 24–30 h, whereas 6A cells required 72 h to complete the cycle (Fig. 2A). The delay in cell cycle progression for 6A cells was not, however, associated with a substantial increase in apoptosis (Fig. 2B). Although there appeared to be a modest increase in TUNEL positivity for 6A cells in G1 at the zero time point, the observed G1/S block was not associated either with an increase in low molecular weight DNA (sub G0/G1 DNA) or enhanced TUNEL positivity throughout the cell cycle during the 72 h of observation following stimulation with serum (Fig. 2B). To understand the altered cell cycle progression observed in 6A cells, selected cell cycle proteins were analyzed in stable clones and parental cells during logarithmic cell growth (Fig. 2C). The block at the G1/S transition is consistent with the observed decrease in cyclin D1 protein expression and the increase in expression of the CDK4/6 complex inhibitors p14, p15, p18, and p19 in cells with decreased NOX1 expression. As shown in Table 2, expression levels of p18 and p19 were also increased at the mRNA level.Table 2Expression of cell cycle genes in HT-29 cells and stable clones transfected with shRNAs normalized to 18S rRNA (×10−8)GeneHT-29SC6ACDKN1A (p21)21221686529CDKN1B (p27)224418512852CDKN1C (p57)26417555CDKN2A (p16)35,74557,868104,531CDKN2B (p15)561243508CDKN2C (p18)83138458CDKN2D (p19)5184951141CDK2163718142158CDK4764577098911CDK64339349110,959SKP2232349167149E2F6591577534E2F1399336615475RB229221973181PCNA12,89316,62121,015RAD51230620812406SMAD3355826523720SMAD7156910082100TGFβ12056473110,009CCNA1 (cyclin A1)NDNDNDCCNA298722282343CCNB1 (cyclin B1)150533823125CCNB215,14421,21818,550CCNB3845CCND1 (cyclin D1)11,71110,3488172CCND2210CCND3255726254795CCNE1 (cyclin E1)179614124272CCNE210579912086CDC2261027323454CHK1228719842321CHK2710620753ATM228145171CDC25A372606640 Open table in a new tab To examine potential mechanisms underlying diminished cyclin D1 expression produced by inhibition of NOX1, signal transduction pathways known to control cyclin D1 were evaluated in our HT-29 cell clones. When compared with both the parental HT-29 line and control cells transfected with a scrambled shRNA (SC cells), the 6A cell line demonstrated a profound decrease in signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Fig. 3A). Under conditions of logarithmic cell growth in serum, the phosphorylation of essentially all members of this pathway from Rac1 to CREB was markedly decreased. This was associated with a significant decrease in c-Myc mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 3B). Under identical experimental conditions, however, NOX1 inhibition produced no significant effect on the Akt and p38 MAPK pathways (Fig. 4, A and B) nor an effect on alternative signaling pathways of relevance to the activation of CREB (Fig. 4C).Figure 4Effect of NOX1 knockdown on signaling through the Akt and p38 MAPK pathways.

Detailed study of the mechanism revealed that PRMT1 regulates PPARγ gene expression through histone H4R3me2a methylation at the PPARγ promoter. Supplementing with PPARγ agonists rosiglitazone and GW1929 was sufficient to restore M2 differentiation in vivo and in vitro and abrogated the difference in survival between wild-type and PRMT1 knock-out mice.

https://openalex.org/W2604003886,"Non-canonical base pairing within guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences can produce G-quartets, whose stacking leads to the formation of a G-quadruplex (G4). G4s can coexist with canonical duplex DNA in the human genome and have been suggested to suppress gene transcription, and much attention has therefore focused on studying G4s in promotor regions of disease-related genes. For example, the human KRAS proto-oncogene contains a nuclease-hypersensitive element located upstream of the major transcription start site. The KRAS nuclease-hypersensitive element (NHE) region contains a G-rich element (22RT; 5′-AGGGCGGTGTGGGAATAGGGAA-3′) and encompasses a Myc-associated zinc finger-binding site that regulates KRAS transcription. The NEH region therefore has been proposed as a target for new drugs that control KRAS transcription, which requires detailed knowledge of the NHE structure. In this study, we report a high-resolution NMR structure of the G-rich element within the KRAS NHE. We found that the G-rich element forms a parallel structure with three G-quartets connected by a four-nucleotide loop and two short one-nucleotide double-chain reversal loops. In addition, a thymine bulge is found between G8 and G9. The loops of different lengths and the presence of a bulge between the G-quartets are structural elements that potentially can be targeted by small chemical ligands that would further stabilize the structure and interfere or block transcriptional regulators such as Myc-associated zinc finger from accessing their binding sites on the KRAS promoter.

Mutations in the KRAS promoter are found in about 30% of these cases. It is thought that the KRAS oncogene promotes glycolysis through the activation of downstream signaling pathways (34Ying H.

The very high affinity of the RAS GTP/GDP-binding site (picomolar range) (35John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S.

It is no surprise that after many decades of unsuccessfully battling against the RAS proteins new strategies in the field of drug design have emerged. Among those, some target alternative binding sites in the GTPase domain (38Ostrem J.M. Peters U. Sos M.L. Wells J.A. Shokat K.M.

Alternatively, several strategies, including ours, target the promotor region in an effort to block KRAS expression (41Cogoi S. Xodo L.E.

The promoter region of the KRAS gene comprises more than 500 bp and is susceptible to digestion by nucleases such as DNase I, micrococcal nuclease, and other endogenous nucleases (45Jordano J.

A particular sequence inside the NHE, between positions −327 and −296 nucleotides upstream of the main transcription initiation site, is particularly rich in guanines (sequence 32R; Fig. 1A). 32R contains six guanine stretches and is able to form several G4 conformations. Among those stretches of guanines, two regions overlap and includes the Myc-associated zinc finger (MAZ)-binding sites, the recognition sequence for a transcription factor that recognizes GGGCGG and GGGAGG sequences (46Cogoi S.

We began our study with circular dichroism (CD) and NMR analyses of oligonucleotides within the sequence NHE (Fig. 1A). To make spectral assignments possible, different oligonucleotides were evaluated (supplemental Table S2) with the objective of identifying a sequence that formed a single G4 conformer based on the dispersion and intensities of imino peaks observed in the NMR spectra. The sequence 21R and three other related sequences display a 1D imino peak pattern that corresponds to a single conformer as shown by 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1C). The similar imino signatures suggest the presence of a predominant conformer within the human NHE of KRAS gene. The sequence 22RT with a G16 to T16 mutation displayed a better resolved imino peak pattern and a slightly better stabilization observed by the CD melting studies (Fig. 1B). In addition, DMS footprinting (50Paramasivam M. Cogoi S. Xodo L.E. Primer extension reactions as a tool to uncover folding motifs within complex G-rich sequences: analysis of the human KRAS NHE.Chem. Commun. 2011; 47: 4965-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and our 15N-filtered 1D NMR experiments (results not shown) demonstrated that G16 did not participate in the tetrad formation. Oligonucleotides of the native sequence with four G-tracts, 21R and 22R, and those with single G16 to T (16G→T) mutations, 21RT and 22RT, respectively, appeared to adopt a predominant conformation based on analysis of the imino proton region from 10 to 12 ppm. The sequence and the respective 1H 1D NMR spectra are presented in Fig. 1C. Remarkably, 22RT showed a better resolved peak pattern in both imino and aromatic regions (not shown) than did 21R or 22R. For stability purposes, we have included an additional A at the 22RT 3′-end. These modifications resulted in better imino and aromatic peak resolution when compared with 22R and 21R. The CD spectral signatures are similar between 21R and 22RT. The spectrum of each includes a positive band at 263 nm and a negative band at 243 nm suggestive of a parallel G4 fold (Fig. 1B, left). The thermal stability of 21R and 22RT was determined through CD melting experiments. The melting temperatures (Tm) in 90 mm K+ were 49.2 ± 0.2 and 51.8 ± 0.3 °C for 21R and 22RT, respectively (Fig. 1B, right). The molecularity of 21R and 22RT was assessed by inspecting the UV-visible melting curves and by diffusion NMR experiments (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3, respectively). The results demonstrate that both 21R and 22RT fold into a monomeric structure, inferred from the reversible and superimposable cooling versus heating UV-visible curves in the concentration range that spans an order of magnitude from ≈5 to ≈50 μm. These experiments showed that melting transitions are reversible and independent of DNA concentration, demonstrating that the G4 structures formed by both 21R and 22RT are unimolecular. As the melting process was reversible, model-dependent van't Hoff enthalpies of folding could be calculated. The ΔH037 values for 21R and 22RT were 164 ± 4 and 191 ± 7 kJ/mol, respectively. Diffusion NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the diffusion coefficient value for 22RT. From diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments, we obtained a diffusion coefficient of 1.54 × 10−10 m2 s−1 (logD ≈ −9.81), which is in the range of those found for monomeric G4 oligonucleotides of similar size such as the human telomeric sequence (22AG) observed elsewhere (23Ambrus A. Chen D. Dai J. Jones R.A. Yang D. Solution structure of the biologically relevant G-quadruplex element in the human c-MYC promoter.

Webba da Silva M. Rapid stoichiometric analysis of G-quadruplexes in solution.Chemistry. 2010; 16: 6451-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The results support a model where 22RT is monomeric under the experimental conditions probed in this work. For reference, we report a diffusion value of 8.9 × 10−11 m2 s−1 (logD ≈ −10.05) obtained for the oligonucleotide KRAS 44R from the NHE region that contains the sequence 32R at the 5′-end (supplemental Table S2). The imino proton spectrum of 22RT is characterized by 10 individually well resolved and sharp peaks in the 10.5-12-ppm region (Fig. 1C) plus one additional broad peak that was later identified as G19 and G7 overlapped imino peaks. The imino pattern in this region is often used as a fingerprint for G4 structures. The pattern observed suggests the formation of three G-quartets, each involving four imino protons. Based on the specific intraquartet characteristic guanine H1–H8 NOE correlations (Fig. 2B), the folding pattern of the 22RT G4 involves three G-quartets: G2·G6·G11·G18, G3·G7·G12·G19, and G4·G9·G13·G20 (Fig. 2). For clarity, we have selected the six lowest-energy structures after refinement of the best 20 structures with a heavy atom r.m.s.d. value of ≈1.5 Å (Fig. 3). When depicted against the calculated mass-weighting principal axis, the tetrad core is placed with its averaged planes almost in a perpendicular fashion (Fig. 3). The G3·G7·G12·G19 residues form the central tetrad of the quadruplex core as the imino protons on these residues are better protected from water/deuterium exchange than are those of other guanines of 22RT (supplemental Fig. S4). In addition and as expected, the guanines in a central G-quartet have by far the strongest NOE inter-residue connectivities between exchangeable protons (e.g. NH2/H1), supporting the increased protection of these protons from exchange with water. Interestingly, G3 is the only base that has NOE cross-peaks to both amino-exchangeable protons (NH21/NH22). These protons are probably protected by the single-nucleotide chain reversal C5 loop, which bridges and completely blocks the groove between G3 and G7. The 22RT G4 has an ˜30° helical twist on average and a rise of 3.4 Å for each G-tetrad step. On average, the four grooves are of medium size with similar widths in the range of 12 ± 2 Å as defined by the distances between phosphates of opposing guanines in the structure. The orientations of the aromatic bases toward the sugars are determined by the conformation of the glycosidic bond angle, which is determined by the intraresidue NOE correlation intensities between the H8 aromatic proton and H1′ sugar proton. All the guanine glycosidic torsion angles are in the anti conformation as reflected by the medium/low intraguanine NOE cross-peaks observed between H8 and H1′ protons (Fig. 2A). These glycosidic torsion angle conformations are expected for a parallel G4 as suggested by the CD spectra of 22RT (Fig. 1B). Our CD and NMR results are consistent and indicate that 22RT adopts a parallel G4 as shown schematically in Fig. 2C. The three G-tetrads are connected by four linkers: two single-residue loops (C5 and T10), a bulge (T8), and one four-nucleotide loop (A14, A15, T16, and A17). C5 and T10 each form double-chain reversal loops that allow these single residues to bridge three G-tetrad blocks. Inspection of r.m.s.d. values and conformation diversity for C5 indicates hingelike motions parallel to the mass-weighting principal axis. The T10 base is oriented toward the 3′-end of the oligonucleotides, and fewer distinct conformers are observed. Interestingly, T8 forms a bulge projected out of the G-tetrad core. Although over 700,000 G-quadruplexes with single or multiple bulges may exist in the human genome (53Chambers V.S. Marsico G. Boutell J.M. Di Antonio M. Smith G.P. Balasubramanian S.

https://openalex.org/W2601570735,"Monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, which can be initiated by physiological or atherogenic factors, is a pivotal process in atherogenesis, a disorder in which monocytes adhere to endothelial cells and subsequently migrate into the subendothelial spaces, where they differentiate into macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells and cause atherosclerotic lesions. However, the monocyte-differentiation signaling pathways that are activated by atherogenic factors are poorly defined. Here we report that the AMP-activated protein kinase α1 (AMPKα1) in monocytes promotes atherosclerosis by increasing monocyte differentiation and survival. Exposure of monocytes to oxidized low-density lipoprotein, 7-ketocholesterol, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or macrophage colony-stimulated factor (M-CSF) significantly activated AMPK and promoted monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. M-CSF-activated AMPK is via M-CSF receptor-dependent reactive oxygen species production. Consistently, genetic deletion of AMPKα1 or pharmacological inhibition of AMPK blunted monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and promoted monocyte/macrophage apoptosis. Compared with apolipoprotein E knock-out (ApoE-/-) mice, which show impaired clearing of plasma lipoproteins and spontaneously develop atherosclerosis, ApoE-/-/AMPKα1-/- mice showed reduced sizes of atherosclerotic lesions and lesser numbers of macrophages in the lesions. Furthermore, aortic lesions were decreased in ApoE-/- mice transplanted with ApoE-/-/AMPKα1-/- bone marrow and in myeloid-specific AMPKα1-deficient ApoE-/- mice. Finally, rapamycin treatment, which abolished delayed monocyte differentiation in ApoE-/-/AMPKα1-/- mice, lost its atherosclerosis-lowering effects in these mice. Mechanistically, we found that AMPKα1 regulates FoxO3-dependent expression of both LC3 and ULK1, which are two important autophagy-related markers. Rapamycin treatment increased FoxO3 activity as well as LC3 and ULK1 expressions in macrophages from AMPKα1-/- mice. Our results reveal that AMPKα1 deficiency impairs autophagy-mediated monocyte differentiation and decreases monocyte/macrophage survival, which attenuates atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2598535813,"Despite the actual therapeutic approaches for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), efficient and secure alternative options remain a research focus. In this context, anthocyanins seem promising natural anti-inflammatory agents, but their action mechanisms and efficacy as compared with established drugs still require more clarification. The main aim of this study was to compare the anti-inflammatory action of a chemically characterized anthocyanin-rich fraction (ARF), obtained from Portuguese blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), with that of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), a first-line drug in IBD, in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis rat model. Such fraction showed a high content and great molecular diversity of anthocyanins, with malvidin-3-galactoside and petunidin-3-arabinoside in the highest concentrations. After daily administration by intragastric infusion for 8 days, ARF, at a molar anthocyanin concentration about 30 times lower than 5-ASA, showed a higher effectiveness in counteracting the intestinal inflammation, as assessed by i) body weight variation and colon damage score, ii) reduction in leukocyte infiltration, iii) increase in antioxidant defenses and iv) by downregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in colon tissue homogenates. The strong inhibition of COX-2 expression seems to be a crucial anti-inflammatory mechanism common to both ARF and 5-ASA, but the additional higher abilities of anthocyanins to downregulate iNOS and to decrease leukocytes infiltration and to increase antioxidant defenses in colon may account for the much higher anti-inflammatory action of anthocyanins. These data may contribute to the development of a promising natural approach in IBD management."
https://openalex.org/W2599932526,"Defects in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase or respiratory chain complex IV (CIV) assembly are a frequent cause of human mitochondrial disorders. Specifically, mutations in four conserved assembly factors impinging the biogenesis of the mitochondrion-encoded catalytic core subunit 2 (COX2) result in myopathies. These factors afford stability of newly synthesized COX2 (the dystonia-ataxia syndrome protein COX20), a protein with two transmembrane domains, and maturation of its copper center, CuA (cardiomyopathy proteins SCO1, SCO2, and COA6). COX18 is an additional COX2 assembly factor that belongs to the Oxa1 family of membrane protein insertases. Here, we used a gene-editing approach to generate a human COX18 knock-out HEK293T cell line that displays isolated complete CIV deficiency. We demonstrate that COX20 stabilizes COX2 during insertion of its N-proximal transmembrane domain, and subsequently, COX18 transiently interacts with COX2 to promote translocation across the inner membrane of the COX2 C-tail that contains the apo-CuA site. The release of COX18 from this complex coincides with the binding of the SCO1-SCO2-COA6 copper metallation module to COX2-COX20 to finalize COX2 biogenesis. Therefore, COX18 is a new candidate when screening for mitochondrial disorders associated with isolated CIV deficiency.

We demonstrate that COX20 stabilizes COX2 during insertion of its N-proximal transmembrane domain, and subsequently, COX18 transiently interacts with COX2 to promote translocation across the inner membrane of the COX2 C-tail that contains the apo-CuA site. The release of COX18 from this complex coincides with the binding of the SCO1-SCO2-COA6 copper metallation module to COX2-COX20 to finalize COX2 biogenesis. Therefore, COX18 is a new candidate when screening for mitochondrial disorders associated with isolated CIV deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2603026029,"Effective management of protected sea turtle populations requires knowledge not only of mean values for demographic and life-history parameters, but also temporal and spatial trends, variability, and underlying causes. For endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys kempii), the need for baseline information of this type has been emphasized during attempts to understand causes underlying the recent truncation in the recovery trajectory for nesting females. To provide insight into variability in age and size at sexual maturation (ASM and SSM) and long-term growth patterns likely to influence population trends, we conducted skeletochronological analysis of humerus bones from 333 Kemp’s ridleys stranded throughout the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) from 1993 to 2010. Ranges of possible ASMs (6.8 to 21.8 yr) and SSMs (53.3 to 68.3 cm straightline carapace length (SCL)) estimated using the “rapprochement” skeletal growth mark associated with maturation were broad, supporting incorporation of a maturation schedule in Kemp’s ridley population models. Mean ASMs estimated from rapprochement and by fitting logistic, generalized additive mixed, and von Bertalanffy growth models to age and growth data ranged from 11 to 13 yr; confidence intervals for the logistic model predicted maturation of 95% of the population between 11.9 and 14.8 yr. Early juvenile somatic growth rates in the GOM were greater than those previously reported for the Atlantic, indicating potential for differences in maturation trajectories between regions. Finally, long-term, significant decreases in somatic growth response were found for both juveniles and adults, which could influence recruitment to the reproductive population and observed nesting population trends."
https://openalex.org/W2598902957,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) catalyzes the reversible NADP+-dependent conversion of isocitrate (ICT) to α-ketoglutarate (αKG) in the cytosol and peroxisomes. Mutations in IDH1 have been implicated in >80% of lower grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas and primarily affect residue 132, which helps coordinate substrate binding. However, other mutations found in the active site have also been identified in tumors. IDH1 mutations typically result in a loss of catalytic activity, but many also can catalyze a new reaction, the NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG to d-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG). D2HG is a proposed oncometabolite that can competitively inhibit αKG-dependent enzymes. Some kinetic parameters have been reported for several IDH1 mutations, and there is evidence that mutant IDH1 enzymes vary widely in their ability to produce D2HG. We report that most IDH1 mutations identified in tumors are severely deficient in catalyzing the normal oxidation reaction, but that D2HG production efficiency varies among mutant enzymes up to ∼640-fold. Common IDH1 mutations have moderate catalytic efficiencies for D2HG production, whereas rarer mutations exhibit either very low or very high efficiencies. We then designed a series of experimental IDH1 mutants to understand the features that support D2HG production. We show that this new catalytic activity observed in tumors is supported by mutations at residue 132 that have a smaller van der Waals volume and are more hydrophobic. We report that one mutation can support both the normal and neomorphic reactions. These studies illuminate catalytic features of mutations found in the majority of patients with lower grade gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2600136923,"Lipodystrophy is a rare disorder characterized by complete or partial loss of adipose tissue. Patients with lipodystrophy exhibit hypertriglyceridemia, severe insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Efforts to ameliorate NASH in lipodystrophies with pharmacologic agents have met with limited success. We examined whether a controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP) that produces mild liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupling could decrease hypertriglyceridemia and reverse NASH and diabetes in a mouse model (fatless AZIP/F-1 mice) of severe lipodystrophy and diabetes. After 4 wk of oral CRMP (2 mg/kg body weight per day) or vehicle treatment, mice underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps combined with radiolabeled glucose to assess liver and muscle insulin responsiveness and tissue lipid measurements. CRMP treatment reversed hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance in liver and skeletal muscle. Reversal of insulin resistance could be attributed to reductions in diacylglycerol content and reduced PKC-ε and PKC-θ activity in liver and muscle respectively. CRMP treatment also reversed NASH as reflected by reductions in plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations; hepatic steatosis; and hepatic expression of IL-1α, -β, -2, -4, -6, -10, -12, CD69, and caspase 3 and attenuated activation of the IRE-1α branch of the unfolded protein response. Taken together, these results provide proof of concept for the development of liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupling agents as a potential novel therapy for lipodystrophy-associated hypertriglyceridemia, NASH and diabetes.-Abulizi, A., Perry, R.

https://openalex.org/W2601487509,"Autophagy is known to be involved in viral infection. However, the relationship between autophagy and viral infection has not been characterized. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), important regulators of gene transcription, play central roles in many biologic processes, including autophagy and viral infection. It was therefore of interest to investigate the miRNAs regulating viral infection and host autophagy. In this study the viral infection (white spot syndrome virus, WSSV) correlated positively with the host autophagy in shrimp. Two host miRNAs (miR-71 and -13b) had significant effects on viral infection and host autophagy. MiR-71 regulated the viral infection and host autophagy by targeting the host calcification-associated peptide-1 (cap-1) gene. MiR-13b targeted the host knickkopf gene to simultaneously regulate viral infection and host autophagy. When the expressions of miR-71 and -13b were silenced in shrimp, the autophagy could not be induced by WSSV infection and the autophagy induction did not influence the virus replication, indicating that miR-71 and -13b were necessary for the viral infection and host autophagy. In this context, the findings of this study revealed a novel mechanism of miRNAs bridging the viral infection and host autophagy in vivo.—He, Y., Sun, Y., Zhang, X.

https://openalex.org/W2601668927,"Captive flatfishes, such as the Senegalese sole, typically produce very low volumes of sperm. This situation is particularly prevalent in the first generation (F1) of reared sole males, which limits the development of artificial fertilization methods and the implementation of selective breeding programs. In this study, we investigated whether combined treatments with homologous recombinant follicle-stimulating (rFsh) and luteinizing (rLh) hormones, produced in a mammalian host system, could stimulate spermatogenesis and enhance sperm production in Senegalese sole F1 males. In an initial autumn/winter experiment, weekly intramuscular injections with increasing doses of rFsh over 9 weeks resulted in the stimulation of gonad weight, androgen release, germ cell proliferation and entry into meiosis, and the expression of different spermatogenesis-related genes, whereas a subsequent single rLh injection potentiated spermatozoa differentiation. In a second late winter/spring trial corresponding to the sole’s natural prespawning and spawning periods, we tested the effect of repeated rLh injections on the amount and quality of sperm produced by males previously treated with rFsh for 4, 6, 8 or 10 weeks. These latter results showed that the combination of rFsh and rLh treatments could increase sperm production up to 7 times, and slightly improve the motility of the spermatozoa, although a high variability in the response was found. However, sustained administration of rFsh during spawning markedly diminished Leydig cell survival and the steroidogenic potential of the testis. These data suggest that in vivo application of rFsh and rLh is effective at stimulating spermatogenesis and sperm production in Senegalese sole F1 males, setting the basis for the future establishment of recombinant gonadotropin-based hormone therapies to ameliorate reproductive dysfunctions of this species."
https://openalex.org/W2597562261,"Na+/H+ antiporters are located in the cytoplasmic and intracellular membranes and play crucial roles in regulating intracellular pH, Na+, and volume. The NhaA antiporter of Escherichia coli is the best studied member of the Na+/H+ exchanger family and a model system for all related Na+/H+ exchangers, including eukaryotic representatives. Several amino acid residues are important for the transport activity of NhaA, including Lys-300, a residue that has recently been proposed to carry one of the two H+ ions that NhaA exchanges for one Na+ ion during one transport cycle. Here, we sought to characterize the effects of mutating Lys-300 of NhaA to amino acid residues containing side chains of different polarity and length (i.e. Ala, Arg, Cys, His, Glu, and Leu) on transporter stability and function. Salt resistance assays, acridine-orange fluorescence dequenching, solid supported membrane-based electrophysiology, and differential scanning fluorometry were used to characterize Na+ and H+ transport, charge translocation, and thermal stability of the different variants. These studies revealed that NhaA could still perform electrogenic Na+/H+ exchange even in the absence of a protonatable residue at the Lys-300 position. However, all mutants displayed lower thermal stability and reduced ion transport activity compared with the wild-type enzyme, indicating the critical importance of Lys-300 for optimal NhaA structural stability and function. On the basis of these experimental data, we propose a tentative mechanism integrating the functional and structural role of Lys-300."
https://openalex.org/W2599513296,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) are a promising platform for cardiac studies in vitro , and possibly for tissue repair in humans. However, hiPSC-CM cells tend to retain morphology, metabolism, patterns of gene expression, and electrophysiology similar to that of embryonic cardiomyocytes. We grew hiPSC-CM in patterned islands of different sizes and shapes, and measured the effect of island geometry on action potential waveform and calcium dynamics using optical recordings of voltage and calcium from 970 islands of different sizes. hiPSC-CM in larger islands showed electrical and calcium dynamics indicative of greater functional maturity. We then compared transcriptional signatures of the small and large islands against a developmental time course of cardiac differentiation. Although island size had little effect on expression of most genes whose levels differed between hiPSC-CM and adult primary CM, we identified a subset of genes for which island size drove the majority (58%) of the changes associated with functional maturation. Finally, we patterned hiPSC-CM on islands with a variety of shapes to probe the relative contributions of soluble factors, electrical coupling, and direct cell-cell contacts to the functional maturation. Collectively, our data show that optical electrophysiology is a powerful tool for assaying hiPSC-CM maturation, and that island size powerfully drives activation of a subset of genes involved in cardiac maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2601611846,"Although sponges are important components of benthic ecosystems of the Caribbean Sea, their diversity remained poorly investigated in the Lesser Antilles. By organizing a training course in Martinique, we wanted both to promote taxonomy and to provide a first inventory of the sponge diversity on this island. The course was like a naturalist expedition, with a field laboratory and a classroom nearby. Early-career scientists and environmental managers were trained in sponge taxonomy. We gathered unpublished data and conducted an inventory at 13 coastal sites. We explored only shallow water habitats (0–30 m), such as mangroves, reefs or rocky bottoms and underwater caves. According to this study, the sponge fauna of Martinique is currently represented by a minimum of 191 species, 134 of which we could assign species names. One third of the remaining non-identified sponge species we consider to be new to science. Martinique appears very remarkable because of its littoral marine fauna harboring sponge aggregations with high biomass and species diversity dominating over coral species. In mangroves, sponges cover about 10% of the surface of subtidal roots. Several submarine caves are true reservoirs of hidden and insufficiently described sponge diversity. Thanks to this new collaborative effort, the Eastern Caribbean has gained a significant increase of knowledge, with sponge diversity of this area potentially representing 40% of the total in the Caribbean Sea. We thus demonstrated the importance of developing exploratory and educational research in areas historically devoid of biodiversity inventories and systematics studies. Finally, we believe in the necessity to consider not only the number of species but their distribution in space to evaluate their putative contribution to ecosystem services and our willingness to preserve them."
https://openalex.org/W2598593317,"Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is a key player in resolution of inflammation and a mediator of glucocorticoid actions. In atherosclerotic tissue, increased expression of AnxA1 has been associated with protective plaque-stabilizing effects. Here, we investigated the expression of AnxA1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Blood was collected from 57 patients with stable CAD (SCAD) and 41 healthy controls. We also included a minor group (n = 10) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). AnxA1 mRNA was measured in PBMCs. Expression of AnxA1 protein (total and surface-bound) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) were detected in PBMC subsets by flow cytometry. Also, salivary cortisol, interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-10 in plasma, and LPS-induced cytokine secretion from PBMCs, with or without dexamethasone, were assessed. AnxA1 mRNA was found to be slightly increased in PBMCs from SCAD patients compared with controls. However, protein expression of AnxA1 or GRs in PBMC subsets did not differ between SCAD patients and controls, despite SCAD patients showing a more proinflammatory cytokine profile ex vivo. Only surface expression of AnxA1 on monocytes correlated with dexamethasone-mediated suppression of cytokines. In ACS patients, a marked activation of AnxA1 was seen involving both gene expression and translocation of protein to cell surface probably reflecting a rapid glucocorticoid action modulating the acute inflammatory response in ACS. To conclude, surface expression of AnxA1 on monocytes may reflect the degree of glucocorticoid sensitivity. Speculatively, ""normal"" surface expression of AnxA1 indicates that anti-inflammatory capacity is impaired in SCAD patients."

Our previous study showed interferon (IFN)-γ and CD3 T cell impairment in patients with severe cavitary pulmonary TB (PTB). However, the cause of the change in immune responses during the progression of TB is still poorly understood. In this study, eight newly diagnosed patients with severe cavitary and mild lesion non-cavity PTB were recruited, and three healthy volunteers were recruited as the control. RNA extracted from blood was tested by whole genome oligo microarrays. A PCR array was used to further test the same samples. Two additional groups of patients were recruited according to the same criteria with healthy control(HC) recruited as well and subjected to peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation (PBMC)and analysis of TCF-7, β-catenin, cyclin D2, IFN-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression in CD14- cells (lymphocytes) and CD14+ cells by quantitative PCR. The changes of expression of β-catenin, CD69+ and IFN-γ by CD3+, CD14- and CD14+ cells in vitro with stimulation of LiCl were tested by flow cytometry. Whole genome oligo microarrays showed a significant decrease in expression of the Wnt signaling pathway in severe PTB patients. Further analysis of the Wnt pathway by PCR array indicated that TCF-7, β-catenin, and cyclin D2 expression was significantly reduced in severe PTB patients compared with mild PTB patients. In the additionally recruited patients, TCF-7, β-catenin, and cyclin D2 were expressed in both CD14+ and CD14- cells, while β-catenin was decreased significantly in CD14- cells compared with CD14+ cells in severe PTB patients, and IFN-γ and TNF-α expression in CD14- cells was also reduced significantly in severe PTB patients. β-catenin can directly trigger T cell activation and IFN-γsecretion in PBMCs stimulated for 24 hours. These findings indicate that Wnt pathway and its key genes, such as β-catenin, were impaired in blood cells of patients with severe PTB. Therefore, Wnt/β-catenin pathway is closely associated with T cell proliferation and TB lesion deterioration."

Although the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and SSD still remains poorly understood, a set of studies have found that many same genetic factors play important roles in the etiology of these two disorders. Nowadays, the differential gene expression between MDD and SSD is still unknown. In our previous study, we compared the expression profile and made the classification with the leukocytes by using whole-genome cRNA microarrays among drug-free first-episode subjects with SSD, MDD and matched healthy controls (8 subjects in each group), and finally determined 48 gene expression signatures. Based on these findings, we further clarify whether these genes mRNA was different expressed in peripheral blood in patients with SSD, MDD and healthy controls (60 subjects respectively).With the help of the quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we gained gene relative expression levels among the three groups.We found that there are three of the forty eight co-regulated genes had differential expression in peripheral blood among the three groups, which are CD84, STRN, CTNS gene (F = 3.528, p = 0.034; F = 3.382, p = 0.039; F = 3.801, p = 0.026, respectively) while there were no significant differences for other genes.CD84, STRN, CTNS gene may have significant value for performing diagnostic functions and classifying SSD, MDD and healthy controls."
https://openalex.org/W2599208884,"Objective To assess the impact of maintenance nifedipine therapy on pregnancy duration in women with preterm placenta previa bleeding. Methods PPADAL was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between 05/2008 and 05/2012 in five French hospitals. The trial included 109 women, aged ≥ 18 years, with at least one episode of placenta previa bleeding, intact membranes and no other pregnancy complication, at gestational age 24 to 34 weeks and after 48 hours of complete acute tocolysis. Women were randomly allocated to receive either 20 mg of slow-release nifedipine three times daily (n = 54) or placebo (n = 55) until 36 + 6 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome for the trial was length of pregnancy measured in days after enrolment. Main secondary outcomes were rates of recurrent bleeding, cesarean delivery due to hemorrhage, blood transfusion, maternal side effects, gestational age at delivery and adverse perinatal outcomes (perinatal death, chronic lung disease, neonatal sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage > grade 2, perventricular leukomalacia > grade 1, or necrotizing enterocolitis). Analysis was by intention to treat. Results Mean (SD) prolongation of pregnancy was not different between the nifedipine (n = 54) and the placebo (n = 55) group; 42.5 days ± 23.8 versus 44.2 days ± 24.5, p = 0.70. Cesarean due to hemorrhage performed before 37 weeks occurred more frequently in the nifedipine group in comparison with the placebo group (RR, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–2.72). Adverse perinatal outcomes were comparable between groups; 3.8% for nifedipine versus 5.5% for placebo (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval 0.10–2.61). No maternal mortality or perinatal death occurred. Conclusion Maintenance oral nifedipine neither prolongs duration of pregnancy nor improves maternal or perinatal outcomes.

Patients with hepatitis C coinfection, liver transplantation or presence of conditions that limit liver (LSM) or spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) were excluded. Blood tests, abdominal ultrasound, SSM and LSM by transient elastography (FibroScan®) were performed at the same day. Alcohol consumption was quantified using the AUDIT score and c-ACLD was defined by LSM ≥ 15 kPa performed by an experimented operator blinded for clinical and laboratory data.101 patients were eligible and few patients were excluded due to negative anti-HDV (n = 7), hepatitis C coinfection (n = 2), liver transplantation (n = 10) and limitation for LSM or SSM (n = 5). Therefore, 77 patients [61% male, age = 43 (IQR,36-52) years] were included. The prevalence of c-ACLD was 57% (n = 44/77). Patients with c-ACLD had a higher rate of detectable HBV viral load (p = 0.039), higher levels of transaminases, GGT, alkaline phosphatases, total bilirubin and INR (p<0.001 for all), as well as lower platelet count and albumin levels (p>0.001 for both) compared to those without c-ACLD. Patients with c-ACLD had higher SSM [65.2 (IQR,33.8-75.0) vs 21.8 (16.5-32.0) kPa; p<0.001] and higher splenic volume [475 (IQR,311-746) vs 154 (112-283) cm3; p<0.001] compared to those without. Detectable HBV viral load (>10 UI/ml), alkaline phosphatase (per IU/L) and GGT levels (per IU/L) were independently associated with c-ACLD in all multivariate models. Splenic volume [per cm3,OR = 1.01 (95%CI,1.01-1.02);p = 0.002], SSM [per kPa, OR = 1.04 (1.01-1.07);p = 0.012] and splenomegaly [yes vs no,OR = 28.45 (4.42-182.95);p<0.001] were independently associated with c-ACLD.The prevalence of c-ACLD was high in patients with chronic HDV infection in western Amazon basin.

This vaccine has a unique feature of time-dependent protection: macaques are not protected at 3-5 weeks post vaccination (WPV), whereas immune protection emerges between 15 and 20 WPV. Although the exact mechanisms of the time-dependent protection remain incompletely understood, studies suggested that both cellular and humoral immunities contribute to this time-dependent protection. To further elucidate the mechanisms of protection induced by SIVΔnef, we longitudinally compared the global gene expression profiles of SIV Gag-CM9+ CD8+ (Gag-specific CD8+) T cells from peripheral blood of Mamu-A*01+ rhesus macaques at 3 and 20 WPV using rhesus microarray. We found that gene expression profiles of Gag-specific CD8+ T cells at 20 WPV are qualitatively different from those at 3 WPV. At 20 WPV, the most significant transcriptional changes of Gag-specific CD8+ T cells were genes involved in TCR signaling, differentiation and maturation toward central memory cells, with increased expression of CCR7, TCRα, TCRβ, CD28 and decreased expression of CTLA-4, IFN-γ, RANTES, granzyme A and B. Our study suggests that a higher quality of SIV-specific CD8+ T cells elicited by SIVΔnef over time contributes to the maturation of time-dependent protection."
