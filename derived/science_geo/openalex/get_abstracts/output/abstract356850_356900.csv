https://openalex.org/W2060004514,"The cellular innate immune system is essential for recognizing pathogen infection and for establishing effective host defence. But critical molecular determinants responsible for facilitating an appropriate immune response-following infection with DNA and RNA viruses, for example-remain to be identified. Here we report the identification, following expression cloning, of a molecule (STING; stimulator of interferon genes) that appears essential for effective innate immune signalling processes. It comprises five putative transmembrane regions, predominantly resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and is able to activate both NF-kappaB and IRF3 transcription pathways to induce expression of type I interferon (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta ) and exert a potent anti-viral state following expression. In contrast, loss of STING rendered murine embryonic fibroblasts extremely susceptible to negative-stranded virus infection, including vesicular stomatitis virus. Further, STING ablation abrogated the ability of intracellular B-form DNA, as well as members of the herpesvirus family, to induce IFN-beta, but did not significantly affect the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that STING interacts with RIG-I and with SSR2 (also known as TRAPbeta), which is a member of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex required for protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane following translation. Ablation by RNA interference of both TRAPbeta and translocon adaptor SEC61beta was subsequently found to inhibit STING's ability to stimulate expression of IFN-beta. Thus, as well as identifying a regulator of innate immune signalling, our results imply a potential role for the translocon in innate signalling pathways activated by select viruses as well as intracellular DNA."

Here we show that senescent cells accumulate in murine livers treated to produce fibrosis, a precursor pathology to cirrhosis. The senescent cells are derived primarily from activated hepatic stellate cells, which initially proliferate in response to liver damage and produce the extracellular matrix deposited in the fibrotic scar. In mice lacking key senescence regulators, stellate cells continue to proliferate, leading to excessive liver fibrosis. Furthermore, senescent activated stellate cells exhibit gene expression profile consistent with cell-cycle exit, reduced secretion of extracellular matrix components, enhanced secretion of extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, and enhanced immune surveillance. Accordingly natural killer cells preferentially kill senescent activated stellate cells in vitro and in vivo, thereby facilitating the resolution of fibrosis. Therefore, the senescence program limits the fibrogenic response to acute tissue damage.

Therefore, the senescence program limits the fibrogenic response to acute tissue damage. Cellular senescence is a stable form of cell-cycle arrest that may limit the proliferative potential of premalignant cells (Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Cellular senescence: when bad things happen to good cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). Initially defined by the phenotype of human fibroblasts undergoing replicative exhaustion in culture (Hayflick and Moorhead, 1961Hayflick L. Moorhead P.S. The serial cultivation of human diploid cell strains.Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5003) Google Scholar), senescence can be triggered in many cell types in response to diverse forms of cellular damage or stress (Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F.

Although once considered a tissue culture phenomenon, recent studies demonstrate that cellular senescence imposes a potent barrier to tumorigenesis and contributes to the cytotoxicity of certain anticancer agents (Braig et al., 2005Braig M.

Interestingly, senescent cells have also been observed in certain aged or damaged tissues; however, the functional contribution of cellular senescence to noncancer pathologies has not been examined. Senescent cells display a large flattened morphology and accumulate a senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity that distinguishes them from most quiescent cells (Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Cellular senescence: when bad things happen to good cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). In addition, they often downregulate genes involved in proliferation and extracellular matrix production and upregulate inflammatory cytokines and other molecules known to modulate the microenvironment or immune response (Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F.

Replicative senescence of activated human hepatic stellate cells is accompanied by a pronounced inflammatory but less fibrogenic phenotype.Hepatology. 2003; 37: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of cellular senescence as a barrier to malignant transformation, senescent cells activate the p53 and p16/Rb tumor suppressor pathways (Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Cellular senescence: when bad things happen to good cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar, Collado et al., 2007Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cellular senescence in cancer and aging.Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). p53 promotes senescence by transactivating genes that inhibit proliferation, including the p21/Cip1/Waf1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and miR-34 class of microRNAs (He et al., 2007He L. He X. Lowe S.W. Hannon G.J. microRNAs join the p53 network–another piece in the tumour-suppression puzzle.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In contrast, p16INK4a promotes senescence by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4, thereby preventing Rb phosphorylation and allowing Rb to promote a repressive heterochromatin environment that silences certain proliferation-associated genes (Narita et al., 2003Narita M. Nunez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Rb-mediated heterochromatin formation and silencing of E2F target genes during cellular senescence.Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Although the p53 and p16/Rb pathways act in parallel to promote senescence, their relative contribution to the program can be cell type dependent (Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Cellular senescence: when bad things happen to good cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). Although senescent cells can remain viable in culture indefinitely, their fate in tissue is not well characterized. On one hand, benign melanocytic nevi (moles) are highly enriched for senescent cells yet can exist in skin throughout a lifetime (Michaloglou et al., 2005Michaloglou C. Vredeveld L.C. Soengas M.S. Denoyelle C. Kuilman T. van der Horst C.M. Majoor D.M. Shay J.W. Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. BRAFE600-associated senescence-like cell cycle arrest of human naevi.Nature. 2005; 436: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar), implying that senescent cells can be stably incorporated into tissue. On the other hand, liver carcinoma cells induced to undergo senescence in vivo can be cleared by components of the innate immune system leading to tumor regression (Xue et al., 2007Xue W. Zender L. Miething C. Dickins R.A. Hernando E. Krizhanovsky V. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Senescence and tumour clearance is triggered by p53 restoration in murine liver carcinomas.Nature. 2007; 445: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Therefore, in some circumstances, senescent cells can turn over in vivo. Liver cirrhosis is a major health problem worldwide (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar) and the 12th most common cause of death in the United States (NCHS, 2004National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). (2004). National Vital Statistics Report. Chronic liver disease/cirrhosis. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/FASTATS/liverdis.htm.Google Scholar). Liver fibrosis acts as a precursor to cirrhosis and is triggered by chronic liver damage produced by hepatitis virus infection, alcohol abuse, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, fatty liver disease). The hepatic stellate cell (HSC, also called Ito cell) is a key cell type that contributes to liver fibrosis. Upon liver damage, HSCs become “activated”—i.e., they differentiate into myofibroblasts, proliferate, and produce the network of extracellular matrix that is the hallmark of the fibrotic scar (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar). Following acute damage, activated HSCs probably support hepatocyte proliferation and organ repair (Passino et al., 2007Passino M.A. Adams R.A. Sikorski S.L. Akassoglou K. Regulation of hepatic stellate cell differentiation by the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR.Science. 2007; 315: 1853-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); however, during chronic damage the excessive extracellular matrix produced by these cells disrupts liver cytoarchitecture leading eventually to cirrhosis and liver failure (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar). SA-β-gal-positive cells have been observed in cirrhotic livers of human patients (Wiemann et al., 2002Wiemann S.U. Satyanarayana A. Tsahuridu M. Tillmann H.L. Zender L. Klempnauer J. Flemming P. Franco S. Blasco M.A. Manns M.P. Rudolph K.L. Hepatocyte telomere shortening and senescence are general markers of human liver cirrhosis.FASEB J. 2002; 16: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), although the nature of these putative senescent cells and their impact on liver biology are not known. To study the potential role of cellular senescence in liver cirrhosis, we used a well-established mouse model where fibrosis is produced by chronic treatment with CCl4, a liver-damaging agent (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar). We examined the accumulation of senescent cells following CCl4 treatment, as well as their fate following CCl4 withdrawal. We also examined the course of liver fibrosis in mutant strains of mice where the senescence program was attenuated by disabling the p53 and/or p16/Rb pathways. Unexpectedly, our results establish that cellular senescence limits the extent of fibrosis following liver damage and underscore the interplay between senescent cells and the tissue microenvironment. To investigate the relationship between fibrosis and cellular senescence, we subjected 7- to 9-week-old female mice to a six week treatment with CCl4, a chemical widely used to induce fibrosis in experimental animals (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar). This protocol produced fibrosis as assessed by staining with Hematoxylin-Eosin and Sirius Red, which directly marks the extracellular matrix deposited by activated HSCs (Figure 1A). Approximately 2% of the liver was Sirius Red positive as assessed by quantitative laser scanning cytometry, representing a 3- to 4-fold increase over untreated controls. Furthermore, CCl4 treatment produced a dramatic expansion of activated HSCs, which were visualized by immunofluorescence staining of liver sections for the activated HSC markers desmin and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) (data not shown, see also Figure 2).Figure 2Senescent Cells Are Derived from Activated HSCsShow full caption(A) Senescent cells, identified by p53- and Hmga1-positive staining, express activated HSC markers Desmin and αSMA.

To identify senescent cells in situ, we stained liver sections from CCl4 and vehicle-treated (control) mice for a panel of senescence-associated markers, including SA-β-gal and proteins such as p16, p21, p53, and Hmga1, which have been causally linked to the senescence program (Collado et al., 2007Collado M.

Cells staining positive for SA-β-gal and each senescence-associated protein accumulated in fibrotic livers and were invariably located along the fibrotic scar (Figure 1). These cells typically expressed multiple senescence markers and were not proliferating (only cells with nuclear staining for p21, p53, and Hmga1 were considered positive). For example, of the p21-positive cells identified in fibrotic livers, 87% were positive for p53 immunostaining and 90% were positive for Hmga1 staining (Figure 1B), whereas only 8% coexpressed the proliferation-association marker Ki67 despite a general increase in the frequency of Ki67-positive cells (Figure 1B). Of note, these senescence markers were not expressed in control livers (Figure 1B, data not shown). Moreover, senescent cells also accumulated in livers derived from mice treated with DDC (3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine), another agent that produces liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (data not shown). Although hepatocytes represent the most abundant cell type in the liver, the location of senescent cells along the fibrotic scar in both human (Wiemann et al., 2002Wiemann S.U. Satyanarayana A. Tsahuridu M. Tillmann H.L. Zender L. Klempnauer J. Flemming P. Franco S. Blasco M.A. Manns M.P. Rudolph K.L. Hepatocyte telomere shortening and senescence are general markers of human liver cirrhosis.FASEB J. 2002; 16: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and mouse (Figure 1B) livers raised the possibility that these cells were derived from activated HSCs, which initially proliferate following liver damage and are responsible for much of the extracellular matrix production in fibrosis. Accordingly, in mouse fibrotic liver sections, the cells that stained positive for the senescence-associated markers p53 and Hmga1 were also positive for the HSC markers desmin and αSMA, and, in serial sections, most SA-β-gal-positive cells also expressed αSMA (Figure 2B). Similarly, in serial sections obtained from human cirrhotic livers, cells expressing the senescence markers p21 and p16 colocalized with those expressing αSMA (Figure 2C). Therefore, senescent-activated HSCs accumulate in fibrotic livers. Hepatic stellate cells initially proliferate in response to liver damage, and so it was not obvious how their senescence would ultimately influence the progression of fibrosis. Since p53 contributes to cellular senescence in most murine tissues (Collado et al., 2007Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cellular senescence in cancer and aging.Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar), cells derived from mice lacking p53 often show an enhanced proliferative capacity in culture (Sherr, 1998Sherr C.J. Tumor surveillance via the ARF-p53 pathway.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). To evaluate the biological impact of senescence on liver fibrosis, we initially compared the histopathology of livers obtained from wild-type (WT) and p53−/− mice treated with CCl4. After 6 weeks, livers were examined for fibrosis using Sirius Red staining and expression of Tgfb1, a major cytokine upregulated during fibrosis progression (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, livers derived from p53−/− mice contained significantly more fibrotic tissue relative to WT controls (Figures 3A and 3B and data not shown, p = 0.008) and also displayed an increase in Tgfb1 expression (Figure S1 available online). This increase in fibrosis was associated with an aberrant expansion of activated HSCs as assessed by αSMA expression as a surrogate marker for the abundance of this cell type (Figures 3C and S1). Conversely, livers derived from p53−/− mice treated with CCl4 showed more proliferating cells (Figure S2) and a decrease in SA-β-gal staining compared to WT controls (Figure 3A). These observations suggest that, in the absence of p53, liver damage produces fewer senescent cells, and a corresponding increase in activated HSCs, extracellular matrix deposition, and fibrosis. In many cell types, both the p53 and the p16/Rb pathways contribute to senescence such that cells lacking either pathway alone retain a residual senescence response (Serrano et al., 1997Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Oncogenic ras provokes premature cell senescence associated with accumulation of p53 and p16INK4a.Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3708) Google Scholar). In fact, livers derived from p53−/− mice treated with CCl4 still showed some increase in SA-β-gal-positive cells and retained their ability to upregulate p16 (Figure 3A). Moreover, CCl4 treated livers from INK4a/ARF−/− mice also showed only a partial reduction in senescence (corresponding to an increase in HSCs [Figure 3C] and fibrosis [data not shown]) and still upregulated p53 (data not shown). To determine the impact of disrupting both loci on senescence and fibrosis in the liver, we produced p53−/−;INK4a/ARF−/− compound mutant mice. Since less than 5% of the female double mutant mice reached adulthood, only male animals were used in these experiments. Of note, male mice develop more severe fibrosis than females (compare Figure 4B to Figure 4C; see also Shimizu et al., 2007Shimizu I. Kohno N. Tamaki K. Shono M. Huang H.W. He J.H. Yao D.F. Female hepatology: favorable role of estrogen in chronic liver disease with hepatitis B virus infection.World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 4295-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), making comparisons within the same sex essential. Consistent with the predicted consequences of p53 and INK4a/ARF inactivation on senescence, isolated HSCs from double knockout livers did not senesce in culture, showing much less SA-β-gal activity and much more BrdU incorporation compared to WT cells, which senesced after a few passages (Figures 3D and S3; data not shown). Livers derived from CCl4 treated mice lacking both p53 and INK4a/ARF developed severe fibrosis when compared to WT animals, showing a greater than 50% increase in fibrotic area, wider fibrotic scars, and substantially more scar branching (Figures 3E and 3F). Moreover, double mutant livers contained few SA-β-gal-positive cells (Figure 3E) and harbored a large increase in activated HSCs as determined by αSMA protein (Figure 3G) and mRNA (data not shown, 35-fold relative to controls, p = 0.02) expression. Double knockout animals also developed clearly visible ascites, one of the clinical manifestations of cirrhosis, resulting in significantly wider abdomens compared to controls (Figure S4, p = 0.006). Therefore, activated HSCs lacking both the p53 and INK4a/ARF genes (and thus the ARF/p53 and p16/Rb pathways) fail to senesce and inappropriately expand in response to chronic liver damage, leading to more extracellular matrix production and fibrosis. To confirm that the above phenotypes were a result of impaired senescence in activated HSCs and not other liver cell types, we specifically suppressed p53 expression in HSCs and examined the extent of liver fibrosis and activated HSC proliferation after CCI4 treatment. Transgenic mice harboring a tetracycline response element (TRE) driven short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) capable of efficiently suppressing p53 expression (Dickins et al., 2007Dickins R.A. McJunkin K. Hernando E. Premsrirut P.K. Krizhanovsky V. Burgess D.J. Kim S.Y. Cordon-Cardo C. Zender L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Tissue-specific and reversible RNA interference in transgenic mice.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) were crossed to mice harboring a tTA (tetracycline-controlled transactivator) transgene expressed from the Gfap promoter (Wang et al., 2004Wang J. Lin W. Popko B. Campbell I.L. Inducible production of interferon-gamma in the developing brain causes cerebellar dysplasia with activation of the Sonic hedgehog pathway.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which, in the liver, is HSC specific (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar, Zhuo et al., 2001Zhuo L. Theis M. Alvarez-Maya I. Brenner M. Willecke K. Messing A. hGFAP-cre transgenic mice for manipulation of glial and neuronal function in vivo.Genesis. 2001; 31: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). As the tTA transactivaor binds the TRE promoter in the absence of tetracycline, double-transgenic mice (DTg) should constitutively express the p53 shRNA, which proved to be the case (Figure S5). Consistent with observations in p53 null animals, double-transgenic mice where p53 was suppressed specifically in HSCs developed significantly more fibrosis than controls (Figure 3H, p = 0.0009); moreover, immunofluorescence studies revealed that their livers contained more proliferating HSCs (Ki67- and αSMA-positive) (Figures 3I and 3J). Apparently, the senescence of activated stellate cells limits fibrotic progression. Although the architectural changes that accompany cirrhosis are considered irreversible, it is now evident that fibrosis in patients, even in more advanced stages, can regress following eradication of the disease trigger (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar). Accordingly, liver fibrosis in WT animals resolved within 10 days after stopping CCl4 treatment and was almost undetectable by 20 days (Figure 4A). The frequency of senescent cells in WT livers declined with the reversion of fibrosis, as did the number of HSCs, such that no SA-β-gal-positive cells were detected in 20 day post-treatment livers and the amount of αSMA present dramatically declined. In marked contrast, activated HSCs were clearly retained in livers from p53−/− mice at 20 days post-treatment, and this correlated with an impairment in fibrotic reversion (Figures 4A and 4B, p = 0.014, p = 0.006, 10 or 20 days after the treatment, respectively). Even more fibrotic lesions and activated HSCs were retained in p53−/−;INK4a/ARF−/− mice at this time point (Figures 4C and S6). Consistent with the impaired clearance of fibrotic tissue in the absence of p53, livers derived from p53−/− animals displayed much higher levels of TGFβ and αSMA following CCl4 withdrawal compared to controls, implying that they maintained greater fibrogenic signaling and more activated HSCs (Figure S1). p53−/− livers also retained more proliferating (Ki67-positive) cells than did WT controls (Figure S2), suggesting that p53-deficient activated HSCs can bypass the senescence response, continue to proliferate, and deposit extracellular matrix in the scars. We therefore hypothesized that senescence limits proliferation of activated HSCs and facilitates their clearance from the liver. As a first step toward defining how activated stellate cells undergo senescence and are cleared from tissue, we compared the transcriptional profiles of cultured primary human activated HSCs that were proliferating or triggered to senesce by treatment with a DNA-damaging agent, etoposide. Like IMR-90 normal diploid fibroblasts, a cell type in which senescence has been studied extensively, activated HSCs stopped proliferating, accumulated SA-β-gal activity, and acquired senescence-associated heterochromatic foci within several days of etoposide treatment yet retained the activated HSC markers αSMA, GFAP, and Vimentin (Figure 5A). Thus, by several criteria, etoposide-treated activated HSCs undergo senescence. Gene expression profiling of two different activated HSC preparations was performed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays, and the differentially expressed genes analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) to identify biological processes and pathways that were altered in an unbiased way. Consistent with the proliferative arrest that accompanies senescence, the most significantly overrepresented “Biological Process” term among downregulated genes was “cell cycle” (Table S1, p = 1.72E-21) and included genes necessary for cell-cycle progression, such as CDKN3, CyclinB (CCNB1, CCNB2), CDC20, and the E2F target genes CDC2 (CDC2), CyclinA2 (CCNA2), and Thymidine kinase (TK1). Genes encoding extracellular matrix components were also significantly overrepresented among downregulated genes, including those linked to “extracellular matrix” (Cellular Component term) and “extracellular matrix structural constituent” (Molecular Function term) (p = 3.44E-6 and p = 1.75E-6, respectively). Interestingly, Collagens type I, III, IV and Fibronectin are constituents of the fibrotic scar (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar), and most of these genes were downregulated on our microarray (Figure S7) and quantitative RT-PCR analyses (Figure 5B). These observations suggest that the senescence program limits both the proliferative and fibrogenic potential of activated HSCs. Senescent human fibroblasts also show a pattern of gene expression that involves upregulation of secreted proteases, protease modulators, growth factors, and cytokines, often referred to as the “senescence-associated secretory phenotype” (Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Cellular senescence: when bad things happen to good cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). Similarly, senescent activated HSCs upregulate matrix metalloproteinases, which have fibrolytic activity (Figure 5C). Moreover, these cells upregulate genes related to “extracellular region” and “cytokine activity” (p = 4.18E-12, p = 1.98E-10, respectively)."
https://openalex.org/W2010978319,"Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer that can be inherited, but the genetic aetiology is largely unknown. Here we show that germline mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene explain most hereditary neuroblastomas, and that activating mutations can also be somatically acquired. We first identified a significant linkage signal at chromosome bands 2p23-24 using a whole-genome scan in neuroblastoma pedigrees. Resequencing of regional candidate genes identified three separate germline missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK that segregated with the disease in eight separate families. Resequencing in 194 high-risk neuroblastoma samples showed somatically acquired mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain in 12.4% of samples. Nine of the ten mutations map to critical regions of the kinase domain and were predicted, with high probability, to be oncogenic drivers. Mutations resulted in constitutive phosphorylation, and targeted knockdown of ALK messenger RNA resulted in profound inhibition of growth in all cell lines harbouring mutant or amplified ALK, as well as in two out of six wild-type cell lines for ALK. Our results demonstrate that heritable mutations of ALK are the main cause of familial neuroblastoma, and that germline or acquired activation of this cell-surface kinase is a tractable therapeutic target for this lethal paediatric malignancy."

Detection of foreign nucleic acids is an ancient form of host defense. In vertebrates, nucleic acid detection activates a program of antiviral defense designed to neutralize the spread of infection. This antiviral program is coordinated by type I interferons (IFNs), which direct a multifaceted response to restrict viral replication within infected cells, alert neighboring cells to the presence of infection, and expand effector lymphocytes to provide long-term and specific protection against the virus (Stark et al., 1998Stark G.R.

Type I interferons in host defense.Immunity. 2006; 25: 373-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Two complementary systems link nucleic acid detection to the IFN-mediated antiviral response. One system consists of several Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are transmembrane sensors expressed on sentinel immune cells that sample endosomal cargo for nucleic acids (Takeda et al., 2003Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Toll-like receptors.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4551) Google Scholar). As such, TLRs comprise a non-cell-autonomous mechanism whereby uninfected immune cells sense viral infection by detecting free viral particles or viral nucleic acids within phagocytosed apoptotic cells (Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007Pichlmair A. Reis e Sousa C. Innate recognition of viruses.Immunity. 2007; 27: 370-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). A second, more broadly expressed system detects viral nucleic acids within the infected cell itself. This system is exemplified by the cytosolic RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA5, which signal activation of a cell-intrinsic antiviral response through the adaptor protein IPS-1 (also known as MAVS, CARDIF, or VISA; reviewed by Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007Pichlmair A. Reis e Sousa C. Innate recognition of viruses.Immunity. 2007; 27: 370-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar. Recently, a cytosolic antiviral pathway that detects DNA was described (Ishii et al., 2006Ishii K.J. Coban C. Kato H. Takahashi K. Torii Y. Takeshita F. Ludwig H. Sutter G. Suzuki K.

This system, termed the IFN-stimulatory DNA (ISD) response, is analogous to the RIG-I and MDA5 RNA helicases in that it is cell intrinsic. However, the ISD pathway engages a distinct signaling cascade that is IPS-1-independent (Kumar et al., 2006Kumar H. Kawai T. Kato H. Sato S. Takahashi K. Coban C. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Ishii K.J.

Wang Z. Choi M.K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Ban T. Lu Y. Miyagishi M. Kodama T. Honda K. et al.DAI (DLM-1/ZBP1) is a cytosolic DNA sensor and an activator of innate immune response.Nature. 2007; 448: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Although little is known about the upstream signaling events that distinguish the ISD response from RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated RNA recognition, both pathways activate potent type I IFN production through the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (Ishii et al., 2006Ishii K.J.

Recognition of cytosolic DNA activates an IRF3-dependent innate immune response.Immunity. 2006; 24: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Together, these two types of nucleic acid detection systems—TLRs and cytosolic sensors—account for essentially all IFN-mediated antiviral immunity (Koyama et al., 2007Koyama S. Ishii K.J. Kumar H. Tanimoto T. Coban C. Uematsu S. Kawai T. Akira S. Differential role of TLR- and RLR-signaling in the immune responses to influenza A virus infection and vaccination.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4711-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, discrimination of viral from self-nucleic acids is imperfect, and recent studies have shown that defective clearance of self-derived nucleic acids can cause severe, IFN-associated autoimmunity. For example, deficiency for the extracellular DNase I causes a lupus-like syndrome in mice (Napirei et al., 2000Napirei M. Karsunky H. Zevnik B. Stephan H. Mannherz H.G. Moroy T. Features of systemic lupus erythematosus in Dnase1-deficient mice.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), and DNase I mutations in humans are associated with lupus (Yasutomo et al., 2001Yasutomo K. Horiuchi T. Kagami S. Tsukamoto H. Hashimura C. Urushihara M. Kuroda Y. Mutation of DNASE1 in people with systemic lupus erythematosus.Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 313-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). One major mechanism by which these extracellular nucleic acids cause autoimmunity is through activation of TLRs on autoreactive B cells (Leadbetter et al., 2002Leadbetter E.A. Rifkin I.R. Hohlbaum A.M. Beaudette B.C. Shlomchik M.J. Marshak-Rothstein A. Chromatin-IgG complexes activate B cells by dual engagement of IgM and Toll-like receptors.Nature. 2002; 416: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). TLR7 and TLR9 are important for autoantibody production in a murine model of lupus (Christensen et al., 2006Christensen S.R. Shupe J. Nickerson K. Kashgarian M. Flavell R.A. Shlomchik M.J.

Deane J.A. Difilippantonio M.J. Tarasenko T. Satterthwaite A.B. Bolland S. Autoreactive B cell responses to RNA-related antigens due to TLR7 gene duplication.Science. 2006; 312: 1669-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, Subramanian et al., 2006Subramanian S.

USA. 2006; 103: 9970-9975Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). A complex of extracellular DNA and the antimicrobial peptide LL37 activates TLR9-dependent IFN production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in human psoriasis (Lande et al., 2007Lande R. Gregorio J. Facchinetti V. Chatterjee B. Wang Y.H. Homey B. Cao W. Wang Y.H. Su B. Nestle F.O. et al.Plasmacytoid dendritic cells sense self-DNA coupled with antimicrobial peptide.Nature. 2007; 449: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Notably, liver macrophages in mice lacking the lysosomal DNase II become engorged with the ejected nuclei of erythrocyte precursors and develop a TLR-independent IFN response to this undigested DNA (Okabe et al., 2005Okabe Y. Kawane K. Akira S. Taniguchi T. Nagata S. Toll-like receptor-independent gene induction program activated by mammalian DNA escaped from apoptotic DNA degradation.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Yoshida et al., 2005Yoshida H. Okabe Y. Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Nagata S. Lethal anemia caused by interferon-beta produced in mouse embryos carrying undigested DNA.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Importantly, all of these examples involve non-cell-autonomous mechanisms in that the source of the accumulated nucleic acids is distinct from the cells that detect them. In contrast, it is unclear whether accumulation of self-nucleic acids within cells can activate cytosolic sensors, because a situation where this occurs has not yet been identified. Given the importance of these cell-intrinsic nucleic acid sensors in antiviral defense, a number of fundamental questions regarding the principles of self-/non-self discrimination arise. Specifically, are there dedicated mechanisms that limit excessive activation of cytosolic nucleic acid sensors? What happens when these mechanisms break down? In addition, can cell-intrinsic nucleic acid detection cause autoimmunity if improperly controlled? Here, we developed an approach to isolate proteins relevant to the ISD response and identified 3′ repair exonuclease 1 (Trex1) as an ISD binding protein. Trex1 is the most abundant 3′→5′ DNA exonuclease in cells (Hoss et al., 1999Hoss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Lindahl T.

Loss of function mutations in the human Trex1 gene cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS; Crow et al., 2006aCrow Y.J. Hayward B.E. Parmar R. Robins P. Leitch A. Ali M. Black D.N. van Bokhoven H. Brunner H.G. Hamel B.C. et al.Mutations in the gene encoding the 3′-5′DNA exonuclease TREX1 cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome at the AGS1 locus.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 917-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). AGS presents in infancy as a severe encephalitis with intracranial calcifications, lymphocyte infiltrates, and elevated type I IFN levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and demyelination of motor neurons with accompanying psychomotor retardation (Rice et al., 2007bRice G. Patrick T. Parmar R. Taylor C.F. Aeby A. Aicardi J. Artuch R. Montalto S.A. Bacino C.A. Barroso B. et al.Clinical and molecular phenotype of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 81: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Many of these symptoms resemble those caused by congenitally acquired infection with cytomegalovirus or rubella virus (Crow et al., 2003Crow Y.J. Black D.N. Ali M. Bond J. Jackson A.P. Lefson M. Michaud J. Roberts E. Stephenson J.B. Woods C.G. Lebon P.

Different Trex1 mutations also cause monogenic chilblain lupus, and are found more frequently in people with systemic lupus erythematosus than in healthy individuals, suggesting that a common mechanism may underlie these disorders (Alarcon-Riquelme, 2006Alarcon-Riquelme M.E.

Genet. 2007; 80: 811-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Trex1-deficient mice exhibit dramatically reduced postnatal survival; the principal cause of mortality in these mice is circulatory failure caused by inflammatory myocarditis (Morita et al., 2004Morita M. Stamp G. Robins P. Dulic A. Rosewell I. Hrivnak G. Daly G. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Gene-targeted mice lacking the Trex1 (DNase III) 3′→5′ DNA exonuclease develop inflammatory myocarditis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6719-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Despite the emerging evidence linking Trex1 deficiency to autoimmunity, little is known about the specific mechanisms that lead to disease in the absence of Trex1. Herein, we define Trex1 as a negative regulator of the ISD response and delineate the genetic pathway linking cell-intrinsic initiation of autoimmunity to type I IFN-dependent autoantibody production and autoimmune pathology. We identify single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fragments derived from endogenous retroelements that accumulate in Trex1-deficient hearts, and show that Trex1 can metabolize reverse-transcribed DNA of these endogenous retroelements, revealing a source of Trex1 substrates that may trigger autoimmunity. We designed an unbiased biochemical approach to identify proteins involved in ISD recognition based on direct binding to cytosolic DNA in live cells. We took advantage of the fact that the ISD response is sequence independent, and synthesized biotinylated oligonucleotides with several bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) nucleosides in place of thymidine; BrdU more readily crosslinks to closely associated proteins upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. We transfected the BrdU-modified ISD into macrophages, UV treated the cells 90 min later, and recovered the biotinylated DNA/protein complexes from cell lysates. Mass spectrometry analysis identified a prominent recovered protein as Trex1 (Figure 1A), which we confirmed by western blot with antisera to Trex1 (Figure 1B). Analysis of microarray data revealed that, in addition to its steady-state abundance, transcription of the trex1 gene is robustly induced by ISD stimulation (Figure 1C). Of all 3′→5′ DNA exonucleases in the mouse genome, Trex1 is uniquely ISD inducible, which suggests a more specialized role for Trex1 in antiviral immunity (Figure 1C). We found that Trex1-deficient cells had an intact ISD response to transfected DNA, thus ruling out the possibility that Trex1 is the ISD sensor itself (Figure 1D). Consistent with a previous report (Chowdhury et al., 2006Chowdhury D. Beresford P.J. Zhu P. Zhang D. Sung J.S. Demple B. Perrino F.W. Lieberman J. The exonuclease TREX1 is in the SET complex and acts in concert with NM23-H1 to degrade DNA during granzyme A-mediated cell death.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we found that Trex1 was cytosolic and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; Chowdhury et al., 2006Chowdhury D. Beresford P.J. Zhu P. Zhang D. Sung J.S. Demple B. Perrino F.W. Lieberman J. The exonuclease TREX1 is in the SET complex and acts in concert with NM23-H1 to degrade DNA during granzyme A-mediated cell death.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of Trex1 that follows the nuclease domain was necessary for this ER localization: a truncated form of Trex1 lacking the last 79 amino acids was located diffusely throughout the cell (Figure 1E). Notably, a missense mutation in human Trex1 resulting in a similarly truncated protein causes autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (OMIM 192315), underscoring the importance of this ER localization (Richards et al., 2007Richards A. van den Maagdenberg A.M. Jen J.C. Kavanagh D. Bertram P. Spitzer D. Liszewski M.K. Barilla-Labarca M.L. Terwindt G.M. Kasai Y. et al.C-terminal truncations in human 3′-5′ DNA exonuclease TREX1 cause autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1068-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Fusion of the C-terminal 79 amino acids of Trex1 to the C terminus of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) conferred ER localization identical to that of full-length Trex1 (Figure 1E) (Richards et al., 2007Richards A. van den Maagdenberg A.M. Jen J.C. Kavanagh D. Bertram P. Spitzer D. Liszewski M.K. Barilla-Labarca M.L. Terwindt G.M. Kasai Y. et al.C-terminal truncations in human 3′-5′ DNA exonuclease TREX1 cause autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1068-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Trex1 contains a predicted transmembrane helix at its C terminus, suggesting that it may be an integral membrane protein of the ER (Lee-Kirsch et al., 2007bLee-Kirsch M.A. Gong M. Chowdhury D. Senenko L. Engel K. Lee Y.A. de Silva U. Bailey S.L. Witte T. Vyse T.J. et al.Mutations in the gene encoding the 3′-5′ DNA exonuclease TREX1 are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1065-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, Trex1 lacks an identifiable signal sequence for ER insertion, either at its N terminus or within the 79 C-terminal amino acids that dictate ER localization. When we examined the migration of epitope-tagged Trex1 in sucrose gradients, we unexpectedly found two distinct pools of Trex1: a buoyant fraction that migrated at the top of the gradient, and a dense fraction that coeluted with calnexin, an ER-resident, transmembrane protein (Figure 1F). Removal of the Trex1 C terminus eliminated the dense pool, while fusion of this C terminus to YFP resulted in a dual distribution identical to that of full-length Trex1 (Figure 1F). The dense form of Trex1 was also eliminated by pretreatment of cell extracts with detergent (0.5% NP-40; data not shown). These data suggest that Trex1 is not a transmembrane protein, and that a fraction of Trex1 interacts through its C terminus with ER membranes or with another ER-resident protein to determine its localization. Trex1 is an ISD-inducible DNA exonuclease, but it is not the sensor of the ISD pathway. We therefore hypothesized that Trex1 may play a regulatory role in the ISD pathway by metabolizing DNA ligands of this cell-intrinsic antiviral response. Because IRF3 is essential for the antiviral ISD response (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006aStetson D.B. Medzhitov R. Recognition of cytosolic DNA activates an IRF3-dependent innate immune response.Immunity. 2006; 24: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), we examined the contribution of the ISD-IRF3 pathway by breeding Trex1-deficient mice to IRF3-deficient mice (Sato et al., 2000Sato M. Suemori H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T.

Importantly, IRF3 dependence distinguishes the ISD pathway from TLR9-dependent recognition of DNA, which activates type I IFNs in pDCs through the related IRF7 transcription factor (Honda et al., 2005Honda K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Asagiri M. Sato M. Mizutani T. Shimada N. Ohba Y. Takaoka A. Yoshida N. Taniguchi T.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Trex1-deficient mice in our colony succumbed to lethal autoimmunity at a median age of 9 weeks (Figure 2A). In contrast, genetic ablation of IRF3 prevented disease in Trex1-deficient mice, as evidenced by complete rescue from mortality and restoration of normal body weight (Figures 2A and 2B). We performed two additional crosses to further dissect the phenotype of Trex1-deficient mice. Detection of intracellular DNA by the ISD pathway activates potent type I IFN production, and elevated type I IFNs are a hallmark of AGS and lupus (Crow et al., 2003Crow Y.J. Black D.N. Ali M.

Similar to Trex1/IRF3 double knockout (DKO) mice, Trex1-deficient mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (IFNαR1) were completely protected from mortality (Figure 2C). Finally, we found that lymphocytes were essential for disease, because RAG2 deficiency fully rescued Trex1-deficient mice from mortality (Figure 2D). Most Trex1-deficient mice die of circulatory failure caused by severe inflammatory myocarditis (Morita et al., 2004Morita M. Stamp G. Robins P. Dulic A. Rosewell I. Hrivnak G. Daly G. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Gene-targeted mice lacking the Trex1 (DNase III) 3′→5′ DNA exonuclease develop inflammatory myocarditis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6719-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). All hearts examined from Trex1-deficient mice in our colony had evidence of profound inflammation, with thinning of the ventricular wall, mononuclear cell infiltrates, and disruption of normal heart muscle morphology (Figure 3A). These pathological features were absent in Trex1-deficient mice lacking IRF3, IFNαR1, or RAG2 (Figure 3A). Interestingly, despite the restoration of normal heart anatomy in Trex1-deficient mice on all three rescued backgrounds, we found distinct effects of each rescuing genotype on type I IFN expression in heart tissue. IFN-β mRNA expression was dramatically increased in Trex1-deficient hearts and completely restored to wild-type levels in Trex1/IRF3 DKO hearts, further emphasizing the primary role of IRF3 in this IFN-dependent pathology (Figure 3B). Trex1/IFNαR1 DKO hearts had low but detectably elevated levels of IFN-β mRNA, consistent with disruption of the positive feedback loop of type I IFN expression that is amplified by IFNαR1 signaling (Figure 3B). In contrast, hearts of Trex1/RAG2 DKO mice retained significantly elevated levels of IFN-β mRNA (Figure 3B). Importantly, these data indicate that expression of type I IFNs alone is not sufficient to cause disease; rather, it is the IFN-dependent mobilization of lymphocytes that precipitates autoimmunity in this setting. The Trex1/RAG2 DKO mice revealed an unexplored stage of disease after initiation and before lymphocyte-dependent pathology. To further characterize this postinitiation phase, we performed a microarray analysis comparing heart tissue of Trex1/RAG2 DKO hearts to RAG2 KO littermate controls. We found that ISD- and IFN-inducible genes comprised over 75% of the top 50 genes with increased expression levels in Trex1-deficient hearts, further emphasizing the role of the ISD pathway in initiating disease (Figure 3C) (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006aStetson D.B. Medzhitov R. Recognition of cytosolic DNA activates an IRF3-dependent innate immune response.Immunity. 2006; 24: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that Trex1 substrates are ligands of the ISD pathway. Accumulation of these substrates within Trex1-deficient cells initiates IRF3-dependent type I IFN production, which, in turn, recruits and activates lymphocytes to attack the affected tissues. Genetic ablation of IRF3, IFNαR1, or RAG2 ameliorates disease at three discrete phases, thus defining a genetic pathway connecting unregulated cell-intrinsic DNA detection by the ISD pathway to lethal autoimmunity. Because lymphocytes are essential for the autoimmune pathology caused by loss of Trex1 function, we tested for the presence of autoantibodies in Trex1-deficient mice. Sera from wild-type mice showed no detectable reactivity with heart tissue sections (Figure 4A, left panels). In contrast, IgG antibodies from Trex1-deficient mice strongly stained heart tissue (Figure 4A, middle and right panels). Sera from different Trex1 KO mice reproducibly detected similar cytosolic structures (Figure 4A). This cytosolic staining pattern was different from the nuclear and punctate cytosolic distribution of autoantigens detected by autoantibodies from MRL-lpr/lpr mice that develop systemic autoimmunity (Figure 4A, bottom row). Autoantibodies from Trex1-deficient mice detected KO and wild-type heart extracts equivalently, demonstrating that the autoantigens were not specific to Trex1 KO hearts (Figures 4B and 4C). Moreover, we observed a trend toward broader autoreactivity with sera from older Trex1-deficient mice, consistent with epitope spreading (Figures 4B and 4C). We next tested whether the ISD pathway was linked to autoantibody production in Trex1-deficient mice. Sera from all singly Trex1-deficient mice tested demonstrated strong reactivity to heart extracts of both wild-type and Trex1 KO mice (Figure 4C). In contrast, serum autoantibodies were undetectable in similarly aged Trex1 KO mice lacking either IRF3 or IFNαR1 (Figure 4C). These data reveal an important connection betw"
https://openalex.org/W2093972125,"Infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), is a dangerous and costly complication of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. How antibiotic-mediated elimination of commensal bacteria promotes infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a fertile area for speculation with few defined mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that antibiotic treatment of mice notably downregulates intestinal expression of RegIIIgamma (also known as Reg3g), a secreted C-type lectin that kills Gram-positive bacteria, including VRE. Downregulation of RegIIIgamma markedly decreases in vivo killing of VRE in the intestine of antibiotic-treated mice. Stimulation of intestinal Toll-like receptor 4 by oral administration of lipopolysaccharide re-induces RegIIIgamma, thereby boosting innate immune resistance of antibiotic-treated mice against VRE. Compromised mucosal innate immune defence, as induced by broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, can be corrected by selectively stimulating mucosal epithelial Toll-like receptors, providing a potential therapeutic approach to reduce colonization and infection by antibiotic-resistant microbes."

Studies employing ubiquitin mutants suggest that the fate of polyubiquitinated proteins is determined by which lysine within ubiquitin is linked to the C terminus of an adjacent ubiquitin. We have developed linkage-specific antibodies that recognize polyubiquitin chains joined through lysine 63 (K63) or 48 (K48). A cocrystal structure of an anti-K63 linkage Fab bound to K63-linked diubiquitin provides insight into the molecular basis for specificity. We use these antibodies to demonstrate that RIP1, which is essential for tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-κB activation, and IRAK1, which participates in signaling by interleukin-1β and Toll-like receptors, both undergo polyubiquitin editing in stimulated cells. Both kinase adaptors initially acquire K63-linked polyubiquitin, while at later times K48-linked polyubiquitin targets them for proteasomal degradation. Polyubiquitin editing may therefore be a general mechanism for attenuating innate immune signaling.

Polyubiquitin editing may therefore be a general mechanism for attenuating innate immune signaling. Ubiquitination is a reversible, ATP-dependent posttranslational modification in which the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin is covalently linked through an isopeptide bond to the side chain of a lysine or, less commonly, the amino terminus of a target protein. Three classes of enzymes are required: the ubiquitin-activating E1, an ubiquitin-conjugating E2, and an ubiquitin ligase E3. The E3s select the substrate to be modified. A polyubiquitin chain is formed when one of the seven lysine side chains within ubiquitin is linked to the C-terminal glycine of another ubiquitin. The best characterized linkages to date utilize ubiquitin K48 and K63. K48-linked polyubiquitin predominantly, but not exclusively, targets proteins for proteasomal degradation, whereas K63-linked polyubiquitin more often regulates protein function, subcellular localization, or protein-protein interactions. Ubiquitination is reversible due to deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that can cleave ubiquitin from modified proteins (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6471) Google Scholar). Identification of polyubiquitin chain linkages on modified proteins has relied largely on mass spectrometry (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J.

Both approaches have their disadvantages. Mass spectrometry is labor intensive, requires sophisticated instrumentation, and has limited sensitivity when interrogating rapid changes in the ubiquitination status of endogenous proteins. Overexpressing mutant ubiquitins in cells or using mutant ubiquitins in vitro may not recapitulate accurately modifications that involve wild-type, endogenous ubiquitin. We have addressed this barrier to progress by developing linkage-specific antibodies with utility in a broad range of applications including immunoprecipitation (IP), immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Given that ubiquitination is emerging as a critical regulator of a variety of cellular processes including, but not limited to, cell-cycle progression, the DNA-damage response, activation of transcription by NF-κB, and regulation of cell survival (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6471) Google Scholar), these reagents hold the same potential as antibodies specific for phosphorylated amino acids in revealing the rapid changes in posttranslational modifications that accompany signaling. To illustrate the usefulness of these linkage-specific antibodies, we have used them to examine polyubiquitin editing during signaling by tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). The kinase adaptor RIP1, for example, is essential for activation of the transcription factor NF-κB following stimulation of TNFR1. RIP1 is recruited to TNFR1 via the adaptor TRADD and must be polyubiquitinated for interaction with NEMO/IKKγ, the regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK), and for recruitment of the kinase TAK1. Activated IKK phosphorylates IκB, which is subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. NF-κB transcription factors bound to IκB are thereby released and are able to translocate into the nucleus (Hayden and Ghosh, 2008Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Shared principles in NF-κB signaling.Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). RIP1 recruited to TNFR1 likely bears K63-linked polyubiquitin, which may be assembled by the E3 TRAF2 (Ea et al., 2006Ea C.K. Deng L. Xia Z.P. Pineda G. Chen Z.J.

A20, which is a negative regulator of TNF-induced NF-κB signaling, functions as a DUB toward RIP1 and, in so doing, disassembles the scaffolding necessary for the recruitment of NEMO and TAK1. Additionally, A20 can function as an E3 ligase and add K48-linked polyubiquitin to RIP1 to target it for proteasomal degradation (Wertz et al., 2004Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R.

Using our linkage-specific polyubiquitin antibodies, we have confirmed that RIP1 undergoes polyubiquitin editing and show that chain switching is a more general mechanism for downregulating signaling. We find that IRAK1, a proximal signaling component of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) and certain Toll-like receptors (TLRs), also undergoes polyubiquitin editing following receptor engagement. We took a phage display approach to engineer antibodies specific for K48- or K63-linked polyubiquitin. A minimal diversity, bivalent Fab antibody fragment phage display library (Fellouse et al., 2007Fellouse F.A. Esaki K. Birtalan S. Raptis D. Cancasci V.J. Koide A. Jhurani P. Vasser M. Wiesmann C.

Biol. 2007; 373: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar; library D) was panned against ubiquitin chains of either the K63 or K48 linkage (Figure S1A available online). After four rounds of selection, with later rounds including counterselection against monoubiquitin or polyubiquitin of the other linkage, specific binders were identified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twelve clones from each sort were expressed in E. coli as soluble Fabs, purified, and tested by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for binding to K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin. The highest affinity, most specific clones were then converted to monovalent format and used as templates for second generation libraries with additional sequence diversity engineered into the heavy chain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) H1, H2, and H3. K48 linkage-selected clones, for instance, had high sequence diversity in CDR H3, so the effect of further diversity in CDR H3 was explored. The K63 linkage-selected clones, by contrast, showed little diversity in CDR H3, so the focus of additional libraries was on optimization of CDRs H1 and H2. Clone Apu2.07 was the highest affinity anti-K48 linkage Fab isolated from a second generation library, with a binding constant of 1.2 nM for K48-linked diubiquitin and no detectable binding to K63-linked diubiquitin (Table 1). Apu2.16 was the highest affinity, most specific anti-K63 linkage Fab with a binding constant of 92 nM for K63-linked diubiquitin and 42 μM for K48-linked diubiquitin. Notably, Apu2.16 and Apu2.07 did not compete for binding to K48-linked diubiquitin (data not shown). Neither Fab demonstrated any detectable binding to monoubiquitin.Table 1Binding Constants for Linkage-Specific Anti-Polyubiquitin FabsCloneK48-Linked Diubiquitin Kd (nM)K63-Linked Diubiquitin Kd (nM)Apu2.071.2NBApu2.164200092Apu3.A8NB8.7Apu3.A12NB6.2Apu3.B3NB6.1Fab antibody fragments were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance.

Open table in a new tab Fab antibody fragments were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. Due to fast kon and koff rates, only the binding constant (Kd) is reported. NB indicates no detectable binding. To understand the basis of Apu2.16 specificity, the Fab fragment was crystallized in complex with K63-linked diubiquitin. The crystal structure was solved to 2.7 Å (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code 3DVN), and it shows that Apu2.16 recognizes the context of the K63 linkage rather than the linkage itself (Figure 1A). The heart of the recognition motif consists of interactions made by CDR H3, which contacts diubiquitin on either side of the isopeptide linkage. The N-terminal portion of CDR H3 (residues E99, Y100, and Y101) contacts C-terminal residues (72–74) as well as Q40 from the acceptor ubiquitin, while the distal part of H3 (residues R102 and Y103) contacts the 50 s loop of the K63 donor ubiquitin. Specifically, Y103 intercalates into a pocket between the donor ubiquitin 50 s loop and the acceptor G76. The rest of the interface is largely modular with the Apu2.16 light chain CDRs L1 and L2 interacting with the surface of the K63 donor ubiquitin, while the other two heavy chain CDRs contact the acceptor ubiquitin. On the ubiquitin side, the C-terminal residues of the acceptor ubiquitin prior to the isopeptide linkage (especially L73 and R74) are in much more intimate contact with the Fab than the isopeptide linkage itself; these two side chains account for ∼25% of the total surface area buried by diubiquitin on complex formation. In contrast, G76 contributes ∼1% of ubiquitin surface area, and K63 of the donor ubiquitin does not participate in the interface at all. In addition to extensive Van der Waals interactions, R74 also facilitates electrostatic complementarity to the Fab via a salt bridge to a glutamate side chain (E99) from the proximal part of CDR H3. Comparison of K63-linked diubiquitin in the above cocrystal to a crystal structure of K63-linked diubiquitin alone (PDB code 2JF5) or to either the crystal (PDB code 1TBE) or solution structures of K48-linked diubiquitin (Cook et al., 1992Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Carson M. Chen Z. Pickart C.M. Structure of a diubiquitin conjugate and a model for interaction with ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2).J. Biol.

Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) demonstrates that the Apu2.16 Fab recognizes a specific conformation of diubiquitin that is unique to the K63 linkage (Figure 1B). Moreover, a significant portion of the Fab paratope is derived from CDRs L2 and H2. Because L2 was not randomized in the first or second generation libraries, Apu2.16 was affinity matured by introducing sequence diversity into paratope positions within CDRs L2 and H2. Three affinity-matured clones, Apu3.A8, Apu3.A12, and Apu3.B3, demonstrated single digit nanomolar binding to K63-linked diubiquitin and no detectable binding to K48-linked diubiquitin (Table 1). Both Apu3.A8 and Apu3.A12 contained a S52R substitution in CDR L2 and a S52T or S52A substitution in CDR H2, respectively (Figure S1B). Apu3.B3 contained four amino acid substitutions. To understand the structural consequences of the improvements in Apu3.A8, we crystallized the Fab fragment in complex with K63-linked diubiquitin and solved the structure to 2.6 Å resolution (PDB code 3DVG; Figures 1C and S2). Changes in L2 and H2, which improved greatly the specificity and utility of this antibody, had relatively little impact on the structure of the Fab. Excluding differences in the conformation of CDR L1 and the N-terminal strand of the light chain, both of which are attributable to differences in crystal packing, the structures of the two Fabs are virtually identical (rmsd 0.80 Å on 412 C-α atoms). Surprisingly, neither R52 in L2 nor T52 in H2 is in intimate contact with the diubiquitin, and neither residue contributes much to the ubiquitin-binding surface on Apu3.A8. Instead the effect of these two mutations appears to be driven largely by improved electrostatic compatibility between the surface of the K63 donor ubiquitin and the light chain (Figure 1D). In particular, R52 in L2 and R66 in the light chain framework form a positively charged surface patch that complements a negative patch on the surface of the K63 donor ubiquitin. The K48 (Apu2.07) and K63 (Apu2.16, Apu3.A8, Apu3.A12, and Apu3.B3) linkage-specific Fabs were converted to full-length human immunoglobulins and tested by western blotting for their ability to recognize polyubiquitin linkages (Figure 2A and data not shown). All five antibodies recognized purified polyubiquitin chains of the appropriate linkage and did not bind to monoubiquitin. The K48 and K63 linkage-specific antibodies (Apu2.07 and Apu3.A8) also detected smears in cell lysates (Figure 2B) derived from human embryonic kidney 293T cells, mouse embryo fibroblasts, insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 or Trichoplusia ni cells), or yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Transient transfection of 293T cells with the E3 TRAF6 amplified the K63-linked polyubiquitin signal considerably (Figure 2C), consistent with previous studies characterizing TRAF6 as a K63 ubiquitin ligase (Deng et al., 2000Deng L.

We utilized the observation that overexpressed TRAF6 is itself modified by K63-linked polyubiquitin (Wang et al., 2001Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. TAK1 is a ubiquitin-dependent kinase of MKK and IKK.Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) to assess whether the K63 linkage-specific antibody Apu3.A8 would be useful for immunoprecipitation (Figure 2D). When TRAF6-containing lysates were denatured with 1% SDS to dissociate TRAF6 from other ubiquitinated proteins, and immunoprecipitations were performed following dilution of the SDS to as low as 0.05%, no TRAF6 was captured by the K63 linkage-specific antibodies (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of TRAF6 was successful, however, when TRAF6 lysates were denatured with 6 M urea. Western blot analysis for the 3xHA-epitope tag on TRAF6 revealed a smear of modified protein (Figure 2D, lane 2). Treatment of the immunoprecipitated material with the promiscuous catalytic domain of the DUB USP2 (USP2CD) collapsed the higher molecular weight bands, confirming ubiquitination of TRAF6 (Figure 2D, lanes 3–5). Nonspecific proteolytic activity associated with USP2CD did not remove the slower migrating species because inhibition of USP2CD DUB activity with the cysteine protease inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) prevented collapse of the smear (Figure 2D, lane 6). A portion of the TRAF6 immunoprecipitated by the K63 linkage-specific antibody appeared, by its migration, to be unmodified TRAF6. We speculate that a cellular DUB was not inactivated fully upon lysis and that this DUB generated the faster-migrating species of TRAF6 during the immunoprecipitation. The ability of the K48 linkage-specific antibody to immunoprecipitate K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins was determined using overexpressed 3xHA-tagged IκBα. A smear of IκBα was immunoprecipitated by the K48 linkage-specific antibody, which was converted to a faster migrating smear by USP2CD in a NEM-sensitive manner (Figure 2E). An isotype control antibody recognizing human HER2 failed to immunoprecipitate either IκBα or TRAF6 (Figure 2E and data not shown). Having established that the K48 and K63 linkage-specific antibodies could immunoprecipitate polyubiquitinated proteins, we sought to confirm their linkage specificity in this application using mass spectrometry. Polyubiquitinated proteins were immunoprecipitated from human BJAB cells, resolved by SDS-PAGE, subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, and then analyzed using a variation of the ubiquitin-AQUA method (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Quantitative analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated cyclin B1 reveals complex chain topology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Briefly, trypsin digests were supplemented with isotope-labeled internal standard peptides representing each polyubiquitin chain linkage and unbranched ubiquitin, and then the standards plus their corresponding native analytes were detected in high-resolution precursor ion scans using narrow range-extracted ion chromatograms. The abundance of each polyubiquitin chain linkage and the total amount of ubiquitin in the BJAB immunoprecipitates were quantified by comparing the signal from each digested peptide relative to its corresponding internal standard. The anti-K48 linkage, anti-K63 linkage (Apu3.A8), and isotype control antibodies immunoprecipitated 49.1 pmol, 2.2 pmol, and 0.2 pmol of total ubiquitin, respectively (Figure 3A). This result was in keeping with the observation that K48-linked polyubiquitin was more abundant than K63-linked polyubiquitin in the input lysate used for the immunoprecipitations (Figure 3B). Direct examination of the polyubiquitin linkages immunoprecipitated by the anti-K48 linkage antibody revealed 12.7 pmol of K48 –GG signature peptide and measurable amounts of the signature peptides for other linkages: 0.1 pmol K63, 1.1 pmol K11, and 2.0 pmol K6 (Figure 3C). Similarly, polyubiquitin immunoprecipitated by the anti-K63 linkage antibody did not produce exclusively the K63 –GG signature peptide; 0.3 pmol K63, 0.18 pmol K48, 0.08 pmol K11, and 0.06 pmol K6 were detected (Figure 3D). Given the strong binding preferences seen for the antibodies by SPR (Table 1), these mass spectrometry results suggest that a significant fraction of ubiquitin-modified cellular substrates (or complexes that resist dissociation in 6 M urea) exhibit heterogeneous polyubiquitin chain linkages. To confirm that the mixed linkages immunoprecipitated from BJAB cell lysates derived from substrates bearing heterogeneous polyubiquitin chains, as opposed to nonspecific binding, we tested whether the target linkage was necessary for immunoprecipitation of the other linkage types. Mixed linkage polyubiquitin chains with either the K48 or K63 linkage absent were generated in vitro using the E3 MuRF1 and the E2 UbcH5c (Kim et al., 2007Kim H.T. Kim K.P. Lledias F. Kisselev A.F.

The K48 or K63 linkage was excluded from the MuRF1 autoubiquitination reactions using mutant ubiquitin that had either K48 or K63 mutated to arginine (Figure 3E). By western blotting with a pan ubiquitin antibody, MuRF1 autoubiquitination reactions produced high molecular weight smears irrespective of whether we used wild-type (WT), K48R, or K63R ubiquitin (Figure 3F, lanes 1, 5, and 9). Ubiquitin-AQUA analysis of the reaction with WT ubiquitin revealed three main linkages: K48, K63, and K11 (Figure 3G, lane 1). As expected, reactions performed with K48R ubiquitin lacked K48-linked chains (Figure 3G, lane 5) and those performed with K63R ubiquitin lacked K63-linked chains (Figure 3G, lane 9). Both the anti-K48 and anti-K63 linkage antibodies immunoprecipitated polyubiquitinated species when MuRF1 was modified with WT ubiquitin (Figure 3F, lanes 3 and 4), but each antibody failed to do so if their target linkage was absent (Figure 3F, lanes 7 and 12). An isotype control antibody did not immunoprecipitate ubiquitinated MuRF1 from any of the reactions (Figure 3F, lanes 2, 6, and 10). Ubiquitin-AQUA analysis of the immunoprecipitated species from the WT ubiquitin reaction demonstrated the presence of K48-, K63-, and K11-linked chains regardless of the antibody used for enrichment (Figure 3H, lane 3 and Figure 3I, lane 4). As predicted by western blotting (Figure 3F, lanes 7 and 12), K11-linked chains were immunoprecipitated by both the anti-K48 and anti-K63 linkage antibodies only if their target linkage was also present (Figures 3H and 3I). These results demonstrate that the anti-K48 and anti-K63 linkage antibodies retain their fidelity in the context of immunoprecipitation. Further, they indicate that alternative linkages immunoprecipitated from cells by the K48 and K63 linkage-specific antibodies must stem from individual substrates (or complexes not dissociated by 6 M urea) bearing both the target linkage and other linkage types. Whether individual chains contain mixed linkages or whether substrates carry polyubiquitin chains of different linkages on separate lysines remains to be determined. We used the linkage-specific polyubiquitin antibodies to determine the distribution of K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin within cells by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Figures 4A and 4D). Apu2.07 anti-K48 linkage antibody stained both the nucleus and cytoplasm of HeLa cells, but what appeared to be nucleoli within the nucleus were labeled less intensely (Figure 4A). This pattern of staining coincided almost completely with proteasomes labeled with a polyclonal antibody recognizing the core 20S subunits (Figures 4B and 4C), which is consistent with the notion that K48-linked polyubiquitin generally targets proteins for proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, K48-linked polyubiquitin, but not proteasomes, was detected at the midbody during mitosis. Apu3.A8 anti-K63 linkage antibody had a very different staining pattern, labeling cytoplasmic speckles that varied both in number and size between individual cells (Figure 4D). We did not detect colocalization of K63-linked polyubiquitin with proteasomes in these speckles (Figures 4E and 4F). Nor did the K63-linked polyubiquitin speckles colocalize with Golgi complex and lysosomal markers (Figure S3). In control experiments, staining by the linkage-specific antibodies could be competed by synthesized polyubiquitin only if the chains contained the target linkage (data not shown). These results indicate that K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin can occur in distinct subcellular regions. We also tested whether the linkage-specific antibodies would be useful for immunohistochemistry and found that formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of HeLa cells also were stained effectively by the Apu2.07 anti-K48 and Apu3.A8 anti-K63 linkage antibodies (Figures 4G and 4J). Staining was competed by tetraubiquitin containing the target linkage but not by tetraubiquitin containing an alternative linkage (Figures 4H, 4I, 4K, and 4L). The utility of the K48 and K63 linkage-specific antibodies in unveiling the type of ubiquitination on a specific target protein was assessed with endogenous RIP1 in HeLa S3 cells treated with TNF (Figure 5). It has been shown that RIP1 recruited to TNFR1 is polyubiquitinated (Ea et al., 2006Ea C.K. Deng L. Xia Z.P. Pineda G. Chen Z.J.

https://openalex.org/W2106728955,"Tail-anchored (TA) proteins, defined by the presence of a single C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD), play critical roles throughout the secretory pathway and in mitochondria, yet the machinery responsible for their proper membrane insertion remains poorly characterized. Here we show that Get3, the yeast homolog of the TA-interacting factor Asna1/Trc40, specifically recognizes TMDs of TA proteins destined for the secretory pathway. Get3 recognition represents a key decision step, whose loss can lead to misinsertion of TA proteins into mitochondria. Get3-TA protein complexes are recruited for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane insertion by the Get1/Get2 receptor. In vivo, the absence of Get1/Get2 leads to cytosolic aggregation of Get3-TA complexes and broad defects in TA protein biogenesis. In vitro reconstitution demonstrates that the Get proteins directly mediate insertion of newly synthesized TA proteins into ER membranes. Thus, the GET complex represents a critical mechanism for ensuring efficient and accurate targeting of TA proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2060470491,"Proteolysis is a key regulatory process that promotes the (in)activation, translocation, and/or degradation of proteins. As such, there is considerable interest in methods to comprehensively characterize proteolytic pathways in biological systems. Here, we describe a robust and versatile proteomic platform that enables direct visualization of the topography and magnitude of proteolytic events on a global scale. We use this method to generate a proteome-wide map of proteolytic events induced by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This profile contained 91 characterized caspase substrates as well as 170 additional proteins not previously known to be cleaved during apoptosis. Surprisingly, the vast majority of proteolyzed proteins, regardless of the extent of cleavage, yielded persistent fragments that correspond to discrete protein domains, suggesting that the generation of active effector proteins may be a principal function of apoptotic proteolytic cascades."

https://openalex.org/W2014426141,"Stem cells are defined as self-renewing cell populations that can differentiate into multiple distinct cell types. However, hundreds of different human cell lines from embryonic, fetal and adult sources have been called stem cells, even though they range from pluripotent cells-typified by embryonic stem cells, which are capable of virtually unlimited proliferation and differentiation-to adult stem cell lines, which can generate a far more limited repertoire of differentiated cell types. The rapid increase in reports of new sources of stem cells and their anticipated value to regenerative medicine has highlighted the need for a general, reproducible method for classification of these cells. We report here the creation and analysis of a database of global gene expression profiles (which we call the 'stem cell matrix') that enables the classification of cultured human stem cells in the context of a wide variety of pluripotent, multipotent and differentiated cell types. Using an unsupervised clustering method to categorize a collection of approximately 150 cell samples, we discovered that pluripotent stem cell lines group together, whereas other cell types, including brain-derived neural stem cell lines, are very diverse. Using further bioinformatic analysis we uncovered a protein-protein network (PluriNet) that is shared by the pluripotent cells (embryonic stem cells, embryonal carcinomas and induced pluripotent cells). Analysis of published data showed that the PluriNet seems to be a common characteristic of pluripotent cells, including mouse embryonic stem and induced pluripotent cells and human oocytes. Our results offer a new strategy for classifying stem cells and support the idea that pluripotency and self-renewal are under tight control by specific molecular networks."
https://openalex.org/W2136348345,"Sexually dimorphic traits play key roles in animal evolution and behavior. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms governing their development and evolution. One recently evolved dimorphic trait is the male-specific abdominal pigmentation of Drosophila melanogaster, which is repressed in females by the Bric-à-brac (Bab) proteins. To understand the regulation and origin of this trait, we have identified and traced the evolution of the genetic switch controlling dimorphic bab expression. We show that the HOX protein Abdominal-B (ABD-B) and the sex-specific isoforms of Doublesex (DSX) directly regulate a bab cis-regulatory element (CRE). In females, ABD-B and DSX(F) activate bab expression whereas in males DSX(M) directly represses bab, which allows for pigmentation. A new domain of dimorphic bab expression evolved through multiple fine-scale changes within this CRE, whose ancestral role was to regulate other dimorphic features. These findings reveal how new dimorphic characters can emerge from genetic networks regulating pre-existing dimorphic traits."
https://openalex.org/W1967985251,"The Drosophila MSL complex associates with active genes specifically on the male X chromosome to acetylate histone H4 at lysine 16 and increase expression approximately 2-fold. To date, no DNA sequence has been discovered to explain the specificity of MSL binding. We hypothesized that sequence-specific targeting occurs at ""chromatin entry sites,"" but the majority of sites are sequence independent. Here we characterize 150 potential entry sites by ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq and discover a GA-rich MSL recognition element (MRE). The motif is only slightly enriched on the X chromosome ( approximately 2-fold), but this is doubled when considering its preferential location within or 3' to active genes (>4-fold enrichment). When inserted on an autosome, a newly identified site can direct local MSL spreading to flanking active genes. These results provide strong evidence for both sequence-dependent and -independent steps in MSL targeting of dosage compensation to the male X chromosome."

In solution, Tau adopts a “paperclip” conformation, whereby the N- and C-terminal domains approach each other and the repeat domain (Jeganathan, S., von Bergen, M., Brutlach, H., Steinhoff, H. J., and Mandelkow, E. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 2283-2293). In AD, Tau is in a hyperphosphorylated state. The consequences for microtubule binding or aggregation are a matter of debate. We therefore tested whether phosphorylation alters the conformation of Tau. To avoid the ambiguities of heterogeneous phosphorylation we cloned “pseudo-phosphorylation” mutants of Tau where combinations of Ser or Thr residues were converted into Glu. These mutations were combined with FRET pairs inserted in different locations to allow distance measurements. The results show that the paperclip conformation becomes tighter or looser, depending on the pseudo-phosphorylation state. In particular, pseudo-phosphorylation at the epitope of the diagnostic antibody AT8* (S199E + S202E + T205E) moves the N-terminal domain away from the C-terminal domain. Pseudo-phosphorylation at the PHF1 epitope (S396E + S404E) moves the C-terminal domain away from the repeat domain. In both cases the paperclip conformation is opened up. By contrast, the combination of AT8* and PHF1 sites leads to compaction of the paperclip, such that the N-terminus approaches the repeat domain. The compaction becomes even stronger by combining pseudo-phosphorylated AT8*, AT100, and PHF1 epitopes. This is accompanied by a strong increase in the reaction with conformation-dependent antibody MC1, suggesting the generation of a pathological conformation characteristic for Tau in AD. Furthermore, the compact paperclip conformation enhances the aggregation to paired helical filaments but has little influence on microtubule interactions.

Microtubule dynamics are modulated by microtubule-associated proteins that bind to the surface of microtubules; among these, Tau protein is one of the major microtubule-associated proteins in neurons (4Garcia M.L.

Several observations suggest that Tau cannot simply be a “random coil” in the strict sense. Hints for special conformational states come from the reactivities of antibodies such as Alz50, MC1, Tau-66, MN423, and SM134 that have discontinuous epitopes on Tau. Antibodies Alz50 and MC1 recognize conformations of Tau in brain tissue that occur at an early stage of AD. Their epitopes comprise residues near the N terminus and in the third repeat and this conformation is called “pathological conformation of Tau” as it precedes aggregation (33Carmel G. Mager E.M.

We recently characterized this globally folded state of Tau in solution by generating Tau variants containing FRET pairs at different positions and measuring their distance by the fluorescence energy transfer from the donor (tryptophan) to the acceptor (cysteine carrying a dansyl group). This study revealed a double hairpin or “paperclip” conformation where the C terminus was folded near the repeat domain, and the N terminus was folded back near the C terminus (1Jeganathan S. von Bergen M. Brutlach H. Steinhoff H.J. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2283-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).Given the results, the next question was whether phosphorylation at critical sites would have an influence on this global conformation of Tau and could induce the pathological state seen by the MC1 antibody. Ideally, it would be desirable to phosphorylate Tau by predetermined sites with 100% efficiency. This cannot be achieved due to the open structure of Tau, which makes many sites accessible to various kinases. Therefore, phosphorylation reactions generally result in a heterogeneous mixture of Tau molecules phosphorylated at different sites and to different extents. To circumvent this ambiguity we generated Glu mutants where phosphorylatable serine or threonine residues were replaced by glutamate. Although glutamate is not a perfect substitute for phosphorylation, it is a reasonable approximation (38Huang W. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8960-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the extent of “pseudo-phosphorylation” is by definition specific and complete. The effect of pseudo-phosphorylation on the aggregation and microtubule binding of Tau has also been studied (39Leger J. Kempf M. Lee G. Brandt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8441-8446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 40Haase C. Stieler J.T. Arendt T. Holzer M. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1509-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). But it has not been studied whether there are changes in the global folding of Tau that could be linked to its properties. We have therefore combined phospho-mutants with FRET donor/acceptor mutants to measure intramolecular distances. Here we report that phosphorylation at critical sites upstream or downstream of the repeats indeed modifies the global conformation of Tau so that the paperclip structure is either opened up or tightened. In the latter case the N-terminal domain approaches the repeats, which is reminiscent of the conformation recognized by conformation-dependent antibody MC1. This has consequences for the aggregation behavior of Tau.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Proteins—Chemicals of biochemical grade such as GdnHCl were purchased from Sigma. The fluorescent label 1,5-IAEDANS was obtained from Invitrogen. Point mutations were made in the htau40 coding sequence carried by plasmid pNG2 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The plasmids were sequenced on both strands to confirm the mutations. A number of mutants of the full-length Tau isoform htau40 (4R/2N) that carry mutations for FRET pairs, i.e. tryptophan (donor) and cysteine linked to IAEDANS (acceptor) at different positions, was used in the previous study (1Jeganathan S. von Bergen M. Brutlach H. Steinhoff H.J. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2283-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For the current study, the mutant for mapping the proximities between the N terminus and repeats (N-R) were chosen with tryptophan at residue 310 and cysteine at 17; the mutant for mapping the distance between repeats and the C terminus (R-C) were chosen with tryptophan at residue 432 and cysteine at either 291 or 322; the mutant for mapping the proximities between the N and C terminus (N-C) were chosen with tryptophan at residue 432 and cysteine at 17. These FRET pair mutations were combined with phosphomimic mutations (glutamic acid) (Fig. 1B), for example, phosphorylated epitopes of antibodies: AT8* (Ser-199, Ser-202, Thr-205) (41Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Schröter C. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Steiner B. Berling B. Meyer H.E. Mercken M. Vandermeeren A. Goedert M. Mandelkow E.

Lett. 1995; 189: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), AT100 (Thr-212, Ser-214) (24Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Illenberger S. Godemann R. Mandelkow E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 43Hoffmann R. Lee V.M. Leight S. Varga I. Otvos Jr., L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8114-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and PHF1 (Ser-396, Ser-404) (44Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Schein J.D. Binder L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 564-569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Otvos Jr., L. Feiner L. Lang E. Szendrei G.I. Goedert M. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Thus to analyze the effect of mimicking phosphoepitopes (AT8*, AT100, and PHF1), constructs were made carrying Glu mutations and FRET pairs at different positions (e.g. N-R, R-C, and N-C). The expression of phosphomimic mutants were done using the BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain. The purification of Tau was usually done by making use of a heating step as described earlier (46Barghorn S. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 299: 35-51PubMed Google Scholar). But FRET mutants of Tau were purified with modifications involving a stepwise ammonium sulfate precipitation but no heating step. Briefly, the cell lysate was initially brought to 25% (NH4)2SO4 and then centrifuged for 45 min at 127,000 × g to clear the supernatant. The supernatant was then adjusted to 55% saturated (NH4)2SO4 to precipitate Tau protein and centrifuged for 45 min at 127,000 × g to collect the pellet that was then dissolved and dialyzed against buffer. Further purification was carried out using the ion exchange column SP Sepharose, followed by a gel filtration column G200 (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of the proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As an example of terminology, Tau/N-CAT8*+AT100+PHF1 will be used to denote the htau40 mutant carrying a combination of Glu mutations for epitopes of AT8*, AT100, and PHF1 with tryptophan at 432 and cysteine at 17 (N-C).Labeling of Proteins—Protein in 4 m GdnHCl, phosphate-buffered saline buffer (∼100 μm) was incubated with 10 m excess DTT for 10 min at 37 °C. DTT was then removed by size exclusion chromatography (Fast Desalting column, Amersham Biosciences) and the eluted protein was immediately supplemented with ∼20 m excess IAEDANS (dissolved in N,N-di-methylformamide). The labeling reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 2 h, or alternatively “solid state-based labeling” was used (47Kim Y. Ho S.O. Gassman N.R. Korlann Y. Landorf E.V. Collart F.R. Weiss S. Bioconjug. Chem. 2008; 19: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which is achieved by reducing the protein with DTT, then precipitating with 70% (NH4)2SO4, followed by dissolving the protein pellet with buffer containing IAEDANS. The solution was then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and residual IAEDANS was removed by size exclusion chromatography. The concentration of protein was determined by absorption at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficient ϵTau = 11,460 to 12,950 m-1 cm-1, depending on the Tau mutants. The amount of bound IAEDANS was determined by the absorption at 336 nm (ϵIAEDANS = 6,100 m-1 cm-1) (48Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was corrected for the contribution of the IAEDANS at 280 nm and the stoichiometry was calculated. Typically the labeling stoichiometry was 0.7-0.9. The distances calculated with or without correction for the fractional labeling ratio are within a difference of 10-15% (see below).Fluorescence Spectroscopy—All steady state fluorescence measurements were performed with a Spex Fluoromax spectrophotometer (Polytec, Waldbronn, Germany), using 3 × 3-mm quartz microcuvettes from Hellma (Mühlheim, Germany) with 20 μl sample volumes. Protein was irradiated at 290 nm to excite tryptophan but not tyrosine. In all cases, the experimental parameters were as follows: scan range = 300-550 nm, excitation slit width = 4 nm, emission slit width = 6 nm, integration time = 0.25 s, and photomultiplier voltage = 950 V. Each time 3 spectra were scanned and averaged. A protein concentration of 4 μm was used and checked by SDS-PAGE as a control. In denaturation experiments with GdnHCl, the efficiency was calculated from emission intensities of labeled protein and unlabeled protein at the same GdnHCl concentration. The influence of various GdnHCl concentrations on the fluorimetric properties of tryptophan and IAEDANS was controlled with free dyes alone and in combination. The effects due to GdnHCl as a solvent were minor (<10%) in comparison to the FRET effects and the spectra were corrected for it. The FRET efficiency was measured by the energy transfer, EFRET = (1 − DA/D)(1/fA)(Eq. 1) where DA is the fluorescence intensity of the donor in the presence of the acceptor and D is the fluorescence intensity of donor in the absence of acceptor. The apparent efficiencies were normalized by fA, the fractional labeling with acceptor, as shown in Equation 1. The distance R between donor and acceptor was calculated by the Förster equation, EFRET = [1 + (R/Ro)6]−1(Eq. 2) where the Förster radius Ro is 22 Å for the Trp-IAEDANS pair (49Matsumoto S. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the case of the tryptophan-IAEDANS pair, a small error in the labeling ratio would give distance values that are within acceptable error range even without a correction factor, due to the dependence of the efficiency on the 6th power of the distance. For example, if the measured efficiency is 0.5 with 100% labeling, then r = 22 Å. On the other hand, if the measured FRET efficiency is 0.5 with only 80% labeling (fA = 0.8) and the correction for fractional labeling is applied, then r = 20.2 Å. Note that in unfolded proteins the distance between a given FRET pair shows a wider distribution and the apparent FRET reflects this heterogeneity (50Schuler B. Lipman E.A. Eaton W.A. Nature. 2002; 419: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar).CD Spectroscopy—All measurements were carried out with a Jasco J-810 CD spectrometer (Jasco, Groß-Umstadt, Germany) in a cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm. The scanning speed was 100 nm/min, bandwidth 0.1 nm, and a response time of 4 s. In each experiment, measurements were done at 20 °C and 4 spectra were summed and averaged. The CD spectra were normalized for the concentration at 214 nm using bovine serum albumin as a standard.PHF Assembly—Aggregation was induced by incubating soluble Tau typically in the range of 50 μm in volumes of 20 μl at 37 °C in 20 mm BES, pH 7.4, plus 25 mm NaCl buffer with the anionic cofactor heparin 6000 (molar ratio of Tau to heparin = 4:1). The formation of aggregates was monitored by ThS fluorescence and confirmed by electron microscopy. For ThS fluorescence, 5 μl of 50 μm assembly reaction was diluted to 50 μl with NH4Ac, pH 7.0, containing 20 μm ThS. Fluorescence measurements were done at 25 °C in a Tecan spectrofluorimeter (Crailsheim, Germany) with an excitation wavelength of 440 nm and an emission wavelength of 521 nm (slit width 7.5 nm each) in a black microtiter plate with 384 round wells (ThermoLabsystems, Dreieich, Germany). The background fluorescence was subtracted when needed. For electron microscopy, protein solutions were diluted to 1-10 μm and placed on 600 mesh carbon-coated copper grids for 45 s, washed twice with H2O, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 45 s. The samples were examined with a Philips CM12 electron microscope at 100 kV.Microtubule Polymerization Assay—Microtubule assembly was monitored by UV light scattering at an angle of 90° at a wavelength of 350 nm in a black microtiter plate with 384 round wells (ThermoLabsystems) in a Tecan spectrofluorimeter in the presence and absence of Tau. 5 μm Tau was mixed with 30 μm tubulin dimer at 4 °C in microtubule assembly buffer (100 mm Na-PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm DTT) in a final volume of 40 μl. The reaction was started by raising the temperature to 37 °C.Western Blotting—The protein samples were added to SDS sample buffer and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for subsequent electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 40 min. After the transfer, the blot membrane was blocked with 5% milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (MC1 at 1:1000 dilution). After washing the unbound primary antibody, the secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgM conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at 1:1000 dilution) was incubated with the blot. The blot was then stripped of MC1 antibody and incubated with the pan-Tau antibody K9JA at 1:8000 dilutions (A0024, DAKO, Glostrup Denmark). Protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSProteins and Phosphomimic Mutations—Tau is a natively unfolded protein that does not contain a significant amount of secondary structure (31Schweers O. Schonbrunn-Hanebeck E. Marx A. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24290-24297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is possible that there are global conformations defined by interactions between the different domains of Tau, as suggested by certain antibodies (e.g. Alz50, MC1) that are diagnostic of a pathological conformation and react with a discontinuous epitope comprising residues near the N terminus and the third repeat (33Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 34Jicha G.A. Bowser R. Kazam I.G. Davies P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown previously, Tau in solution adopts preferred long range interactions between the repeat domain and the C terminus and between the N and C terminus (paperclip conformation), as judged by FRET (1Jeganathan S. von Bergen M. Brutlach H. Steinhoff H.J. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2283-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For mapping FRET distances we inserted Trp as a donor and Cys-dansyl as an acceptor near the N terminus (e.g. residue Y18W or T17C-dansyl), near the C terminus (e.g. V432W), or within the repeats (Cys291-dansyl in R2, Cys322-dansyl in R3 or Y310W in R3). In solution, the C-terminal domain of Tau is unexpectedly close (19-23 Å) to the repeat domain and therefore causes a pronounced FRET signal, whereas the N-terminal domain (residue 17) is not within the FRET range of the repeat domain, but close to the C-terminal tail where it causes FRET (21-24 Å, Fig. 1A).Because the functions of Tau are regulated by phosphorylation we were interested whether this would influence the global conformation. In particular, we wanted to know whether"
https://openalex.org/W2000299318,"A screen of a genomic library from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) identified a small, unannotated open reading frame (MT0196) that encodes a 4.9-kDa, cysteine-rich protein. Despite extensive nucleotide divergence, the amino acid sequence is highly conserved among mycobacteria that are pathogenic in vertebrate hosts. We synthesized the protein and found that it preferentially binds up to six Cu(I) ions in a solvent-shielded core. Copper, cadmium and compounds that generate nitric oxide or superoxide induced the gene's expression in Mtb up to 1,000-fold above normal expression. The native protein bound copper within Mtb and partially protected Mtb from copper toxicity. We propose that the product of the MT0196 gene be named mycobacterial metallothionein (MymT). To our knowledge, MymT is the first metallothionein of a Gram-positive bacterium with a demonstrated function."
https://openalex.org/W1983534052,"Many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) possess allosteric binding sites distinct from the orthosteric site utilized by their cognate ligands, but most GPCR allosteric modulators reported to date lack signaling efficacy in their own right. McN-A-343 (4-(N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium chloride) is a functionally selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) partial agonist that can also interact allosterically at the M(2) mAChR. We hypothesized that this molecule simultaneously utilizes both an allosteric and the orthosteric site on the M(2) mAChR to mediate these effects. By synthesizing progressively truncated McN-A-343 derivatives, we identified two, which minimally contain 3-chlorophenylcarbamate, as pure allosteric modulators. These compounds were positive modulators of the orthosteric antagonist N-[(3)H]methylscopolamine, but in functional assays of M(2) mAChR-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and guanosine 5'-3-O-([(35)S]thio)triphosphate binding, they were negative modulators of agonist efficacy. This negative allosteric effect was diminished upon mutation of Y177A in the second extracellular (E2) loop of the M(2) mAChR that is known to reduce prototypical allosteric modulator potency. Our results are consistent with McN-A-343 being a bitopic orthosteric/allosteric ligand with the allosteric moiety engendering partial agonism and functional selectivity. This finding suggests a novel and largely unappreciated mechanism of ""directed efficacy"" whereby functional selectivity may be engendered in a GPCR by utilizing an allosteric ligand to direct the signaling of an orthosteric ligand encoded within the same molecule."

Using an antibody developed against the sulfonylated (–SO3H) yeast Prx (Tsa1p) active-site peptide (AFTFVCPTEI), we observed an increase in the immunoblot intensity in proportion to the H2O2 concentrations administered to the yeast cells. We identified two species of hyperoxidized Tsa1p: one can be reduced back (reversible) with sulfiredoxin, and the other cannot (irreversible). Irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p was identified as containing the active-site cysteine sulfonic acid (Tsa1p-SO3H) by mass spectrometry. Tsa1p-SO3H was not an autoxidation product of Tsa1p-SO2H and was maintained in yeast cells even after two doubling cycles.

In contrast to the reversibly hyperoxidized Cys-SO2H in proteins, irreversibly hyperoxidized Cys-SO3H is generally believed to be an impaired dead end product, which is destined to be removed (35Friguet B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2910-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 36Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Res. 2006; 40: 1250-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The sulfonic acid state of hyperoxidized CP of mammalian 2-Cys Prx proteins, such as human Prxs II and III, was observed by in-gel tryptic digestion followed by mass spectrometric analysis (15Rabilloud T.

Later, it was proven that sulfonylation of CP occurs as a result of air oxidation from cysteine sulfinic acid during protease treatment for peptide fingerprinting under denaturing conditions (17Yang K.S.

To date, there is no known systematic study examining the conditions of irreversible hyperoxidation or switching of enzyme activity by irreversibly hyperoxidized cysteine residues. Here, we report the hyperoxidation of the active-site Cys-SH to Cys-SO3H in Tsa1p, the reaction that induces activity switching from a peroxidase to an enhanced molecular chaperone. In addition, we also demonstrate the maintenance of Tsa1p-SO3H in yeast cells and the possibility of hyperoxidation systems that facilitate the irreversible hyperoxidation of Tsa1p in yeast cells. Preparation of Antibodies Specific for Sulfonylated Tsa1p—A peptide (AFTFVCPTEI) that corresponds to the active site of yeast Tsa1p was oxidized by performic acid, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce), and used to generate rabbit antibodies as described previously (38Woo H.A. Kang S.W. Kim H.K. Yang K.S. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47361-47364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Hyperoxidation and Retroreduction of Tsa1p in Yeast Cells and in Vitro—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type strain S288C was used in this experiment. Yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose) and then transferred to synthetic defined (SD) medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base and 2% glucose). For hyperoxidation, log-phase cells (A600 = 0.5) were exposed to various concentrations of H2O2 for 10 min and harvested. For retroreduction of Tsa1p in yeast cells, after a 10-min exposure to H2O2, yeast cells were allowed to recover in fresh SD medium for 3 h at 30 °C in the presence of cycloheximide (50 μg/ml). Collected cells were disrupted by glass beads using a minibead beater (BioSpec Products, Inc.) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the crude cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel or a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel. Tsa1p was visualized with anti-Tsa1p antiserum regardless of its oxidation state, and the presence of hyperoxidized Tsa1p was verified with anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum. In vitro hyperoxidation of Tsa1p (0.31 μm) was performed in a thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent oxidation mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 5.95 μm Trx, 0.1 μm Trx reductase, and 0.25 mm NADPH with various H2O2 concentrations for 10 min at 30 °C. For retroreduction in vitro, hyperoxidized Tsa1p was incubated in retroreduction mixture containing 1.2 μm sulfiredoxin 1 (Srx1), 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at 30 °C. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE—Yeast crude extracts (10 μg) were mixed with rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% immobilized pH gradient buffer, 20 mm DTT, and 0.005% bromphenol blue) and loaded onto immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 3–10, 13 cm, Amersham Biosciences). Isoelectric focusing was performed with an IPGphor isoelectric focusing unit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instruction manual. After reduction and alkylation, second dimension electrophoresis was conducted on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using an SE600 vertical unit (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Tsa1p was probed on the membrane with anti-Tsa1p or anti-Tsa1p-SO3H anti-serum, and the immune complexes were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Immunoprecipitation—Yeast cell lysates were prepared with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and anti-Tsa1p antibody-conjugated protein G-Sepharose (2 μl of antibody with 30 μl of resin) was equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Cell lysates (500 μg/ml protein) were incubated with the resin for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was then removed by centrifugation. After washing with buffer B, immune complexes were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Srx1 antibody. Mass Analysis—Mass analysis was performed in parallel on a QSTAR pulsar quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with nanoelectrospray ion sources (Protana, Odense, Denmark). The analytes were dissolved in acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v) and loaded into pre-opened “medium” borosilicate spray capillaries for off-line nanoelectrospray (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense). A potential of 1000 V was applied to the loaded glass capillary tip. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were collected for 1 min, and the masses of proteins were calculated by deconvolving multiple charged ions with m/z values and corresponding total charges using AnalystQS software (Version 1.0, Applied Biosystems). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a TSK-GEL G3000SWXL column (Tosoh). Intact Tsa1p-SH or Tsa1p-SO3H was injected into the column, which was equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Determination of molecular masses was referenced against protein standards (Bio-Rad): thyroglobin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa). Electron Microscopy—Transmission electron microscopy analyses were performed at the Korea Basic Science Institute. Proteins were negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate, and transmission electron microscope images were obtained with a Zeiss EM 912 Omega microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. Trx-dependent Peroxidase Assay and Chaperone Assay—The rate of peroxide reduction was monitored as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm by NADPH oxidation at 30 °C using a Jasco UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cell holder. Reactions were initiated by adding the designated concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in a Trx-dependent oxidation mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 5.95 μm Trx, 0.1 μm Trx reductase, and 0.25 mm NADPH. Specific activities were calculated from the initial linear portion of the assay. Chaperone activity was measured by its capacity to inhibit thermal aggregation of firefly luciferase (Roche Applied Science). Luciferase (0.15 μm) was incubated with Tsa1p-SH or Tsa1p-SO3H in 25 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.9) at 47 °C for 30 min, and the thermal aggregation of luciferase was monitored by measuring the light scattering at 320 nm. Two Different Hyperoxidation States of Tsa1p—Hyperoxidation of CP residues of Prx proteins to cysteine sulfinic acid (CP-SO2H) and the corresponding spot migration on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels have been studied in both mammalian and yeast cells (15Rabilloud T. Heller M. Gasnier F. Luche S. Rey C. Aebersold R. Benahmed M. Louisot P. Lunardi J. J. Biol.

Although an antiserum against mammalian hyperoxidized Prx proteins was developed and characterized, its specificity for two hyperoxidized states, CP-SO2H and CP-SO3H, needs to be redetermined in detail (38Woo H.A. Kang S.W. Kim H.K. Yang K.S. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47361-47364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We also raised rabbit antiserum against the Tsa1p active-site peptide containing CP-SO3H following the previous protocol for mammalian anti-Prx-SO3H antiserum (38Woo H.A. Kang S.W. Kim H.K. Yang K.S. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47361-47364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The reactivity of anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum to yeast cell lysates increased in proportion to hydrogen peroxide concentrations administered to the cells (Fig. 1, A and B, upper panels). By comparing the mobilities of immunoreactive bands to anti-Tsa1p and anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antisera (Fig. 1, A and B), we concluded that the hyperoxidized Tsa1p migrated slower than the reduced form on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. However, the extent of intensity increases in anti-Tsa1p-SO3H-immunoreactive bands upon hydrogen peroxide treatment did not correlate well with that of slow migrating anti-Tsa1p-immunoreactive bands. Although anti-Tsa1p-SO3H-immunoreactive bands showed linear increases up to 10 mm hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1, A and B, upper panels), slow migrating anti-Tsa1p-immunoreactive bands showed saturation at 2 mm hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that the latter contains other species (probably Tsa1p-SO2H) as well as the species reactive to anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum. Two-dimensional PAGE analysis showed results consistent with those from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). With increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide administered to the cells, the hyperoxidized Tsa1p spot gained intensity, whereas the reduced Tsa1p spot lost intensity. Consistently, hyperoxidized Tsa1p migrated slower than the reduced form on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1C, left panel). The hyperoxidized spots detected by the two antisera showed different patterns of intensity increases, similar to the results in Fig. 1A, also suggesting the existence of different species at the same spot location. Retroreducibility of the Two Different Hyperoxidized Forms of Tsa1p—The retroreduction of Tsa1p-CP-SO2H to Tsa1p-CP-SH by the catalytic activity of Srx1/sestrin 2 in the presence of ATP and MgCl2 has been reported (25Woo H.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We wondered if the two different hyperoxidized forms of Tsa1p revert to the reduced form (Tsa1p-CP-SH). When cells were treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide, ∼78% of the hyperoxidized Tsa1p was retroreduced within 3 h after the removal of peroxide. However, when cells were exposed to 2.5 and 5 mm hydrogen peroxide, 53 and 28% of the Tsa1p were retroreduced, respectively. Treatment with 10 mm hydrogen peroxide totally disabled retroreduction. Based on these results, high doses of hydrogen peroxide seem to make irreversibly oxidized products. Subtraction of reversibly oxidized products (fast migrating bands) (Fig. 2A, middle panel) from the total oxidized product (slow migrating bands) (upper panel) can yield irreversibly oxidized products (lower panel), presented in Fig. 2B. As expected, irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p obtained by treatment with 10 mm hydrogen peroxide failed to associate with Srx1, whereas reversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p obtained by treatment with 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide associated with Srx1 (Fig. 2C). These results support the presence of irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p, which is reactive to anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum. Specificity of Anti-Tsa1p-SO3H Antiserum for Irreversibly Hyperoxidized Tsa1p—Purified Tsa1p was treated with 0.2 and 50 mm hydrogen peroxide to prepare reversibly and irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p. The reversibility was determined by retroreduction assay with Srx1 (Fig. 3A). Both species were mixed in different ratios and probed with anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum after separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3B). More than 40 ng of irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p was detectable with anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum in a dose-dependent manner, whereas 100 ng of reversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p was not detectable (Fig. 3, B and C). Mass Analysis of Irreversibly Hyperoxidized Tsa1p—The mass of irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p was purified from crude extracts of yeast cells treated with 10 mm hydrogen peroxide as described previously for the purification of Tsa1p-SH (39Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p was identified by SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional PAGE analyses (Fig. 4, A and B). The mass spectra of reduced Tsa1p and irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p with multiple charges are shown in Fig. 4C. The calculated monoisotopic mass values were 21,458.4 and 21,506.2 Da, respectively. The mass difference was ∼48 Da, which suggests the presence of three oxygen atoms in irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p. Considering the reactivity to anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum, the site of oxidation is the CP residue, and thus, irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p is certainly a Tsa1p-CP-SO3H. Tsa1p-SO3H Is Not a Spontaneous Oxidation Product of Tsa1p-SO2H—Previous reports proposed the autoxidation of protein cysteine sulfinic acid to cysteine sulfonic acid at the peptide level (40Poole L.B. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12330-12338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kice J.L. Adv. Phys. Org. Chem. 1980; 17: 65-181Google Scholar, 42Hayward M.A. Campbell E.B. Griffith O.W. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and the protein level (43Fujiwara N. Nakano M. Kato S. Yoshihara D. Ookawara T. Eguchi H. Taniguchi N. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35933-35944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in the presence of dissolved oxygen. We examined whether Tsa1p-SO2H resulted in spontaneous oxidation to Tsa1p-SO3H in crude cell lysates and an in vitro system. Yeast cell lysate treated with 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide for 10 min was exposed to air for 5 days at 4 °C without a reducing agent. Initially, about half of the Tsa1p was hyperoxidized to Tsa1p-SO2H based on the retroreducibility (Fig. 5A) and the negligible reactivity to anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum (Fig. 5B). At up to 5 days of air exposure, neither a change in the ratio of reduced to hyperoxidized forms nor a change in the reactivity to anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum was observed (Fig. 5B). Purified Tsa1p-SO2H showed consistent results (Fig. 5D). Atmospheric oxygen was not capable of further oxidizing Tsa1p-SO2H even under denaturing conditions in the presence of 6 m guanidine HCl (Fig. 5, B and D, middle panels). In addition, pH increases up to 8.5 with 6 m guanidine HCl did not cause the autoxidation of Tsa1p-SO2H to Tsa1p-SO3H, and the yeast culture and storage conditions also did not cause the autoxidation of Tsa1p-SO2H (data not shown). Maintenance of Tsa1p-SO3H in Cells—Irreversibly oxidized proteins in cells are generally believed to be degraded by proteolytic systems employing principally the 20 S proteasome as well as the ubiquitin-26 S proteasome pathways (35Friguet B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2910-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 36Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Res. 2006; 40: 1250-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). To examine the life span of Tsa1p-SO3H in yeast cells, exponentially growing yeast cells were exposed to 10 mm hydrogen peroxide for 10 min and incubated with fresh SD medium. After 4 h of lag phase, yeast cells achieved exponential growth with a doubling time of ∼3 h (Fig. 6B). The Tsa1p-SO3H level did not change much until 6 h and then gradually decreased. From 6 to 12 h of the culture period, the cell number doubled twice, whereas total Tsa1p-SO3H decreased to half of the initial level. Because of the long lag period after the treatment with hydrogen peroxide, the determination of the half-life of Tsa1p-SO3H in yeast cells might be controversial. If we define the Tsa1p-SO3H half-life in exponentially growing yeast cells, it is reasonably estimated to be 6 h (Fig. 6). The negligible rate of irreversible hyperoxidation of Tsa1p under normal culture conditions and the maintenance of Tsa1p-SO3H over more than two doubling periods implicate a new role for Tsa1p-SO3H in yeast cells rather than overoxidized protein wastes. Loss and Gain of Catalytic Activity by Hyperoxidation—Trx-dependent peroxidase activity was lost by hyperoxidation at CP (Fig. 7A), but the considerable maintenance of Tsa1p-SO3Hin the yeast cells led us to explore the endogenous catalytic activity of Tsa1p-SO3H. We measured the molecular chaperone activity of Tsa1p-SO3H because the oligomeric structure-dependent functional switching of Tsa1p from a peroxidase to a molecular chaperone and vice versa has been reported (31Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Chaperone activities were determined by measuring the protection capacity of the heat-induced aggregation of luciferase. The molar ratios of Tsa1p-SH and Tsa1p-SO3H to luciferase requiring 70% protection were 2:1 and 0.5:1, respectively. Thus, Tsa1p-SO3H had ∼4-fold higher chaperone activity compared with Tsa1p-SH (Fig. 7B). Oligomeric Structure of Tsa1p-SO3H—The correlation between chaperone activities and their structures has been established in many small heat shock proteins (19Haslbeck M. Franzmann T. Weinfurtner D. Buchner J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 29Nakamoto H. Vigh L. CMLS Cell. Mol.

We explored whether this correlation is also applicable to Tsa1p-SO3H. A functional switching of Tsa1p from a peroxidase to a molecular chaperone accompanied by a shift to a higher molecular mass complex has been observed (31Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y.

Purified Tsa1p-SH from yeast cells was separated into two major peaks on a size exclusion chromatography column (TSK-GEL G3000SWXL) with calculated molecular masses of ∼600 and 40 kDa, corresponding to two dodecameric forms and a dimeric form. Tsa1p-SO3H eluted with one major peak at ∼530 kDa, which we suppose to be two dodecamers (Fig. 8A). To compare the oligomeric structures of Tsa1p-SH and Tsa1p-SO3H, we performed electron microscopy, and the proteins were visualized by negative staining with uranyl acetate. Tsa1p-SO3H showed a homogeneous ring-shaped structure 14 nm in diameter, whereas Tsa1p-SH showed an irregular configuration with ∼10% of a sporadic ring-shaped structure (Fig. 8B). Sphere-shaped particles were not found with either Tsa1p-SH or Tsa1p-SO3H. These results confirm that irreversible hyperoxidation induces oligomerization to higher molecular mass forms, which we suppose to be two dodecamers, and that these higher molecular mass structures are responsible for a molecular chaperone function. Comparison of Sulfonyl Hyperoxidation in Yeast Cells and an in Vitro System—In vitro preparation of Tsa1p-SO2H using the Trx system was feasible, and the hyperoxidized product was mostly Tsa1p-SO2H (Figs. 3 and 5). In contrast, preparation of Tsa1p-SO2H using yeast cells was not successful because the hyperoxidized products were a mixture of Tsa1p-SO2H and Tsa1p-SO3H (data not shown). In addition, preparation of Tsa1p-SO3Hinan in vitro system was also feasible (Fig. 3); however, conditions harsher than those used with yeast cells were usually required. Because of this discrepancy, we compared the sulfonyl hyperoxidation in both systems more precisely. Most of the Tsa1p was hyperoxidized to Tsa1p-SO2H upon treatment with 0.2 mm hydrogen peroxide in the in vitro system, whereas most of the Tsa1p in yeast cells was not hyperoxidized under the same conditions. Although the Tsa1p in both systems was hyperoxidized by 1 mm hydrogen peroxide, the principal form in yeast cells was Tsa1p-SO3H, whereas in the in vitro system, it was Tsa1p-SO2H (Fig. 9). Considered an effective intrinsic antioxidant system in yeast cells, the hydrogen peroxide concentration that Tsa1p must cope with in yeast cells should be much lower than in the in vitro system. The more feasible sulfonyl hyperoxidation in yeast cells suggests the possible existence of a facilitation system other than the Trx system for the reaction from Tsa1p-SH to Tsa1p-SO3H or from Tsa1p-SO2H to Tsa1p-SO3H in yeast cells. In contrast to catalases, which directly catalyze the decomposition of peroxides to water and oxygen, peroxidases, which consume expensive cellular reducing equivalents to reduce peroxides, should be systematically regulated to conserve cellular reducing resources. After the finding of inactivation of Tsa1p during peroxidase catalysis in yeast (13Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

In addition, studies that followed reported the reversibility of sulfinic CP to sulfhydryl in mammalian 2-Cys Prxs and enzymatic systems responsible for that retroreduction in yeast and mammalian systems (25Woo H.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To quantify hyperoxidized Tsa1p in yeast cells using immunological methods, we developed rabbit antiserum against the peptide encompassing Tsa1p-CP-SO3H using the same method as described previously for mammalian anti-Prx-SO3H anti-serum (38Woo H.A. Kang S.W. Kim H.K. Yang K.S. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47361-47364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We identified two different forms of hyperoxidized Tsa1p (reversible Tsa1p-SO2H and irreversible Tsa1p-SO3H) (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4) based on the reactivity of the antiserum we developed. In contrast to mammalian anti-Prx-SO3H antiserum, which equally recognizes both Prx-CP-SO2H and Prx-CP-SO3H (38Woo H.A. Kang S.W. Kim H.K. Yang K.S. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47361-47364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), the reactivity of anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum was specific to Tsa1p-CP-SO3H (Fig. 3). Tsa1p-CP-SO3H was detectable above 20 ng in our alkaline phosphatase-based immune complex detection system, but 100 ng of Tsa1p-SO2H was not visible using the same detection system (Fig. 3). When HeLa cell extracts treated with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide were probed, anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum clearly showed distinguishable reactivity toward irreversibly hyperoxidized 2-Cys Prx spots, although the exact oxidation status of CP needs to be verified (data not shown). Considering the active-site amino acid sequence identity between yeast Tsa1p (-AFTFVCPPTEI-) and mammalian 2-Cys Prx (-DFTFVCPPTEI-), anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum can also be used for the detection of mammalian irreversibly hyperoxidized 2-Cys Prx proteins. The points that Tsa1p-SO3H has a half-life of more than two doubling times in yeast, Tsa1p-SO3H is not an autoxidation product, and Tsa1p-SO3H is an irreversibly hyperoxidized product together support the use of Tsa1p-SO3H as a molecular marker of cumulative oxidative stress in cells. Anti-Tsa1p-SO3H antiserum, which specifically recognizes irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p as well as mammalian 2-Cys Prxs, can be an efficient tool for probing a cell's history of withstanding oxidative stresses. Once impaired by oxidative stress, proteins are generally considered cellular waste and designated for degradation by the proteasome in cells. The longer half-life of irreversibly hyperoxidized Tsa1p-SO3H (Fig. 6) compared with the average half-life of yeast proteins (37Belle A. Tanay A. Bitincka L. Shamir R. O'Shea E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13004-13009Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) suggests an intrinsic role for hyperoxidized Tsa1p-SO3H in oxidatively stressed yeast cells. We identified the enhanced molecular chaperone activity and corresponding oligomeric structure of Tsa1p-SO3H (Figs. 7 and 8). Tsa1p-SO3H functioning as a molecular chaperone in cells is considered to be an advantage over Tsa1p-SH or Tsa1p-SO2H in cells. Presumably, Tsa1p-SO2H has a considerably shorter life span than Tsa1p-SO3H because most of the Tsa1p-SO2His retroreduced to Tsa1p-SH when Srx1 is available. Because Srx1 is a noticeably inefficient enzyme with a very low turnover rate (kcat = 0.1–0.8/min) (28Chang T.-S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and because proper oligomeric structure is responsible for chaperone function, Tsa1p-SO2H seems likely to act as a molecular chaperone only briefly until association with Srx1 for retroreduction. Tsa1p-SH has several different oligomeric forms (Fig. 8B) (31Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), which is the reason why it is a less effective molecular chaperone than Tsa1p-SO3H. Therefore, Tsa1p-SO3H functions as the most effective and longest lived molecular chaperone among the Tsa1p redox forms in yeast cells. Comparing Tsa1p hyperoxidation in yeast cells with that in an in vitro oxidation system, we found that reversible sulfinyl hyperoxidation was the favored reaction in the in vitro system but not in the yeast cells. In contrast, irreversible sulfonyl hyperoxidation was preferred in yeast cells (Fig. 9). Our results show that atmospheric oxygen is not capable of oxidation of Tsa1p-SO2H to Tsa1p-SO3H (Fig. 5), which is consistent with previous observations (40Poole L.B. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12330-12338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kice J.L. Adv. Phys. Org. Chem. 1980; 17: 65-181Google Scholar, 42Hayward M.A. Campbell E.B. Griffith O.W.

Chem. 2007; 282: 35933-35944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Hyperoxidation in vitro takes place only during peroxidatic turnover in the presence of a recycling system including Trx, Trx reductase, and NADPH (17Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Taken together, the in vitro preference of sulfinyl hyperoxidation and the in vivo preference of sulfonyl hyperoxidation suggest the possible existence of an enzymatic system other than the Trx system that facilitates sulfonyl hyperoxidation in yeast cells, and it remains to be elucidated. In summary, we have identified Tsa1p-SO3H and its function as an effective and stable molecular chaperone and as a cellular marker that retains a cell's cumulative index of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2168044451,"The orientation of asymmetric cell division contributes to the organization of cells within a tissue or organ. For example, mirror-image symmetry of the C. elegans vulva is achieved by the opposite division orientation of the vulval precursor cells (VPCs) flanking the axis of symmetry. We characterized the molecular mechanisms contributing to this division pattern. Wnts MOM-2 and LIN-44 are expressed at the axis of symmetry and orient the VPCs toward the center. These Wnts act via Fz/LIN-17 and Ryk/LIN-18, which control β-catenin localization and activate gene transcription. In addition, VPCs on both sides of the axis of symmetry possess a uniform underlying “ground” polarity, established by the instructive activity of Wnt/EGL-20. EGL-20 establishes ground polarity via a novel type of signaling involving the Ror receptor tyrosine kinase CAM-1 and the planar cell polarity component Van Gogh/VANG-1. Thus, tissue polarity is determined by the integration of multiple Wnt pathways."

Ligand binding of the type I and II TGF-β receptors initiate downstream signaling. The role of stromal TGF-β signaling in prostate cancer progression is unknown. In mice, the conditional stromal knockout of the TGF-β type II receptor expression (Tgfbr2fspKO) resulted in the development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and progression to adenocarcinoma within 7 months. Clinically, we observed a loss of TGF-β receptor type II expression in 69% of human prostate cancer-associated stroma, compared to 15% of stroma associated with benign tissues (n=140, P-value <0.0001). To investigate the mechanism of paracrine TGF-β signaling in prostate cancer progression, we compared the effect of the prostatic stromal cells from Tgfbr2fspKO and floxed TGF-β type II receptor Tgfbr2floxE2/floxE2 mice on LNCaP human prostate cancer cells in vitro and tissue recombination xenografts. Induction of LNCaP cell proliferation and tumorigenesis was observed by Tgfbr2fspKO prostate stroma as a result of elevated Wnt3a expression. Neutralizing antibodies to Wnt3a reversed LNCaP tumorigenesis. The TGF-β inhibition of Wnt3a expression was in part through the suppression of Stat3 activity on the Wnt3a promoter. In conclusion, the frequent loss of stromal TGF-β type II receptor expression in human prostate cancer can relieve the paracrine suppression of Wnt3a expression."
https://openalex.org/W1971992755,"Cell migration is essential to cancer invasion and metastasis and is spatially and temporally integrated through transcriptionally dependent and independent mechanisms. As cell migration is studied in vitro, it is important to identify genes that both drive cell migration and are biologically relevant in promoting invasion and metastasis in patients with cancer. Here, gene expression profiling and a high-throughput cell migration system answers this question in human bladder cancer. In vitro migration rates of 40 microarray-profiled human bladder cancer cell lines were measured by radial migration assay. Genes whose expression was either directly or inversely associated with cell migration rate were identified and subsequently evaluated for their association with cancer stage in 61 patients. This analysis identified genes known to be associated with cell invasion such as versican, and novel ones, including metallothionein 1E (MT1E) and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), whose expression correlated positively with cancer cell migration and tumor stage. Using loss of function analysis, we show that MT1E and NNMT are necessary for cancer cell migration. These studies provide a general approach to identify the clinically relevant genes in cancer cell migration and mechanistically implicate two novel genes in this process in human bladder cancer."

However, the functional links between these consecutive steps have not been fully defined.

In addition, Gle1 has a conserved physical association with the initiation factor eIF3, and gle1 mutants display genetic interactions with the eIF3 mutant nip1-1. Strikingly, gle1 mutants have defects in initiation, whereas strains lacking IP6 do not. We propose that Gle1 functions together with IP6 and the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 to regulate termination. However, Gle1 also independently mediates initiation. Thus, Gle1 is uniquely positioned to coordinate the mRNA export and translation mechanisms.

These results directly impact models for perturbation of Gle1 function in pathophysiology. A series of molecular events are required during the life span of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), including transcription, processing, export, translation, and degradation. Completion of these steps underlies all gene expression, and specific quality control mechanisms are predicted to control each (Moore, 2005Moore M.J. From birth to death: The complex lives of eukaryotic mRNAs.Science. 2005; 309: 1514-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). To date, functional connections have been documented between transcription, nuclear processing, and export (Hagiwara and Nojima, 2007Hagiwara M. Nojima T. Cross-talks between transcription and post-transcriptional events within a ‘mRNA factory’.J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 142: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For example, the recruitment of mRNA export factors is coupled to proper transcription and splicing (Kohler and Hurt, 2007Kohler A. Hurt E. Exporting RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Links between mRNA export and translation also exist (Culjkovic et al., 2006Culjkovic B. Topisirovic I. Skrabanek L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21176-21180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanisms are less well defined. Such linkages presumably allow efficient cellular regulation of gene expression at multiple levels simultaneously. Eukaryotic translation is a well-conserved mechanism with four major phases: initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling (for review, see Kapp and Lorsch, 2004Kapp L.D. Lorsch J.R. The molecular mechanics of eukaryotic translation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 657-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Initiation, which involves the assembly of translation-competent ribosomes on mRNA, depends on eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) that stimulate ribosome loading. One of these, eIF3, has 6 to 13 subunits (in S. cerevisiae and humans, respectively) and functions by stimulating complex formation on the 40S subunit (forming the 43S preinitiation complex), recruiting the mRNA, and facilitating start site scanning (Hinnebusch, 2006Hinnebusch A.G. eIF3: A versatile scaffold for translation initiation complexes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Interestingly, eIF3 also regulates dissociation and recycling of the ribosome after termination (Pisarev et al., 2007Pisarev A.V. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. Recycling of eukaryotic posttermination ribosomal complexes.Cell. 2007; 131: 286-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Proper termination of translation is equally critical for gene expression. Termination is primarily regulated by release factors (eRFs) 1 and 3 (Sup45 and Sup35, respectively, in yeast) (Kapp and Lorsch, 2004Kapp L.D. Lorsch J.R. The molecular mechanics of eukaryotic translation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 657-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The stop codon is recognized by eRF1/Sup45, which stimulates ribosomal peptidyl transferase activity to release the completed polypeptide. This activity is enhanced by eRF3, although eRF3 also binds poly(A) binding protein (PABP/Pab1) and might have a role in ribosome recycling (Hoshino et al., 1999Hoshino S. Imai M. Kobayashi T. Uchida N. Katada T. The eukaryotic polypeptide chain releasing factor (eRF3/GSPT) carrying the translation termination signal to the 3′-Poly(A) tail of mRNA. Direct association of erf3/GSPT with polyadenylate-binding protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16677-16680Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Before translation, however, an mRNA must exit the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Initial mRNA export steps require recognition of an export-competent mRNA-protein complex (mRNP) by the transport factor Mex67 (TAP/NXF1 in vertebrates) (Gruter et al., 1998Gruter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. TAP, the human homolog of Mex67p, mediates CTE-dependent RNA export from the nucleus.Mol.

After Mex67-dependent targeting to the NPC, several other factors are necessary for proper export. Gle1 is an essential mRNA export factor in both yeast and human cells (Murphy and Wente, 1996Murphy R. Wente S.R.

In conjunction with the small molecule inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), Gle1 stimulates the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of Dbp5 (Alcazar-Roman et al., 2006Alcazar-Roman A.R. Tran E.J. Guo S.

Dbp5 is an essential member of the DEAD-box helicase family, with a cytoplasmic NPC binding site at Nup159 in yeast that is juxtaposed to the Gle1-Nup42 complex (Hodge et al., 1999Hodge C.A.

Gle1/IP6-activated Dbp5 is converted to a Dbp5-ADP state that triggers mRNP remodeling, displacing proteins to facilitate export directionality (Tran et al., 2007Tran E.J. Zhou Y. Corbett A.H.

Cell. 2007; 28: 850-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Prior studies have suggested coupling between the export and translation mechanisms. The vertebrate TAP/NXF1 promotes the translation of RNA harboring a viral constitutive transport element (CTE) (Jin et al., 2003Jin L. Guzik B.W. Bor Y.C. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Tap and NXT promote translation of unspliced mRNA.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3075-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Evidence also suggests that the cap-binding protein eIF4E regulates export of a subset of cell-cycle-related mRNAs (Culjkovic et al., 2006Culjkovic B. Topisirovic I. Skrabanek L. Ruiz-Gutierrez M. Borden K.L. eIF4E is a central node of an RNA regulon that governs cellular proliferation.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21176-21180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a recent report has revealed a novel function of Dbp5 in translation termination (Gross et al., 2007Gross T. Siepmann A. Sturm D. Windgassen M. Scarcelli J.J. Seedorf M. Cole C.N. Krebber H. The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 functions in translation termination.Science. 2007; 315: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that Gle1 might also have a role in translation via Dbp5 activation. Although Gle1 is enriched at the nuclear rim, Gle1 is also found in the cytoplasm (Del Priore et al., 1996Del Priore V. Snay C.A. Bahr A. Cole C.N. The product of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSS1 gene, identified as a high-copy suppressor of the rat7–1 temperature-sensitive allele of the RAT7/NUP159 nucleoporin, is required for efficient mRNA export.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1601-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Watkins et al., 1998Watkins J.L. Murphy R. Emtage J.L. Wente S.R. The human homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gle1p is required for poly(A)+ RNA export.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 6779-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), supporting the existence of a Gle1 pool for the translation machinery. Full delineation of Gle1 cellular functions is especially important given the causal links reported between mutations in human GLE1 and a severe form of human motor neuron degeneration (Nousiainen et al., 2008Nousiainen H.O. Kestila M. Pakkasjarvi N. Honkala H. Kuure S. Tallila J. Vuopala K. Ignatius J. Herva R. Peltonen L. Mutations in mRNA export mediator GLE1 result in a fetal motoneuron disease.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Gle1 has genetic and physical interactions with translation factors and plays roles in both termination and initiation. Surprisingly, IP6 production is only required for translation termination. This suggests that Gle1 plays two independent roles in translation, one in termination via IP6-dependent activation of Dbp5 and one in initiation that is IP6 and Dbp5 independent. This work reveals an extensive molecular linkage between mRNA export and translation and provides a mechanism for coregulation of critical gene expression steps. To investigate whether Gle1 functions in translation, we employed the S. cerevisiae model system and analyzed a panel of mutant strains for growth defects in the presence of the translation inhibitors cycloheximide and paromomycin (Figure 1A). These inhibitors have been previously used to identify mutants with defects in different aspects of translation (Greenberg et al., 1998Greenberg J.R. Phan L. Gu Z. deSilva A. Apolito C. Sherman F. Hinnebusch A.G. Goldfarb D.S. Nip1p associates with 40 S ribosomes and the Prt1p subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 and is required for efficient translation initiation.J. Biol.

Two temperature-sensitive gle1 mutant strains (gle1-2 and gle1-4) grew similarly to a wild-type control strain at 23°C on rich media. However, at 23°C, both had significantly reduced growth in the presence of cycloheximide and paromomycin (Figure 1A). As controls, strains harboring a wild-type GLE1-expressing plasmid were rescued for the cycloheximide-sensitive growth defect (Figure 1B). Importantly, strains harboring mutations in other genes required for mRNA export through NPCs [rat7-1 (nup159), nup42Δ] were not inhibited for growth under these conditions (Figure 1A). Of note, Nup159 and Nup42 are the respective NPC docking sites for Dbp5 and Gle1 (Hodge et al., 1999Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. Rat8p/Dbp5p is a shuttling transport factor that interacts with Rat7p/Nup159p and Gle1p and suppresses the mRNA export defect of xpo1–1 cells.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, Murphy and Wente, 1996Murphy R.

Dockendorff T.C. Cole C.N.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 939-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This indicated that the hypersensitivity of the gle1 mutants to translation inhibition is not attributed to general defects in mRNA export. If Gle1 is involved in translation, we speculated that it might be associated with ribosomes. Sucrose density fractionation was performed with lysates from wild-type strains, and samples were analyzed by immunoblotting for Gle1. The majority of Gle1 was found in lightest (nonribosome) fractions; however, a significant portion of Gle1 was in the heavier ribosomal fractions, particularly the 80S fraction (Figure 1C, lane 6). This indicated that Gle1 might functionally associate with ribosomal complexes. We next used genetic and biochemical assays to test whether Gle1 plays a role in translation termination. First, gle1 sup45 double-mutant strains were tested for synthetic fitness defects at elevated temperatures (Figure 2A). At 30°C, a semipermissive growth temperature for the gle1-4 strain, growth of the gle1-4 sup45-2 double mutant was inhibited compared to either single mutant. Second, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were conducted to test for Gle1 physical association with termination factors. Using strains with Sup45 and Sup35 epitope-tagged by a tandem affinity purification (TAP) sequence, we isolated complexes from cell lysates and immunoblotted (Figure 2B, top panel). Substantial levels of endogenous Gle1 were coimmunoprecipitated with Sup45-TAP. Minimal Gle1 was detected in isolations from control lysates lacking a TAP-tagged protein. The Gle1:Sup45-TAP interaction was not altered by RNase treatment, indicating that the association is not mediated through RNA (data not shown). Although substantially lower, Gle1 also coimmunoprecipitated with Sup35-TAP (Figure 2B, bottom panel). To investigate whether Gle1 and Sup45 directly bind in vitro, soluble binding assays were performed with bacterially expressed Gle1 and GST-tagged Sup45. Compared to a control assay with GST alone, significantly higher levels of purified Gle1 bound to GST-Sup45 (Figure 2C). Further, Gle1 still bound to GST-Sup45 after RNase treatment (data not shown). Dbp5 also associates with Sup45 (Gross et al., 2007Gross T. Siepmann A. Sturm D. Windgassen M. Scarcelli J.J. Seedorf M. Cole C.N. Krebber H. The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 functions in translation termination.Science. 2007; 315: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that Gle1 and Dbp5 are both physically connected to the translational termination complex. To further examine the functional requirement for Gle1 in termination, we conducted two independent assays for termination efficiency. First, we used strains with an ade2-1 allele harboring an ochre nonsense mutation that are red in color due to lack of functional Ade2 enzyme. Nonsense codon read-through, as a result of termination defects, produces functional Ade2 protein and reduces red pigmentation (Cox, 1965Cox B.S. Psi, a cytoplasmic suppressor of super-suppressor in yeast.Heredity. 1965; 20: 505-521Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Colonies of a wild-type control strain were red in color, whereas the temperature-sensitive sup45-2 mutant was pink (Figure 3A). In stark contrast, gle1-2 sup45-2 and gle1-4 sup45-2 double-mutant colonies were white. This indicated a more severe termination defect in the double mutants than in the respective single-mutant strains. Of note, this effect was observed at the permissive temperature for gle1 mutants (23°C). We also performed an assay that utilizes a tandem β-galactosidase/luciferase reporter separated by a short linker sequence (Stahl et al., 1995Stahl G. Bidou L. Rousset J.P. Cassan M. Versatile vectors to study recoding: Conservation of rules between yeast and mammalian cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Three related plasmid-based reporters are shown in Figure 3B: one with a stop codon inserted in frame into the linker region (TMV), a control lacking the stop codon (TQ), and a control in which a stem-loop from HIV-1 has been inserted in the linker (1789). These plasmids were transformed into control and gle1 mutant strains, and the read-through efficiency was determined at 23°C. Comparison of ratios of luciferase to β-galactosidase activity between the TQ control and the other two plasmids yielded the relative level of abnormal termination read-through. Roughly consistent with previous results (Stahl et al., 1995Stahl G. Bidou L. Rousset J.P. Cassan M. Versatile vectors to study recoding: Conservation of rules between yeast and mammalian cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), wild-type strains showed ∼27% read-through with the TMV construct (Figure 3C). Strikingly, read-through in both gle1-2 and gle1-4 strains was dramatically increased to 71% and 73%, respectively. The effects were specific to normal termination, because read-through efficiency of the stem loop did not change (Figure 3C). Similar results were observed with other stop codon sequences (data not shown). A rat7-1 (nup159) strain showed minimal change (34%), indicating that a general perturbation of mRNA export did not impact translation termination. Another mRNA export mutant strain, nab2-ΔN, also had no appreciable defect in read-through efficiency (Figure S1A available online). The defect was also notably less (36%) in a rat8-2 (dbp5) mutant than in gle1 mutants at 23°C, and others previously reported a modest increase (from ∼16 to 25%) in read-through for the rat8-2 (dbp5) mutant after a brief pulse at the restrictive temperature (Gross et al., 2007Gross T. Siepmann A. Sturm D. Windgassen M. Scarcelli J.J. Seedorf M. Cole C.N. Krebber H. The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 functions in translation termination.Science. 2007; 315: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We concluded that the differences between the rat8-2 (dbp5) and gle1 mutants reflect mutant specificity and highlight the robustness of the gle1 mutant defect. Interestingly, GLE1 overexpression partially rescued the read-through defect of a sup35-21 termination mutant (Figure S1B). Taken together, these data indicate that Gle1 is required for efficient translation termination. We next analyzed the direct functional consequences on termination. Association of Sup35 (eRF3) with the termination complex is a critical step in termination, and others have shown that Dbp5 is required for Sup35 incorporation into termination complexes (Gross et al., 2007Gross T. Siepmann A. Sturm D. Windgassen M. Scarcelli J.J. Seedorf M. Cole C.N. Krebber H. The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 functions in translation termination.Science. 2007; 315: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Sucrose density fractionation was performed with lysates from control and gle1-4 strains containing TAP-tagged Sup35 (Figure 3D). In wild-type samples, significant levels of Sup35-TAP cofractionated with ribosomes (80S and polysomes, determined by OD254). Densitometric analysis revealed that approximately 47% of Sup35-TAP was ribosome associated in wild-type lysates. However, the levels of ribosome-associated Sup35-TAP significantly decreased in lysates from gle1-4 mutant cells, particularly in the later polysome fractions (compare lanes 7–12 in wild-type versus gle1-4), and the majority of the Sup35-TAP shifted to the low-density fraction (lane 2). Quantification showed that the level of ribosome-associated Sup35-TAP in gle1-4 samples (26%) dropped to nearly half that in the wild-type. In the gle1-4 mutant, Sup45, Dbp5, and gle1G384R did not show significant decreases in ribosome association (Figure S1C). We concluded that Gle1 promotes ribosome association of Sup35 in termination. Although consistent with the reported Dbp5 interactions, the association of Gle1 with the translation termination complex was intriguing in light of our prior discovery of a yeast two-hybrid interaction between human Gle1 (hGle1) and the f subunit (p47/S5/ɛ) of the translation initiation factor eIF3 (Rayala et al., 2004Rayala H.J. Kendirgi F. Barry D.M. Majerus P.W. Wente S.R. The mRNA export factor human Gle1 interacts with the nuclear pore complex protein Nup155.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To further examine this interaction in human cells, we transfected plasmids expressing GFP-tagged hGle1 and HA-tagged eIF3f into HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitations with anti-GFP antibodies were performed from total cell lysates (Figure 4A). Immunoblot analysis showed that eIF3f-HA was specifically coisolated with hGle1-GFP. This result confirmed that hGle1 interacts with the eIF3 subunit. Because the human eIF3f subunit is not conserved in S. cerevisiae (Hinnebusch, 2006Hinnebusch A.G. eIF3: A versatile scaffold for translation initiation complexes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), we performed immunoprecipitations from yeast strains expressing TAP-tagged versions of different yeast eIF3 subunits. Endogenous Gle1 was coimmunoprecipitated with Prt1-TAP (eIF3b) (Figure 4B). We did not consistently detect significant coisolation of Gle1 with the other eIF3 subunits tested (Nip1/eIF3c, Rpg1/eIF3a, and Tif34/eIF3i), though this might reflect the stringency of the experimental conditions (Figure 4B and data not shown). Of note, we did not detect Dbp5 in either the Prt1-TAP or Nip1-TAP complexes (data not shown). We concluded that Gle1 physically associates with eIF3 subunits and that these interactions are conserved from yeast to humans. To test for direct physical interactions between Gle1 and eIF3, we performed in vitro binding experiments. Lysates from bacterial cells expressing GST-tagged fusions for each of the five core subunits of yeast eIF3 (Prt1, Nip1, Tif32/Rpg1, Tif34, and Tif35) were incubated with recombinant purified Gle1. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-Gle1 antibodies, and the GST-tagged eIF3 subunits were detected by immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 4C, GST-Prt1 was coisolated with Gle1, and the association was maintained after RNase treatment. GST-Tif35, which is part of a subcomplex with Prt1 (Phan et al., 2001Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valasek L. Nielsen K.H. Hinnebusch A.G. A subcomplex of three eIF3 subunits binds eIF1 and eIF5 and stimulates ribosome binding of mRNA and tRNA(i).EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2954-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), also bound Gle1. The other three subunits did not specifically bind Gle1. Thus, Gle1 physically associates with eIF3, with two potential binding surfaces in Prt1 and Tif35. To test for functional links between Gle1 and eIF3, we generated gle1 nip1 double-mutant strains and assayed growth at a range of different temperatures. At 23°C, no differences were observed when growth between single and double mutants was compared (Figure 4D). However, synthetic fitness defects were detected at 30°C, wherein both the gle1-2 nip1-1 and the gle1-4 nip1-1 strains had inhibited growth compared to the single mutants. In contrast, no synthetic growth defects were observed in rat8-2 (dbp5) nip1-1 or rat7-1 (nup159) nip1-1 double mutants (Figure S2A and data not shown). Further indicating interaction specificity, no synthetic growth defects were observed in gle1 prt1-1 or gle1 rpg1-1 double mutants (data not shown). Thus, both physical and genetic interactions were found between Gle1 and eIF3, and these functions appear to be independent of Dbp5. To address the hypothesis that Gle1 is required for initiation, we first analyzed the monosome to polysome content of different mutant strains using sucrose density sedimentation. At the permissive temperature (23°C), the polysome profile from the gle1-4 mutant cells was similar to that from wild-type cells (Figures 5A and 5C). However, after a temperature shift to 37°C, gle1-4 cells displayed a dramatically elevated monosome peak and reduced polysomes (Figure 5D). This profile indicated a defect in translation initiation because it was similar to those of strains defective for initiation factors, including nip1 (Greenberg et al., 1998Greenberg J.R. Phan L. Gu Z. deSilva A."

In this work, we have used a preosteoblastic cell line to study the effects of dynamic mechanical strain on β-catenin signaling. We found that mechanical strain caused a rapid, transient accumulation of active β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its translocation to the nucleus. This was followed by up-regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin target genes Wisp1 and Cox2, with peak responses at 4 and 1 h of strain, respectively. The increase of β-catenin was temporally related to the activation of Akt and subsequent inactivation of GSK3β, and caveolin-1 was not required for these molecular events. Application of Dkk-1, which disrupts canonical Wnt/LRP5 signaling, did not block strain-induced nuclear translocation of β-catenin or up-regulation of Wisp1 and Cox2 expression. Conditions that increased basal β-catenin levels, such as lithium chloride treatment or repression of caveolin-1 expression, were shown to enhance the effects of strain. In summary, mechanical strain activates Akt and inactivates GSK3β to allow β-catenin translocation, and Wnt signaling through LRP5 is not required for these strain-mediated responses.

https://openalex.org/W2004296273,"Appropriate glycoprotein O-glycosylation is essential for normal development and tissue function in multicellular organisms. To comprehensively assess the developmental and functional impact of altered O-glycosylation, we have extensively analyzed the non-glycosaminoglycan, O-linked glycans expressed in Drosophila embryos. Through multidimensional mass spectrometric analysis of glycans released from glycoproteins by beta-elimination, we detected novel as well as previously reported O-glycans that exhibit developmentally modulated expression. The core 1 mucin-type disaccharide (Galbeta1-3GalNAc) is the predominant glycan in the total profile. HexNAcitol, hexitol, xylosylated hexitol, and branching extension of core 1 with HexNAc (to generate core 2 glycans) were also evident following release and reduction. After Galbeta1-3GalNAc, the next most prevalent glycans were a mixture of novel, isobaric, linear, and branched forms of a glucuronyl core 1 disaccharide. Other less prevalent structures were also extended with HexA, including an O-fucose glycan. Although the expected disaccharide product of the Fringe glycosyltransferase, (GlcNAcbeta1-3)fucitol, was not detectable in whole embryos, mass spectrometry fragmentation and exoglycosidase sensitivity defined a novel glucuronyl trisaccharide as GlcNAcbeta1-3(GlcAbeta1-4)fucitol. Consistent with the spatial distribution of the Fringe function, the GlcA-extended form of the Fringe product was enriched in the dorsal portion of the wing imaginal disc. Furthermore, loss of Fringe activity reduced the prevalence of the O-Fuc trisaccharide. Therefore, O-Fuc glycans necessary for the modulation of important signaling events in Drosophila are, as in vertebrates, substrates for extension beyond the addition of a single HexNAc."
https://openalex.org/W2145095659,"Recent findings have indicated a role for cytochrome P-450 (CYP) epoxygenase-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) in acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). Given that the intracellular concentration of EETs is determined by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), we assessed the influence of the sEH and 11,12-EET on pulmonary artery pressure and HPV in the isolated mouse lung. In lungs from wild-type mice, HPV was significantly increased by sEH inhibition, an effect abolished by pretreatment with CYP epoxygenase inhibitors and the EET antagonist 14,15-EEZE. HPV and EET production were greater in lungs from sEH(-/-) mice than from wild-type mice and sEH inhibition had no further effect on HPV, while MSPPOH and 14,15-EEZE decreased the response. 11,12-EET increased pulmonary artery pressure in a concentration-dependent manner and enhanced HPV via a Rho-dependent mechanism. Both 11,12-EET and hypoxia elicited the membrane translocation of a transient receptor potential (TRP) C6-V5 fusion protein, the latter effect was sensitive to 14,15-EEZE. Moreover, while acute hypoxia and 11,12-EET increased pulmonary pressure in lungs from TRPC6(+/-) mice, lungs from TRPC6(-/-) mice did not respond to either stimuli. These data demonstrate that CYP-derived EETs are involved in HPV and that EET-induced pulmonary contraction under normoxic and hypoxic conditions involves a TRPC6-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2136532823,"Mass spectrometry technologies for measurement of cellular metabolism are opening new avenues to explore drug activity. Trimethoprim is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Kinetic flux profiling with (15)N-labeled ammonia in Escherichia coli reveals that trimethoprim leads to blockade not only of DHFR but also of another critical enzyme of folate metabolism: folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FP-gamma-GS). Inhibition of FP-gamma-GS is not directly due to trimethoprim. Instead, it arises from accumulation of DHFR's substrate dihydrofolate, which we show is a potent FP-gamma-GS inhibitor. Thus, owing to the inherent connectivity of the metabolic network, falling DHFR activity leads to falling FP-gamma-GS activity in a domino-like cascade. This cascade results in complex folate dynamics, and its incorporation in a computational model of folate metabolism recapitulates the dynamics observed experimentally. These results highlight the potential for quantitative analysis of cellular metabolism to reveal mechanisms of drug action."

HCV non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) binds to the N-terminal NS3 protease domain to stimulate NS3 serine protease activity. In addition, the NS3 protease domain enhances the RNA binding, ATPase, and RNA unwinding activities of the C-terminal NS3 helicase domain (NS3hel). To determine whether NS3hel enhances the NS3 serine protease activity, we purified truncated and full-length NS3-4A complexes and examined their serine protease activities under a variety of salt and pH conditions. Our results indicate that the helicase domain enhances serine protease activity, just as the protease domain enhances helicase activity. Thus, the two enzymatic domains of NS3-4A are highly interdependent. This is the first time that such a complete interdependence has been demonstrated for a multifunctional, single chain enzyme. NS3-4A domain interdependence has important implications for function during the viral lifecycle as well as for the design of inhibitor screens that target the NS3-4A protease."
https://openalex.org/W2010375302,"Cyclic GMP serves as the second messenger in visual transduction, linking photon absorption by rhodopsin to the activity of ion channels. Synthesis of cGMP in photoreceptors is supported by a pair of retina-specific guanylyl cyclases, retGC1 and -2. Two neuronal calcium sensors, GCAP1 and GCAP2, confer Ca(2+) sensitivity to guanylyl cyclase activity, but the importance and the contribution of each GCAP is controversial. To explore this issue, the gene GUCA1B, coding for GCAP2, was disrupted in mice, and the capacity for knock-out rods to regulate retGC and generate photoresponses was tested. The knock-out did not compromise rod viability or alter outer segment ultrastructure. Levels of retGC1, retGC2, and GCAP-1 expression did not undergo compensatory changes, but the absence of GCAP2 affected guanylyl cyclase activity in two ways; (a) the maximal rate of cGMP synthesis at low [Ca(2+)] dropped 2-fold and (b) the half-maximal rate of cGMP synthesis was attained at a higher than normal [Ca(2+)]. The addition of an antibody raised against mouse GCAP2 produced similar effects on the guanylyl cyclase activity in wild type retinas. Flash responses of GCAP2 knock-out rods recovered more slowly than normal. Knock-out rods became more sensitive to flashes and to steps of illumination but tended to saturate at lower intensities, as compared with wild type rods. Therefore, GCAP2 regulation of guanylyl cyclase activity quickens the recovery of flash and step responses and adjusts the operating range of rods to higher intensities of ambient illumination."
https://openalex.org/W2113773206,"Ezrin is a multidomain protein providing regulated membrane-cytoskeleton contacts that play a role in cell differentiation, adhesion, and migration. Within the cytosol of resting cells ezrin resides in an autoinhibited conformation in which the N- and C-terminal ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) association domains (ERMADs) interact with one another. Activation of the ezrin membrane-cytoskeleton linker function requires an opening of this interdomain association that can result from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding to the N-ERMAD and threonine 567 phosphorylation in the C-ERMAD. We have shown that ezrin can also be activated by Ca2+-dependent binding of the EF-hand protein S100P. We now provide a quantitative analysis of this interaction and map the respective binding sites to the F2 lobe in the ezrin N-ERMAD and a stretch of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal extension of S100P. Phospholipid binding assays reveal that S100P and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate compete to some extent for at least partially overlapping binding sites in N-ERMAD. Using interaction-competent as well as interaction-incompetent S100P derivatives and permanently active ezrin mutants, we also show that the protein interaction and a resulting activation of ezrin promote the transendothelial migration of tumor cells. Thus, a prometastatic role of ezrin and S100P that had been proposed based on their overexpression in highly metastatic cancers is probably due to a direct interaction between the two proteins and the S100P-mediated activation of ezrin.

(ezrin/radixin/moesin) family proteins function as membrane-cytoskeleton linkers in a number of dynamic processes ranging from the formation and maintenance of actin-rich surface structures such as microvilli to the control of cell-cell and cell-cell matrix contacts and the regulation of cell migration (for review, see Refs. 1Bretscher A.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition to providing direct physical scaffolds in the membrane skeleton, ERM proteins also function in diverse aspects of intracellular signaling, for example by directly interacting with effectors of Rho GTPase signaling (for review, see Ref. 6Ivetic A. Ridley A.J. Immunology. 2004; 112: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The three-modular structure of ERM proteins is ideally suited for carrying out cross-linking and signaling functions in a regulated manner. The N-terminal domain, also known as N-terminal ERM association domain (N-ERMAD) or FERM domain (for Four point one ERM), is a conserved element shared with other members of the band 4.1 superfamily of proteins. It is followed by a central α-helical domain with the propensity to form coiled-coils and a C-terminal ERMAD. Binding sites for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and several plasma membrane-resident proteins like the hyaluronate receptor CD44, and different intercellular cell adhesion molecules are located in the N-ERMAD. The C-ERMAD, on the other hand, contains an F-actin binding site, whereas the central region appears to contribute to the binding of other protein ligands like the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the case of ezrin (1Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). However, in resting, non-stimulated cells most of these binding sites are masked through intra- and intermolecular interactions between the N- and C-ERMADs, thereby keeping ERM proteins in an autoinhibited or dormant state. Specifically, binding sites for the cytoplasmic tails of plasma membrane proteins and for F-actin are inaccessible in dormant ERM proteins. Hence, inactive ERM proteins reside in the cytoplasm, and it requires cell stimulation, e.g. after exposure to growth factors, to activate the membrane-cytoskeleton cross-linking function of ERM proteins and recruit them to the membrane. Activation of ERM proteins can occur by different means and has been studied most extensively for ezrin. Here phosphorylation at threonine 567 in the C-ERMAD, a target for protein kinase Cα acting downstream of activated plasma membrane receptors, leads to the activation of the ezrin membrane-cytoskeleton linking function (7Ng T. Parsons M. Hughes W.E. Monypenny J. Zicha D. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Gschmeissner S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2723-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Ezrin also represents a substrate of different receptor tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphorylation, e.g. occurring after activation of the Kit and Flt3 receptors, has recently been shown to activate a metastasis-promoting function of ezrin (8Monni R. Haddaoui L. Naba A. Gallais I. Arpin M. Mayeux P. Moreau-Gachelin F. Blood. 2008; 111: 3163-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In line with a role of ezrin in tumor progression and invasion are the observations that it is required for malignant glioma cell invasion (9Wick W. Grimmel C. Wild-Bode C. Platten M. Arpin M. Weller M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3360-3368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Rho/ROCK-dependent tumor cell motility in three-dimensional matrices (10Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression of ezrin is increased in a number of highly metastatic cancers (for review, see Refs. 11McClatchey A.I. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar and 12Curto M. McClatchey A.I. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 113-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). At least partial activation of ezrin can also occur after PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding in the N-ERMAD (for review, see Refs. 1Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 13Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, and 14Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 187-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). We previously identified the Ca2+-binding protein S100P as a novel activator of ezrin. The Ca2+-regulated binding of S100P to ezrin unmasks the F-actin binding site thereby activating the ezrin molecule (15Koltzscher M. Neumann C. Konig S. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2372-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). S100P is a member of the S100 family of EF-hand Ca2+ binding proteins that function by regulating the activity of effector proteins in their Ca2+-bound state. Several S100 proteins are up-regulated in human tumor cells and have been proposed to function in metastatic processes (for review, see Ref. 16Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). These include S100P whose expression is markedly increased in highly metastatic non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) correlating with an increased migration/invasion (17Diederichs S. Bulk E. Steffen B. Ji P. Tickenbrock L. Lang K. Zänker K.S. Metzger R. Schneider P.M. Gerke V. Thomas M. Berdel W.E. Serve H. Müller-Tidow C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5564-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Based on the apparent coregulation of the ezrin and S100P expression in metastatic tumors, we further examined the ezrin-S100P interaction and analyzed whether the S100P-mediated activation of ezrin contributes to an increased migratory phenotype of cancer cells. We show that ezrin and S100P co-localize in stimulated cells and can be co-immunoprecipitated in the presence of Ca2+. The affinity of complex formation was measured by surface plasmon resonance experiments, and structural parameters of the S100P-ezrin interaction were elucidated by mapping the respective binding sites. This led to the generation of a S100P mutant incapable of ezrin binding that served as an inert control in cell migration analyses, establishing a role of ezrin-S100P complex formation in the transendothelial migration of NSCLCs. Construction of Plasmids—The pET28a+ and pEGFP-C2 constructs encoding N-terminal histidine- or GFP-tagged human WT S100P, human WT ezrin, and ezrin N-ERMAD (aa 1–323) had been described previously (15Koltzscher M. Neumann C. Konig S. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2372-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the human S100P deletion mutants S100P 91aa and S100P 87aa and the ezrin deletion mutants ezrin 233aa, ezrin 197aa, ezrin 173aa and ezrin 82aa were generated by polymerase chain reactions using the pET28a+ plasmids containing WT S100P and WT ezrin as templates. For the recombinant expression of non-tagged proteins, the cDNAs of N-ERMAD and the S100P deletion mutants were cloned into a pET23a+ (Novagen, Madison, WI) vector modified to express the recombinant protein without T7 tag, and in the case of S100P WT, into the pKK223-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). PCR was performed using Turbo Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotide primers containing the appropriate stop codons and restriction enzyme sites. The cDNA encoding the T567D ezrin mutant protein was generated by using accordingly mutated primers in the PCR reaction. For bacterial protein expression of His- or GST-tagged derivatives, the mutant cDNAs were cloned into the pET28a+ vector (Novagen) inframe with the 6× His tag (S100P derivatives) or into the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with the GST tag (ezrin derivatives). For migration and localization analyses, coding sequences of S100P deletion constructs and ezrin T567D were cloned into the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to yield in-frame fusion proteins with an N-terminal EGFP. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were cultured in MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS gold (PAA, Linz, Austria), 20 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 10 μg/ml hydrocortisone. SK-BR-3 cells (human mammary gland) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. The human lung squamous carcinoma cell line HTB-58 was cultured in Eagle's modified essential medium supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. For the generation of stable cell lines expressing GFP-tagged WT S100P, S100P deletion mutants, ezrin T567D, or GFP alone, HTB-58 cells were transfected with the appropriate pEGFP fusion constructs and selected using the antibiotic G418 (750 μg/ml). To eliminate clone-specific effects mixed cultures of selected cell lines were used in all experiments. The expression of the GFP constructs was verified by Western blotting employing anti-EGFP antibodies as well as by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Immunofluorescence Staining—To induce cell stimulation accompanied by an intracellular Ca2+ transient, SK-BR-3 cells grown on coverslips were transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum and cultured for 16 h. 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum was then added, and cells were incubated for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After quenching in 50 mm NH4Cl for 7 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min and incubated in PBS supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Cells were then first incubated with an anti-ezrin polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NW) for 30 min and washed 3 times with 2% bovine serum albumin, PBS followed by incubation with an anti-S100P mouse monoclonal antibody (generated by injecting mice with purified His-tagged human S100P) for 30 min. After washing three times with PBS, primary antibodies were stained with Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Red-X-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Cells were washed 3 times with PBS, once with distilled H2O, mounted in Mowiol, and analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Transient Transfection and Co-immunoprecipitation—Transient transfection of SK-BR-3 cells with the GFP-WT S100P expression construct was carried out by electroporation (10 μg of DNA, 200 V, 1050 microfarads) of trypsinized cells in 4-mm cuvettes. After transfection cells were seeded on 100-mm cell culture dishes and 6 h after transfection transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum and cultured for 16 h. Cells were then lysed in 1.1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g, and the resulting post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was dialyzed against buffer D (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, complete protease-inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After dialysis the PNS was adjusted to 0.5 mm CaCl2, centrifuged for 20 min at 100,000 × g, and incubated overnight with 10 μg of anti-ezrin polyclonal rabbit antibodies coupled to 100 μl Dynabeads® M-280 sheep anti-rabbit (Invitrogen). As a control, an equal amount of PNS was incubated in parallel with nonspecific anti-mouse IgG polyclonal rabbit antibodies (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) coupled to 100 μl of Dynabeads® M-280 sheep anti-rabbit. Beads were washed 3 times with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm CaCl2 in PBS and then treated for 5 min at 95 °C with an equal volume of 4× SDS sample buffer. Proteins released from the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Recombinant Expression and Purification of S100P and Ezrin—pET28a+ constructs encoding N-terminal His-tagged WT and mutant S100P as well as pGEX4T-1 constructs encoding WT ezrin and ezrin deletion mutants with an N-terminal GST tag were used to transform Escherichia coli (strain BL21 (DE3)pLysS). Transformed bacteria were grown to an A600 of 0.6, and recombinant protein expression was then induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h of incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 mm PMSF). Subsequently, cells were lysed by repeated freeze/thaw cycles (3 times) and sonication, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. For preparation of WT and mutant S100P, the remaining supernatant was adjusted to a Ca2+ concentration of 5 mm and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated in lysis buffer containing 0.5 mm Ca2+ instead of EGTA. After extensive washing with the same buffer, bound S100P proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 1 mm EGTA. S100P-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 mm PMSF, and applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) column equilibrated in the same buffer. S100P proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF. In the case of GST-tagged WT ezrin and ezrin deletion mutants the cleared bacterial lysates were applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in PBS containing 1.5 mm PMSF. After extensive washing with the same buffer, bound ezrin derivatives were eluted with 100 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For preparation of non-tagged WT S100P and S100P deletion mutants, the cleared bacterial lysates were applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column and purified by developing the column as described above for the His-tagged S100P proteins. The non-tagged N-ERMAD protein was purified as described (18Smith W.J. Cerione R.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1359-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Real Time Binding Measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—SPR experiments were performed with a Biacore 3000 system (GE Healthcare). Purified N-ERMAD, S100P, or the mutants indicated were immobilized on a sensor surface, and the respective binding partners (analytes) were passed over the chip in a mobile aqueous phase. Sensor Chip CM5 was obtained from GE Healthcare. The HBS-P, 0.5 mm CaCl2 flow buffer consisted of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.5 mm CaCl2 and was filtered through 0.22-μm filters (Millipore) and degassed before use. Immobilization on the sensor chips employed amine coupling according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, using a flow rate of 5 μl/min, the chip surface was activated with an 8-min injection of a freshly prepared 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide solution followed by injection of the protein to be coupled, typically at a concentration of 30 μg/ml in acetate buffer (pH 5.5 for N-ERMAD and 4.5 for S100P immobilization). When the desired level of immobilization was achieved, unreacted N-hydroxy-succinimide-ester groups were blocked with a 7-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride. Sensograms (response units versus time) were recorded at 25 °C with a typical flow rate of 40 μl/min and injection times of 3 min. Controls for the contribution of the change in bulk refractive index were performed in parallel with blank flow cells that were activated with N-ethyl-N-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxy-succinimide and deactivated with ethanolamine in the absence of protein to be coupled and subtracted from all binding sensograms. Blank injections of the running buffer were also performed and subtracted from all the kinetic measurements. To analyze the binding of WT S100P and S100P 87aa to the immobilized N-ERMAD, different concentrations of WT S100P and S100P 87aa in the flow buffer (concentration range between 0.006 and 3.5 μm) were injected into the flow cells. Each injection was repeated at least 2-fold for reproducibility. Regeneration of the surface was performed using two short pulses of HBS-P, 3 mm EGTA buffer and glycine/HCl buffer, pH 2.5. Approximate equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were obtained by measuring the equilibrium resonance (Req) units at several ligand concentrations at equilibrium. The affinity of the interaction, i.e. the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), was determined from the level of binding at equilibrium as a function of the sample concentrations by BIAevalution version 4.1 software (Biacore, Inc.). The steady state binding level is related to the concentration according to the Scatchard equation: Req/C = KARmax - ReqKA, where Rmax is the resonance signal at saturation, C is the concentration of free analyte, and KA is the equilibrium association constant. Column-based Binding Assays—The interaction between the different S100P and ezrin derivatives was also analyzed using affinity columns containing one of the binding partners in an immobilized form. To prepare affinity columns, GST-tagged proteins (N-ERMAD, ezrin 233aa, ezrin 197aa, ezrin 173aa, and ezrin 82aa) were dialyzed against PBS containing 1.5 mm PMSF and rebound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The material was transferred to 5 ml of polypropylene columns (Pierce) and washed with PBS containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 to remove unbound protein and adjust the fluid phase to an elevated Ca2+ concentration. His-tagged S100P derivatives were then added in the fluid phase, the columns were washed extensively with PBS containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 to remove all non-specifically bound protein, and Ca2+-dependently bound proteins were eluted with PBS containing 1 mm EGTA. Columns were then stripped with 100 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For the reciprocal experiments, His-tagged proteins (purified WT or mutant S100P) were dialyzed against buffer A (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 mm PMSF) and rebound to Ni-NTA-agarose. 500 μg of purified His-tagged protein were mixed with 250 μl of a 50% Ni-NTA agarose slurry equilibrated in buffer A and incubated for at least 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The mixtures were then transferred to the 5-ml polypropylene columns and washed with buffer A to remove unbound protein. Subsequently, purified GST-tagged proteins (N-ERMAD, ezrin 233aa, ezrin 197aa, ezrin 173aa, ezrin 82aa) were added to the column in the fluid phase. After washing with 10 column volumes of buffer A, Ca2+-dependent bound proteins were eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer B (same as buffer A but containing 1 mm EGTA instead of 0.5 mm CaCl2). The columns were stripped of His-tagged proteins by elution with 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. Samples of each elution and washing step were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting with the respective antibodies. Chemical Cross-linking—For chemical cross-linking experiments, 4 μg of the different S100P derivatives were dialyzed against buffer C (0.2 m Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Ca2+ was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the samples were incubated with the homobifunctional cross-linker BS3 (Sulfo-DSS) (final concentration 5 mm) at 22 °C for 45 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2% SDS (w/v) and 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Liposome Co-sedimentation Assays—Small unilamellar liposomes containing 97% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) and 3% PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Avanti Polar Lipids) were prepared by sonication in buffer L (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaN3, 50 μm CaCl2). Typically this yielded vesicles in the size range of 15–50 nm that could be pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 × g. For liposome co-sedimentation assays 100 μg of the POPC/PtdIns(4,5)P2 liposomes were mixed with 20 μg of N-ERMAD and 20 μg of the S100P derivative indicated, and the mixture was adjusted to a total volume of 200 μl with buffer L. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the liposomes were pelleted by high speed centrifugation (20 min 100,000 × g) and washed 2 times in buffer L. The resulting supernatants (Sn1, unbound fraction; Sn2, Sn3, wash fractions) and the remaining pellets were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. Controls were carried out in buffer L without Ca2+ but containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.1 mm EGTA. They showed the same amount of N-ERMAD binding that was, however, not affected by the addition of S100P. Additional control experiments employed PtdIns(4,5)P2-free liposomes that did not show N-ERMAD binding. Furthermore, controls revealed that the different S100P derivatives were not capable of binding to the POPC- or POPC/PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes. Lipid Plate Binding Assay—Phosphoinositide binding was also analyzed by a lipid-plate assay employing immobilized PtdIns(4,5)P2 (19Rescher U. Ruhe D. Ludwig C. Zobiack N. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3473-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, wells of 96-well microtiter plates (F96 Maxisorp, Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) were coated with 100 ng of PtdIns(4,5)P2, air-dried, and then blocked for 1 h with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Purified, His-tagged N-ERMAD in the absence or presence of the S100P derivatives indicated (800 ng/well and protein) was incubated in the PtdIns(4,5)P2-coated wells for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 50 μm CaCl2. Subsequently, the wells were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween, and the amount of lipid-bound N-ERMAD was determined by a colorimetric reaction using monoclonal anti-Penta-His antibodies (Qiagen), peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, and 3.3′, 5.5′-tetramethyl benzidine substrate (Perbio, Bonn, Germany). Control reactions using the same conditions but PBS without Ca2+ yielded no effect of any of the S100P derivatives on the binding of N-ERMAD to immobilized PtdIns(4,5)P2. For statistical evaluation, the amount of N-ERMAD bound to the immobilized PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the absence of Ca2+ was set to 100%. The values obtained for binding in the presence of Ca2+, i.e. under conditions where N-ERMAD-S100P complex formation occurs, were then calculated in relation to these 100% with lower values, indicating inhibition of lipid binding. Data were obtained in triplicates of at least four independent experiments, and statistical significance was calculated by unpaired Student's t test. Transendothelial Migration Analysis—For transendothelial migration experiments, 2.2 × 105 HMEC-1 were seeded into the upper chamber of a Transwell device (Costar, Bodenheim, Germany) and cultivated for 48 h on the microporous (8 μm) filter support to generate a confluent monolayer with a defined transendothelial electrical resistance (20Kielbassa-Schnepp K. Strey A. Janning A. Missiaen L. Nilius B. Gerke V. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 5 × 105 HTB-58 cells expressing EGFP alone or the different EGFP-S100P or EGFP-ezrin mutants were then added to the upper chamber, and their transendothelial migration was quantified by counting the number of cells that had migrated into the lower chamber within a time period of 16 h. Flow cytometry of the GFP-positive cells employed a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Characterization of the Ezrin-S100P Interaction—To verify that the ezrin-S100P interaction identified previously (15Koltzscher M. Neumann C. Konig S. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2372-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) also occurs in vivo, we first carried out co-localization analyses employing SK-BR-3 human mammary epithelial cells. These cells were chosen because they can be induced by serum stimulation to form abundant ezrin-positive surface protrusions and microvilli. Fig. 1A shows that S100P is also found in these surface structures showing a high degree of co-localization with ezrin. The same co-localization is seen for ectopically expressed GFP-S100P (not shown). We then perf"
https://openalex.org/W2112225261,"Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles have been used successfully as an intracellular contrast agent for nuclear MRI cell tracking in vivo. We present a method of detecting intracellular SPIO colloid uptake in live cells using cell magnetophoresis, with potential applications in measuring intracellular MRI contrast uptake. The method was evaluated by measuring shifts in mean and distribution of the cell magnetophoretic mobility, and the concomitant changes in population frequency of the magnetically positive cells when compared to the unmanipulated negative control. Seven different transfection agent (TA) -SPIO complexes based on dendrimer, lipid, and polyethylenimine compounds were used as test standards, in combination with 3 different cell types: mesenchymal stem cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and cultured KG-1a hematopoietic stem cells. Transfectol (TRA) -SPIO incubation resulted in the highest frequency of magnetically positive cells (>90%), and Fugene 6 (FUG) -SPIO incubation the lowest, below that when using SPIO alone. A highly regular process of cell magnetophoresis was amenable to intracellular iron mass calculations. The results were consistent in all the cell types studied and with other reports. The cell magnetophoresis depends on the presence of high-spin iron species and is therefore expected to be directly related to the cell MRI contrast level."
https://openalex.org/W2061913729,"The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) regulates synaptic function, but little is known about specific UPP targets and mechanisms in mammalian synapses. We report here that the SCFβ-TRCP complex, a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets the postsynaptic spine-associated Rap GTPase activating protein (SPAR) for degradation in neurons. SPAR degradation by SCFβ-TRCP depended on the activity-inducible protein kinase Polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2). In the presence of Plk2, SPAR physically associated with the SCFβ-TRCP complex through a canonical phosphodegron. In hippocampal neurons, disruption of the SCFβ-TRCP complex by overexpression of dominant interfering β-TRCP or Cul1 constructs prevented Plk2-dependent degradation of SPAR. Our results identify a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates degradation of a key postsynaptic regulator of synaptic morphology and function.

Our results identify a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates degradation of a key postsynaptic regulator of synaptic morphology and function. Dendritic spines are tiny, actin-rich, dynamic protrusions radiating from the dendritic shaft of principal neurons and comprise the postsynaptic compartment of most glutamatergic synapses of the mammalian brain. The size and morphology of dendritic spines are correlated with their function. Thus, large mushroom-shaped spines tend to be more stable than small thin spines, contain more α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid receptors, and mediate stronger synaptic connections (1Kasai H. Matsuzaki M. Noguchi J. Yasumatsu N. Nakahara H. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 2Tada T. Sheng M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The morphology of spines, which changes during development and in response to synaptic activity, is influenced by multiple signaling pathways that emanate from postsynaptic glutamate receptors and act upon the actin cytoskeleton and associated proteins in the postsynaptic density (PSD) 5The abbreviations used are: PSD, postsynaptic density; Ub, ubiquitin; GAP, GTPase activating protein; SPAR, spine-associated Rap GTPase activating protein; Plk2, Polo-like kinase 2; UPP, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SCF, Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein; WT, wild type; RFP, red fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference; DIV, days in vitro; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; β-TRCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein. 5The abbreviations used are: PSD, postsynaptic density; Ub, ubiquitin; GAP, GTPase activating protein; SPAR, spine-associated Rap GTPase activating protein; Plk2, Polo-like kinase 2; UPP, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SCF, Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein; WT, wild type; RFP, red fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference; DIV, days in vitro; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; β-TRCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein.

Yang S. Rudolph-Correia S. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SPAR results in enlargement of spine heads, an effect dependent upon the ability of SPAR to rearrange actin and function as a RapGAP. In contrast, dominant-negative SPAR produces long and thin spines (5Pak D.T. Yang S. Rudolph-Correia S. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). SPAR, in turn, is regulated by polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2; also known as serum-inducible serine/threonine kinase (SNK)) (6Pak D.T. Sheng M. Science. 2003; 302: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Synaptic activity induces Plk2 expression (6Pak D.T. Sheng M.

Neuron. 2008; 58: 571-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).SPAR turnover depends upon the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) since ubiquitinated SPAR accumulates in the presence of active Plk2 when proteasomes are inhibited (6Pak D.T. Sheng M. Science. 2003; 302: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This necessitates the involvement of at least one E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase targeting SPAR. More generally, the UPP is known to play an important role in the activity-dependent turnover of several proteins in the PSD (10Ehlers M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), a process that likely involves activity-driven redistribution of proteasomes into spines (11Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Nature. 2006; 441: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, as is the case for many neuronal processes in which the UPP has been implicated, the molecular and regulatory components upstream of the proteasome responsible for targeting the ubiquitination of SPAR and other PSD proteins are unknown.Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein (SCF) complexes are one of the best understood E3 Ub-ligases with regard to mechanism of substrate recognition (12Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 13Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). By recruiting substrates to the SCF complex, F-box proteins dramatically increase the specificity and rate of ubiquitin transfer to substrates. The F-box protein β-TRCP has been shown to target critical signaling proteins for degradation, including IκBα, β-catenin, and Cdc25A (14Jin J. Shirogane T. Xu L. Nalepa G. Qin J. Elledge S.J.

Here, we identifyβ-TRCP as the F-box protein that targets Plk2-phosphorylated SPAR for degradation in neurons. Biochemical studies revealed that SPAR interacted with the SCFβ-TRCP complex through a canonical β-TRCP phosphodegron. Induction of Plk2 activity led to SPAR turnover, and this was prevented by dominant negative disruption of the SCFβ-TRCP complex or point mutations in the phosphodegron of SPAR preventing SPAR from interacting with β-TRCP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Plasmids—Expression plasmids expressing cDNA with a CMV promoter for myc-SPAR, HA-Plk2, and HA-Plk2K108M were previously described (6Pak D.T.

Yang S. Rudolph-Correia S. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and cloned into pENTR-6, compatible with the GATEway cloning system (Invitrogen). These were used for in vitro LR clonase reactions into pDEST-53 (for GFP-SPAR) or pDEST-N-myc (for myc-SPAR fragments). Point mutations in the β-TRCP phosphodegron were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis using pCMV-myc-SPAR or pDEST-myc-Act2 as templates. pCMV-myc-CKIϵ and pCMV-GSK3β were previously described (19Shirogane T.

Cells were typically harvested ∼24-30 h post-transfection, except for RNAi experiments where cells were harvested 96 h post-transfection after a 48-h selection with puromycin (1 μg/ml) to enrich for a transfected population. Treatment of transfected cells with cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) began 96 h post-transfection.For assays examining myc-SPAR abundance and turnover, cell pellets were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and cleared lysates were resolved on 4-12% gradient Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels. Resolved proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose (250 mA, 2 h) and immunoblotted with c-Myc 9E10 (sc-40, Santa-Cruz), HA F-7 (sc-7392, Santa Cruz), Cdk2 M2 (sc-163, Santa Cruz), β-TRCP1 (Cell Signaling), Cul1 (71-8700, Invitrogen/Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and Cdc25A Ab-3 (MS-640-P0, NeoMarkers), as indicated. Promega horseradish peroxidase-conjugate anti-mouse IgG (W402B) and anti-rabbit IgG (W401B) were used for secondary detection.For single-cell immunofluorescence RNAi experiments, HEK293T cells were seeded onto 18-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (30 μg/ml) and laminin (2 μg/ml) and transfected at 20-30% confluency using calcium phosphate. Cells were fixed 96 h post-transfection for 10 min at room temperature using 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline, and the GFP-SPAR signal was amplified using anti-GFP (A-11122, Invitrogen) at 1:1000 in GDB buffer (1% gelatin, 5% Triton X-100, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2 m NaCl) (6Pak D.T. Sheng M. Science. 2003; 302: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar).Binding and ubiquitination detection assays were performed with cleared whole cell lysates from transfected HEK293T cells in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40. In the case of ubiquitination detection assays, cells were treated with 25 μm MG-132 before harvesting, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide was added to the lysis buffer. GSH-Sepharose or c-Myc 9E10-agarose beads (10 μl per condition) were pre-washed in lysis buffer and incubated with 400 μg of lysate for 2 h at 4 °C while rocking. Beads were then washed 3-4 times in lysis buffer, and bound protein was eluded in 2× Laemmli protein loading buffer containing SDS. Both GSH-bound samples and crude extract were resolved on 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. Myc-bound samples were resolved on 6% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gels. Samples were then transferred from the SDS-PAGE onto nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with anti-Myc, anti-HA, anti-FLAG (F3165, Sigma), or anti-GST (26H1, Cell Signaling), as indicated.Neuron Cultures and Immunostaining—Medium-density dissociated hippocampal cultures were prepared and cultured from E19 Long Evans rat hippocampi as previously described (5Pak D.T. Yang S. Rudolph-Correia S. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Neurons were transfected at DIV16, “super-infected” at DIV18, and fixed ∼18 h post-infection (DIV19) in 1% paraformaldehyde for 2 min at room temperature followed by -20 °C methanol for 10 min. Immunostaining was performed in GDB buffer (6Pak D.T. Sheng M. Science. 2003; 302: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) using rabbit SPAR polyclonal antibodies (5Pak D.T. Yang S. Rudolph-Correia S. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma).Microscopy and Quantification—Fixed neurons and HEK293T cells were imaged with an LSM510 confocal system (Zeiss). A 40× oil immersion lens was used for confocal microscopy, and each image was comprised of 0.5-μm z-stacks projected into a single plane. SPAR immunostaining analysis was performed with MetaMorph Software and carried out blinded with respect to the experimental conditions. Quantification of SPAR puncta involved subjecting images stained for endogenous SPAR to threshold and was carried out from somatic and proximal dendritic regions from transfected, infected, or transfected plus superinfected cells. All SPAR intensity measurements represent integrated SPAR immunostaining intensity per area and are normalized to neighboring uninfected and untransfected cells.Statistical Analysis—Statistical Methods are described in the figures legends.RESULTSPlk2-dependent SPAR Degradation Requires a Cul1-based E3 Ub-ligase—SPAR turnover in neurons is controlled through the UPP in a manner that requires active Plk2 protein kinase (6Pak D.T. Sheng M. Science. 2003; 302: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Such regulation is reminiscent of the mechanism employed by most SCF E3 Ub-ligases, where substrate recognition depends upon upstream kinase signaling cascades. A central subunit of the SCF complex is the Cul1 scaffold protein. To explore the idea that SPAR turnover is regulated by an SCF E3 Ub-ligase, we made use of a previously reported dominant-negative version of Cul1 (DNCul1). This C-terminal-truncated protein binds substrates but fails to associate with ubiquitin-charged E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, thereby preventing substrate turnover (14Jin J. Shirogane T. Xu L. Nalepa G. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3062-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 19Shirogane T. Jin J. Ang X.L. Harper J.W. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 8375-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Cultured hippocampal neurons (16 days in vitro (DIV16)) were transfected with DNCul1 and then super-infected 2 days later with Sindbis virus driving expression of FLAG-tagged Plk2 for ∼18 h to promote degradation of endogenous SPAR (6Pak D.T. Sheng M. Science. 2003; 302: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We infected at a titer that resulted in ∼10% infection rate of cells already transfected with DNCul1 (Fig. 1, A-C). The option of co-transfecting plasmids driving Plk2 expression was precluded by the low Plk2 expression achievable using this method. 6D. P. Seeburg, unpublished observation. In the absence of Plk2 infection, transfection of control empty vector (pcDNA3.1) or a control dominant-negative Cullin 3 (DNCul3), which disrupts structurally related but functionally distinct Cul3-based complexes (23Cullinan S.B. Gordan J.D. Jin J. Harper J.W. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8477-8486Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), had no effect on endogenous SPAR levels relative to nearby untransfected and uninfected cells as assessed by quantitative immunostaining (Fig. 1, A and C, quantified in D). Uninfected cells overexpressing DNCul1 displayed a trend toward increased SPAR levels compared with nearby untransfected cells, but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.13; Fig. 1B, quantified in D).In Plk2-infected but otherwise untransfected neurons, endogenous SPAR levels were close to undetectable (Fig. 1, A-C, arrowheads; quantified in E), in agreement with our previous findings (6Pak D.T. Sheng M. Science. 2003; 302: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In Plk2-infected cells that had been previously transfected with control empty vector or DNCul3, SPAR levels fell to the same extent as in cells only infected with Plk2 (Fig. 1, A and C, compare SPAR staining in cells marked by arrowheads (infected) and arrows (transfected and infected); quantified in E). However, in cells transfected with DNCul1, infection with Plk2 Sindbis virus failed to reduce SPAR levels (Fig. 1B, notice the yellow color in cells marked by arrows, indicating the presence of both SPAR (green) and Plk2 (red); quantified in E). Thus, Plk2-driven SPAR degradation in neurons depended upon a Cul1-based SCF complex but not any of the structurally related Cul3-based Ub-ligases.SPAR Physically Associates with the SCFβ-TRCP Complex—To further explore the idea that SPAR turnover is regulated by an SCF E3 Ub-ligase, we established a system in cultured HEK293T cells that recapitulates Plk2-dependent SPAR degradation. This system facilitated biochemical studies that were otherwise limited by the physical properties of dendritic spines and allowed the use of molecular reagents previously developed for study of the human SCF pathway (24Jin J. Ang X.L. Shirogane T. Wade Harper J. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 287-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We found that expression of SPAR alone (as an Myc-tagged fusion protein) led to its accumulation in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2A, lane 3). In contrast, co-expression with Plk2 (but not a catalytically inactive mutant Plk2D201A) promoted the degradation of myc-SPAR (Fig. 2, A, lane 2 compared with lanes 4-6, and B, lanes 1 and 2). Co-expression of SPAR with wild type Plk2 correlated with the appearance of a slower mobility form of SPAR (presumably phosphorylated) that is sensitive to Plk2-induced degradation (Fig. 2A, myc-SPAR-P; see also Fig. 2, B and C). Our recapitulation of Plk2-dependent SPAR turnover in HEK293T cells provides a convenient system in which to search for components of the Plk2-dependent degradation pathway.FIGURE 2SPAR physically associates with the SCFβ-TRCP complex. A, Plk2-dependent loss of SPAR. HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCMV-HA-Plk2 (lane 1), 1 μg of pCMV-myc-SPAR (lane 3), or 1 μg of pCMV-myc-SPAR together with either 1 μg of catalytically inactive pCMV-HA-Plk2D201A (lane 2) or increasing amounts of pCMV-HA-Plk2WT (0.3, 1, or 2 μg) (lanes 4-6). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant among all conditions with use of empty vector. Whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with Myc antibody to assess myc-SPAR levels. B, dominant negative versions of Cul1 and β-TRCP stabilize SPAR. pCMV-myc-SPAR (0.5 μg) and pCMV-HA-Plk2D201A/WT (1 μg) (catalytically inactive, lane 1; wild type, lanes 2-9) were co-expressed in HEK293T cells with 2.5 μg of either empty vector, dominant negative Cullins, or dominant negative F-box proteins. Changes in the abundance of myc-SPAR were determined by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. C, F-box protein interaction screen. pCMV-myc-SPAR (0.6 μg), pCMV-HA-Plk2WT/K108M (0.6 μg), and pCMV-DNCul1 (2 μg) were co-expressed as shown with pCMV-GST (lane 2) or the indicated F-box proteins as GST fusions (0.6 μg) (lanes 3-22) in HEK293T cells seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, cell extracts were used for GSH-Sepharose pull-down assays, and proteins were immunoblotted with anti-GST and anti-Myc antibodies. Crude lysates were blotted as an input control. D, coimmunoprecipitation of SPAR and Plk2. Extracts of HEK293T cells transfected with pCMV-DNCul1 and pCMV-myc-SPAR (lane 1), pCMV-HA-Plk2 (lane 2), or both (lane 3) were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies as indicated. E, formation of a SPAR·Plk2·β-TRCP·Cul1 complex with active Plk2. Lysates from cells transfected with pCMV-myc-SPAR (0.5 μg), pCMV-HA-Plk2WT/D201A (0.5 μg), pCMV-GST-β-TRCP (0.5 μg), and pCMV-FLAG-Cul11-452 (2 μg), as indicated, were incubated with GSH-Sepharose and immunoblotted with anti-Myc, anti-HA, anti-GST, and anti-FLAG antibodies as shown. Lanes 1-4 show lysates (6% of input of the GSH-Sepharose binding reactions).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Consistent with the idea that SPAR is a target of one of the SCF complexes, overexpression of dominant-negative Cul1 (DNCul1) in HEK293T stabilized myc-SPAR despite cotransfection of active Plk2 (Fig. 2B, lane 3), in agreement with our findings in neurons (see Fig. 1, B and E). Moreover, these cells accumulated the slower migrating form of myc-SPAR that presumably corresponds to phosphorylated SPAR. In contrast, a dominant-negative form of the related Cullin4 (DNCul4) had no effect on SPAR turnover (lane 4), indicating that the effect of DNCul1 was specific.F-box proteins serve as substrate receptors in Cul1-based E3s. To uncover candidate F-box proteins for SPAR, we performed a cell-based interaction screen in HEK293T cells between SPAR and a panel of co-expressed GST-tagged F-box proteins. Potential complexes between SPAR and GST-tagged F-box proteins were isolated by incubating cell lysates with GSH-Sepharose beads. Previous studies had indicated that the interaction of F-box proteins with substrates can be detected in tissue culture cells that co-express the F-box protein and substrate in the presence of DNCul1, which blocks substrate degradation (14Jin J. Shirogane T. Xu L. Nalepa G. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3062-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 19Shirogane T. Jin J. Ang X.L. Harper J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26863-26872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Among a panel of F-box proteins individually co-transfected with myc-SPAR and HA-Plk2, we identified an interaction between myc-SPAR and both GST-β-TRCP1 and GST-β-TRCP2 (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). Our ability to assay for endogenous interactions was precluded by the unavailability of suitable antibodies for immunoprecipitation. Although produced from different genes, β-TRCP1 and β-TRCP2 are ∼85% identical and are believed to have largely redundant functions (25Guardavaccaro D. Kudo Y. Boulaire J. Barchi M. Busino L. Donzelli M. Margottin-Goguet F. Jackson P.K. Yamasaki L. Pagano M. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 799-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Importantly, the binding of β-TRCP1 and β-TRCP2 to myc-SPAR required co-transfection of active (wild type (WT)) Plk2 and was undetectable in the presence of catalytically defective Plk2K108M (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6). Together with the Plk2-dependent slower gel mobility of SPAR (Fig. 2, A-C), this suggests that SPAR associates with β-TRCP in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, as is the case for all other β-TRCP substrates identified to date (13Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). SPAR did not associate with any of 16 other F-box proteins tested (Fig. 2C, lanes 7-22), including 5 F-box proteins, which like β-TRCP, bind substrates through their WD40 repeats (Fig. 2C, lanes 7-11). This indicates a high degree of specificity in the interaction between SPAR and β-TRCP.Consistent with previous studies that showed interaction between Plk2 and SPAR (6Pak D.T. Sheng M. Science. 2003; 302: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), we found that Plk2 associated with SPAR in a coimmunoprecipitation assay upon co-expression of DNCul1 (Fig. 2D), further validating our heterologous cell system. Interestingly, we also discovered that the associations of Plk2 and β-TRCP with SPAR were not mutually exclusive, as we were able to detect a ternary interaction with Plk2 that was not precluded by the β-TRCP-SPAR interaction (Fig. 2E, lanes 6 and 8). GST-β-TRCP1 (and GST-β-TRCP2) associated with SPAR, Plk2, and the N terminus of Cullin 1 (Cul11-452/DNCul1), whereas catalytically inactive Plk2D201A did not support assembly of the full complex (Fig. 2E, lanes 5-8). Moreover, the Plk2-dependent slower mobility form of SPAR was enriched in the complex compared with the faster mobility form of SPAR (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 2 and 4 with 6 and 8).SCFβ-TRCP Regulates SPAR Abundance and Turnover and Promotes Its Ubiquitination—To validate a role for the SCFβ-TRCP complex in Plk2-dependent SPAR turnover, we next examined SPAR abundance in HEK293T cells after expression of dominant-negative β-TRCP (β-TRCPΔF) (Fig. 2B). The ΔF-box construct is unable to assemble with Cul1 due to absence of the F-box motif, but it maintains its ability to interact with substrates of both β-TRCP1 and -2 and can thereby sequester substrates and block their turnover (14Jin J.

Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 287-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Expression of β-TRCPΔF resulted in increased levels of SPAR, especially of the slower migrating form of SPAR that is dependent upon Plk2 activity (Fig. 2B, lane 5). In contrast, ΔF-box dominant-negative versions of other F-box proteins Fbw7α/β/γ (containing WD40 repeats) and Skp2 (containing leucine-rich repeats) failed to promote an increase in the steady state abundance of SPAR (Fig. 2B, lanes 6-9).To directly examine whether β-TRCP proteins are required for Plk2-dependent SPAR turnover, we took advantage of a shRNA vector (shβ-TRCP) that is capable of suppressing protein expression of both human β-TRCP1 and β-TRCP2. This hairpin sequence and this particular shRNA vector have been validated for numerous β-TRCP substrates (14Jin J. Shirogane T. Xu L. Nalepa G. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W.

Cells were transfected with expression constructs for GFP-SPAR and red fluorescent protein (RFP) to mark transfected cells and simultaneously transfected with shβ-TRCP or control vector (pRSP) in the presence of active Plk2 or a catalytically inactive version, Plk2D201A (Fig. 3A).

Translational fusion of ASV Gag with an L domain deletion (Δp2b) to proteins that comprise ESCRT-I, -II, and -III (the endocytic sorting complexes required for transport) rescued both Gag ubiquitination and particle release from cells. The ESCRT-I factors Vps37C or Tsg101 were more effective in rescue of Gag/Δp2b budding than the ESCRT-II factor Eap20 or the ESCRT-III component CHMP6. Thus ESCRT components can substitute for Nedd4 family members in ASV Gag release. Unlike wild type, ASV Gag/Δp2b -ESCRT chimeras failed to co-immunoprecipitate with co-expressed hemagglutinin-tagged Nedd4, indicating that Nedd4 was not stably associated with these Gag fusions. Release of the Gag-ESCRT-I or -II fusions was inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of Vps4 ATPase similar to wild type ASV Gag. In contrast to ASV Gag, HIV-1 Gag containing an L domain inactivating mutation (P7L) was efficiently rescued by fusion to a component of ESCRT-III (Chmp6) but not ESCRT-II (Eap20). Depletion of the endogenous pool of Eap20 (ESCRT-II) had little effect on HIV-1 Gag release but blocked ASV Gag release. In contrast, depletion of the endogenous pool of Vps37C (ESCRT-I) had little effect on ASV but blocked HIV-1 Gag release. Furthermore, an N-terminal fragment of Chmp6 inhibited both HIV-1 and ASV Gag release in a dominant negative manner. Taken together, these results indicate that ASV and HIV-1 Gag utilize different combinations of ESCRT proteins to facilitate the budding process, although they share some common elements.

Retroviruses, and many other enveloped viruses, evolved mechanisms to exploit components of the endocytic sorting pathway to bud from cells efficiently. The retroviral Gag precursor polyprotein contains the major structural components of the virus, including late assembly domains that function as docking sites for host cell factors that promote the release of virus-like particles (VLPs) 4The abbreviations used are: VLP, virus-like particle; Vps, vacuolar protein sorting; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; ASV, avian sarcoma virus; MVB, multivesicular bodies; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FL, full length. 4The abbreviations used are: VLP, virus-like particle; Vps, vacuolar protein sorting; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; ASV, avian sarcoma virus; MVB, multivesicular bodies; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FL, full length. from the plasma membrane (1Booth A.M.

Although distinct classes of L domain sequences exist among retroviruses (with core motifs of PTAP, PPXY, and YPXL), each functions as a binding site to recruit different components of the vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) machinery. Class E Vps proteins function in the process of sorting cargo proteins into the luminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). MVBs are carrier vesicles that deliver cargo designated for lysosomal degradation from early to late endosomes (8Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Functionally conserved from yeast to mammalian cells, most class E Vps proteins are organized into high molecular weight cytoplasmic complexes called ESCRT (endocytic sorting complexes required for transport) -I, -II, and -III. Although the mechanistic details of MVB biogenesis remain poorly characterized, current studies suggest that the ESCRT complexes are sequentially recruited to endosomal compartments to remodel and invaginate the limiting endosomal membrane and sort ubiquitinated protein cargo into luminal vesicles. In the last defined step, the ESCRT-III complex recruits an AAA ATPase, Vps4, to catalyze the dissociation of the ESCRT complexes from the endosomal compartment. This facilitates scission of the vesicle from the limiting membrane (for reviews, see Refs. 9Hurley J.H. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Traffic. 2005; 6: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The PTAP and PPXY core motifs in HIV-1 and ASV Gag, respectively, are functionally exchangeable (14Parent L.J. Bennett R.P. Craven R.C. Nelle T.D. Krishna N.K. Bowzard J.B. Wilson C.B. Puffer B.A. Montelaro R.C. Wills J.W. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5455-5460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This, together with the finding that release of both viruses from cells is blocked by the catalytically inactive Vps4 E228Q enzyme, underlines usage of a common budding process dependent on the ESCRT machinery (15Medina G. Zhang Y. Tang Y. Gottwein E. Vana M.L. Bouamr F. Leis J. Carter A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 880-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M.

Cell. 2003; 114: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for this functional exchangeability remains unclear because the mechanism by which ASV Gag accesses components of the ESCRT machinery is not known. The PTAP motif, located in the p6 region of HIV-1 Gag, binds to the class E Vps protein, Tsg101 (5VerPlank L. Agresta B. Grassa T. Kikonyogo A. Leis J. Carter C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7724-7729Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The p6 region of HIV-1 Gag also contains a secondary L domain motif (YPXL) that recruits another class E Vps protein, AIP1/Alix (17Strack B. Calistri A. Craig S. Popova E. Gottlinger H.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). AIP1 acts as a bridging factor to link ESCRT-I to the ESCRT-III complex. The PPXY motif, located in the p2b region of ASV Gag, binds to the Nedd4 family of E3 HECT ubiquitin ligases. Unlike Tsg101, Nedd4 is not a class E Vps protein in that its function is not required for MVB biogenesis. However, like AIP1, Nedd4 binds Tsg101 (15Medina G. Zhang Y. Tang Y. Gottwein E. Vana M.L. Bouamr F. Leis J. Carter A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 880-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and therefore may link ASV Gag to the ESCRT machinery. Co-expression of catalytically inactive Nedd4 with a point mutation in its HECT domain inhibits the release of ASV Gag, providing strong evidence that ubiquitin signaling plays an important role in Gag release (18Vana M.L. Tang Y. Chen A. Medina G. Carter C. Leis J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13943-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the specific role of ubiquitin in retrovirus budding remains unclear, it may potentially function as a sorting signal to facilitate the interaction between Gag and ubiquitin-binding domains in some of the factors of the ESCRT machinery. Recent studies also demonstrate that overexpression of Nedd4L rescues the budding defect caused by the deletion of the L domain in HIV-1 Gag. Although these findings implicate Nedd4 activity in particle release, the precise role of Nedd4L in wild type HIV-1 budding remains unclear (19Chung H.Y. Morita E. von Schwedler U. Muller B. Krausslich H.G. Sundquist W.I. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4884-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Usami Y. Popov S. Popova E. Gottlinger H.G. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate the ability of different ESCRT proteins covalently linked to ASV Gag/Δp2b or HIV-1 Gag P7L, both of which have L domain mutations (see Fig. 1), to support VLP release. We observe that ESCRT-I, -II, and -III proteins rescue ASV Gag budding with declining efficiencies, respectively. We further show that a productive budding pathway correlates with the restoration of ubiquitin modification of chimeric Gag. Interestingly, tethering the ESCRT-II protein Eap20 to the C terminus of Gag complements the L domain mutation of ASV Gag/Δp2b but not HIV Gag/P7L. This suggests that, unlike HIV-1 Gag, ASV Gag requires a functional ESCRT-II complex for release. Accordingly, we observe that siRNA-mediated depletion of Eap20 in 293/E cells significantly inhibits the release of ASV but not HIV-1 Gag. Tethering the ESCRT-I protein, Vps37C, to ASV Gag/Δp2b also rescues budding and ubiquitination. However, depletion of the endogenous pool of Vps37C has no affect on release of ASV Gag but blocked the release of HIV-1 Gag. The biochemical analysis presented in this manuscript, together with our previous findings, indicate that ASV and HIV-1 Gag use parallel pathways dependent on different components of the ESCRT machinery to bud from cells. Reagents—All ASV Gag expression constructs were based on plasmid 2036 as previously described (4Kikonyogo A. Bouamr F. Vana M. Xiang Y. Aiyar A. Carter C. Leis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To create the ASV Gag/Δp2b-ESCRT and HIV Gag/P7L-ESCRT fusion constructs, an HpaI site was introduced in frame at the 3′ end of the Gag coding region by standard PCR techniques. Similarly an HpaI site was added to the 5′ end of the coding region of all ESCRT proteins. The fusion constructs were then cloned into p2036. Vps37C was PCR-amplified from pCR3.1/YFP-Vps37C, a generous gift from Scott Eastman and Paul Bieniasz (Rockefeller University) (21Eastman S.W. Martin-Serrano J. Chung W. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. J.

HIV-1 Gag-GFP and HIV-1 Gag/P7L-GFP were expressed from the pEGFP-N2 vector, in which the GFP was covalently linked to the C terminus of Gag. The cDNA sequence of Eap20 and Chmp6 were cloned into the pIRES-hrGFP-1a vector (also a generous gift from Wesley Sundquist, University of Utah). A 3× FLAG tag fused to the C terminus of Eap20 and Chmp6 allows for the detection of protein expression with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The dominant negative Chmp6(1–167) fragment, in which the last 34 amino acids were deleted, was expressed from the pcDNA4/TO-Myc vector (a generous gift of Phyllis Hanson, Washington University) as previously described (22Shim S.

Transfection and Metabolic Labeling of Cells—293/E cells are derived from human embryonic kidney cells and stably express the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) protein, EBNA-1, for enhanced maintenance and transgene expression of p2036 (4Kikonyogo A. Bouamr F. Vana M. Xiang Y. Aiyar A. Carter C. Leis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11199-11204Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). 293/E cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1,000 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin (1,000 μg/ml). In all experiments, 293/E cells were transfected with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the budding assay, the cells were labeled 48 h post-transfection with 112.5 μCi/ml of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys (>1000 Ci/mmol) for 2.5 h, and Gag proteins were immunoprecipitated from the media and lysate fractions by use of a rabbit anti-ASV polyclonal antiserum or an anti-HIV CA(p24) monoclonal antibody, as described previously (18Vana M.L. Tang Y. Chen A. Medina G. Carter C. Leis J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13943-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels), and dried gels were analyzed with a Storm imaging system or a PhosphorI mager (Amersham Biosciences) (18Vana M.L. Tang Y. Chen A. Medina G. Carter C. Leis J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13943-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Budding efficiency was determined by dividing the signal of the Gag band isolated from the medium fraction by the sum of the Gag signals in the medium and lysate fractions. The level of wild type Gag budding was set to 1. Detection of Proteins by Western Blotting—Six-well plates of 293/E cells were transfected with indicated DNA. For ubiquitination assay, 293/E cells were transfected with 0.5–1.0 μg of p2036-Gag, Gag/Δp2b, or Gag/Δp2b-ESCRT chimeras and the indicated amount of pMT123. VLPs were harvested from the cell culture medium 48 h post-transfection by centrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C (Beckman SW50.1 rotor), as previously described (18Vana M.L. Tang Y. Chen A. Medina G. Carter C. Leis J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13943-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The pelleted VLPs were suspended in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets. Because of their lower expression levels and lower budding efficiencies, VLPs for the ASV Gag/Δp2b-ESCRT-II and -ESCRT-III chimeras were suspended in 50 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets. The cell lysate fraction was prepared by lysing cells with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets, as previously described (18Vana M.L. Tang Y. Chen A. Medina G. Carter C. Leis J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13943-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Gag proteins were then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit anti-ASV polyclonal antiserum (1:500–1:1000 dilution) and 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking of the membrane with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, Gag proteins were detected with anti-avian myeloblastosis virus MA(p19) (mAb) monoclonal antibody (which cross-reacts with the ASV mAb protein) and an anti-mouse IgG-HRP secondary antibody from ECL. The anti-avian myeloblastosis virus MA(p19), developed by David Boettiger, was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank under the auspices of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). Ubiquitinated forms of Gag were detected with a mouse anti-HA antibody. siRNA Depletion of Endogenous Vps37C and Eap20 in Cells—Knockdown of YFP-Vps37C and Eap20-FLAG expression was achieved by transfecting the indicated concentrations of Vps37C or Eap20 siRNA into 293/E cells in six-well plates with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the 293/E cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding either YFP-Vps37C, EAP20-FLAG, ASV Gag, or HIV Gag-GFP with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described above. VLPs and lysate fractions were harvested 24 h later, and the levels of proteins expression were analyzed by quantifying the intensities of the bands obtained in Western blots as described above. The Eap20 siRNA used in this study was originally described by Langelier et al. (23Langelier C. von Schwedler U.K. Fisher R.D. De Domenico I. White P.L. Hill C.P. Kaplan J. Ward D. Sundquist W.I. J.

Such functional replacement of L domain activity provides a valuable assay to characterize the role of ESCRT complexes in retroviral budding. In this study, we expanded on previous approaches by constructing seven chimeric ASV Gag/Δp2b-ESCRT proteins and monitored their ability to rescue the budding defect caused by an 11 amino acid deletion that includes the PPXY motif in the p2b region of ASV Gag (6Wills J.

Each chimera was transfected into 293/E cells, cell lysate and media fractions were prepared, Gag complexes were recovered, and viral proteins were detected by Western blotting after fractionation by SDS-PAGE, as described under “Detection of Proteins by Western Blotting.” To stabilize expression, ASV Gag/Δp2b-Tsg101 was co-expressed with Vps28-FLAG, and ASV Gag/Δp2b-Eap45 was co-expressed with Eap20-FLAG. Eap45 expression is not stable unless co-expressed with other ESCRT-II proteins (23Langelier C. von Schwedler U.K. Fisher R.D. De Domenico I. White P.L. Hill C.P. Kaplan J. Ward D. Sundquist W.I. J.

Also, proteolytic processing of Gag is not required for particle release from cells so that all ASV Gag constructs contain a D37S mutation in the protease coding sequence to permit detection of full-length rather than processed Gag proteins on the gels. Efficient release of VLPs into the medium fraction depends upon the p2b region of ASV Gag (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2), in agreement with previous observations (6Wills J. Cameron C. Wilson C. Xiang Y. Bennett R. Leis J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6605-6618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Xiang Y. Cameron C. Wills J. Leis J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5695-5700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this experiment, the amount of Gag/Δp2b in the medium fraction was barely detected (lane 2). As shown in Fig. 2, fusion of Gag/Δp2b to Vps37C (lane 3), Tsg101 (lane 5), Eap20 (lane 6), or Chmp6 (lane 8) rescued budding to different extents. The origin of the faster migrating band observed with GagΔp2b-Vps37C fusion in the medium fraction is not known but might reflect protease degradation (Fig. 2, lane 3). To quantify the extent of rescue, the cells were transfected with wild type Gag, Gag/Δp2b, or each of the fusion constructs and labeled with [35S]Met/Cys as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Radiolabeled Gag and Gag fusions were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate and media fractions and fractionated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and radioactive bands were quantified. Setting the budding efficiency of wild type Gag to 1 and normalizing for the amount of total full-length Gag or Gag fusion expressed in the lysate and media fractions, the relative release efficiencies of the ESCRT chimeras was averaged from two separate experiments. When fused to Gag/Δp2b, the ESCRT-I proteins Vps37C and Tsg101 rescued VLP release to ∼65 and 45%, respectively, relative to wild type Gag. The ESCRT-II protein, Eap20, restored VLP release with a budding efficiency of ∼25%. Lastly, we observed a 13% rescue of VLP budding for the Chmp6 fusion relative to wild type Gag. We also detected an amount of Gag/Δp2b-Chmp4 of ∼4% by this protocol, which is not sufficient to differentiate from Gag/Δp2b. Thus the Western and radiolabeled analyses yielded similar results. Of the seven ESCRT proteins fused to Gag/Δp2b, Vps28 (ESCRT-I), Eap45 (ESCRT-II), and Chmp4B (ESCRT-III) failed to complement the L domain deletion (lanes 4, 7, and 9) when fused to Gag/Δp2b so that their role in the release process could not be analyzed by this approach. The finding that Eap20, co-expressed with Gag/Δp2b-Eap45, did not rescue Gag release compared with Eap20 covalently linked to Gag/Δp2b suggests that the deletion of the Nedd4 PY-binding motif from Gag removes the capacity of Gag to recruit the necessary ESCRT complexes for the budding process. ASV Gag/Δp2b-ESCRT Chimeras Reconstitute a Vps-dependent Budding Pathway—We next verified whether the ESCRT-I and -II chimeras utilized the same endocytic sorting machinery for budding as wild type Gag by testing sensitivity to Vps4, a global regulator of the MVB machinery. We co-transfected various Gag/Δp2b-ESCRT fusion constructs with DNA encoding Vps4 E228Q, a catalytically inactive form of Vps4 previously shown to suppress the release of HIV-1 and ASV particles in a dominant negative fashion (2Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W.

The data presented in Fig. 3 demonstrates that the release of the Gag fusions to -Tsg101, -Vps37C, and -Eap20, respectively, were subject to dominant negative inhibition by co-expression with Vps4 E228Q in a dose-dependent manner (panels B-D). Quantification of the Gag signals confirms that Vps4 E228Q significantly reduces particle release. The Vps4 E228Q protein is stably expressed in the lysate fraction in each case, as detected by Western blotting (data not shown). From data presented in Figs. 2 and 3, we conclude that ESCRT proteins coupled to Gag/Δp2b allow chimeric Gag to access the endocytic sorting machinery used by wild type.

Leis J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13943-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutating the lysine residues (the acceptor sites for ubiquitin modification) in close proximity to the HIV and ASV L domains causes a late budding defect (33Spidel J.L. Craven R.C.

We therefore examined whether the ESCRT chimeras restored ubiquitination of Gag as part of a functional budding process. 293/E cells were co-transfected with a vector expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin and expression plasmids encoding wild type Gag, Gag/Δp2b, or ESCRT chimeras. HA-tagged ubiquitin permits enhanced detection of ubiquitinated Gag using an anti-HA antibody. Gag detected in the lysate fraction is both mono- and polyubiquitinated (18Vana M.L. Tang Y. Chen A. Medina G. Carter C. Leis J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13943-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the L domain dependence of Gag ubiquitination, as we detect a greater fraction of monoubiquitinated wild type Gag in the lysate fraction relative to ASV Gag/Δp2b (lanes 1 and 2, upper panel). Interestingly, Gag/Δp2b-Eap20 (lane 7) and Gag/Δp2b-Vps37C (lane 3) induced robust ubiquitination of Gag in the lysate fraction despite the absence of the Nedd4 binding site. We also detecte"

Mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis in which salt, water, and protein transports are defective in various tissues. Here we expressed wild-type human CFTR as a FLAG-fused protein in HEK293 cells heterologously and purified it in three steps: anti-FLAG and wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatographies and size exclusion chromatography. The stoichiometry of the protein was analyzed using various biochemical approaches, including chemical cross-linking, blue-native PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and electron microscopy (EM) observation of antibody-decorated CFTR. All these data support a dimeric assembly of CFTR. Using 5,039 automatically selected particles from negatively stained EM images, the three-dimensional structure of CFTR was reconstructed at 2-nm resolution assuming a 2-fold symmetry. CFTR, presumably in a closed state, was shown to be an ellipsoidal particle with dimensions of 120 x 106 x 162 A. It comprises a small dome-shaped extracellular and membrane-spanning domain and a large cytoplasmic domain with orifices beneath the putative transmembrane domain.

Migration of circulating leukocytes to injury sites is the first step of the inflammation process, which involves a sequence of coordinated interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells (1Luster A.D. Alon R. von Andrian U.H. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1182-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Central to this physiological and pathological event are chemokines, a family of low molecular weight soluble proteins, that function to attract leukocytes bearing the appropriate receptors (2Charo I.F.

Understanding the structure of this pair of molecules is necessary for exploring pharmacological methods to regulate their activity. The structure of CX3CR1, a receptor of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is relatively well known, but that of CX3CL1 much less so. CX3CL1-CD (76 residues), a globular protein domain 3 nm in diameter (14Fong A.M. Erickson H.P. Zachariah J.P. Poon S. Schamberg N.J. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Biol.

It is composed of a disordered N terminus up to the first cysteine (Cys-8), a long loop followed by a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (residues 24–51) and a C-terminal α-helix (residues 56–67) packed against the β-sheet (15Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The stalk (241 residues) is 26 nm in length (14Fong A.M. Erickson H.P.

In contrast, membrane-associated CX3CL1, along with CX3CR1, mediates stable adhesion of leukocytes such as integrins (16Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D.

Although we know that the potent adhesiveness of CX3CR1 under flow requires that CX3CL1-CD have a high affinity for it (19Haskell C.A. Cleary M.D. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10053-10058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), nothing is known about the quaternary structure of the ligand. Most of the soluble chemokines bind sulfated glycoaminoglycans of the extracellular matrix and endothelial cell surfaces. This immobilization leads to chemokine clustering and is essential for establishing the chemokine gradient that leads to directed migration. Moreover, numerous chemokines tend to self-associate at high concentrations in solution, and this clustering sometimes appears to be essential to their in vivo activity (20Proudfoot A.E. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). For CX3CL1, however, the CD itself remains monomeric in solution, even at high concentrations (15Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The CD structure has been studied in crystals (21Hoover D.M. Mizoue L.S. Handel T.M. Lubkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23187-23193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), where it includes four monomers arranged as two asymmetric dimers. However, the potential aggregation of the complete CX3CL1 molecule has not yet been investigated. We reasoned that CX3CL1 clustering could be important for its adhesive properties, as it is for integrins (22Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Among the many methods for studying the aggregation of cellular proteins, resonance energy transfer techniques have emerged as useful tools for analyzing the proximity of membrane molecules in living cells (23Veatch W. Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We used these techniques here to study the aggregation status of CX3CL1 in its native membranous state. We report that CX3CL1 is indeed clustered and that this clustering takes place primarily through its transmembrane domain. Moreover, we show that this aggregation is associated with the mature glycosylation of the protein and, most importantly, is required for its adhesive potency in flow conditions (flow adhesion assay) and under normal pulling (dual pipette assay). Chemicals, Proteins, and Monoclonals—Benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside was purchased from Calbiochem. Neuraminidase (acylneuraminyl hydrolase) and O-glycosidase (endo-d-galactosyl-N-acetyl-α-galactosamine hydrolase) came from Roche Diagnostics. Monoclonal antibodies against CX3CL1-CD (clone 51637) and full-length CX3CL1 tagged with His6 were purchased from R&D Systems (Lille, France) and CX3CL1-CD from Peprotech (Levallois-Perret, France). Plasmid Constructs—The CX3CL1 constructs in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pEYFP-N1 (Clontech), and pRluc-N2 (Perkin-Elmer) were made with CX3CL1-pBLAST (Invivogen Cayla, Toulouse, France) as template and primers containing a HindIII restriction site in 5′position and a BamHI restriction site in the 3′-position for PCR amplification as explained in supplemental Table S1. The HindIII/BamHI fragment was then cloned in the different plasmids. The truncated and mutated constructs were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Briefly, 10 ng of various plasmid constructions was used as a template, with mutated nucleotide primers as described in supplemental Table S1. PCR conditions were as follows: predenaturing at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 18 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 50 s, and extension at 68 °C for 7 min. After digestion with DpnI, 2 μl of PCR product was used to transform the XL10-Gold Ultracompetent cells provided with the kit. Appropriate clones were identified by sequencing. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus GlutaMax I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. To obtain HEK clones expressing CX3CL1 or ALA12, CX3CL1-pEYFP and ALA12-pEYFP constructs were transfected into HEK cells with the cationic polymer transfection reagent jetPEI (Polyplus transfection, Ozyme, St. Quentin-en-Yvelines, France). A stable transformant resistant to 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was selected with a FACS Aria cell sorter (BD Biosciences). HUVEC were cultured in endothelial cell medium (PAA Laboratories, Les Mureaux, France), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HUVEC were incubated for 20 h with tumor necrosis factor-α at 20 ng/ml and interferon-γ at 500 units/ml (Peprotech) to induce CX3CL1 expression. Expression of CX3CL1 on HUVEC and HEK cells and clones was tested with phycoerythrin-labeled murine anti-CX3CL1 mAb (mAb clone 51637, R&D Systems) and analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACScan (BD Biosciences). BRET—Cells were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/well in 12-well dishes 24 h before transfection. Transient transfections were performed with the cationic polymer transfection reagent, JetPEI (Polyplus transfection, Ozyme) in 150 mm NaCl. In most experiments, 0.2 μg of various CX3CL1-pRluc constructs was transfected alone or with increasing quantities of various CX3CL1-pEYFP constructs. The total amount of DNA transfected in each well was completed to 2.2 μg with empty pcDNA3 vector. After overnight incubation, the transfected cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed with HBSS buffer supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2. The cells were then seeded in 96-well black plates (PerkinElmer) in 100 μl of supplemented HBSS. Coelenterazine H (Interchim, Montluçon, France) was added to reach a final concentration of 5 μm. Readings were collected with a microplate analyzer (Fusion; PerkinElmer) that allowed the sequential integration of signals detected in the 485 ± 20-nm window for luciferase and the 540 ± 20-nm window for yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) light emissions. The BRET signal was determined by calculating the ratio of the light intensity emitted by the CX3CL1-YFP over the light intensity emitted by the CX3CL1-luciferase (Luc). The values were corrected by subtracting the background BRET signal detected when the CX3CL1-Luc construct was expressed alone. The values are the mean over 15 measurements. To relate the BRET measurements to the actual CX3CL1 concentration, we measured the luminescence or fluorescence of HEK transfected either with CX3CL1-Luc or CX3CL1-YFP constructs and quantified their CX3CL1 content in Western blot experiments with CX3CL1-His6 tag (R&D Systems) as standard (Fig. 2B). Homogeneous Time-resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)—Monoclonal anti-CX3CR1 (clone 51637) was labeled with the different fluorescent donors or acceptors as described previously (24Maurel D. Kniazeff J.

The number of europium cryptate-PBP per antibody (molar ratio) was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring their absorbance at 280 and 317 nm and inserting these values into the equation Molar ratio=(OD317 nm/ϵeuropium cryptate−PBP)/[(OD280 nm−(OD317 nm/A))/ϵantibody](Eq. 1) where the molar extinction coefficient of the europium cryptate-PBP (ϵeuropium cryptate-PBP) was taken as 19,800 m-1 cm-1 and that of the antibodies as 210,000 m-1 cm-1. Factor A expressed the ratio (OD317 nm/OD280 nm) for europium cryptate-PBP and was determined to be 2. The final molar ratio was determined to be 1.1. The anti-CX3CR1 monoclonal was labeled with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester derivative D2 acceptor as described previously (26Trinquet E. Fink M. Bazin H. Grillet F. Maurin F. Bourrier E. Ansanay H. Leroy C. Michaud A. Durroux T. Maurel D. Malhaire F. Goudet C. Pin J.P. Naval M. Hernout O. Chretien F. Chapleur Y. Mathis G. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 358: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The final number of dyes per antibody was determined spectrophotometrically. By using the maximum absorption for D2 at 650 nm and its molar extinction coefficient value (240,000 m-1 cm-1), the final ratio was determined to be 1.3. HEK clone cells and HUVEC (activated or not) were harvested and resuspended in KREBS buffer (Tris/HCL 20 mm, pH 7.4, NaCl 118 mm, glucose 5.6 mm, KH2PO4, MgSO4 1.2 mm, KCl 4.7 mm, CaCl2 1.8 mm, and bovine serum albumin 0.1%). Fifty thousand cells in 100 μl were distributed in 96-well black plates (PerkinElmer) where 4 nm europium cryptate-labeled donor anti-CX3CL1 and 4 nm D2-labeled acceptor antibody (anti-CX3CL1 or anti-FLAG as control) were already present, diluted in the same buffer. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, fluorescence emissions were measured, at both 620 and 665 nm, on a multidetection microplate reader (PHERAstar, BMG Labtech). The HTRF ratio was calculated as r = (fluorescence at 665 nm/fluorescence at 620 nm) × 104. The specific signal over background, noted as ΔF, was calculated with the following formula, ΔF=(Rpos−Rneg)/Rneg(Eq. 2) where Rpos corresponds to the ratio with anti-CX3CL1 mAb as the acceptor and Rneg to the ratio with anti-FLAG mAb as the acceptor. Static Adhesion Assay—Two different assays were performed. In the cell-cell model, performed as described previously (27Hermand P. Huet M. Callebaut I. Gane P. Ihanus E. Gahmberg C.G. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26002-26010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), CHO-CX3CR1 and parental CHO were grown in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 96-well plate (5.104 cells/well) and washed in HBSS buffer. Then 105 HEK cells expressing variants of CX3CL1 were added for 45 min at room temperature. In the cell-to-protein adhesion model, a monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody (mAb 050, R&D Systems) (250 ng in 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) was adsorbed for 2 h at room temperature in flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark). Then CX3CL1-His6, diluted in the same buffer, was incubated overnight at 4 °C at a concentration of 1.8 μg/ml (50 μl/well in triplicate). Adhesion of HEK-CX3CR1 cells was performed as described previously (27Hermand P. Huet M. Callebaut I. Gane P. Ihanus E. Gahmberg C.G. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26002-26010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with an incubation time of 45 min at room temperature in HBSS buffer with or without enzymatic treatment. In both cases, before the adhesion assay the cells were labeled with 1 μm 5(6)carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (Interchim) and the microplate was read at 535 nm with a microplate analyzer (Fusion; PerkinElmer). Deglycosylation Treatment—The adsorbed protein was digested with 4 milliunits of neuraminidase in 40 mm Tris, pH 8, and 4 mm CaCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C before incubation with 1 milliunit of O-glycosidase in PBS for 4 h at 37 °C. Western blotting using an anti-CX3CL1 antibody analyzed the digested protein. Parallel Plate Laminar Flow Chamber Adhesion Assay—The technique we used has been thoroughly described previously (28Daoudi M. Lavergne E. Garin A. Tarantino N. Debre P. Pincet F. Combadiere C. Deterre P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19649-19657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, the coverslips were cultured with adherent clone HEK cells expressing either CX3CL1 or ALA12 mutant. The coverslip was mounted in a chamber set on the stage of an inverted microscope (TE300, Nikon) equipped with a phase contrast 10× objective (Nikon, n.a. 0.25) and a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Sensicam, PCO, Kelheim, Germany). The entire apparatus was kept at 37 °C by a thermostatic chamber (Life Imaging Services, Reinach, Switzerland). HEK-CX3CR1 clone cells were suspended in PBS, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 5 μm carboxy-SNARF-1-AM (seminaphtorhodafluor-1-acetoxymethylester, Molecular Probes-Invitrogen) for labeling, and resuspended in flow buffer (HBSS supplemented with 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 106 cells/ml. A syringe pump (PHD 2000; Harvard Apparatus, Les Ulis, France) drove 0.5 ml of cell suspension through the chamber at a wall shear stress of 1.5 dynes.cm-2. After a 10-min wash at 1.5 dynes.cm-2, fluorescent images of three separate 0.5 mm2 fields were recorded to count the adherent cells (excitation 450–500 nm, emission 510–560 nm, dichroic filter Q505lp, Chroma, Brattleboro, VT). The number of nonspecific adhering cells was obtained in the same manner, except the HEK-CX3CR1 clone cells were preincubated for 2 min with 100 nm soluble CX3CL1-CD (chemokine domain alone, R&D Systems). Dual Pipette Aspiration Technique—The dual pipette adhesion assay was performed as described previously (28Daoudi M. Lavergne E. Garin A. Tarantino N. Debre P. Pincet F. Combadiere C. Deterre P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19649-19657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, two cells, collected by gentle aspiration onto the tip of each pipette (cell 1 in pipette A, cell 2 in pipette B), were brought into contact with the micromanipulators and allowed to remain in contact for 4 min. To separate the cells, aspiration in pipette B was maintained at a level sufficiently high to hold cell 2 tightly, and the aspiration in pipette A was increased in steps measured with a pressure sensor (Validyne, model DP103-38; ranging from 0 to 50,000 pascals). After each step, the pipettes were moved apart in an effort to detach the adherent cells from one another. A pair pulled intact from pipette A was moved back to the pipette orifice, the aspiration in the pipette was increased, and another attempt was made to detach the cells from each other. The cycle was repeated until the level of aspiration in pipette A was sufficient to pull one cell apart from the other. The aspiration employed in each cycle was monitored continuously. The values recorded for each of the last two cycles in the series (Pn - 1 and Pn) were used to calculate the separation force, F, for the pair tested, with the equation, F=π(d/2) 2(Pn−1+Pn)/2(Eq. 3) with d the internal diameter of pipette A. The results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. for 14 measurements. BRET of CX3CL1 in the HEK Cell Line—To investigate by BRET the aggregation state of the chemokine CX3CL1 in its native membranous form, we developed various constructs of CX3CL1 chimera that expressed Luc or YFP on the cytoplasmic C-terminal side. As expected, the tagged CX3CL1 was expressed at the plasma membrane in transiently transfected HEK cells (Fig. 2A, insert). The membrane-targeted CX3CL1-YFP or CX3CL1-Luc accounted for about 50% of the total cellular CX3CL1, as already shown for the CX3CL1-GFP chimera (29Liu G.Y. Kulasingam V. Alexander R.T. Touret N. Fong A.M. Patel D.D. Robinson L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19858-19866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Finally, our CX3CL1 chimera also functioned as native CX3CL1 according to adhesion tests (data not shown), as the GFP (green fluorescent protein) chimera did (29Liu G.Y. Kulasingam V. Alexander R.T. Touret N. Fong A.M. Patel D.D. Robinson L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19858-19866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using such chimera with a ratio of 1:10 YFP (acceptor) over Luc (donor), we measured a high BRET ratio (Fig. 2A, right), higher than that obtained when the CX3CL1-YFP plasmid was replaced by the empty pEYFP construct (Fig. 2A, left), by CXCL16-YFP (Fig. 2A, middle), or by ICAM-4-YFP (not shown). These data suggest the specificity of the homotypic CX3CL1 BRET and show for the first time the probable self-assembly of CX3CL1 proteins in a cellular context. After transfecting HEK cells with various amounts of CX3CL1-YFP and a constant amount of CX3CL1-Luc (yielding 1.5 fmol of CX3CL1-Luc/mg total protein; see Fig. 2B), we plotted the BRET data versus the CX3CL1-YFP/CX3CL1-Luc ratio and observed a saturation curve (Fig. 2C, filled squares) as expected for specific clustering (30Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 31Mercier J.-F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In contrast, the same curve plotted with CXCL16-YFP replacing CX3CL1-YFP remained at low amplitude (Fig. 2C, empty squares). Working with a constant CX3CL1-YFP/CX3CL1-Luc ratio, here equal to 5 (Fig. 2D), we verified that the BRET level was constant when plotted against the total amount of tagged CX3CL1 (donor plus acceptor) (Fig. 2D) and against the CX3CL1-YFP concentration (acceptor) (Fig. 2E). Indeed, when BRET is specific, its amplitude should not depend on the total amount of interacting proteins (30Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 34Marullo S. Bouvier M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 362-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) or on the concentration of the donor moiety (30Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Finally, the significant BRET decrease in the presence of an excess of an untagged unit (Fig. 2F) showed that the BRET was specific and not due to random collision. We concluded that CX3CL1 appears to aggregate specifically, at least in the HEK cell line. HTRF Measurements with Cellular CX3CL1—To test whether native CX3CL1 aggregates similarly in primary cells, we used the method called HTRF (35Mathis G. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which has been applied to detect biomolecular interactions (36Bazin H. Trinquet E. Mathis G. J. Biotechnol. 2002; 82: 233-250PubMed Google Scholar) including ligand-enzyme relations (37Jia Y. Quinn C.M. Gagnon A.I. Talanian R. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 356: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and protein clustering (24Maurel D. Kniazeff J. Mathis G. Trinquet E. Pin J.-P. Ansanay H. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It consisted here of measuring the resonance energy transfer between labeled antibodies specific against CX3CL1. Using both stably CX3CL1-expressing HEK cells (data not shown) and cytokineactivated HUVEC, also expressing CX3CL1 (16Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 38Imaizumi T. Matsumiya T. Fujimoto K. Okamoto K. Cui X. Ohtaki U. Yoshida Hidemi Satoh K. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A), we observed a marked level of energy transfer (Fig. 3B, right, solid bar), substantially higher than the level observed with irrelevant monoclonals (Fig. 3B, right, empty bar). This result was confirmed by plotting HTRF signals as the difference between specific and nonspecific data (ΔF; see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 3B, insert). In contrast, measurements of resting HUVEC, which do not express CX3CL1 (Fig. 3A), showed no specific HTRF (Fig. 3B, left, and insert). Accordingly, CX3CL1 appears natively aggregated when it is expressed at the external membrane of primary cells. CX3CL1 Clustering Is Mainly Due to Its Transmembrane Domain—We next sought to identify the domain of CX3CL1 involved in clustering, by progressively deleting the external (first the CD and then the mucin stalk) and intracellular domains of the molecule (Fig. 4, top). We first checked that all these constructs when transfected in HEK produced proteins that effectively targeted the membrane (Fig. 4, A–C) and were expressed at levels similar to that of whole CX3CL1 (Fig. 2A, insert).

The trivalent arsenical of GSAO reacts with and perturbs adenine nucleotide translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane of endothelial cells, which leads to proliferation arrest. Three observations indicated that the γ-glutamyl residue of GSAO is cleaved at the endothelial cell surface by γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γGT). GSAO was found to be an efficient substrate for γGT, endothelial cell accumulation and antiproliferative activity of GSAO was blunted by a competitive substrate and an active site inhibitor of γGT, and the level of cell surface γGT correlated strongly with the sensitivity of cells to GSAO. Using transport inhibitors, it was revealed that the resulting metabolite of GSAO cleavage by γGT, 4-(N-(S-cysteinylglycylacetyl)amino) phenylarsonous acid (GCAO), was transported across the plasma membrane by an organic anion transporter. Furthermore, GCAO is likely processed by dipeptidases in the cytosol to 4-(N-(S-cysteinylacetyl)amino) phenylarsonous acid (CAO), and it is this metabolite that reacts with mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase. Taken together, our findings indicate that γGT processing of GSAO at the cell surface is the rate-limiting step in its antiangiogenic activity. This information can explain the kidney toxicity at high doses of GSAO noted in preclinical studies and will aid in the anticipation of potential side effects in humans and in the design of better antimitochondrial cancer drugs. 4-(N-(S-glutathionylacetyl)amino) phenylarsonous acid (GSAO) is a small, synthetic mitochondrial poison that targets angiogenic endothelial cells and is currently being tested in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial.

Proper functioning of ANT is essential for cell viability, so targeting this protein in angiogenic endothelial cells is a powerful means of blocking angiogenesis (5Don A.S. Hogg P.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 372-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A limitation of targeting specific angiogenic proteins is that they can often be circumvented by other proteins in the angiogenic process.

Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Inactivation of ANT by GSAO causes an increase in superoxide levels, proliferation arrest, ATP depletion, mitochondrial depolarization, and apoptosis in endothelial cells. The strong selectivity of GSAO for proliferating endothelial cells is a consequence of the higher mitochondrial calcium levels in proliferating cells (1Don A.S. Kisker O. Dilda P. Donoghue N. Zhao X. Decollogne S. Creighton B. Flynn E. Folkman J. Hogg P.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). ANT is a calcium receptor that undergoes a conformational change and a change in activity upon binding of calcium ions. GSAO binds to calcium-replete ANT but binds minimally in the absence of calcium ions. Calcium content within the mitochondrial matrix increases severalfold in proliferating cells, and it is the higher mitochondrial calcium concentration that sensitizes proliferating cells to GSAO-induced pore formation. This mechanism is supported by the crystal structure of the calcium-free form of bovine ANT (8Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank ID 1OKC). The members of the cysteine pair (Cys-160 and Cys-257) that GSAO is proposed to cross-link in the calcium-replete form are 18 Å apart in the calcium-free structure, which is at least twice the distance required for them to interact with trivalent arsenicals (9Donoghue N. Yam P.T. Jiang X.M. Hogg P.J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2436-2445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GSAO is also a selective inhibitor of endothelial cells when compared with tumor cells. For instance, GSAO is >30 times more effective at inhibiting proliferation of endothelial cells than human pancreatic Bx-PC3 carcinoma cells. This is because endothelial cells are very poor at exporting GSAO, whereas the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP) 1 and 2 in tumor and other cells efficiently pump GSAO out the cytoplasm (2Dilda P.J. Don A.S. Tanabe K.M. Higgins V.J. Allen J.D. Dawes I.W. Hogg P.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2005; 97: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells express very little MRP1/2. This study addressed the question of how GSAO translocates across the plasma membrane of endothelial cells. We hypothesized that the glutathione pendant is the moiety that mediates the entry of GSAO into cells. There are no efficient plasma membrane transporters of glutathione in mammalian cells, however. Considering that GSAO resembles a glutathione-S conjugate of aminophenylarsonous acid, we explored the possibility that GSAO was metabolized at the cell surface and that a product containing the arsenical moiety was transported across the plasma membrane. We show here that the γ-glutamyl residue of GSAO is cleaved from the molecule at the cell surface by γ-glutamyltransferase (γGT; EC 2.3.2.2) to produce 4-(N-(S-cysteinylglycylacetyl)amino) phenylarsonous acid (GCAO). GCAO in then transported across the plasma membrane by the organic anion-transporting polypeptide family. These findings indicate that GSAO could be considered a pro-drug that is dependent on cell surface processing by γGT for its action. Cell Proliferation and Viability Assays—Bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells were from Cell Applications (San Diego, CA). BAE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10! fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 5 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Melanoma cell clones expressing different γGT activity were produced as described previously (10Franzini M. Corti A. Lorenzini E. Paolicchi A. Pompella A. De Cesare M. Perego P. Gatti L. Leone R. Apostoli P. Zunino F. Eur. J. Cancer. 2006; 42: 2623-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The c21/basal and c21/γGT clones express a γGT activity of 0.34 ± 0.13 and 91 ± 3.4 milliunits/mg of cellular protein, respectively. Both clones were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10! (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5! CO2, 95! air atmosphere. Cell culture plasticware was from Techno Plastic Products (Trasadingen, Switzerland). All other cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. BAE (5,000 cells/well) and melanoma cells (4,000 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates in 0.2 ml of culture medium. Viable BAE cells were determined using the tetrazolium salt MTT (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Viable melanoma cells were determined using the WST-1 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Results were expressed as the percentage of untreated controls. The potent γGT competitive inhibitor, l-2-amino-4-boronobutanoic acid (ABBA), was provided by Dr. R. E. London (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC). Ki for Inhibition of γGT by GSAO—γGT activity was measured using γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide as substrate and glycyl-glycine as transpeptidation acceptor (11Huseby N.E. Stromme J.H. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1974; 34: 357-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). γGT, γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide, glycyl-glycine, and GSAO in 15 mm Tris, pH 9.0, buffer were incubated at 25 °C in Linbro/Titertek E.I.A. microtitration plate wells. The reactions were started by the addition of γGT to a final volume of 200 μl. Reactant concentrations are found in the legend for Fig. 2. The formation of p-nitroaniline as a function of time was monitored continuously by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices M2 Microplate Reader (Palo Alto, CA). The extinction coefficient used for p-nitroaniline was 9920 m–1 cm–1. The apparent Ki for inhibition of γGT by GSAO was estimated from the effect of fixed concentrations of GSAO on the initial velocity of hydrolysis of γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide by γGT. The results were consistent with simple competitive inhibition. The data points were globally fit by non-linear least squares regression using GraphPad (San Diego, CA) software. Production of GSAO Metabolites—GSAO was produced as described previously to a purity >94! by HPLC (1Don A.S. Kisker O. Dilda P. Donoghue N. Zhao X. Decollogne S. Creighton B. Flynn E. Folkman J. Hogg P.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A 50 mm solution of GSAO was made by dissolving solid in 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, buffer containing 40 mm glycyl-glycine. GCAO was produced by cleaving the γ-glutamyl group from GSAO with porcine kidney γ-glutamyl transpeptidase type IV (Sigma). A 10 mm solution of GSAO was incubated with 0.55 units/ml γGT in 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, buffer containing 40 mm glycyl-glycine for 1 h at 30 °C. The γGT was removed from the reaction by filtration using a YM3 Microcon membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). 4-(N-(S-Cysteinylacetyl)amino) phenylarsonous acid (CAO) was produced by cleaving the glycine amino acid from GCAO with porcine kidney aminopeptidase N (Type IV-S, Sigma). The GCAO filtrate was incubated with 2 units/ml aminopeptidase N for 1 h at 37 °C. The aminopeptidase N was removed from the reaction by filtration using a YM3 Microcon membrane. The concentrations of the metabolites were measured by titrating with dimercaptopropanol and calculating the remaining free thiols with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (1Don A.S. Kisker O. Dilda P. Donoghue N. Zhao X. Decollogne S. Creighton B. Flynn E. Folkman J. Hogg P.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The titrated solutions were sterile-filtered and stored at 4 °C in the dark until use. There was no significant loss in the active concentration of stock solutions of the arsenicals for at least a week when stored under these conditions. HPLC and Electrospray Mass Ionization-Mass Spectrometry Analysis of the Organoarsenicals—GSAO and metabolites were characterized by HPLC (1200 Series; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Samples were resolved on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm; Agilent Technologies) using a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water (25:75 v/v), flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and detection by absorbance at 256 nm. The purity of GSAO, GCAO, and CAO by peak area was 94 ± 1, 69 ± 3, and 84 ± 4!, respectively. Masses of the compounds were determined using electrospray mass ionization-mass spectrometry. Spectra were acquired using an API QStar Pulsar i hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples (∼1 pmol) were loaded into nanospray needles (Proxeon), and the tip was positioned ∼10 mm from the orifice. Nitrogen was used as curtain gas, and a potential of 900 V was applied to the needle. A time-of-flight mass spectrometry scan was acquired (m/z 200–2000, 1 s) and accumulated for ∼1 min into a single file. The mass spectrum of GCAO gave molecular ions at 420.0 m/z [GCAO+H]+, 402.0 m/z [GCAO+H-H2O]+, and 383.9 m/z [GCAO+H-2H2O]+, confirming the cleavage of the γ-glutamyl group from GSAO. The mass spectrum of CAO gave molecular ions at 362.9 m/z [CAO+H]+, 384.9 m/z [CAO+Na]+, and 344.9 m/z [CAO+H-H2O]+, confirming the cleavage of the glycine from GCAO. Accumulation of GSAO and Metabolites in BAE Cells—BAE cells were seeded in Petri dishes (1.6 × 106 cells) or 6-well plates (7.5 × 105 cells) and allowed to attach overnight. The medium was replaced, and the cells were incubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of transport inhibitors. The cells were then incubated with GSAO, GCAO, or CAO, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with 1 ml of 70! w/w nitric acid. Lysates were diluted 30-fold and analyzed for arsenic atoms using an Elan 6100 Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Sciex Instruments). Mitochondrial Swelling Assay—Mitochondria were isolated from the livers of ∼250-g male Wistar rats using differential centrifugation as described previously (1Don A.S. Kisker O. Dilda P. Donoghue N. Zhao X. Decollogne S. Creighton B. Flynn E. Folkman J. Hogg P.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Dilda P.J. Decollogne S. Rossiter-Thornton M. Hogg P.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11729-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 3 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, buffer containing 213 mm mannitol, 71 mm sucrose, and 10 mm sodium succinate at a concentration of 30 mg of protein/ml. Mitochondrial permeability transition induction was assessed spectrophotometrically by suspending the liver mitochondria at 0.5 mg of protein/ml at 25 °C in 3 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, buffer containing 75 mm mannitol, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm sodium succinate, and 2 μm rotenone. Swelling was measured by monitoring the associated decrease in light scattering at 520 nm using a SpectraMax Plus microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Statistical Analyses—Results are presented as means ± S.E. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided, and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Inhibition of Cell Surface γGT Blunts Accumulation of GSAO in Endothelial Cells and Antiproliferative Activity—Both the γGT substrate, reduced glutathione, and the γGT inhibitor, acivicin, significantly reduced accumulation of GSAO in endothelial cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Acivicin also blunted the antiproliferative activity of GSAO (Fig. 1D). These findings implied that the effect of GSAO on endothelial cells was modified by cell surface γGT. To test this conclusion, the effect of varying cell surface expression of γGT on the antiproliferative activity of GSAO was assessed. Previously, well characterized c21 melanoma cell clones expressing low (0.34 milliunits/mg of cell protein) or high (91 milliunits/mg of cell protein) levels of γGT activity were employed (10Franzini M. Corti A. Lorenzini E. Paolicchi A. Pompella A. De Cesare M. Perego P. Gatti L. Leone R. Apostoli P. Zunino F. Eur. J. Cancer. 2006; 42: 2623-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Expression Level of γGT Positively Correlates with Sensitivity of Model Cells to GSAO—Melanoma c21/basal and c21/γGT clones were tested for sensitivity to GSAO in 24- or 72-h assays. The 24-h GSAO IC50 (concentration of compound that inhibits proliferation by 50!) for proliferation arrest was ∼60 and ∼1250 μm for high and low γGT cells, respectively (Fig. 2A). These IC50 values fell to ∼20 and ∼115 μm, respectively, in 72-h assays (Fig. 2B). The antiproliferative effects of GSAO were negated in both high and low expressing cells with the potent γGT inhibitor, ABBA (Fig. 2C). Treatment with ABBA alone at the concentration used had no effect on cell proliferation or viability (data not shown). These findings indicate that the susceptibility of cells to proliferation arrest by GSAO is markedly dependent on expression level of γGT. The time dependence of the antiproliferative effect suggests that GSAO is being cleaved by γGT and that the product(s) is then inhibiting cell proliferation. To test whether GSAO is a substrate for γGT, the apparent Ki for binding of GSAO to γGT was measured. Ki for Binding of γGT to GSAO—Inhibition of γGT by GSAO was measured from the effect of fixed concentrations of GSAO on the initial velocity of hydrolysis of γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide by γGT. The apparent Ki for competitive inhibition of γGT by GSAO was estimated to be 1.6 ± 0.2 mm, which is similar to the Km for hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate, γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (2.4 ± 0.4 mm) (Fig. 2D). This finding implies that the aminophenylarsonous acid moiety of GSAO does not demonstrably affect access of γGT to the glutathione pendant. The OATP Family Is Involved in Endothelial Cell Uptake of the Product of GSAO Cleavage by γGT, GCAO—GCAO was produced by cleaving the γ-glutamyl group from GSAO with porcine kidney γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. The enzyme was removed from the reactions by size-exclusion filtration, and GCAO was analyzed by HPLC. GSAO and GCAO have retention times of 3.03 and 3.38 min, respectively (Fig. 3A). The organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) family of transporters function independently of ATP and sodium gradients and were originally characterized as uptake transporters (12Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). OATP family members have been implicated in transport of glutathione-S conjugates (13Kobayashi D. Nozawa T. Imai K. Nezu J. Tsuji A. Tamai I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), so they were candidate transporters for GCAO. 4,4′-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) is an inhibitor of the plasma membrane OATP family of transporters. Accumulation of GCAO in endothelial cells (data not shown) and antiproliferative activity were reduced by DIDS (Fig. 3D), which implies that this family of transporters are involved in GCAO translocation across the plasma membrane. GCAO Accumulates More Rapidly in Endothelial Cells and Has Greater Antiproliferative Activity than GSAO—GCAO accumulated in BAE cells at a 8.7-fold faster rate than GSAO (Fig. 3B). The rate of accumulation of GCAO was 3.8 ± 0.1 pmol of arsenic atoms/106 cells/min, when compared with 0.4 ± 0.1 pmol of arsenic atoms/106 cells/min for GSAO. The faster rate of accumulation of GCAO corresponded to a ∼5-fold increased antiproliferative activity. The IC50 for GSAO and GCAO in a 24-h BAE cell proliferation assay was 97 ± 5 and 18 ± 3 μm, respectively (Fig. 3C). It is apparent from the results that the IC50 for GSAO markedly decreases with time of incubation and much less so for GCAO. For example, the 72-h GSAO IC50 is similar to the 24-h IC50 for GCAO. These results are consistent with a mechanism whereby GSAO is cleaved at the cell surface by γGT and the resultant GCAO enters the cell and triggers proliferation arrest. GCAO Is Secreted from Endothelial Cells by MRP1—Cellular accumulation of GCAO is a balance between the rate of uptake and the rate of export from the cell. GSAO accumulation in cells is controlled by the rate of export by MRP1 and MRP2 (2Dilda P.J. Don A.S. Tanabe K.M. Higgins V.J. Allen J.D. Dawes I.W. Hogg P.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2005; 97: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To test whether GCAO is also exported by MRP1, the effect of the MRP1 inhibitor 4H10 on accumulation in endothelial cells was measured. Cellular accumulation of GCAO was increased 3-fold when MRP1 was inhibited (Fig. 4A), which correlated with the more potent antiproliferative effect (Fig. 4B). The inhibitor alone had no effect on BAE cell proliferation (data not shown). GCAO Triggers the Mitochondrial Permeability Transition More Rapidly than GSAO—GSAO inactivates the mitochondrial inner membrane transporter ANT, which leads to proliferation arrest and cell death (1Don A.S. Kisker O. Dilda P. Donoghue N. Zhao X. Decollogne S. Creighton B. Flynn E. Folkman J. Hogg P.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). GCAO also induces the mitochondrial permeability transition (Fig. 4C). Comparison of the time for 25! maximal swelling as a function GSAO or GCAO concentration indicates that GCAO is approximately twice as efficacious as GSAO attriggering the permeability transition (Fig. 4D). GCAO and Its Metabolite, CAO, Accumulate in Endothelial Cells at the Same Rate and Have Comparable Antiproliferative Activity—CAO was produced by cleaving the glycine amino acid from GCAO with porcine kidney aminopeptidase N (Fig. 5A). The enzyme was removed from the reactions by size-exclusion filtration, and the product of the reaction was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 5B). CAO has a retention time of 3.64 min. The rate of accumulation of CAO in BAE cells was 3.3 ± 0.1 pmol of arsenic atoms/106 cells/min, when compared with 3.8 ± 0.1 pmol of arsenic atoms/106 cells/min for GCAO (Fig. 5C). The similar rate of accumulation of the two compounds corresponded to a comparable antiproliferative activity. The IC50 for GCAO and CAO in a 48-h BAE cell proliferation assay was 9 ± 2 and 11 ± 2 μm, respectively (Fig. 5D). CAO Is Secreted from Endothelial Cells by MRP1—Similar to the result for GCAO (Fig. 4A), cellular accumulation of CAO was increased 2.2-fold when MRP1 was inhibited (Fig. 6A). The inhibitor alone had no effect on BAE cell proliferation (data not shown). CAO Triggers the Mitochondrial Permeability Transition More Rapidly than GCAO—Like GSAO and GCAO, CAO also induces the mitochondrial permeability transition (Fig. 6B). Comparison of the time for 25! maximal swelling as a function GCAO or CAO concentration indicates that GCAO is approximately twice as efficacious as GCAO at triggering the permeability transition (Fig. 6C). γGT is present on the outer surface of the plasma membrane (14Horiuchi S. Inoue M. Morino Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 429-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of virtually all cells. The enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of the bond linking the glutamate and cysteine residues of extracellular glutathione and glutathione-S conjugates (15Enoiu M. Herber R. Wennig R. Marson C. Bodaud H. Leroy P. Mitrea N. Siest G. Wellman M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GSAO is effectively a glutathione-S conjugate of aminophenylarsonous acid, so it is not surprising that it is a substrate for γGT. This has been demonstrated in several ways. First, GSAO is an efficient substrate for isolated γGT. Second, endothelial cell accumulation and antiproliferative activity of GSAO was blunted by extracellular glutathione and an active site inhibitor of γGT. The glutathione likely acted as a competitive substrate inhibitor of γGT in this experiment. Third, the level of cell surface γGT correlated strongly with the sensitivity of model cells to GSAO. There was a marked time dependence of the antiproliferative effect of GSAO on endothelial cells. The longer the incubation of GSAO with γGT-expressing cells, the lower the IC50 for proliferation arrest. This time dependence is consistent with a mechanism where GSAO is cleaved by γGT and the product of this reaction is inhibiting cell proliferation. This mechanism was tested by making the product of γGT cleavage, GCAO, and examining how endothelial cells respond to this compound. As anticipated, GCAO accumulated much more rapidly in endothelial cells than GSAO and had greater antiproliferative activity. The mechanism of GCAO import and export from endothelial cells was examined. Import of GCAO into endothelial cells (data not shown) and antiproliferative activity was reduced by an inhibitor of the OATP family (13Kobayashi D. Nozawa T. Imai K. Nezu J. Tsuji A. Tamai I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Some transporters are proton- or sodium-dependent, including the proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter family (16Daniel H. Kottra G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and the sodium-dependent glutathione transport mechanism and sulfate dicarboxylate transporter (17Pajor A.M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 451: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). GCAO accumulation in endothelial cells was not activated at low pH and was only marginally sodium-dependent (data not shown), however, implying that these transporters are not involved in GCAO uptake. Export of GCAO, as for GSAO (2Dilda P.J. Don A.S. Tanabe K.M. Higgins V.J. Allen J.D. Dawes I.W. Hogg P.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2005; 97: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), is via MRP1 and likely also MRP2. Glutathione-S conjugates and their metabolites are known substrates for these MRPs (2Dilda P.J. Don A.S. Tanabe K.M. Higgins V.J. Allen J.D. Dawes I.W. Hogg P.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2005; 97: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Kruh G.D. Belinsky M.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7537-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The glycine-cysteine peptide bond of GCAO is readily cleaved by dipeptidases to produce CAO. A number of dipeptidases are found on the plasma membrane (19Cannon V.T. Barfuss D.W. Zalups R.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 394-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the cytosol (20Josch C. Sies H. Akerboom T.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is likely that GCAO is cleaved on or in the cell by one or more dipeptidases. CAO accumulated in endothelial cells at the same rate as GCAO and had comparable antiproliferative activity. Like GSAO and GCAO, CAO was also a substrate for MRP1 in endothelial cells. These findings suggest that further processing of GCAO to CAO has little bearing on how endothelial cells respond to the compound. A number of trivalent arsenicals, including sodium arsenite (21Larochette N. Decaudin D. Jacotot E. Brenner C. Marzo I. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Xie Z. Reed J. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), phenylarsonous acid (4McStay G.P. Clarke S.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), GSAO (1Don A.S. Kisker O. Dilda P. Donoghue N. Zhao X. Decollogne S. Creighton B. Flynn E. Folkman J. Hogg P.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and ortho-GSAO (3Dilda P.J. Decollogne S. Rossiter-Thornton M. Hogg P.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11729-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), have been shown to react with two cysteine thiols on the matrix face of mitochondrial ANT, forming stable cyclic dithioarsinite complexes in which both sulfur atoms are bound to arsenic. This interaction triggers opening of the mitochondrial transition pore, which leads to proliferation arrest and apoptotic cell death. CAO was about two times more efficacious than GCAO and GCAO was about two times more effective than GSAO at triggering the mitochondrial permeability transition in isolated mitochondria. GSAO and its metabolites, therefore, have similar effects on mitochondrial integrity. There is precedent for an important role for γGT in the mechanism of action of glutathione-S conjugates other than GSAO. γGT-dependent metabolism of glutathione-S-hydroxy-2,3-trans-nonenal is associated with a considerable increase of cytotoxicity due to the release of cysteinyl-glycine-S-hydroxy-2,3-trans-nonenal (15Enoiu M. Herber R. Wennig R. Marson C. Bodaud H. Leroy P. Mitrea N. Siest G. Wellman M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Also, γGT processing of mercuric glutathione conjugate to mercuric cysteinyl-glycine results in increased luminal uptake of the product in the proximal tubules of the kidney (19Cannon V.T. Barfuss D.W. Zalups R.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 394-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pro-drug mechanism of action of GSAO described here implies that GSAO should be more effective against γGT-positive tumors. Metabolism of GSAO by tumor cell and/or tumor endothelium γGT would produce high local concentrations of GCAO that will then block tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. Notably, tumors of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, and ovary express γGT, whereas soft tissue tumors tend not to express this enzyme (22Hanigan M.H. Frierson Jr., H.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In preclinical toxicology studies, it was noted that high levels of GSAO administration resulted in damage to the distal tubules of the kidney in mice and rats. The damage resolved upon cessation of treatment. Interestingly, high levels of γGT and dipeptidase (dehydropeptidase 1) have been reported in kidney proximal tubules (19Cannon V.T. Barfuss D.W. Zalups R.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 394-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hanigan M.H. Frierson Jr., H.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the GCAO and CAO transporter OATP is expressed specifically on the apical side of distal nephrons (23Lee W. Glaeser H. Smith L.H. Roberts R.L. Moeckel G.W. Gervasini G. Leake B.F. Kim R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9610-9617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The kidney toxicity observed at maximum tolerated doses of GSAO in rodents, therefore, may be a consequence of high local processing of GSAO by γGT in the proximal tubules and transport of GCAO into the distal tubule cells, where it triggers mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our findings indicate that γGT processing of GSAO at the cell surface is the rate-limiting step in its antiangiogenic activity (Fig. 7). The reaction product GCAO is then transported into the cell by OATP, where it may be further processed to CAO before it reacts with its mitochondrial target. This information will aid in the design of better antimitochondrial cancer drugs. We thank Russell Pickford for helpful discussion and the mass spectrometry spectra analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2143925621,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are inducible feedback inhibitors of janus kinase and signal transducer and activators of transcription signaling pathways. In addition, SOCS1 has been identified to regulate stability of nuclear NF-kappaB subunits. However, details about the regulation of the nuclear pool of SOCS1 are unknown. Using different experimental approaches, we observed that SOCS1 but no further SOCS family members localized to the nucleus when expressed in various cell lines. Nuclear transport was confirmed for endogenous SOCS1 in macrophages stimulated with IFN-gamma. Sequence analysis revealed a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) located between the src-homology 2 (SH2) domain and the SOCS box of SOCS1. Deletion of this region, introduction of a series of R/A point mutations, or substitution of this sequence with the respective region of SOCS3 resulted in loss of nuclear localization. Fusion of the SOCS1-NLS to cytokine-inducible SH2 region containing protein (CIS) resulted in nuclear localization of this otherwise cytoplasmic protein. SOCS1 mutants with loss of nuclear localization were still effective in suppressing IFN-alpha-mediated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, they showed decreased inhibition of IFN-gamma-mediated induction of CD54. The results identify a hitherto unknown transport of SOCS1 into the nucleus which extends the spectrum of SOCS1 inhibitory activity."
https://openalex.org/W2078808508,"The genome sequence of Aspergillus oryzae revealed unexpectedly that this species has approximately 20% more genes than its congeneric species A. nidulans and A. fumigatus. Where did these extra genes come from? Here, we evaluate several possible causes of the elevated gene number. Many gene families are expanded in A. oryzae relative to A. nidulans and A. fumigatus, but we find no evidence of ancient whole-genome duplication or other segmental duplications, either in A. oryzae or in the common ancestor of the genus Aspergillus. We show that the presence of divergent pairs of paralogs is a feature peculiar to A. oryzae and is not shared with A. nidulans or A. fumigatus. In phylogenetic trees that include paralog pairs from A. oryzae, we frequently find that one of the genes in a pair from A. oryzae has the expected orthologous relationship with A. nidulans, A. fumigatus and other species in the subphylum Eurotiomycetes, whereas the other A. oryzae gene falls outside this clade but still within the Ascomycota. We identified 456 such gene pairs in A. oryzae. Further phylogenetic analysis did not however indicate a single consistent evolutionary origin for the divergent members of these pairs. Approximately one-third of them showed phylogenies that are suggestive of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from Sordariomycete species, and these genes are closer together in the A. oryzae genome than expected by chance, but no unique Sordariomycete donor species was identifiable. The postulated HGTs from Sordariomycetes still leave the majority of extra A. oryzae genes unaccounted for. One possible explanation for our observations is that A. oryzae might have been the recipient of many separate HGT events from diverse donors."
https://openalex.org/W2132976741,"Eukaryotic DNA replication requires the assembly of multiprotein pre-replication complexes (pre-RCs) at chromosomal origins of DNA replication. Here we describe the interactions of highly purified Schizosaccharomyces pombe pre-RC components, SpORC, SpCdc18, and SpCdt1, with each other and with ars1 origin DNA. We show that SpORC binds DNA in at least two steps. The first step likely involves electrostatic interactions between the AT-hook motifs of SpOrc4 and AT tracts in ars1 DNA and results in the formation of a salt-sensitive complex. In the second step, the salt-sensitive complex is slowly converted to a salt-stable complex that involves additional interactions between SpORC and DNA. Binding of SpORC to ars1 DNA is facilitated by negative supercoiling and is accompanied by changes in DNA topology, suggesting that SpORC-DNA complexes contain underwound or negatively writhed DNA. Purified human origin recognition complex (ORC) induces similar topological changes in origin DNA, indicating that this property of ORC is conserved in eukaryotic evolution and plays an important role in ORC function. We also show that SpCdc18 and SpCdt1 form a binary complex that has greater affinity for DNA than either protein alone. In addition, both proteins contribute significantly to the stability of the initial SpORC-DNA complex and enhance the SpORC-dependent topology changes in origin DNA. Thus, the formation of stable protein-DNA complexes at S. pombe origins of replication involves binary interactions among all three proteins, as well as interactions of both SpORC and SpCdt1-SpCdc18 with origin DNA. These findings demonstrate that SpORC is not the sole determinant of origin recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1974162402,"Several bacterial solute transport mechanisms involve members of the periplasmic binding protein (PBP) superfamily that bind and deliver ligand to integral membrane transport proteins in the ATP-binding cassette, tripartite tricarboxylate transporter, or tripartite ATP-independent (TRAP) families. PBPs involved in ATP-binding cassette transport systems have been well characterized, but only a few PBPs involved in TRAP transport have been studied. We have measured the thermal stability, determined the oligomerization state by small angle x-ray scattering, and solved the x-ray crystal structure to 1.9 Å resolution of a TRAP-PBP (open reading frame tm0322) from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (TM0322). The overall fold of TM0322 is similar to other TRAP transport related PBPs, although the structural similarity of backbone atoms (2.5-3.1 Å root mean square deviation) is unusually low for PBPs within the same group. Individual monomers within the tetrameric asymmetric unit of TM0322 exhibit high root mean square deviation (0.9 Å) to each other as a consequence of conformational heterogeneity in their binding pockets. The gel filtration elution profile and the small angle x-ray scattering analysis indicate that TM0322 assembles as dimers in solution that in turn assemble into a dimer of dimers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Tetramerization has been previously observed in another TRAP-PBP (the Rhodobacter sphaeroides α-keto acid-binding protein) where quaternary structure formation is postulated to be an important requisite for the transmembrane transport process. Several bacterial solute transport mechanisms involve members of the periplasmic binding protein (PBP) superfamily that bind and deliver ligand to integral membrane transport proteins in the ATP-binding cassette, tripartite tricarboxylate transporter, or tripartite ATP-independent (TRAP) families. PBPs involved in ATP-binding cassette transport systems have been well characterized, but only a few PBPs involved in TRAP transport have been studied.

The overall fold of TM0322 is similar to other TRAP transport related PBPs, although the structural similarity of backbone atoms (2.5-3.1 Å root mean square deviation) is unusually low for PBPs within the same group. Individual monomers within the tetrameric asymmetric unit of TM0322 exhibit high root mean square deviation (0.9 Å) to each other as a consequence of conformational heterogeneity in their binding pockets. The gel filtration elution profile and the small angle x-ray scattering analysis indicate that TM0322 assembles as dimers in solution that in turn assemble into a dimer of dimers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Tetramerization has been previously observed in another TRAP-PBP (the Rhodobacter sphaeroides α-keto acid-binding protein) where quaternary structure formation is postulated to be an important requisite for the transmembrane transport process.

Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Winnen B. Hvorup R.N. Saier Jr., M.H. Res. Microbiol. 2003; 154: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that utilize the H+/M+ motive force to translocate ligands. Only a small number of TRAP transport systems have been characterized in detail (4Forward J.A. Behrendt M.C. Wyborn N.R. Cross R. Kelly D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5482-5493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Severi E. Randle G. Kivlin P. Whitfield K. Young R. Moxon R. Kelly D. Hood D. Thomas G.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1173-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). TRAP transport systems, such as that from Rhodobacter capsulatus (4Forward J.A. Behrendt M.C. Wyborn N.R. Cross R. Kelly D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5482-5493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are comprised of three proteins: a PBP, a small integral membrane protein, and a large integral membrane protein that shows sequence similarity to ion symporters. Arrangements of these components can also be fused into multi-domain polypeptides (9Kelly D.J. Thomas G.H. FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2001; 25: 405-424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligands that are known to be transported in TRAP systems, such as ascorbate (10Thomas G.H. Southworth T. Leon-Kempis M.R. Leech A. Kelly D.J. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), sialic acid (8Severi E. Randle G. Kivlin P. Whitfield K. Young R. Moxon R. Kelly D. Hood D. Thomas G.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1173-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), pyroglutamic acid (11Rucktooa P. Antoine R. Herrou J. Huvent I. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Villeret V. Bompard C. J. Mol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8064-8072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are usually not transported by ATP-binding cassette transporters. PBPs form a protein superfamily characterized by two α/β domains with a ligand-binding site located at the domain interface (13Tam R. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two domains typically are connected by two to three β-strands that function as a hinge in ligand-mediated changes in the relative orientation of the two domains (14Bjorkman A.J. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The ligand is completely enveloped within the interdomain interface of the closed state. Three groups (I, II, and III) can be distinguished within the PBP superfamily categorized upon the topology of β-strands in each the two domains (15Fukami-Kobayashi K. Tateno Y. Nishikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Tam and Saier (13Tam R. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) originally identified TRAP-PBPs as members of the PBP superfamily based on sequence similarity. In the absence of a three-dimensional structure, it was not possible to further assign TRAP-PBPs to one of the three structural groups. The crystal structures of two (the sialic acid-binding protein from Haemophilus influenzae (SaBP) (16Muller A. Severi E. Mulligan C. Watts A.G. Kelly D.J. Wilson K.S. Wilkinson A.J. Thomas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22212-22222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the α-keto acid-binding protein from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (αKaBP) (17Gonin S. Arnoux P. Pierru B. Lavergne J. Alonso B. Sabaty M. Pignol D. BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)) TRAP-PBPs revealed they belong to the PBP group II. Unlike previously studied PBPs, the αKaBP was shown to be an obligate dimer that forms tetramers in solution (17Gonin S. Arnoux P. Pierru B. Lavergne J. Alonso B. Sabaty M. Pignol D. BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the complete genomic sequence of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima has revealed that this organism is rich in metabolite uptake systems (18Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M. Cotton M.D. Pratt M.S.

Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). To further understand this important aspect of microbial biochemistry, it is necessary to supplement sequence-based information with functional and structural studies. A survey of the genomic sequence of T. maritima (18Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M. Cotton M.D. Pratt M.S. Phillips C.A. Richardson D. Heidelberg J. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Eisen J.A. White O. Salzberg S.L. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Fraser C.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) identified a large number of potential PBP open reading frames (ORFs) in metabolite transport operons. Among these, ORF tm0322 exhibits high amino acid and operon similarity to TRAP-associated PBPs but not to ATP-binding cassette transport-associated PBPs. Immediately adjacent to tm0322 are two ORFs (tm0323 and tm0324) that show significant sequence similarity to the R. capsulatus TRAP integral membrane transporters (4Forward J.A. Behrendt M.C. Wyborn N.R. Cross R. Kelly D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5482-5493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This gene cluster is therefore postulated to correspond to a T. maritima TRAP transport system. Here we present the initial biochemical characterization, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, and x-ray crystal structure of the PBP component of this putative TRAP transport system. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification—The tm0322 gene was amplified from T. maritima genomic DNA by sticky end PCR (19Zeng G. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using the following primers: PO4-TATGTCAGCGGTATTTGGCGCGAAGTACACACTGAG, and TCAGCGGTATTTGGCGCGAAGTACACACTGAG for the 5′ half of the gene; PO4-AATTCTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGCCCAGACTCTCCCTTCACTTCCTTGATCAGCTGG, and CTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGCCCAGACTCTCCCTTCACTTCCTTGATCAGCTGG for the 3′ half of the gene. The resulting fragment, lacking the putative periplasmic signal sequence, was cloned into the NdeI/EcoRI sites of a pET21a (Novagen) plasmid for overexpression in Escherichia coli. A hexahistidine affinity tag was fused in-frame at the C terminus to facilitate purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (20Yip T.T. Hutchens T.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 244: 179-190PubMed Google Scholar) followed by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex S75 26/60). TM0322 elutes from the gel filtration column as multiple peaks, which based on calculated hydrodynamic radius are monomers and dimers (see Fig. 1). Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient (ϵ = 52,000 m-1 cm-1) (21Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar) calculated from the number of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the protein sequence. Selenomethionine-substituted TM0322 was grown in the E. coli methionine auxotroph B834 (Novagen). A total of 100 ml of an overnight culture grown in TB was pelleted and resuspended in 4 liters of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 100 mg/liter selenomethionine. This was grown to an A600 of 0.7 at 37 °C and induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mm), followed by further growth at 37 °C for 3-4 h. Protein was purified as described above for the native protein except that 5 mm dithiothreitol was added to all buffers. SAXS Data Acquisition and Processing—SAXS data were collected at beam line X21 at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory). The wavelength of the beam was 1.24 Å. Monomeric (see Fig. 1B, lane 7) and dimeric (see Fig. 1B, lane 14) fractions from the gel filtration column were concentrated to 3.0 and 1.7 mg/ml, respectively, in a 10 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, buffer for SAXS analysis. Monomer, dimer, and buffer samples were exposed for 45 s at 10 °C in a quartz flow cell at a flow rate of 28 μl/min. SAXS data on a standard protein, hen egg white lysozyme (14.2 kDa; Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ), were collected over a concentration series in the same capillary. For the monomer and dimer, the recorded intensities of three independent runs/sample were averaged together after they were circularly averaged and scaled to obtain a relative scattering intensity (I) as a function of momentum transfer vector, q (q = [4πsinθ]/λ), after subtraction of buffer scattering contributions. I0 values, determined for the monomeric and dimeric fractions relative to that of lysozyme (22Krigbaum W.R. Kugler F.R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), were as expected (see Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of P(r) analysis using GNOMSampleMolecular massIo/cProteinRgDmaxObservedExpectedkDamg/mlÅÅLysozyme14.235.01.014.6 ± 0.0645Monomeric TM032237.290.191.73.022.10 ± 0.0380Dimeric TM032274.4188.5183.41.731.47 ± 0.45115 Open table in a new tab SAXS Data Analysis—For monodisperse globular proteins, a plot of ln(I(q)) versus q2, where q·Rg ≤ 1, was linear and was fit to Equation 1 Iq=I0e−Rg2q23(Eq. 1) to provide an estimation of the scattering particle radius of gyration (Rg) and forward or zero angle scatter (I0) from the slope (−Rg2/2) and the y-intercept I0 (Guinier analysis (23Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Acdemic Press, New York1982: 18-37Google Scholar)). All of the scattering data were analyzed in this manner using the Primus software package (24Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). Indirect Fourier transformation of the scattering data over the measured q range gives a pairwise distribution function of interatomic vectors, P(r). The inverse Fourier transform of I(q) yields P(r), which represents the distribution of vector lengths connecting small volume elements within the entire volume of the scattering particle (Equation 2). Pr=12π2∫Iqq⋅rsinq⋅rdq(Eq. 2) P(r) = 0 at r = 0 Å and approaches 0 at the maximum linear dimension of the particle, Dmax. The radius of gyration (Rg) and forward scattering (I0) were calculated from the second moment and the start of P(r) (25Ashish, Juncadella I.J. Garg R. Boone C.D. Anguita J. Krueger J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2761-2772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), respectively, where Rg is the root mean square of all elemental volumes from the center of mass of the particle, weighted by their scattering densities, and I0 is directly proportional to the molar particle concentration multiplied by the square of the scattering particle molecular weight for particles with the same mean scattering density (see Table 1) (25Ashish, Juncadella I.J. Garg R. Boone C.D. Anguita J. Krueger J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2761-2772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The GNOM45 software package (26Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2874) Google Scholar) was used for all P(r) analyses. Ab Initio Model Construction—Three-dimensional shapes of the monomeric and dimeric proteins were constructed from their respective SAXS data using the GASBOR22IQW program (q range input for each analysis was from 0.01 to 0.04 Å-1) (27Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar), by calculating the distribution of linearly connected 1.9 Å spheres (the number of spheres is set to the number of residues in the protein) that best fit the scattering data. Each calculation was repeated five times with different random starting points for the Monte Carlo optimization algorithm; no predefined shape or symmetry constraints were used. From these runs, the predicted structure with the lowest deviation of the calculated scattering profile from experimental data was used for interpretation. To compare the SAXS-based models of monomeric and dimeric TM0322, with the atomic structure obtained from x-ray crystallographic data, the structures were superimposed using the SUPCOMB13 (28Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) program. Thermal Denaturation—Thermal denaturations were determined by measuring the circular dichroism signal at 222 nm (1-cm path length) as a function of temperature, using an Aviv model 202 circular dichroism spectrophotometer with 2 μm protein (12.5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, 5 mm NaCl) and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) at various concentrations (4.0-6.5 m). Protein samples were equilibrated for 15 min prior to collecting data. Each measurement includes a 3-s averaging time for data collection and a 60-s equilibration period at each temperature. The data were fit to a two-state model to determine the appTm values (29Schellman J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 30Cohen D.S. Pielak G.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The appTm values in the absence of denaturant were determined by linear extrapolation (31Cuneo M.J. Changela A. Warren J.J. Beese L.S. Hellinga H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A total of 10 ligands (succinate, fumarate, maleate, ectoine, sialic acid, xylulose, α-ketoglutarate, tartrate, glutamate, and oxalate) were screened by monitoring ligand-induced changes in the thermal melting transition; none of these ligands induced changes in the appTm value. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—TM0322 was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion in drops containing 2 μl of 10 mg/ml protein solution mixed with 2 μl of 1.9-2.3 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 4.2, and equilibrated against 900 μl of 1.9-2.3 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 4.2. Large selenomethionine-substituted crystals in the P6522 space group (a = 119 Å, b = 119 Å, c = 427.3 Å) typically grew within 3-4 days at 17 °C. The crystals were transferred stepwise to 2.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 4.2, incrementally supplemented with glycerol in 5% steps up to 25% final concentration for cryoprotection. The crystals were mounted in a nylon loop and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All of the data were collected at 100 K at the SER-CAT 22ID and 22BM beam lines at the Advanced Photon Source. The diffraction data were scaled and indexed using XDS (32Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Structure Determination Methods—The structure was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method (33Hendrickson W.A. Smith J.L. Sheriff S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using a three-wavelength dataset collected for a selenomethionine TM0322 crystal at the selenium K/α absorption edge. The SHELXD (34Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) program was used to identify 36 of a possible 44 selenium sites, corresponding to four monomers in the asymmetric unit. The top substructure solution from SHELXD yielded a pseudo-free correlation coefficient of 74.35% and contrast and connectivity parameters of 0.831 and 0.944, respectively. Initial phases calculated after density modification in SHELXE produced an interpretable electron density map. The use of noncrystallographic symmetry aided further phase improvement and phase extension in RESOLVE (35Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). The improved phases were input into ARP/wARP (36Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), which was able to trace 1214 of the total 1316 residues in the asymmetric unit. Further manual model building was carried out in O (37Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. KjeldgaardActa Crystallogr A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) or COOT (38Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22525) Google Scholar), and the model was refined in REFMAC5 (39Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). The final model includes four monomers and 529 water molecules. The model exhibits good stereochemistry as determined by PROCHECK (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar); the final refinement statistics are listed in Table 2.

Open table in a new tab Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification—ORF tm0322 in the T. maritima genome sequence (18Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M. Cotton M.D. Pratt M.S. Phillips C.A. Richardson D. Heidelberg J. Sutton G.G.

Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) was postulated to encode a TRAP-PBP of unknown function based on its sequence similarity to the known R. capsulatus C4-dicarboxylate-binding protein and its position within a putative operon containing ORFs homologous to other TRAP transporters. The DNA for ORF tm0322, lacking a putative periplasmic signal sequence (41Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar) (residues 1-16), was amplified from T. maritima genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into a pET21a vector in-frame with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Overexpression of native (in BL21 cells) and selenomethionine-substituted protein (in B834 cells) yielded ∼70 mg of pure protein/liter of culture. C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged TM0322 was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (20Yip T.T. Hutchens T.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 244: 179-190PubMed Google Scholar) followed by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex S75 26/60). TM0322 elutes from the gel filtration column in multiple peaks that are assigned to monomers, dimers, and higher order assemblies based on the calculated hydrodynamic radius (Fig. 1). Quaternary assemblies exceeding dimers cannot be resolved because they elute in the void volume of the gel filtration column (>75 kDa). Comparison of native and denaturing PAGE analysis of the eluate indicates there are at least three noncovalent populations of protein assemblies (Fig. 1). Both the monomeric (lanes 11-15) and dimeric (lanes 7-10) fractions are homogeneous in the native PAGE gel; mobility shifts in the native gel correlate with the peaks observed in the gel filtration chromatogram (Fig. 1). Thermal Stability—The stability of TM0322 was determined by thermal denaturation using circular dichroism (30Cohen D.S. Pielak G.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the absence of GdmCl, no significant change in the circular dichroism signal could be observed as a function of temperature (data not shown). All of the subsequent measurements were carried out in the presence of GdmCl (Fig. 2). Thermal denaturations fit a two-state model (29Schellman J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 30Cohen D.S. Pielak G.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The apo-protein has an apparent thermal transition midpoint (appTm) of 130 °C in the absence of GdmCl, as determined by linear extrapolation of thermal denaturations measured at different GdmCl concentrations (Fig. 2) (31Cuneo M.J.

Small Angle X-ray Scattering—The putative monomeric (Fig. 1B, lane 7) and dimeric (Fig. 1B, lane 14) fractions were concentrated and analyzed by small angle x-ray scattering (Fig. 3). Their Guinier plots are linear over a q range of 0.012-0.058 Å-1 for the monomeric and 0.012-0.040 Å-1 for the dimeric fractions, which suggests that both samples are monodisperse and furthermore indicates Rg values of 22.1 ± 0.03 and 31.5 ± 0.45 Å for the monomeric and dimeric fractions, respectively (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The P(r) data for the monomeric protein indicates particles with a Dmax of ∼80 Å, whereas the P(r) for the dimeric protein has particles with a Dmax of ∼115 Å (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The GASBOR22IQW (27Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys.

The models of monomeric and dimeric TM0322 used 342 and 684 1.9 Å radius spheres (corresponding to the expected number of residues in each of the assemblies) and 234 and 611 water molecules, respectively, based on a Fibonacci grid of 12 and 14, respectively (27Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar); no shape or symmetry constraints were imposed. The resulting models are shown in Fig. 4. The monomer model has an overall shape (∼65 Å ×∼40 Å ×∼20 Å) with dimensions consistent with other TRAP-PBPs (11Rucktooa P. Antoine R. Herrou J. Huvent I.

The dimer model has an overall shape of a three-dimensional triangle (∼70 Å × ∼100 Å ×∼110 Å ×∼25 Å) (Fig. 4). It shares little resemblance to αKaBP, which is an obligate dimer. The model can be bisected into two fragments equal to those of the monomeric SAXS model, suggesting that TM0322 assembles into a dimer arranged differently from αKaBP (Fig. 4).

https://openalex.org/W1994633260,"Mitochondrial protein kinase C isozymes have been reported to mediate both cardiac ischemic preconditioning and ischemia/reperfusion injury. In addition, cardiac preconditioning improves the recovery of ATP levels after ischemia/reperfusion injury. We have, therefore, evaluated protein kinase C modulation of the F1F0 ATPase in neonatal cardiac myocytes. Exposure of cells to 3 or 100 nm 4β-phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate induced co-immunoprecipitation of δ protein kinase C (but not α, ϵ, or ζ protein kinase C) with the d subunit of the F1F0 ATPase. This co-immunoprecipitation correlated with 40 ± 3% and 72 ± 9% inhibitions of oligomycin-sensitive F1F0 ATPase activity, respectively. We observed prominent expression of δ protein kinase C in cardiac myocyte mitochondria, which was enhanced following a 4-h hypoxia exposure. In contrast, hypoxia decreased mitochondrial ζPKC levels by 85 ± 1%. Following 4 h of hypoxia, F1F0 ATPase activity was inhibited by 75 ± 9% and δ protein kinase C co-immunoprecipitated with the d subunit of F1F0 ATPase. In vitro incubation of protein kinase C with F1F0 ATPase enhanced F1F0 activity in the absence of protein kinase C activators and inhibited it in the presence of activators. Recombinant δ protein kinase C also inhibited F1F0 ATPase activity. Protein kinase C overlay assays revealed δ protein kinase C binding to the d subunit of F1F0 ATPase, which was modulated by diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and cardiolipin.

Our results suggest a novel regulation of the F1F0 ATPase by the δ protein kinase C isozyme. The mitochondrial F1F0 ATP synthase produces greater than 90% of cellular ATP in the myocardium, yet relatively little is known regarding how this enzyme complex is regulated (1Di Pancrazio F. Mavelli I. Isola M. Losano G. Pagliaro P. Harris D.A. Lippe G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1659: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2Harris D.A. Das A.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). It has an F1 domain in the mitochondrial matrix (3Carbajo R.J. Kellas F.A. Runswick M.J. Montgomery M.G. Walker J.E. Neuhaus D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 824-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and an F0 domain, which is a proton channel, that traverses the inner mitochondrial membrane (IM). 2The abbreviations used are: IM, inner mitochondrial membrane; Hx, hypoxia; 4β-PMA, 4β-phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate; Nx, normoxia; DG, diacylglycerol; PS, phosphatidylserine; NCM, neonatal cardiac myocytes; NCP, nitrocellulose paper; CL, cardiolipin; PKC, protein kinase C; IR, ischemia/reperfusion. 2The abbreviations used are: IM, inner mitochondrial membrane; Hx, hypoxia; 4β-PMA, 4β-phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate; Nx, normoxia; DG, diacylglycerol; PS, phosphatidylserine; NCM, neonatal cardiac myocytes; NCP, nitrocellulose paper; CL, cardiolipin; PKC, protein kinase C; IR, ischemia/reperfusion. The F0 domain allows proton re-entry into the mitochondrial matrix down a concentration gradient to provide the energy for ATP synthesis (4Walker, J. E., and Dickson, V. K. (2006) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1757, 286–296Google Scholar). The F1 domain consists of three α, three β, and γ, δ, and ϵ subunits. The interfaces between α- and β-subunits are the site of nucleotide binding and ATP synthesis. The F1 and F0 domains are connected by a central stalk consisting of the γ, δ, and ϵ subunits and by a peripheral stalk that is made up of the OSCP, F6, b, and d subunits (5Gaballo A. Zanotti F. Papa S. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The central stalk rotates along with a ring of 10–14 “c” subunits during ATP synthesis, and the peripheral stalk acts as a stator to prevent the α- and β-subunits from rotating with the central stalk and c-subunits. This latter function is crucial for the enzyme proton pumping activity. In vivo, the electrochemical/proton gradient across the IM provides the driving force for F1F0 ATP synthase activity. Loss of this gradient first leads to inhibition of F1F0 ATP synthase activity and eventually the enzyme operates in reverse (F1F0 ATPase). This ATP hydrolysis contributes significantly to ATP loss during cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury (6Solaini G. Harris D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). There are 2 endogenous inhibitory proteins of the F1F0 ATP synthase/ATPase complex known as Inhibitor of F1 (IF1) (6Solaini G. Harris D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Green D.W. Grover G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and calcium-sensitive binding inhibitor (Ca BI) (2Harris D.A. Das A.M. Biochem.

IF1 inhibits predominantly the hydrolysis of ATP by F1F0 ATPase. Its binding to the F1 catalytic domain is favored under conditions of low pH and decreased IM potential, such as would occur in ischemia (6Solaini G. Harris D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Green D.W. Grover G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Ylitalo K.

Gaballo A. Papa S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has been proposed to be a type of “fail safe” mechanism, which limits the destruction of ATP in pathological states (6Solaini G. Harris D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 9Zanotti F. Raho G. Gaballo A. Papa S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CaBI inhibits both ATPase and ATP synthase activities and is released from the enzyme in the presence of elevated Ca2+ (2Harris D.A. Das A.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 6Solaini G. Harris D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Collectively, these are the only established mechanisms for inhibiting F1F0 synthase or ATPase activities. However, IF1- and CaBI-mediated inhibition of F1F0 activities cannot completely account for the regulation of this F1F0 enzyme complex (2Harris D.A. Das A.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Recently, mitochondrial mechanisms involving protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes in cardiac preconditioning (PC) and IR injury have received considerable attention (10Nguyen T. Ogbi M. Guo D. Johnson J.A. Curr. Enzyme Inhib. 2007; 3: 143-159Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For example, ϵPKC has been reported to activate mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channels (11Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 1997; 273: H847-H853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibit the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (12Baines C.P. Song C. Zheng Y. Wang G. Zhang J. Wang O. Guo Y. Bolli R. Cardwell E.M. Ping P. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), induce the phosphorylation of the BAD protein to inhibit apoptosis in diabetic hearts (13Malhotra A. Begley R. Kang B.P. Rana I. Liu J. Yang G. Mochly-Rosen D. Meggs L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: H1343-H1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), regulate anti-apoptotic activity through the regulation of Bcl-2 family of proteins (14Manat R. Singal T. Dhalla N.S. Tappia P.S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 291: H854-H860Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and enhance the activity of cytochrome c oxidase in PC (15Ogbi M. Johnson J.A.

Physiol. 2007; 293: H2219-H2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The role of δPKC is more controversial with reports indicating it plays significant roles in PC (17Wang Y. Hirai K. Ashraf M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 18Mayr M. Metzler B. Chung Y.L. McGregor E. Mayr U. Troy H. Hu Y. Leitges M. Pachinger O. Griffiths J.R. Dunn M.J. Xu Q. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2004; 287: H946-H956Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and IR injury (19Inagaki K. Hahn H.S. Dorn II G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Churchill E.N. Muriel C.L. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Szweda L.I. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Wang et al. (17Wang Y. Hirai K. Ashraf M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) reported diazoxide-induced PC, which correlated with δPKC translocation to mitochondria. Also, Mayr et al., (18Mayr M. Metzler B. Chung Y.L. McGregor E. Mayr U. Troy H. Hu Y. Leitges M. Pachinger O. Griffiths J.R. Dunn M.J. Xu Q. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

Physiol. 2004; 287: H937-H945Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reported that δPKC knock-out mice demonstrated decreased glycolysis and an increased lipid metabolism under baseline conditions and were unable to induce a PC response. In contrast, Mochly-Rosen and co-workers (19Inagaki K. Hahn H.S. Dorn II G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) demonstrated in rodent studies that δPKC activation induces apoptosis and also phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2, which in turn may phosphorylate and delay the reactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase following IR injury (20Churchill E.N. Muriel C.L. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Szweda L.I. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, there have been no reports demonstrating PKC isozyme-selective modulation of the F1F0 synthase/ATPase complex under normoxic or low oxygen conditions. We present here the first evidence for modulation of F1F0 ATPase by δPKC and propose that δPKC interacts with the d subunit of the F1F0 ATPase (dF1F0). We hypothesize that this putative interaction regulates F1F0 activities under normoxic conditions, as well as mediates inhibition of F1F0 ATP synthase or ATPase activities during prolonged hypoxia. Such inhibition could contribute to cardiac IR injury by delaying the recovery of aerobic ATP production. Alternatively, the δPKC-dF1F0 interaction may be cardioprotective if δPKC limits IR-induced reverse-mode F1F0 ATPase activity. Primary Neonatal Cardiac Myocytes (NCMs)—NCMs were isolated from the hearts of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (22Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C. Karliner J. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Johnson J.A. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This study was conducted in accordance with the institutional, state, and federal guidelines for the humane care and use of laboratory animals. Induction of Hypoxia in NCMs—NCMs were placed in a PlasLabs Anaerobic chamber at 37 °C, 1% CO2, < 0.5% O2, and the balance N2 as previously described (15Ogbi M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Incubations were conducted in glucose-free M199 medium (24Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Normoxic incubations were conducted in a water-jacketed incubator gassed with 1% CO2 and 99% air at 37 °C in M199 containing 5 mm glucose. Cell Lysis and Isolation of Mitochondria Using Percoll/Optiprep Density Gradients—Fifteen 100-mm dishes of NCMs were used for each treatment group. These procedures have been extensively described in previous studies (15Ogbi M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Guo D. Nguyen T. Ogbi M.

Johnson J.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Experiments—The antisera against the d subunit of the F1F0 ATPase (dF1F0) from Molecular Probes (50 μg) was coupled with Bio-Rad Affi-gel (1 ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (15Ogbi M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Guo D. Nguyen T. Ogbi M. Tawfik H.

Johnson J.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dF1F0 antisera-coupled Affi-gel was blocked for 1 h in IP buffer (13.3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1.8 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 (w/v), 0.5% SDS (w/v), 1.5 mm NaPPi, 0.005% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1.5 nm calyculin A, and 9.1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) before immunoprecipitation. Mitochondria (500 μg) from the each treatment group were solubilized in IP buffer in a total volume of 1 ml. After this step, the solubilized mitochondria were incubated with 200 μl of antibody-coupled Affi-gel overnight at 4 °C. Affi-gel immunoprecipitates were washed, and then SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to Affi-gel pellets to liberate proteins. Affi-gel was then pelleted by centrifugation, and the resulting SDS-PAGE sample buffer supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12–13.5% acrylamide) and transferred onto nitrocellulose paper (NCP) using standard Western blot techniques. The resulting blots were probed for α, δ, ϵ, and ζPKC isozymes using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (GE Healthcare). F1F0 ATPase Activity Measurements—The oligomycin-sensitive activity of F1F0 ATPase activity was measured in NCM cell lysates as previously described (26Buchanan S.K. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped and lysed by sonication in 400 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm EGTA. The F1F0 ATPase activity was then measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the disappearance of NADH, which manifests as a decline in absorbance at 340 nm as NADH is oxidized to NAD+. ATP hydrolysis is coupled to NADH loss in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system as previously described (1Di Pancrazio F. Mavelli I. Isola M. Losano G. Pagliaro P. Harris D.A. Lippe G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1659: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The final F1F0 ATPase assay buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 83 mm sucrose, 4 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm KCN, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 units of pyruvate kinase, 5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and 75 μm NADH in a 1-ml cuvette. All assay reagents were obtained from Sigma. The assay was monitored continuously for 1–5 min at 25 °C in the absence and presence of oligomycin (8 μg/ml). All assays were conducted in triplicate. F1F0 ATPase Purification for Overlay and PKC Add-back Assays—Isolation of the F1F0 ATPase holo-enzyme by chromatography was performed as previously described by Buchanan and Walker (26Buchanan S.K. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were isolated from the ventricles of 5 adult Sprague-Dawley rat hearts, then washed in phosphate buffer, and solubilized in buffer containing 20 mm ATP, 20 mm MgSO4, 0.001% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% dodecyl-β-maltoside. The solubilized mitochondria were precipitated with ammonium sulfate. The ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in buffer, dialyzed overnight, and then loaded on a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column. The F1F0 ATPase was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 m, and peak F1F0 ATPase fractions were identified by F1F0 ATPase activity. Subsequently, the presence of the α, β, and dF1F0 ATPase subunits were confirmed in peak F1F0 ATPase activity fractions by Western blot. Peak fractions were then pooled and used for overlay assays. PKC Overlay Assays—The overlay method to detect PKC-binding partners was previously described by Mochly-Rosen and co-workers (27Schechtman D. Murriel C. Bright R. Mochly-Rosen D. Meth. Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 345-350PubMed Google Scholar). Required activators and cofactors of PKC such as 1 mm calcium (Ca2+), 240 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (PS), 3.2 μg/ml diacylglycerol (DG, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), and 0–1 mm cardiolipin (CL, Sigma Aldrich) were included in the assay as indicated. Purified F1F0 holo-enzyme (50 μg) was separated by 13.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto NCP. The NCP blots were then cut into (0.3 cm × 5.5 cm) strips, washed with distilled water, and blocked with overlay blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol) for 1 h at room temperature. NCP strips were then incubated with overlay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.0% polyethylene glycol, and 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, SBTI, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) containing purified PKC (500 μg/ml) and cofactors for 1 h at room temperature. The strips were washed four times for 5 min with overlay wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol). Bound PKC was detected with PKC isozyme antisera as previously described (28Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analyses—Western blotting was carried out as described previously (22Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C. Karliner J. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Johnson J.A. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and using ECL Detection (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12–13.5% acrylamide gels and then transferred onto NCP. For two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis, the samples were separated using 13-cm pH 3–10 NL dry IPG strips (GE Healthcare) followed by SDS-PAGE 12–13.5% acrylamide gels and then transferred onto NCP. The resulting blots were probed for PKC isozymes and F1F0 subunits. PKC antisera were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories or Santa Cruz Biotechnology while F1F0 antisera were obtained from Invitrogen and were used at recommended dilution concentrations. In Vitro PKC/F1F0 ATPase Add-back Experiments—Rat brain PKC was purified as previously described (29Mochly-Rosen D. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2291-2297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant δPKC expressed in sf9 cells, was obtained from BIOSOURCE, Inc. (Camarillo, CA). F1F0 ATPase was used on the day of purification without freezing. Rat brain PKC (120 units/mg) was added to 50 μg of purified F1F0 ATPase for 5 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of DG and PS. F1F0 ATPase assays were then conducted for 1, 3, or 5 min. For heated (inactivated) PKC groups, PKC was heated at 85 °C for 10 min, placed on ice for at least 3 min, and then added to the F1F0 ATPase. All data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's posthoc analyses were used for comparison of differences between groups, and a p value ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant. δPKC Co-immunoprecipitates with the d Subunit of the F1F0 ATPase (dF1F0) following 4β-Phorbol 12-Myristate-13-acetate (4β-PMA) Treatment of NCMs—Cells were treated with either 3 nm 4β-PMA for 1 h or 100 nm 4α- and 4β-PMA for 20 min. Mitochondria were isolated, solubilized, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-dF1F0 antisera. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer of proteins onto NCP followed by probing of NCP blots with PKC isozyme-selective antisera. Following 3 nm 4β-PMA treatment δPKC (but not α, ϵ, or ζPKC) co-immunoprecipitated with dF1F0 (Fig. 1A). This co-immunoprecipitation did not occur under basal (4α-PMA) conditions. Following 100 nm 4β-PMA treatment, the δPKC-dF1F0 co-immunoprecipitation increased by 3.6 ± 1.2-fold over 3 nm 4β-PMA levels (Fig. 1). These results suggest that 4β-PMA induces a δPKC co-immunoprecipitation with dF1F0 under normoxic (Nx) conditions. 4β-PMA Treatment Inhibits F1F0 ATPase Activity in NCMs—To determine if the above δPKC-dF1F0 co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1) correlated with changes in F1F0 ATPase activity, the experiments represented in Fig. 2 were conducted. NCMs were exposed to 0, 3, or 100 nm 4β-PMA and assayed for F1F0 ATPase activity. 3 nm 4β-PMA treatment inhibited the basal oligomycin-sensitive F1F0 ATPase activity by 39.7 + 3.1%. This inhibition was increased to 72.1 ± 9.4% following a 20-min 100 nm 4β-PMA exposure (Fig. 2). These results demonstrated that the 4β-PMA-induced δPKC-dF1F0 co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1) correlated with a significant inhibition of F1F0 ATPase activity (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2PMA attenuates F1F0 ATPase activity. NCMs were treated as in Fig. 1. The oligomycin-sensitive F1F0 ATPase activity was measured spectrophotometrically using sonicated NCM lysates (“Experimental Procedures”). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. from four independent experiments, each conducted in triplicate using samples from four different myocyte preparations. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between 4α-PMA and either 3 or 100 nm 4β-PMA (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Exposure of NCMs to Hx inhibits F1F0 ATPase Activity—We next determined if limited Hx also inhibited F1F0 ATPase activity. In Fig. 3, NCMs were exposed to 4 h of Hx in an anaerobic chamber (15Ogbi M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In NCMs, 4 h of Hx causes minimal cell death. In support of this, we observed no significant release of rat cardiac troponin I (cTnI) into NCM media following control or 4-h Hx treatments (not shown). However, under the same conditions, we observed a 75.1 + 8.6% inhibition of baseline F1F0 ATPase activity. Therefore, in addition to 4β-PMA inducing F1F0 ATPase inhibition under Nx conditions, a 4-h Hx exposure also decreased F1F0 ATPase activity. δPKC Exists in NCM Mitochondria under Basal and Hx Conditions—We next determined the mitochondrial distributions of δPKC following Nx and Hx conditions to determine if δPKC translocated to or from mitochondria under conditions that inhibit F1F0 ATPase activity. Mitochondria were isolated via Percoll/Optiprep gradients (15Ogbi M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Guo D. Nguyen T. Ogbi M. Tawfik H. Ma G.

Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. The resulting blots were probed with antisera directed against α, δ, or ζPKC isozymes. We found no mitochondrial αPKC in NCMs following basal or 4 h of Hx treatment. However, δ and ζPKC isozymes were found in NCM mitochondria under Nx conditions (Fig. 4). Further, the level of mitochondrial δPKC increased by 20.7 ± 8.2% following 4 h of Hx. In contrast, 4 h of Hx decreased mitochondrial ζPKC by 84.6 ± 1.0%. Hx Induces Co-immunoprecipitation of δPKC with dF1F0 Antisera—NCMs were exposed to Nx or 4 h of Hx. Mitochondria were isolated and dF1F0 was IPed as in Fig. 1. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses using PKC isozyme selective antisera (Fig. 5). We observed no significant co-immunoprecipitation of PKC isozymes using dF1F0 antisera under Nx conditions. In contrast, δPKC (but not α, ϵ, or ζPKC) co-immunoprecipitated with dF1F0 following 4 h of Hx (Fig. 5). The Hx-induced increase in δPKC-dF1F0 co-immunoprecipitation was 92.9 ± 7.1%. Therefore, δPKC co-immunoprecipitates with dF1F0 following Hx conditions, which correlates with inhibition of F1F0 ATPase activity (Fig. 3) in NCMs. δPKC Binds to dF1F0 in Overlay Assays—Purified F1F0 ATPase holoenzyme was next, isolated from adult rat heart mitochondria by chromatography (26Buchanan S.K. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and individual F1F0 ATPase subunits were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to NCP, and subjected to the PKC overlay assay (27Schechtman D. Murriel C. Bright R. Mochly-Rosen D. Meth. Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 345-350PubMed Google Scholar). When NCP containing resolved F1F0 ATPase subunits was “overlaid” with purified rat brain PKC (mixture of PKC isozymes) (29Mochly-Rosen D. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2291-2297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the presence of the PKC-activating lipids DG and PS, we observed δPKC binding to a protein that co-migrated with dF1F0 immunoreactivity (Fig. 6). There also appeared to be δPKC binding to an unknown protein of ∼35 kDa. It is interesting to note that the γ-subunit of F1F0 ATPase is ∼35 kDa, but further study will be required to confirm the identity of the 35-kDa protein. Addition of 1 mm CaCl2 to the assay appeared to reduce the DG/PS-induced δPKC binding to dF1F0, but had minimal effects on δPKC binding to the ∼35-kDa protein (Fig. 6, lane 4). However, further study will be required to assess the role of calcium in these binding events. The δPKC-dF1F0 binding was also induced when DG/PS was replaced by 200 μm CL. Of interest, CL also induced δPKC binding to the ∼35 kDa protein to an extent similar to that induced by DG/PS (Fig. 6, lane 3 versus 5). Another interesting observation was that CL revealed the presence of at least 4 additional δPKC-binding proteins in our purified F1F0 preparations (Fig. 6A, top). This suggested that δPKC may regulate the F1F0 ATPase via multiple protein-protein interactions with additional F1F0 ATPase subunits or accessory proteins. It is interesting that these latter binding events were not observed in the absence of CL even when DG/PS was present (Fig. 6, lanes 5–7, top versus lanes 3–4, top). Further, the effects of DG/PS and CL on δPKC binding to dF1F0 were not additive (Fig. 6, lanes 3 versus 5). Collectively, these results suggested an in vitro binding interaction between δPKC and dF1F0. Combining Two-dimensional Electrophoresis and PKC Overlay Assay Techniques Confirm δPKC Binding to dF1F0—To obtain further evidence for δPKC-selective binding to dF1F0, we subjected purified F1F0 ATPase (26Buchanan S.K. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to two-dimensional electrophoresis and electrotransfer onto NCP. In Fig. 7, we probed these two-dimensional blots with antisera against the α-(panel A), β-(panel B), and d-(panel C) subunits of F1F0 ATPase. Fig. 7D is a PKC overlay assay (conducted in the presence of DG/PS and CL) and as is shown, δPKC bound only to a protein that co-migrated with dF1F0 immunoreactivity (F"

No recombinant source of Der p 3 has been described yet, and the zymogen maturation mechanism remains to be elucidated. The Der p 3 zymogen was produced in Pichia pastoris. We demonstrated that the recombinant zymogen is glycosylated at the level of its propeptide. We showed that the activation mechanism of proDer p 3 is intermolecular and is mediated by the house dust mite cysteine protease Der p 1. The primary structure of the proDer p 3 propeptide is associated with a unique zymogen activation mechanism, which is different from those described for the trypsin-like family and relies on the house dust mite papain-like protease Der p 1. This is the first report of a recombinant source of Der p 3, with the same enzymatic activity as the natural enzyme and trypsin. Glycosylation of the propeptide was found to decrease the rate of maturation. Finally, we showed that recombinant Der p 3 is inhibited by the free modified prosequence T(P1)R."
https://openalex.org/W2024625228,"With the growing cost of using animals to test the safety of new chemicals and an increasing backlog of chemicals awaiting testing, the quest for cell-based in vitro alternatives for toxicity testing is gaining momentum. With the growing cost of using animals to test the safety of new chemicals and an increasing backlog of chemicals awaiting testing, the quest for cell-based in vitro alternatives for toxicity testing is gaining momentum. When a transformation takes place in a field of science, rarely is the cause singular. Such is true in toxicology, where a constellation of regulatory, scientific, and public/social changes are coming together to spearhead a real shift in practice. Animals, principally rodents, have long been the mainstay for testing the toxicity of commercial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and other substances. Since the 1920s, animals have been used to test the safety of new chemicals (including those in cosmetics) as well as drugs and vaccines. But now a “sea change” is taking place as a high-level initiative in the US and powerful new legislation in Europe are pushing in vitro alternatives to the foreground. “Toxicology is becoming a real science,” says Alan Goldberg, director of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. “It is moving from largely an observational enterprise to a science based on biological pathways, cellular mechanisms, and the chemical understanding of molecular systems.” Such advancement has its roots in pragmatism. Officials at the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are facing an intractable problem. They have to assure the safety of at least 2000 new compounds each year—in addition to the 80,000 already in commerce. Yet, the agencies can only manage to test several hundred annually at a cost of roughly $1–2 million per compound. The issue has become more urgent with a March 2008 report by John Stephenson, director of Natural Resources and Environment with the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The report reviews the EPA's efforts to control the risks of new and existing chemicals under the outdated Toxic Substances Control Act, unchanged since 1976, and finds those efforts lacking. Among other problems, the report notes that the EPA lacks the authority to require companies to safety test their own chemicals and criticizes the animal models as often inaccurate or unable to predict ultimate toxicity in humans. For example, the gold standard of toxicology, called acute toxicity testing, is far from perfect. Typically, scientists give animals one dose of a test chemical, administered for not more than 24 hr, and then count the number that have died 14 days later; that number is recorded and plotted as the lethal dose for 50% of the animals or LD50. The idea is to identify doses that cause no adverse effects versus those that cause life-threatening toxicity. Despite the time, cost, and potential waste of such testing practices, an estimated 35% of pharmaceutical compounds tested in animals historically have failed in human clinical trials because of toxicity problems. “Rodent models are imperfect instruments, at best, and very expensive,” says chemical biologist Christopher Austin, director of the Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD. “Combined with the increasing public unease with using animals for toxicology, it was just obvious to a number of us that we should try a new way.” On the public front, that way is a new piece of legislation, “The Kid Safe Chemicals Act,” introduced on May 20 this year by US Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat, along with two other members of the US Congress. The legislation would require chemical manufacturers to provide health and safety information on everyday chemicals instead of presuming a substance is safe until proven dangerous. From a research perspective, the attempt to procure that heath and safety information happened in 2005, when the newly formed NCGC joined forces with the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NTP/National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and the EPA. The NIH had established the NCGC in 2004 to provide academic investigators with a high-throughput screening and chemical probe capacity previously available only in the pharmaceutical industry. With that capacity in mind, the NHGRI/NTP/EPA collaborators were thrilled when the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) came out with a report about the future of toxicology (http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11970). The NAS vision recognized the importance of new technologies, including high-throughput screening, in the field of toxicology and recommended the integration of so-called “toxicogenomics” into regulatory decision making. In response to the report, the NCGC-NTP-EPA triumvirate published a memorandum of understanding (http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Newsroom/CurrentNewsReleases/ntpncgcepamou121307FinalV2.pdf) in which they committed to implement the NAS vision. The EPA would provide chemicals for testing and computational expertise; the NTP would offer its knowledge of toxicology and a database of compounds; and, crucially, the NCGC would offer high-throughput cell-based screening of new chemicals. The NAS report “gave a third-party independent validation to exactly the approach our collaboration was taking,” says NCGC's Austin. Thus far, the collaboration has screened 3000 chemicals in over 50 high-throughput cell-based screening assays. In a paper published earlier this year in Environmental Health Perspectives, the group established “proof of principle.” They compared results using cells of the same type but derived from different species—for example, kidney cells from rat and human. The key finding was what cell biologists have long known: a rodent is not a mini-human. For example, in a cell viability assay based upon the enzyme luciferase, coupled to ATP quantification, researchers found that the overall activity profiles of substances tested in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells differed markedly from those in mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells. In addition, the researchers found that test chemicals often behave very differently in human cell types thought to be closely related to each other. Overall, 39 tested compounds showed significant differences depending on the species, with 34 having greater potency in rodent cells and 5 being more toxic to human cells. “This paper shows that we can generate reliable reproducible data based on high-throughput techniques,” Austin says. “It also gives you a really tantalizing view of both the promise and complexity of our approach.” Meanwhile, European scientists and regulatory agencies are facing similar pressures to update their toxicity testing guidelines. As with the situation in the US, one of the biggest incentives is cost. Animal tests in Europe consume roughly 3 billion euros per year, and it takes ∼150,000 animals to test one new chemical to current regulatory guidelines. Added to that are the 30,000 existing commercial chemicals of which 86% lack full toxicology data. European scientists have calculated that it would take 67 million animals if regulators were to treat the 30,000 high-priority substances like new chemicals, with still another 110,000 lower-priority chemicals possibly to be tested in the future. Added to the enormous cost of using animals in toxicity testing is tough European Commission (EC) legislation—the Seventh Amendment of the Cosmetics Directive (adopted in 2003)—which requires that by January 2009, no cosmetic can be sold in Europe if it or its ingredients have been tested in animals. (Substances tested before 2004 are exempt from the legislation. And some kinds of animal testing, including repeated dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity, and toxicokinetics, have until March 2013 before phase out.) “This is a marketing ban and a very powerful one,” says Goldberg. “Because it affects companies that want to sell their products in Europe, the amendment has worldwide reach.” Coupled with this is a new EC Regulation called REACh (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical substances) that became effective June 1, 2007. REACh mandates that manufacturers and importers gather information on the properties of their chemical substances and register this information in a central database run by a new European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki. Because there are an estimated 140,000 existing chemicals in Europe, the agency is now prioritizing, based on which substances are produced in the highest volumes. The top 30,000 will be evaluated for toxicity and results posted in a public database (http://echa.europa.eu/home_en.asp). Such regulatory urgency is spurring the development of alternatives to animal testing both in academic and commercial laboratories. To assist in these efforts, the European Union (EU) is now spending 25 million euros each year to fund a mixed consortia of up to 30 partners, most from academia but some from large cosmetic, chemical, and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, there are some incentives to get more small/medium enterprises involved. Once new cell-based in vitro assays are developed they are validated by the European Centre for Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) in Ispra, Italy. ECVAM compares each new in vitro assay developed with the standard animal model and makes sure that the new test is comparable or better. Similar organizations exist elsewhere, including the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) in the US and the Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (JaCVAM) in Japan. As ethical, regulatory, and proprietary interests are now intersecting, the quest for in vitro alternatives has become a “win-win situation,” says Thomas Hartung, former head of ECVAM and current head of the EC's Unit for Traceability, Risk and Vulnerability Assessment. “In the end, everybody wants to have validated alternative tests available,” he says. “Industry is coming up with procedures that we can use and they are very happily applying our assays that have been validated.” But the validation process is lengthy (2–8 years), cumbersome, and costly (∼$300,000 per test). And validation by ECVAM is not the last step. ECVAM must present its validated tests to OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development). Although not an “organization” per se, the OECD offers a discussion forum for its 30 full member countries, including the US. The OECD in 1981 passed the Mutual Acceptance of Data Act, which states that all member states must accept ultimate OECD test guidelines. Thus, a substance tested in, say, France automatically complies with the standards of Austria. The result was a streamlined efficiency in toxicity testing because different countries did not have to perform duplicate testing in order to market products throughout Europe. But the law also caused a major setback because test guidelines decided 30 years ago have become “frozen in time,” says Hartung. That's because all OECD countries must agree to any change. For example, the controversial Draize Test developed in 1944—in which a test substance is applied to the eye or skin of an animal (usually an albino rabbit) and the level of irritation monitored—is still performed today, albeit with some modifications and on reduced numbers of animals. Given such constraints, ECVAM thus far has validated and approved at the OECD level only three in vitro cell-based assays (for skin corrosion and phototoxicity) that fully replace animals for testing. In the skin corrosion in vitro assay, scientists apply the test chemical to an “epidermis” in culture reconstructed from multiple layers of human keratinocytes under a functional layer of corneal cells. Next, researchers test cell viability at specified exposures to the chemical with the dye MTT. In another validated test, researchers create discs of rat skin and apply a test substance to the inner epithelium. Researchers then measure potential corrosiveness based on the skin's resistance to an electrical current passed across the disc; they test penetration of the chemical based on movement of the dye sulforhodamine. Finally, scientists can measure phototoxicity with a test called 3T3 NRU PT, in which researchers expose a mouse fibroblast cell line to the chemical and compare cytotoxicity (as measured by the cell's ability to take up a vital dye called neutral red) with and without exposure to UVA under carefully defined conditions. Other cell-based assays have been accepted or are under discussion to either fully replace animals or reduce the number used. As these new in vitro tests feed into the alternative cell-based assay pipeline, they reveal a healthy growth in the basic science of toxicology. Researchers are successfully creating sophisticated tissue, cellular, and high-throughput assays, as well as computer modeling to measure and predict the effects of various substances on overall physiology. For example, researchers have been able to create and commercialize artificial human skin equivalents derived from cultured human cells. Researchers at MatTek in Ashland, MA have created models such as tracheal/bronchial epithelium and four types of vaginal tissues derived from human epithelial and dendritic cells. Scientists at SkinEthic in Nice, France have created their EpiSkin model by culturing adult human keratinocytes (from plastic surgery donors) on a collagen base under conditions that allow the terminal differentiation of cells and the reconstruction of a functional epidermis. Finally, investigators at Phenion in Duesseldorf, Germany have developed a full thickness skin model based on biopsy material from healthy human donors. Researchers culture the mix of epidermal and dermal cells in a stable matrix that does not contract under physiological forces in order to cultivate a structure similar to the dermis and then overlay keratinocytes to form the epidermis. According to Klaus Schroeder, head of development at Phenion, there is an enormous demand for these new cell-based assays. For example, scientists currently use two primary in vitro assays to screen cosmetic ingredients: cultures of mammalian epidermal cells and a bacterial mutagenesis assay called the Ames test. Both produce a high number of false positives, says Schroeder. A positive result means the ingredient immediately has to be tested in whole animals. “There is a link missing between simple cell culture and the whole animal,” says Schroeder. “This link could be an artificial skin equivalent.” Representatives from the cosmetic industry agree. They are faced with an enormous dilemma. How can they meet the 2009 and 2013 deadlines for EC legislation while currently lacking the requisite in vitro alternatives? The answer is to band together. Cosmetic, toiletry, and perfume companies are now working through Colipa, a European Trade Association, to help ECVAM speed the validation of new in vitro tests. New assays are being developed everywhere—from academia, to start-up biotech companies, to in-house research laboratories at cosmetic giants such as tissue engineering facilities built by L'Oreal in Lyon and Nice, France as well as in China. In 2006, a subsidiary of L'Oreal called EpiSkin acquired SkinEthic. In April 2007, ECVAM announced the validation of the SkinEthic epidermis-on-collagen assay as a full replacement method for chemical testing in animals. In addition, L'Oreal has partnered with an information technology start-up called Solidus in Troy, NJ. The partnership will explore using computer algorithms in conjunction with cell assays to both manage the information load of high-throughput technologies and also simulate the toxicology dynamics of a whole animal in silico. Beyond building tissue engineering resources and partnering with biotech, perhaps the most striking shift in industry is the collaboration between the major players themselves, including L'Oreal, Proctor & Gamble, and Estee Lauder. The companies are actually putting much of their toxicology tests and data on the table. “It is not a kind of race,” says Patricia Pineau, Scientific Communication Director, L'Oreal Research in Paris. “While the lack of competition seems bizarre for industry, we are really sharing.” The reason is that what the industry is swapping is not information about their products but rather information about the testing of their products. What cosmetic company wants to spend money developing toxicology tests when the budget could be spent on new product innovation? Despite this push, however, the regulatory framework remains conservative. “We are still doing the same toxicology animal experiments from 40 years ago,” Hartung says. “There is a tremendous disconnect between the basic science and the regulation. There is no other area in science where this has happened so dramatically.” Still, toxicology is shifting from an observational enterprise (how many animals died or developed tumors) to a more predictive science (what fingerprint of cellular responses can tell us that this substance likely causes kidney failure in a human). That is exactly what the British scientists W.M.S. Russell and R.L. Burch sought when they developed their “3 R's rule” (reducing, refining, and replacing) for chemical testing in animals nearly half a century ago. Although in vitro cell-based alternatives can reduce the number of animals being tested, can help to refine the methodologies used, and ultimately will replace animal models, what remains to be seen is not whether this will happen—but how. Clearly researchers working on the basic science of toxicology can anticipate big changes for their field, with those adept in veterinary science joining others with expertise in cell culture, robotics, and bioinformatics. “Basic researchers should think about the processes that they study from a toxicological—not a beneficial—perspective,” says Austin. “Think about what perturbs a process in the cell and how that could be adapted for a high-throughput screen. And then, when you've got it, call me.”"
https://openalex.org/W2048307858,"The role of protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTPalpha) in mast cell function was investigated in tissues and cells from PTPalpha-deficient mice. Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) lacking PTPalpha exhibit defective stem cell factor (SCF)-dependent polarization and migration. Investigation of the molecular basis for this reveals that SCF/c-Kit-stimulated activation of the Fyn tyrosine kinase is impaired in PTPalpha(-/-) BMMCs, with a consequent inhibition of site-specific c-Kit phosphorylation at tyrosines 567/569 and 719. Although c-Kit-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt is unaffected, profound defects occur in the activation of downstream signaling proteins, including mitogen-activated protein kinases and Rho GTPases. Phosphorylation and interaction of Fyn effectors Gab2 and Shp2, which are linked to Rac/JNK activation in mast cells, are impaired in PTPalpha(-/-) BMMCs. Thus, PTPalpha is required for SCF-induced c-Kit and Fyn activation, and in this way regulates a Fyn-based c-Kit signaling axis (Fyn/Gab2/Shp2/Vav/PAK/Rac/JNK) that mediates mast cell migration. These defective signaling events may underlie the altered tissue-resident mast cell populations found in PTPalpha(-/-) mice."
https://openalex.org/W2068715268,"Topoisomerase II (Top2) is the primary target for active anti-cancer agents. We developed an efficient approach for identifying hypersensitive Top2 mutants and isolated a panel of mutants in yeast Top2 conferring hypersensitivity to the intercalator N-[4-(9-acridinylamino)-3-methoxyphenyl]methanesulphonanilide (mAMSA). Some mutants conferred hypersensitivity to etoposide as well as mAMSA, whereas other mutants exhibited hypersensitivity only to mAMSA. Two mutants in Top2, changing Pro(473) to Leu and Gly(737) to Val, conferred extraordinary hypersensitivity to mAMSA and were chosen for further characterization. The mutant proteins were purified, and their biochemical activities were assessed. Both mutants encode enzymes that are hypersensitive to inhibition by mAMSA and other intercalating agents and exhibited elevated levels of mAMSA-induced Top2:DNA covalent complexes. While Gly(737) --> Val Top2p generated elevated levels of Top2-mediated double strand breaks in vitro, the Pro(473) --> Leu mutant protein showed only a modest increase in Top2-mediated double strand breaks but much higher levels of Top2-mediated single strand breaks. In addition, the Pro(473) --> Leu mutant protein also generated high levels of mAMSA-stabilized covalent complexes in the absence of ATP. We tested the role of single strand cleavage in cell killing with alleles of Top2 that could generate single strand breaks, but not double strand breaks. Expression in yeast of a Pro(473) --> Leu mutant that could only generate single strand breaks conferred hypersensitivity to mAMSA. These results indicate that generation of single strand breaks by Top2-targeting agents can be an important component of cell killing by Top2-targeting drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2058184075,"Flash photolysis and K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were used to investigate the functional and structural effects of pH on the oxygen affinity of three homologous arthropod hemocyanins (Hcs). Flash photolysis measurements showed that the well-characterized pH dependence of oxygen affinity (Bohr effect) is attributable to changes in the oxygen binding rate constant, kon, rather than changes in koff. In parallel, coordination geometry of copper in Hc was evaluated as a function of pH by XAS. It was found that the geometry of copper in the oxygenated protein is unchanged at all pH values investigated, while significant changes were observed for the deoxygenated protein as a function of pH. The interpretation of these changes was based on previously described correlations between spectral lineshape and coordination geometry obtained for model compounds of known structure (Blackburn, N. J., Strange, R. W., Reedijk, J., Volbeda, A., Farooq, A., Karlin, K. D., and Zubieta, J. (1989) Inorg. Chem., 28, 1349-1357). A pH-dependent change in the geometry of cuprous copper in the active site of deoxyHc, from pseudotetrahedral toward trigonal was assigned from the observed intensity dependence of the 1s → 4pz transition in x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra. The structural alteration correlated well with increase in oxygen affinity at alkaline pH determined in flash photolysis experiments. These results suggest that the oxygen binding rate in deoxyHc depends on the coordination geometry of Cu(I) and suggest a structural origin for the Bohr effect in arthropod Hcs.

A pH-dependent change in the geometry of cuprous copper in the active site of deoxyHc, from pseudotetrahedral toward trigonal was assigned from the observed intensity dependence of the 1s → 4pz transition in x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra. The structural alteration correlated well with increase in oxygen affinity at alkaline pH determined in flash photolysis experiments. These results suggest that the oxygen binding rate in deoxyHc depends on the coordination geometry of Cu(I) and suggest a structural origin for the Bohr effect in arthropod Hcs. Hemocyanins (Hcs) 3The abbreviations used are: Hc, hemocyanin; XANES, x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy; CT, charge transfer; SOD, superoxide dismutase; MES, 4-morpholine-ethanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: Hc, hemocyanin; XANES, x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy; CT, charge transfer; SOD, superoxide dismutase; MES, 4-morpholine-ethanesulfonic acid. are oxygen carrier and storage proteins found in molluscs and arthropods. Significant differences are observed between mollusc and arthropod Hcs in size of the functional units and in their tertiary and quaternary structures. Specifically, arthropod Hcs are structurally homogenous oligomeric proteins with a minimal functional subunit of 75 kDa. Under physiological conditions in the presence of calcium, the subunits are typically arranged in hexamers and dodecamers. Removal of Ca2+ with EDTA at neutral pH causes dissociation of the dodecamer into hexamers, which can be dissociated into monomers at alkaline pH (1Dainese E. Di Muro P. Beltramini M. Salvato B. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The different aggregation states are related to modified oxygen binding properties (2Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar). As generally observed for respiratory proteins, a fundamental physiological property of Hc is its competence to bind oxygen with different affinity in response to allosteric effectors including hydrogen ions. Detailed structural information concerning the active site of Hcs is derived mainly from a limited set of x-ray crystallographic investigations. The active site structures of the deoxy form have been described for two arthropod Hcs, Panulirus interruptus (3Volbeda A. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 249-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and Limulus polyphemus (subunit II) (4Hazes B. Magnus C. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Dauter Z. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Protein Science. 1993; 2: 597-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, a comparison of the results is limited by the different solution conditions from which the proteins were crystallized. In both examples, each Cu(I) of the binuclear active site is coordinated by the ϵ-nitrogen of three histidine imidazole residues. In the P. interruptus structure obtained from protein crystallized at pH 4.8, two of the three histidine imidazole ligands and one copper atom lie nearly in a plane, with Cu-N bond lengths of 1.9 Å. In addition, each metal atom binds to a third histidyl imidazole nitrogen at a distance of 2.7 Å, perpendicular to the plane defined by the two equatorial histidine nitrogens and a copper atom. In contrast to this, the structure of L. polyphemus subunit II deoxyHc, obtained from crystals grown in 0.5 m chloride at pH 6.5-7.0, shows that each copper has approximately trigonal planar coordination geometry, with three histidyl imidazole nitrogens at a distance of 1.9-2.2 Å from the copper. These ligands define a plane from which the copper is displaced by 0.3 Å. An important additional difference between these two structures is the metal-metal distance, which is 3.6 Å in P. interruptus Hc (low pH and low ionic strength) and 4.6 Å for L. polyphemus Hc (physiological pH and higher ionic strength, Fig. 1). The only example of an oxy structure for an arthropod Hc is that of subunit II of the L. polyphemus protein crystallized at pH 6.2 (5Magnus K.A. Hazes E.E. Lattman A. Volbeda A. Hol W.G. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Gen. 1991; 9: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this example, the oxygen molecule is bound as a peroxide and forms a μ:η2-η2 bridge between the two Cu(II) atoms. Each copper atom is pentacoordinated in a square pyramidal geometry, where the equatorial plane is now defined by two histidyl imidazole nitrogens and the bound oxygen, while a third histidyl nitrogen is axially coordinated to copper. All three Cu-N bond lengths are 1.9 Å, and the metal-metal separation is 3.0-3.5 Å (6Magnus K.A. Hazes B. Ton-That H. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Hol W.G. Proteins. 1994; 19: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), a distance supported by EXAFS analysis for the closely related P. interruptus oxyHc (7Feiters M.C. Comments Inorg. Chem. 1990; 11: 131-174Crossref Google Scholar, 8Volbeda A. Feiters M.C. Vincent M.G. Bouwman E. Dobson B. Kalk K.H. Reedijk J. Hol W.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Oxygen binding to arthropods Hcs is very sensitive to pH, and the relevance of this Bohr effect resides in the capability of these proteins to respond to a pH variation in the medium with a variation in affinity for molecular oxygen to meet physiological needs. Although Hc has been studied extensively, detailed information concerning oxygen binding kinetics and the origins of both cooperativity and the Bohr effect are still limited (4Hazes B. Magnus C. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Dauter Z. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Protein Science. 1993; 2: 597-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 6Magnus K.A. Hazes B. Ton-That H. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Hol W.G. Proteins. 1994; 19: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A useful approach for the study of oxygen binding kinetics is flash photolysis. OxyHc is blue and its optical spectrum is characterized by CT bands about 345 nm and at about 600 nm (9Jolley Jr., R.L. Evans L.H. Makino N. Mason H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 335-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Heirwegh K. Borginon H. Lontie R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 48: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Solomon E.I. Lowery M.D. Science. 1993; 259: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). DeoxyHc is colorless. Taking advantage of these optical differences, a photolysis approach was previously used to study the binding of oxygen to Streptomyces antibioticus tyrosinase, a monomeric enzyme that like Hc contains a binuclear copper center with similar optical properties (13Hirota S. Kawahara T. Lonardi E. de Waal E. Funasaki N. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 17966-17967Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, flash photolysis was used to investigate oxygen binding to Hc allowing us to probe allosteric effects. A complementary approach to the kinetic studies is x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), which allows for the investigation of the immediate coordination geometry of Cu(I) in deoxyHc. For Cu(I), a species with limited potential for other spectroscopic studies as it lacks color and paramagnetism, coordination geometry can be deduced from copper k-edge absorbance measurements. Previous studies on Cu(I) model complexes of known structure provide the background information used to define a correlation between k-edge features and coordination geometry (14Cramer S.P. Eccles T.K. Kutzler F.W. Hodgson K.O. Mortenson L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 1287-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15Smith T.A. Penner-Hahn J.E. Berding M.A. Doniach S. Hodgson K.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 5945-5955Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Three paradigmatic arthropod Hcs that are structurally and functionally characterized were used here (2Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar). Flash photolysis was used to obtain the kinetic parameters of oxygen binding, while XAS was used to define structural features of copper centers in the active site as a function of pH. The results suggest that the O2 binding rate depends on the coordination geometry of Cu(I) in deoxyHc providing evidence for a structural origin of the Bohr effect. Sample Preparation—P. interruptus and Carcinus aestuarii Hcs were purified and stored as previously described (1Dainese E. Di Muro P. Beltramini M. Salvato B. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Magliozzo R.S. Bubacco L. McCracken J. Jiang F. Beltramini M. Salvato B. Peisach J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). L. polyphemus hemolymph was collected at the Marine Biological Laboratories, Woods Hole, MA. The clotted hemolymph was filtered through gauze and centrifuged to eliminate debris. The clear dark blue supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0. During dialysis, a small amount of precipitate was formed and was separated by low speed centrifugation. The individual subunits were purified according to a published method (17Brenowitz M. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Gianazza E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 210: 748-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Subunit II was used in this study because of its well-characterized allosteric properties (18Brenowitz M. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was verified by the electrophoretic mobility, while its aggregation state in the presence of Ca2+ was determined by analytical ultracentrifugation using Schlieren optics (18Brenowitz M. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Control oxygen binding experiments were carried out using a thin layer optical cell as previously described (19Kraus D.W. Wittemberg J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16043-16053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flash Photolysis Measurements—Purified Hc of C. aestuarii in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, was degassed on a vacuum line and then flushed with nitrogen gas. Hydroxylamine was added to the sample solution anaerobically (final concentration, 1 mm) to reduce any oxidized protein. The solution was then dialyzed under aerobic conditions against 50 mm Tris-HCl, MES, or acetate buffer at the desired pH. After dialysis, the protein concentration was adjusted to 20 μm, and a sample was placed under an atmosphere of oxygen plus nitrogen such that the partial pressure of oxygen could be varied from 5 to 100% with a mixed gas generator (MX-3S, Crown, Tokyo, Japan). The sample solution was filtered under the appropriate oxygen concentration and was transferred into the sealed quartz cell, which was filled with the same gas mixture. Photolysis of oxyHc samples was accomplished using the third harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser (Surelight I-10, Continuum, Santa Clara, pulse energy, 30 mJ; pulse width, 5 ns) for excitation. Time-resolved absorbance changes were measured at 20 °C with illumination from a Xe lamp orthogonal to the laser pulse and were recorded on a digital oscilloscope (TDS 3012B, Tektronix, Tokyo, Japan), which received voltage signals from the photomultiplier attached to a monochromator (RSP-601-03, Unisoku, Osaka, Japan). The traces were obtained as the average of 256 or 512 pulses, and least-squares exponential fits were performed for the time-resolved absorption data using Igor Pro ver. 4.0 (WaveMetrics). X-ray Edge Measurements—Highly concentrated Hc (2 mm copper concentration) used in spectroscopic experiments was prepared using a Centricon filter (Amicon) and then transferred to Lucite® sample holders designed for the x-ray measurements (20Brown J.M. Powers L. Kincaid B. Larrabee J.A. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4210-4216Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). DeoxyHc was obtained by passing a pre-humidified argon stream through an air tight, homemade chamber designed to host the loaded sample holders. Through the transparent faces (top and bottom) of the chamber, it was possible to monitor the course of deoxygenation based on the disappearance of the blue color of oxyHc. It was estimated that no more than 2-3% oxyHc remained in the apparently colorless sample by visual inspection. After deoxygenation, the sealed chamber was cooled in liquid nitrogen and the frozen sample was removed and stored at 77 K until used. All samples were placed ina25 × 2.5 × 2 mm Lucite® sample holder covered with Kapton® tape. X-ray fluorescence data were collected on beam lines X-9A and X-10C at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory, using double flat Si(111) (X-9A) and Si(220) (X-10C) crystal monochromators with fixed exit geometry. Beam harmonics were rejected using a nickel (X-9A) or rhodium- (X-10C) coated mirror positioned downstream of the monochromator. The sample temperature was maintained at ∼120 K by flowing cooled nitrogen gas through a Lucite® cryostat as described previously (1Dainese E. Di Muro P. Beltramini M. Salvato B. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). X-ray edge data having 3 eV resolution (X-9A) and 2 eV resolution (X-10C) were recorded by counting at single energy values for 3 s and incrementing the energy in 0.5 eV steps from 30 eV below the copper edge to 120 eV above the edge. Copper foil was used as an energy standard to account for any shifts in the monochromator calibration for any individual scan. Kapton® tape was mounted at a 45° angle to the incident x-ray beam to scatter x-ray photons through the copper foil. The photons were then counted with a photomultiplier tube positioned perpendicular to the x-ray beam as previously described (1Dainese E. Di Muro P. Beltramini M. Salvato B. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). X-ray flux was 1.0 × 1010 (X-9A) and 1.3 × 1010 photons sec-1 mm-2 at 100 mA beam current (X-10C). X-ray edge data were generally taken in the range of 100-225 mA. K-copper fluorescence was detected with a 13-element solid-state energy-resolving germanium detector, and incident photon scattering was rejected by a nickel filter. Reference signals (incident beam intensity, Io) were collected using a standard ion chamber. To monitor the condition of samples after x-ray exposure, optical spectra in the UV and visible regions were collected after sample dilution in buffer. Sample integrity was verified by the ratio between the absorbance at 280 nm and the charge transfer transition of oxyHc at 345 nm. No significant difference was found in this ratio collected before and after the XAS experiments. X-ray edge spectra were normalized by fitting a function to pre- and post-edge regions of the spectrum and normalizing the edge jump to 1.0 at 9060 eV. To rule out systematic errors, partial sums of the total number of scans were independently fit without any significant differences noted. Flash Photolysis of Oxygen from Oxyhemocyanin—The absorbance change after flash photolysis of C. aestuarii oxyHc was monitored at 337 nm, the absorption maximum of the oxyHc spectrum (Fig. 2). To prove that the observed optical change corresponded to oxygen photolysis and re-binding, the wavelength dependence of the initial absorbance change at several wavelengths within the absorption envelope of oxyHc was measured, and this action spectrum is depicted in the inset of Fig. 2. In the same figure, the difference absorption spectrum between oxyHc and deoxyHc is shown (Fig. 2, inset, dotted line), which was well correlated with the wavelength dependence of the initial absorption change after photolysis. The experimental conditions were designed such that 100% of the Hc was in the oxygenated form before photolysis at all oxygen concentrations tested (1Dainese E. Di Muro P. Beltramini M. Salvato B. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The fraction of deoxyHc present at the beginning of detectable oxygen re-binding was about 5% calculated on the basis of the absorbance change. The time scale of absorbance recovery was in the range of microseconds to submilliseconds. The initial absorbance decrease corresponded to dissociation of oxygen from oxyHc, whereas the complete intensity recovery indicated re-binding of oxygen with no detectable photodamage. The observed absorbance changes at 337 nm were fit successfully with single exponentials for all oxygen concentrations at pH 8.3. Although at this pH in the presence of Ca2+, C. aestuarii Hc is known to be a mixture of 90% dimer of hexamers and 10% hexamers (1Dainese E. Di Muro P. Beltramini M. Salvato B. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), there was no observable heterogeneity in the kinetic data. There was likewise no evidence for bi-phasic character that might be expected if the Hc were switching between the R- and T-state upon photolysis. The observed oxygen re-binding rate constant (kobs) increased upon increasing the pH from 6.5 to 8.7 (Fig. 3A). The kobs values at pH 8.3 and 6.5 are plotted in Fig. 3B as a function of oxygen concentration; the dependence of kobs on oxygen concentration was steeper for the measurements at pH 8.3 than that at pH 6.5. As will be discussed later, the ordinate intercept of the plots gave coincident koff values, demonstrating that only the kon values are pH-dependent. The shape of the optical spectrum of oxyHc is pH-independent, such that optical spectra at different pH values are superimposable. Therefore, our flash photolysis approach does not require any correction for pH effects on the spectrum of oxyHc. 4The kobs value also increased on the low pH side of the minimum at 6.5 (Fig. 3A) as has been noted before for an analogous arthropod Hc (23Molon A. Di Muro P. Bubacco L. Vasilyev V. Salvato, Beltramini M. Conze W. Hellmann N. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7046-7057Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is not analyzed further. The absorbance change upon photolysis of oxyHc at pH 7.1 under O2 concentrations lower than 0.35 mm could not be successfully fit with a single exponential curve (supplemental Fig. S1, depicts the case for [O2] = 0.14 mm), although single exponential fits were adequate for Hc at pH 8.3 under all oxygen concentrations studied, and at pH 7.1 under higher oxygen concentrations ([O2] > 0.49 mm). For the samples at pH 7.1 under oxygen concentrations less than 0.35 mm, double exponential curves were required to fit the data, suggesting a second process is operative under these conditions. The cooperative homohexamers of CaeSS3 subunits of Hc (1Dainese E. Di Muro P. Beltramini M. Salvato B. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), exhibited only a single phase at pH 7.5 and [O2] = 1.39 mm, with smaller kobs values than the heterohexameric native protein (CaeSS3 homohexamers, 61 ± 5 ms-1; the heterohexameric native protein 72.2 ± 3.2 ms-1). To calculate thermodynamic parameters for the oxygen re-binding reaction, we studied the temperature dependence of kobs. In the tyrosinase case (13Hirota S. Kawahara T. Lonardi E. de Waal E. Funasaki N. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 17966-17967Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the initial intensity change in absorbance in the photolysis experiments depended on temperature such that as the temperature increased, the intensity change increased, whereas for Hc, there was no observed temperature dependence of the optical features. These observations suggest that the structure of Hc at the active site is more rigid than that of tyrosinase (13Hirota S. Kawahara T. Lonardi E. de Waal E. Funasaki N. Canters G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 17966-17967Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and that the increase in the oxygen-binding rate constant in Hc as a function of temperature is not due to protein structural changes. A linear Eyring plot was obtained based on the temperature dependence of kon within the range 5 to 25 °C (Fig. 4). The activation enthalpy and entropy of oxygen binding to Hc calculated from the temperature dependence were as follows; ΔH‡ = 7.2 kcal/mol and ΔS‡ = -26 cal/(mol·K), respectively, based on the data in Fig. 4. These values compare reasonably well with those reported for oxygen binding to binuclear copper model complexes (21Karlin K.D. Tolman W.B. Kaderli S. Zuberbühler A.D. J. Mol. Catal. A: Chemical. 1997; 117: 215-222Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Copper K-edge Spectra of Arthropod Hemocyanin—Oxy and deoxyHc have readily distinguishable x-ray absorption spectra. For example, a comparison of the copper k-edge spectra of oxy and deoxy forms of P. interruptus Hc (Fig. 5), a very close homolog of C. aestuarii Hc, indicates a shift of 2-3 eV to higher energy expected from the increase in the 1s-electron binding energy for the metal ion in the oxy protein because of its cupric character (14Cramer S.P. Eccles T.K. Kutzler F.W. Hodgson K.O. Mortenson L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 1287-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The difference spectrum between deoxy and oxyHc allows for an accurate determination of the peak positions in the edge spectra of the deoxy protein. The two largest absorbance difference peaks, at 8982.7 ± 0.5 and 8985.6 ± 0.5 eV, have been assigned to the 1s → 4pz and 1s → (s+p)* transitions, respectively (15Smith T.A. Penner-Hahn J.E. Berding M.A. Doniach S. Hodgson K.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 5945-5955Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In a separate study, the intensities of these transitions were correlated with the coordination geometry of Cu(I) based on a systematic analysis of x-ray edge spectra for a collection of model complexes having different coordination geometries but the same tridentate nitrogen ligands (20Brown J.M. Powers L. Kincaid B. Larrabee J.A. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4210-4216Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 22Blackburn N.J. Strange R.W. Reedijk J. Volbeda A. Farooq A. Karlin K.D. Zubieta J. Inorg. Chem. 1989; 28: 1349-1357Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Metz M. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 4938-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). More precisely, the intensity of the 8982.7 eV feature, normalized to the edge jump, was found to be inversely proportional to the mean displacement along the z-axis of Cu(I) from the plane defined by the three directly coordinated nitrogen atoms. The intensity is significantly higher for the metal ion coordinated in a trigonal planar geometry compared with that for pseudotetrahedral geometry, in which the copper atom lies out of the plane defined by the ligands (20Brown J.M. Powers L. Kincaid B. Larrabee J.A. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4210-4216Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 24Metz M. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 4938-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 8982.7 eV feature can serve as a spectroscopic probe of coordination geometry in Cu(I) sites with all nitrogen coordination as in deoxyHc and was used here to define the structural modifications induced by changes in pH. The k-edge spectra for P. interruptus deoxyHc at different pH values are collected in Fig. 6. The oxygen affinity of this Hc increases ∼35-fold from pH 5 to 9 (Table 1) (25Kuiper H.A. Coletta M. Zolla L. Chiancone E. Brunori M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 626: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 26Kuiper H.A. Gastra W. Beintema J.J. van Bruggen E.F. Schepman A.M. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). At pH 5.25, the intensity of the 8982.7 eV feature is low (Fig. 6a). As the pH is raised to 7, and finally to 9, the intensity increases (Fig. 6, b and c). This spectroscopic change is indicative of the alteration of Cu(I) geometry from pseudotetrahedral toward trigonal (22Blackburn N.J. Strange R.W. Reedijk J. Volbeda A. Farooq A. Karlin K.D. Zubieta J. Inorg. Chem. 1989; 28: 1349-1357Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The spectral changes observed are not due to oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) because the lineshape of the x-ray absorption edge spectra collected at different pH values overlay in the 9000 eV region, with no indication of an energy shift expected if Cu(I) were oxidized to Cu(II). A smaller increase in the intensity of the 8982.7 eV feature with increasing pH was noted for subunit II of L. polyphemus Hc (Fig. 7) compared with the data described for P. interruptus Hc. This protein also has a Bohr effect (18Brenowitz M. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the structural modulation induced by pH is considered here to be analogous to that described for P. interruptus Hc, indicating the general nature of the observations and also establishing a correlation between the magnitude of the Bohr effect and the observed intensity changes for two different Hcs. C. aestuarii, P. interruptus, and L. polyphemus Hcs are highly homologous and show the same trend in the pH dependence of oxygen binding.TABLE 1Values of P50 for oxygen binding to Hcs as a function of pH in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2pHP50 O2 mmHgP. interruptus5.25172aIn 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 5.25 (30).742bIn 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7 and in 50 mm ethanolamine, pH 9 (31).95bIn 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7 and in 50 mm ethanolamine, pH 9 (31).C. aestuarii7.144.3cIn 50 mm Tris-HCl (1).7.533.7cIn 50 mm Tris-HCl (1).7.913.6cIn 50 mm Tris-HCl (1).8.36.81cIn 50 mm Tris-HCl (1).Subunit II L. polyphemus72.5dIn 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7 and 9 (23).91.4dIn 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7 and 9 (23).a In 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 5.25 (30Brouwer M.

https://openalex.org/W2152381733,"Chromosome segregation during cell division depends on the highly ordered bipolar microtubule structure known as the mitotic spindle. Organization of microtubules into this highly ordered structure relies on both motor and nonmotor proteins. Nonmotor spindle proteins fulfill diverse roles including nucleation and organization of microtubules, regulation of spindle shape and size, regulation of motor activity and microtubule dynamics, as well as control of chromosome segregation and cell-cycle progression. Many nonmotor spindle proteins display distinct localization patterns in mitosis, and several contribute to more than one functional activity within the spindle. Given this complexity, it is not surprising that nonmotor proteins frequently show altered expression patterns in cancer or mutations in human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2054154008,"We previously demonstrated that a portion, or perhaps all, of the residues between 931 and 1000 of apolipoprotein (apo) B100 are required for the initiation of apoB-containing particle assembly. Based on our structural model of the first 1000 residues of apoB (designated as apoB:1000), we hypothesized that this domain folds into a three-sided lipovitellin-like “lipid pocket” via a hairpin-bridge mechanism. We proposed that salt bridges are formed between four tandem charged residues 717–720 in the turn of the hairpin bridge and four tandem complementary residues 997–1000 located at the C-terminal end of the model. To identify the specific motif within residues 931 and 1000 that is critical for apoB particle assembly, apoB:956 and apoB:986 were produced. To test the hairpin-bridge hypothesis, the following mutations were made: 1) residues 997–1000 deletion (apoB:996), 2) residues 717–720 deletion (apoB:1000Δ717–720), and 3) substitution of charged residues 997–1000 with alanines (apoB:996 + 4Ala). Characterization of particles secreted by stable transformants of McA-RH7777 cells demonstrated the following. 1) ApoB:956 did not form stable particles and was secreted as large lipid-rich aggregates. 2) ApoB:986 formed both a lipidated particle that was denser than HDL3 and large lipid-rich aggregates. 3) Compared with wild-type apoB:1000, apoB:1000Δ717–720 displayed the following: (i) significantly diminished capacity to form intact lipidated particles and (ii) increased propensity to form large lipid-rich aggregates. 4) In striking contrast to wild-type apoB:1000, (i) apoB:996 and apoB:996 + 4Ala were highly susceptible to intracellular degradation, (ii) only a small proportion of the secreted proteins formed stable HDL3-like lipoproteins, and (iii) a majority of the secreted proteins formed large lipid-rich aggregates. We conclude that the first 1000 amino acid residues of human apoB100 are required for the initiation of nascent apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly, and residues 717–720 and 997–1000 play key roles in this process, perhaps via a hairpin-bridge mechanism.

ApoB100 is synthesized primarily in mammalian liver; it is an essential structural component for the formation and secretion of very low density lipoproteins and serves as a ligand for receptor-mediated uptake of low density lipoproteins by a variety of cells (4Schumaker V.N.

ApoB is highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and thus remains with the lipoprotein particle throughout its metabolism (7Kane J.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because of the size and insoluble nature of apoB, it has been difficult to confirm the structural motifs responsible for the lipid-associating properties of this nonexchangeable apolipoprotein.Early studies using calorimetry and x-ray diffraction (8Deckelbaum R.J.

The β domains contain multiple amphipathic β-strands, and the α domains contain multiple α-helices (20Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv.

A recent study on the structure of solubilized human apoB100 (22Johs A. Hammel M. Waldner I. May R.P. Laggner P. Prassl R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19732-19739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) is consistent with the proposed pentapartite model for apoB100 (19Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The βα1 domain is the N-terminal 1000 amino acid residues of the mature apoB100 without the signal peptide and is referred to as apoB:1000 throughout.Sequence analyses and intron/exon boundary identification of apoB indicated that the N-terminal βα1 domain of apoB is homologous to the lipovitellins (23Baker M.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 1057-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Shoulders C.C. Narcisi T.M. Read J. Chester A. Brett D.J. Scott J. Anderson T.A. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 285-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Lipovitellins are major lipid transport proteins of egg-laying species, transporting lipids from the liver to the oocytes. The crystal structure of silver lamprey lipovitellin (LV) has been determined at 2.8 Å resolution and reveals a β-barrel structure (βC-region) on the apex of a triangular-shaped cavity (25Raag R. Appelt K. Xuong N.H. Banaszak L. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 553-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Sharrock W.J. Rosenwasser T.A. Gould J. Knott J. Hussey D. Gordon J.I. Banaszak L. J.

Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 895-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The cavity is bounded by three β-sheets (βA, βB, and βD) that are proposed to accommodate lipids within the cavity or lipid pocket. Based on the homology between LV and the βα1 domain of apoB100, we proposed (28Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1346-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that this domain might be a lipid-binding pocket for apoB (28Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apoB “lipid pocket” model (Fig. 1B) is based upon the highly significant sequence homology/similarity/identity (20.1% identity and 39.6% similarity) between the βα1 domain of apoB and the N-terminal region of lipovitellin (30Richardson P.E. Manchekar M. Dashti N. Jones M.K. Beigneux A. Young S.G. Harvey S.C. Segrest J.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2789-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Any z-score (probability) <0.1 is strong evidence of homology, and all homologous proteins share regions of similar tertiary structure. Because human apoB has a z-score of 8.6 × 10-10 when compared with lamprey LV (28Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is almost certain that both proteins share major structural similarities within these homologous regions. Because the homology of apoB did not extend to the βD-sheet of LV, it was originally suggested on the basis of the presence of a pronounced cluster of amphipathic β-strands identified by the program LOCATE that microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) might function as the surrogate βD domain, closing the base of the lipid pocket (29Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1346-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MTP has been proposed to act as a lipid transfer protein and is required for the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins (31Gordon D.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the initiation of particle assembly was proposed to occur when the βα1 domain folds into a three-sided LV-like lipid-binding cavity (29Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1346-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Subsequent experimentally derived results (32Manchekar M. Richardson P.E. Forte T.M. Datta G. Segrest J.P. Dashti N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39757-39766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) demonstrated the following. (i) A portion, or perhaps all, of the amino acid residues between 931 and 1000 of apoB100 are necessary for the formation of a stable, lipid-containing nascent particle. (ii) The lipid pocket created by the first 1000 residues of apoB100 is PL-rich and has a maximum capacity on the order of 50 molecules of PL, 11 molecules of TAG, and 7 molecules of cholesteryl ester for a surface to core ratio of ∼ 3:1, a number similar to that observed for LV lipid pocket (27Anderson T.A. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 895-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These studies (32Manchekar M. Richardson P.E. Forte T.M. Datta G. Segrest J.P. Dashti N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39757-39766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) also failed to show any measurable MTP in isolated apoB: 1000-containing particles and indicated that the first 1000 amino acid residues of apoB100 are competent to complete the lipid pocket without a structural requirement for MTP. Further support for the above results was provided by a structural model of apoB:1000 (30Richardson P.E. Manchekar M. Dashti N. Jones M.K. Beigneux A. Young S.G. Harvey S.C. Segrest J.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2789-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The overall topology of the model (Fig. 1B) showed three unique structural domains in the first 1000 residues, i.e. β-barrel, α-helical bundle, and two β-sheets. Analysis of the model suggested a tandem series of four charged residues (Arg997, Glu998, Asp999, and Arg1000) located at the C-terminal end of the model form a portion of the base of the βB-sheet (30Richardson P.E.

On further analysis of the apoB:1000 sequence, a complementary tandem series of four charges (Glu720, His719, Lys718, and Asp717) was found in the unmodeled loop region (residues 670–745) located in the middle of the βA-sheet (30Richardson P.E.

When these regions are modeled, four salt bridges can be formed from Arg997–Glu720, Glu998–His719, Asp999–Lys718, and Arg1000–Asp717 (Fig. 1B). We proposed that the salt bridges serve as a template to guide closure of the third side of the asymmetric pyramidal lipid pocket by the creation of a hairpin bridge that completes the nascent step of lipoprotein particle assembly (30Richardson P.E. Manchekar M. Dashti N. Jones M.K. Beigneux A. Young S.G. Harvey S.C. Segrest J.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2789-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The above studies raised two new questions. (i) What amino acid residues between 931 and 1000 of apoB100 are critical for the formation of a stable, lipid-containing nascent lipoprotein particle? (ii) Are the putative complementary salt bridges, formed between charged amino acid residues 717–720 and 997–1000, involved in the formation of a stable, lipid-containing lipoprotein particle? To address these questions, we truncated apoB between residues 1000 and 931 to produce apoB: 956, apoB:986, and apoB:996. Characterization of particles secreted by stable transformants of rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells demonstrated the following. (i) All of the amino acid residues between 931 and 1000 of apoB100 are necessary for the initiation of apoB-containing particle assembly and formation of stable HDL3-like lipoproteins, and (ii) amino acid residues 997–1000 may be important in this process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Horse serum, antibiotic-antimycotic, and Tris-glycine gels were obtained from Invitrogen.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—To test the hairpin-bridge hypothesis further, we made the following two mutants in addition to apoB:996: 1) apoB:1000 with charged amino acid residues 717–720 deletion (designated as apoB:1000Δ717–720) and 2) apoB:1000 with alanine substitution for charged amino acid residues 997–1000 (designated as apoB:1000 R997A, E998A, D999A, R1000A); for simplicity, we will refer to this mutant as apoB:996 + 4Ala. Amino acid additions and deletions were introduced by Quick Change® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, catalogue number 200516) according to the manufacturer's protocol using pLNB:1000 and pLNB:996 as templates and the following primers. The primers for generation of apoB:1000Δ717–720 mutant were as follows: sense strand (5′-TCTTAGTGGACCACTTTGGCTATACCAAAGATCAGGATATGGTAAATGG-3′) and antisense strand (5′-CCATTTACCATATCCTGATCTTTGGTATAGCCAAAGTGGTCCACTAAGA-3′). The primers for generation of apoB:996 + 4Ala were as follows: sense strand (5′-CAACCTATGAGCTCCAGGCAGCAGCAGCATAGAAGGGCGAATTAGC-3′) and antisense strand (5′-GCTAATTCGCCCTTCTATGCTGCTGCTGCCTGGAGCTCATAGGTTG-3′). The entire open reading frames of apoB inserts were sequenced to confirm the occurrence of the desired mutations and the fidelity of the rest of the sequence. The apoB expression vectors, pLNCB:1000 Δ717–720 and pLNCB:996 + 4Ala with 100% correct sequence, were used to transfect McA-RH7777 cells as described previously (33Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—Rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 (referred to as McA-RH herein) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Clonal stable transformants of McA-RH cells expressing apoB:800, apoB: 931, apoB:956, apoB:986, apoB:996, apoB:1000, apoB: 1000Δ717–720, and apoB:996 + 4Ala were generated as described previously in detail (33Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in DMEM containing 20% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 0.2 mg/ml G418n and medium was changed every 48 h. All experiments were conducted with 3–4-day-old cells as described previously (33Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).De Novo Synthesis and Secretion of Truncated Forms of ApoB—Clonal stable transformants of McA-RH cells expressing apoB: 800, apoB:931, apoB:956, apoB:986, apoB:996, apoB:1000, apoB:1000Δ717–720, and apoB:996 + 4Ala were grown for 3–4 days in 6-well dishes. At the start of the experiments, maintenance media were removed, and monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and serum-, methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM was added. The incorporation of [35S]Met/Cys (50 μCi/ml of medium) into newly synthesized truncated forms of apoB was determined after 3.5 h or overnight incubation, as indicated in each experiment. After the indicated incubation time, the 35S-labeled conditioned medium was collected, and preservative mixture at a final concentration of 500 units/ml penicillin-G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 1.3 mg/ml ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 1 mg/ml EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to prevent oxidative and proteolytic damage. The medium was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove broken cells and debris. Cell monolayer was washed with cold PBS, and lysis buffer containing preservative mixture described above plus leupeptin (50 μg/ml), pepstatin A (50 μg/ml), and aprotinin (100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml) were added, and cells were processed as described previously (33Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled apoB in the conditioned medium and cell lysate was isolated by immunoprecipitation as described below.Pulse-Chase Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown in 35-mm dishes for 4 days under conditions described above. At the start of each experiment, maintenance medium was removed, and cells were preincubated with serum- and methionine/cysteine-free DMEM for 1 h. Cells were then pulsed for 10 min in fresh preincubation medium containing [35S]Met/Cys (100 μCi/ml). Chase was initiated by removing the pulse medium followed by washing the cell monolayer twice with cold PBS and incubation in serum-free DMEM containing 10 mm unlabeled methionine and cysteine. At 0, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min of chase, media were collected and supplemented with preservative mixture described above. Cell monolayer was washed with cold PBS, and lysis buffer containing preservatives was added as above, and cell lysate and medium were processed as described above.In experiments designed to determine the role of proteasomal pathway in the intracellular degradation of truncated forms of apoB, lactacystin, ALLN, and brefeldin A were dissolved in water, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and ethanol, respectively. Final concentrations of Me2SO and ethanol in all control and experimental dishes were 1 and 0.1%, respectively. Aliquots of medium and cell lysate were immunoprecipitated using monospecific polyclonal antibody to human apoB100 coupled to protein G-Sepharose CL-4B as described previously (32Manchekar M.

After electrophoresis, the gels were analyzed by autoradiography or immunoblotting as described below and in the figure legends. The relative intensities of the bands corresponding to truncated proteins were determined by computer-assisted image processing.Metabolic Labeling of the Lipid Component of ApoB-containing Lipoprotein Particles—Cells were grown for 4 days under culture conditions described above. At the start of experiments, maintenance medium was removed; cell monolayer was washed twice with PBS, and serum-free DMEM containing [3H]glycerol (7 μCi/ml of medium) was added. In experiments where the radiolabeled lipids associated with the particles was determined by autoradiography, cells were labeled with both [3H]glycerol and 0.4 mm [14C]oleic acid bound to 0.75% BSA to enhance the signal. After overnight (17–20 h) incubation, labeled conditioned medium was collected and processed as described above. The incorporation of [3H]glycerol into various lipid moieties of secreted apoB-containing lipoproteins was determined by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (NDGGE) of concentrated labeled conditioned medium as described below. Cell monolayer was washed with cold PBS, scraped off the plate in PBS, and sonicated for determination of protein content by the method of Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L.
