https://openalex.org/W2159953069,"Orexins (hypocretins) are a pair of neuropeptides implicated in energy homeostasis and arousal. Recent reports suggest that loss of orexin-containing neurons occurs in human patients with narcolepsy. We generated transgenic mice in which orexin-containing neurons are ablated by orexinergic-specific expression of a truncated Machado-Joseph disease gene product (ataxin-3) with an expanded polyglutamine stretch. These mice showed a phenotype strikingly similar to human narcolepsy, including behavioral arrests, premature entry into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, poorly consolidated sleep patterns, and a late-onset obesity, despite eating less than nontransgenic littermates. These results provide evidence that orexin-containing neurons play important roles in regulating vigilance states and energy homeostasis. Orexin/ataxin-3 mice provide a valuable model for studying the pathophysiology and treatment of narcolepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2149791183,Heterologous prime/boost regimens have the potential for raising high levels of immune responses. Here we report that DNA priming followed by a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (rMVA) booster controlled a highly pathogenic immunodeficiency virus challenge in a rhesus macaque model. Both the DNA and rMVA components of the vaccine expressed multiple immunodeficiency virus proteins. Two DNA inoculations at 0 and 8 weeks and a single rMVA booster at 24 weeks effectively controlled an intrarectal challenge administered 7 months after the booster. These findings provide hope that a relatively simple multiprotein DNA/MVA vaccine can help to control the acquired immune deficiency syndrome epidemic.
https://openalex.org/W2021229976,"Mice carrying a null mutation in the Period 1 (mPer1) gene were generated using embryonic stem cell technology. Homozygous mPer1 mutants display a shorter circadian period with reduced precision and stability. Mice deficient in both mPer1 and mPer2 do not express circadian rhythms. While mPER2 regulates clock gene expression at the transcriptional level, mPER1 is dispensable for the rhythmic RNA expression of mPer1 and mPer2 and may instead regulate mPER2 at a posttranscriptional level. Studies of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) reveal a complex pattern of regulation by mPER1 and mPER2, suggesting independent controls by the two proteins over some output pathways. Genes encoding key enzymes in heme biosynthesis are under circadian control and are regulated by mPER1 and mPER2. Together, our studies show that mPER1 and mPER2 have distinct and complementary roles in the mouse clock mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2107520545,"We describe the 2.6 A resolution crystal structure of RB69 DNA polymerase with primer-template DNA and dTTP, capturing the step just before primer extension. This ternary complex structure in the human DNA polymerase alpha family shows a 60 degrees rotation of the fingers domain relative to the apo-protein structure, similar to the fingers movement in pol I family polymerases. Minor groove interactions near the primer 3' terminus suggest a common fidelity mechanism for pol I and pol alpha family polymerases. The duplex product DNA orientation differs by 40 degrees between the polymerizing mode and editing mode structures. The role of the thumb in this DNA motion provides a model for editing in the pol alpha family."
https://openalex.org/W2162295519,"Procaspase-9 contains an NH2-terminal caspase-associated recruitment domain (CARD), which is essential for direct association with Apaf-1 and activation. Procaspase-1 also contains an NH2-terminal CARD domain, suggesting that its mechanism of activation, like that of procaspase-9, involves association with an Apaf-1-related molecule. Here we describe the identification of a human Apaf-1-related protein, named Ipaf that contains an NH2-terminal CARD domain, a central nucleotide-binding domain, and a COOH-terminal regulatory leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR). Ipaf associates directly and specifically with the CARD domain of procaspase-1 through CARD-CARD interaction. A constitutively active Ipaf lacking its COOH-terminal LRR domain can induce autocatalytic processing and activation of procaspase-1 and caspase-1-dependent apoptosis in transfected cells. Our results suggest that Ipaf is a specific and direct activator of procaspase-1 and could be involved in activation of caspase-1 in response to pro-inflammatory and apoptotic stimuli.

Among these proteins, CED-3 is the apoptotic initiator caspase, which is activated by binding to the adaptor protein CED-4. This activation involves mutual recognition of the respective caspase-associated recruitment domains (CARDs)1 of CED-3 and CED-4 and oligomerization of CED-4 (5Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D.

Like CED-4, Apaf-1, Nod1, and Nod2 contain one, or two in the case of Nod2, NH2-terminal CARD domains followed by a centrally located nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Apaf-1, Nod1, and Nod2 differ from CED-4 by having a long COOH-terminal regulatory domain, containing WD-40 repeats in Apaf-1 or leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in Nod1 and Nod2. Binding of cytochrome c to the WD-40 repeats of Apaf-1 leads to ATP/dATP-dependent oligomerization of Apaf-1 and subsequent recruitment, processing, and activation of caspase-9 (5Yang X. Chang H.Y.

Because humans, unlike C. elegans, contain multiple initiator caspases with CARD domains (15Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), it can be speculated that other novel CED-4/Apaf-1 family members are likely to be found in humans. In this study, we identified and characterized Ipaf (ICE-protease-activating factor), a novel human CED-4/Apaf-1 family member that associates specifically with and activates caspase-1/ICE. Ipaf can also induce apoptosis in human cells in a caspase-1-dependent manner. The nucleotide sequence encoding a CARD-containing peptide (GenBankTM accession number AL121653) with homology to the CARD of procaspase-1 was found in the NCBI public genomic data base using the TBLASTN program. The complete cDNA of this new CARD-containing protein (designated Ipaf) was isolated from a human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) cDNA library by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Ipaf-specific primers. The cDNA sequence of Ipaf was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Constructs encoding full-length Ipaf or truncated mutants were generated by PCR using modified complementary PCR adapter-primers. FLAG- and T7-epitope tagging was done by cloning the PCR generated cDNAs of the respective genes in-frame into pFLAG CMV-2 (IBI Kodak) and pcDNA3-T7 (Invitrogen) vectors, respectively. Plasmids encoding GFP fusions were constructed using pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). The Ipaf-CARD-GST construct was made by cloning residues 1–88 of Ipaf with COOH-terminal GST in pET-28a (Novagen). Procaspase-1 and RICK constructs have been described previously (12Inohara N. del Peso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Alnemri E.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. J. Biol.

Cells were cultivated either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (MCF7 cells) or DMEM/F-12 (293T cells) (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 µg·ml−1 penicillin and 100 µg·ml−1 streptomycin sulfate. MCF7 cells were grown on coverslips and then transfected with constructs encoding GFP-tagged Ipaf. 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The coverslips were mounted on a glass slide, and the fluorescence of GFP was detected by confocal microscopy using excitation wavelength of 488 nm and detection wavelength of 522 nm. Images were Kalman-averaged. 293T cells (5 × 106 cells) in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with the expression plasmids using the LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) method as per the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 µg·ml−1 leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The clarified lysates were preabsorbed on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated with anti-FLAG-M5 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 2 h, followed by protein G-Sepharose-agarose IgG beads. Immune complexes were washed extensively in the lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugate T7 antibody (Novagen). GST pull down assays were performed as described previously (17Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Talanian R.V. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 615-619PubMed Google Scholar). Total lysates from 293T cells (from 100-mm plates) transfected with 1 µg of NH2-terminally FLAG-tagged procaspase-1 in the presence of either 5 µg of RICK or different Ipaf constructs were prepared 18 h post-transfection and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. Tagged caspase-1 was detected by anti-FLAG antibody. 293T cells (0.5 × 105cells/well) in 12-well plates were transfected with 0.1 µg of LacZ reporter plasmid, 0.2 µg of the caspase-1 plasmid, and 0.4 µg of various Ipaf expression plasmids using the LipofectAMINETMmethod as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stained for β-galactosidase activity 20 h after transfection. Normal and apoptotic blue cells were counted. The percentage of apoptotic cells in each experiment was expressed as the mean percentage of stained apoptotic cells as a fraction of the total number of blue cells (n = 3). To identify novel members of the CED-4/Apaf-1 family, we searched the NCBI public data bases for genes having sequence similarity to the CARD of procaspase-1. We identified a genomic sequence in human chromosome 2 (GenBankTM accession number AL121653) that encodes a CARD-containing protein with high similarity to the CARD of procaspase-1. Based on the predicted cDNA sequence of this gene, we cloned the entire open reading frame by PCR from a human PBL library with two sets of primers corresponding to overlapping sequences of the coding region of the gene. The deduced amino acid sequence encodes a protein of 1024 residues with a predicted molecular mass of 116.1 kDa (Fig. 1A). Because of its activity, this protein was termed Ipaf forICE-protease activatingfactor (see below). A BLAST search of protein data bases indicated that Ipaf is a novel protein composed of three putative functional domains (Fig. 1 B), including an NH2-terminal CARD (residues 1–88), followed directly by a putative nucleotide binding domain (residues 163–457) and a COOH-terminal region (residues 656–1024) containing multiple leucine-rich repeats. The CARD domain of Ipaf is mostly related to the CARD domains of procaspase-1 and other caspase-1-related procaspases (Fig. 1 C). The CARD/NBD/LRR domain structure of Ipaf is similar to that of CED-4/Apaf-1/Nod1, thus establishing Ipaf as a new member of the CED4/Apaf-1/Nod1 family of proteins. RT-PCR analysis of the expression of the mRNA of Ipaf in multiple human tissues and cell lines revealed that Ipaf is highly expressed in bone marrow and to a lesser extent in lymph node, placenta, and spleen. Ipaf mRNA was also detected in the brain (Fig. 1 D). Among the different cell lines tested, Ipaf mRNA was found only in the THP-1 monocytic cell line. Subcellular localization is often important for regulating signaling molecules (18Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the intracellular location of Ipaf, a COOH-terminal GFP-tagged construct was created and transfected in MCF7 cells. Interestingly, the fusion protein exhibited a cytoplasmic filament pattern (Fig.2A) similar to the death effector filaments (DEF) formed by CRADD/RAIDD, FADD, or the death effector domain of procaspase-8 (19Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A similar construct in which the CARD domain of Ipaf has been removed showed mostly diffuse cytoplasmic subcellular localization (Fig. 2 A). The formation of DEF-like structures by the full-length Ipaf but not the CARD-truncated mutant indicates that Ipaf may dimerize or oligomerize in a CARD-mediated manner. To test if the Ipaf molecules are able to interact with each other, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding wild type or truncated FLAG-tagged Ipaf and T7-tagged Ipaf. As shown in Fig.2 B, the FLAG-tagged Ipaf was able to bind to the T7-tagged Ipaf, indicating that the Ipaf molecules can indeed associate with each other. This association was dependent on the NH2-terminal CARD as deletion of this domain prevented the CARD-truncated Ipaf mutant from interacting with the full-length Ipaf (Fig.2 B). Moreover, the epitope-tagged CARD of Ipaf was able to coimmunoprecipitate the full-length protein. This CARD-mediated interaction was also demonstrated in vitro as35S-labeled Ipaf was able to associate with an Ipaf-CARD-GST fusion protein but not the GST control (Fig.2 C). Taken together, the above results suggest that the CARD domain of Ipaf mediates its oligomerization. Because Ipaf shows significant structural homology with Nod1 and Nod2, and the latter proteins activate NF-κB (7Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J.

Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar), we tested whether Ipaf can activate NF-κB signaling using a reporter luciferase construct. Surprisingly, no NF-κB activation was detected after expression of Ipaf in 293T cells (data not shown), which indicates that Ipaf is not involved in the NF-κB pathway but could play a role in another signaling pathway. The CARD and its structurally related death effector domain have been shown to function in diverse signaling pathways that mediate apoptosis (20Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Because the CARD of Ipaf shows high similarity to the CARD of procaspase-1, we tested the ability of Ipaf to associate with procaspase-1 in 293T cells. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged Ipaf transiently expressed in 293T cells quantitatively coprecipitated procaspase-1 (Fig.3A). The interaction was mediated by the CARD motifs in the two molecules as truncated Ipaf or procaspase-1 containing only the CARD motifs could interact with each other, whereas a truncated version of Ipaf lacking its CARD (ΔCARD) could not precipitate procaspase-1 (Fig. 3 A). To rule out the possibility that other proteins were necessary for the Ipaf-procaspase-1 interaction, we analyzed the ability of the Ipaf-CARD-GST fusion protein to associate with in vitro 35S-labeled procaspase-1. In agreement with a direct interaction, 35S-labeled procaspase-1 bound to the Ipaf-CARD-GST fusion protein but not to the GST control (Fig.3 B). Of note, no significant interaction was detected between Ipaf-CARD and all other procaspases as well as the CARD-containing proteins Apaf-1 and Bcl-10 (data not shown). Combined, our results suggest that Ipaf selectively associates with procaspase-1 through a homophilic CARD-CARD interaction. This Ipaf-procaspase-1 interaction prompted us to investigate whether Ipaf might be able to promote procaspase-1 activation. Caspase-1 is synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide zymogene (procaspase-1), which is thought to be activated through oligomerization-induced autoprocessing (21Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. et al.Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar, 22Walker N.P.

Paskind M. Wong W. Kamen R. Tracey D. Allen H. Nature. 1997; 386: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Interestingly our data suggest that Ipaf is able to oligomerize (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, Ipaf possesses a COOH-terminal LRR domain, which could be functionally equivalent to the long WD-40 repeats of Apaf-1, thus regulating Ipaf activity. To determine whether Ipaf induces procaspase-1 processing, we transfected 293T cells with expression constructs encoding NH2-terminally FLAG-tagged procaspase-1 with or without constructs encoding T7-tagged full-length Ipaf or a LRR-truncated variant (Ipaf 1–661). As a positive control, we included an experiment in which procaspase-1 was cotransfected with RICK, which is known to promote procaspase-1 processing (14Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Interestingly, coexpression of the LRR-truncated Ipaf mutant, but not the full-length protein, was able to induce proteolytic activation of procaspase-1 (Fig.3 C). Moreover, Ipaf-661, but not the full-length Ipaf, was able to dramatically enhance caspase-1-induced apoptosis in 293T cells (Fig. 4A). Expression of full-length Ipaf or Ipaf 1–661 had no effect on cell viability when expressed alone in 293T cells (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that Ipaf is a very potent activator of procaspase-1 and that the COOH-terminal LRR domain of Ipaf acts as a negative regulator of Ipaf activity, as removal of this domain results in a constitutive activation of Ipaf. Of note, Ipaf 1–661 coexpression failed to increase apoptotic cell death induced by procaspase 8 or procaspase 9 (data not shown), suggesting that the enhancing activity was specific for caspase-1-mediated apoptosis. Indeed, when 293T cells were cotransfected with a constructs encoding Ipaf 1–661, wild type procaspase-1, and a procaspase-1 active site mutant (C285A), the procaspase-1 C285A mutant was able to block Ipaf 1–661/caspase-1-induced apoptosis, thus indicating that Ipaf activates specifically procaspase-1 (Fig. 4 A). To determine the minimal sequence of Ipaf that is able to promote activation of procaspase-1, we engineered mutant forms of Ipaf and tested them for their ability to activate procaspase-1. As shown in Fig. 4 A, coexpression of Ipaf mutants containing the CARD and the NBD (Ipaf 1–557, Ipaf 1–601, Ipaf 1–661), and lacking the LRR with procaspase-1, resulted in massive apoptotic cell death. Additional deletions in the NBD of Ipaf further reduced, but did not abrogate, its activity (Fig. 4 A). Indeed, coexpression of the CARD motif of Ipaf alone (Ipaf 1–88) with procaspase-1 was sufficient to induce a slight increase in apoptotic cell death by caspase-1 (Fig. 4 A). However, deletion of the CARD motif of Ipaf (Ipaf 80–1024) totally inactivated Ipaf (Fig. 4 A). In agreement with these results, only the constitutively active forms, which contain the CARD and entire NBD of Ipaf, were able to induce efficient procaspase-1 processing (Fig. 4 B). The CARD-truncated Ipaf (Ipaf 80–1024) was not able to induce processing of procaspase-1. The separate NBD (Ipaf 80–460) or LRR (Ipaf 661–1024) regions alone were inactive (data not shown). Combined, our results indicate that the CARD and NBD regions of Ipaf are both necessary and sufficient to bind and activate procaspase-1. To determine whether Ipaf-induced processing of procaspase-1 occurs by autocatalysis, we cotransfected the constitutively active Ipaf 1–557 variant with a T7-tagged procaspase-1 active site C285A mutant in 293T cells and checked if this mutant could be processed. As shown in Fig.4 C, no processing of the procaspase-1 C285A mutant could be detected in the presence of Ipaf 1–601, nor of RICK. It is therefore likely that Ipaf induces the autoactivation of procaspase-1 by promoting its oligomerization, in accord with the induced proximity model. In conclusion, this study reports the identification and the characterization of Ipaf, a new member of the CED-4/Apaf-1 family. Ipaf is able to specifically associate with procaspase-1 via homophilic CARD-CARD interaction and to promote procaspase-1 activation. Interestingly, the tissue distribution of Ipaf mRNA is very similar to that of caspase-1 (25Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M.

(2001) Cell Death Differ., in press.Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ipaf mRNA was detected in the THP-1 monocytic cell line, which is known to express high levels of procaspase-1 (25Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 26Druilhe, A., Srinivasula, S. M., Razmara, M., Ahmad, M., and Alnemri, E. S. (2001) Cell Death Differ., in press.Google Scholar). Like Apaf-1, Ipaf is composed of an NH2-terminal CARD followed by a NBD. Apaf-1 has been shown to induce autocatalytic processing of procaspase-9 following NBD-dependent self-association. Ipaf can also self-associate, suggesting that Apaf-1 and Ipaf may share a common mechanism for procaspase activation, keeping with the induced proximity model. Consistent with this hypothesis, Ipaf was unable to induce activation of an active site mutant of procaspase-1, suggesting that Ipaf-mediated activation of procaspase-1 involves autocatalytic activation of procaspase-1. Although the role of the COOH-terminal LRRs remains unclear, this domain is likely to function in a manner analogous to the Apaf-1 WD-40 domain, mediating Ipaf activation by upstream signals. Indeed, removal of the LRRs makes Ipaf constitutively active and capable of promoting procaspase-1 processing, independent of other stimuli. Removal of the WD-40 repeats of Apaf-1 has also been shown to make Apaf-1 constitutively active (10Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol.

Whereas the precise role of caspase-1 in apoptosis is still under investigation, it has been demonstrated that this protease possesses an important role in programmed cell death as caspase-1 knockout mice show a partial defect in apoptosis (28Kuida K.

Moreover, these mice are highly resistant to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock (29Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L. Salfeld J. Cell. 1995; 80: 401-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the LRR domain is known to be involved in protein-protein interactions and in bacterial LPS binding to Toll-like proteins (30Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Ipaf may therefore be an intracellular receptor for bacterial LPS and/or other bacterial products, transducing signals that lead to the activation of procaspase-1. The generation of Ipaf knockout mice will allow the determination of the precise contribution of Ipaf in the activation of caspase-1."

Organisms tightly regulate the concentration of cytosolic iron through regulation of iron uptake and storage. In the past few years the mechanisms that mediate plasma membrane iron transport in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been described in molecular detail (1Radisky D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4481-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Many of the genes required for plasma membrane transport have been cloned. Much less is known, however, about iron storage. Yeast is distinguished from most eucaryotes in not having ferritin as an iron storage molecule. In this regard yeast are more analogous to plants than vertebrates. In plants, ferritin is restricted to the chloroplasts, as opposed to the cytosol in animals. Plants and yeast are thought to store iron in the vacuole, although there is little compelling proof of that supposition. Three lines of evidence have been used to support the view that the vacuole is an iron storage organelle: 1) vacuolar mutants show increased metal sensitivity (2Szczypka M.S. Zhu Z. Silar P. Thiele D.J. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Bode H.P. Dumschat M. Garotti S. Fuhrmann G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); 2) iron can be found in vacuoles (4Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); and 3) there are transport systems capable of extracting iron from the vacuole (5Portnoy M.E. Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,6Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The increased metal sensitivity of vacuolar mutants, however, can result from increased metal uptake rather than decreased storage (7Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Uptake of extracellular fluid by endocytosis, a steady state process would lead to vacuolar iron accumulation, which could be extracted by vacuolar iron transporters. There are little data that demonstrate that iron accumulated in the cytosol can be stored in the vacuole.To determine whether S. cerevisiae store iron in the vacuole we studied vacuolar iron storage in yeast strains unable to endocytose. Our studies demonstrated that yeast do store iron in the vacuole. We further demonstrated that CCC1 is an iron/Mn2+transporter responsible for storing these two metals in the vacuole.DISCUSSIONIn S. cerevisiae, high affinity iron transport is regulated at the level of transcription by Aft1p, which activates transcription of the iron-regulon in low iron conditions (23Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Once transcribed, the activity of the high affinity iron transport system is not inhibited by high iron (24Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In high iron media the expression of Fet3p/Ftr1p slowly declines, and cells can continue to accumulate iron even though they are iron replete. The inability to reduce high affinity iron transport when exposed to high concentrations of metal distinguishes the iron transport system from transport systems for Cu2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ (1Radisky D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4481-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The activity of these transport systems is regulated by the metal, which accelerates the degradation of the transporters. Because of continued iron uptake even in the face of high iron stores, yeast must find ways of accommodating iron. That yeast can store iron is demonstrated by the observation that cells can grow for generations in the absence of exogenous iron.In this communication we presented direct biochemical data that show that iron can be stored in the vacuole. A previous concern with other studies that demonstrated vacuolar iron was the possibility that iron entered the vacuole through endocytic activity (3Bode H.P. Dumschat M. Garotti S. Fuhrmann G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 4Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Endocytosis is a constitutive process, and exposure of cells to iron-rich media would lead to the accumulation of iron in vacuoles. To determine whether iron could enter the vacuole independently of endocytosis, we took advantage of yeast strains with a deletion in the END4 gene. TheΔend4 strain, while unable to internalize, has normal vacuoles by all criteria (Fig. 1). In the absence of endocytosis, however, Δend4 cells can accumulate iron in the vacuole, which can then be mobilized for cellular growth. These observations provide compelling evidence that the vacuole can function as an iron storage organelle.Further evidence that supports the hypothesis that vacuoles can store iron is the observation that CCC1 can effect vacuolar iron accumulation. CCC1 was first identified as a suppressor of a mutant that was unable to grow in high Ca2+ (25Fu D. Beeler T. Dunn T. Yeast. 1994; 10: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mutant had a defect in the synthesis of a mannosyl-lipid. A subsequent study identified CCC1 as a suppressor of Mn2+hypersensitivity resulting from a deletion in pmr1. Analysis of the effect of CCC1 suggested that it was a transporter that mediated the accumulation of Mn2+ into a membranous compartment. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence suggested that an overexpressed hemagglutinin-tagged CCC1 was localized to the Golgi, and it was concluded that CCC1 was a Golgi Mn2+ transporter (22Lapinskas P.J. Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Overexpressed CCC1could not, however, suppress a glycosylation defect ofΔpmr1 and provide Mn2+ to Golgi enzymes.We identified CCC1 as a suppressor of a Δyfh1strain (12Chen O.S. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Δyfh1 strains can accumulate toxic levels of mitochondrial iron resulting in the selection of respiratory incompetent strains. Reduction in cytosolic iron can maintain the respiratory competence of Δyfh1 strains and permit them to grow on glycerol-ethanol even in high iron (26Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We have discovered that iron accumulates within vacuoles in cells overexpressingCCC1. Iron sequestration within vacuoles would result in a low cytosolic iron level that precludes mitochondrial iron accumulation. Overexpression of CCC1 results in increased vacuolar iron accumulation in Δend4 cells, indicating that iron can enter the vacuole independently of endocytic activity. We have localized a FLAG-tagged CCC1 to the vacuolar membrane. Thus, our data are consistent in identifying the vacuole as a site of iron storage and CCC1 as a vacuolar iron transporter. Our studies also indicate that CCC1 can lead to Mn2+accumulation in vacuoles. This result suggests that CCC1 may be a Fe2+/Mn2+ transporter consistent with the finding that most transporters that recognize Mn2+ also recognize Fe2+.While there is one high affinity cell surface iron transporter there are also a number of low affinity iron transporters (1Radisky D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4481-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). There appear to be at least two transporters that can extract iron from the vacuole (FET5/FTH1, SMF3) (5Portnoy M.E. Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 6Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, each membrane system has redundant iron transporters. We do not know if there are other transporters capable of mediating Fe2+ or Mn2+ accumulation in vacuoles. An attempt to examine this possibility by measuring vacuolar iron content in aΔend4Δccc1 deletion strain has been unfruitful as the strain grows poorly. We have also not been able to identify mammalian homologues of CCC1. There are, however, homologues in bothArabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, indicating that plants may also store iron within vacuoles.

We do not know if there are other transporters capable of mediating Fe2+ or Mn2+ accumulation in vacuoles. An attempt to examine this possibility by measuring vacuolar iron content in aΔend4Δccc1 deletion strain has been unfruitful as the strain grows poorly. We have also not been able to identify mammalian homologues of CCC1. There are, however, homologues in bothArabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, indicating that plants may also store iron within vacuoles.

In this study, we found that in isolated rat islets adenovirus-mediated overexpression of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine pathway, leads to deterioration of β-cell function, which is similar to that found in diabetes. Overexpression of GFAT or treatment with glucosamine results in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and reduction in the expression levels of several β-cell specific genes (insulin, GLUT2, and glucokinase). Additionally, the DNA binding activity of PDX-1, an important transcription factor for these three genes, was markedly reduced. These phenomena were not mimicked by the induction ofO-linked glycosylation with an inhibitor ofO-GlcNAcase, PUGNAc. It was also found that glucosamine increases hydrogen peroxide levels and that several hexosamine pathway-mediated changes were suppressed by treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. In conclusion, activation of the hexosamine pathway leads to deterioration of β-cell function through the induction of oxidative stress rather than O-linked glycosylation.

Normal β-cells can compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion or β-cell mass, but insufficient compensation leads to the onset of glucose intolerance. Once hyperglycemia becomes apparent, β-cell function deteriorates (1Weir G.C. Laybutt D.R. Kaneto H. Bonner-Weir S. Sharma A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S154-S159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

After chronic exposure to hyperglycemia, insulin gene transcription and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion are suppressed.

Glucose metabolism through the hexosamine pathway has been implicated in many of the adverse effects of chronic hyperglycemia. In the hexosamine pathway, fructose-6-phosphate is converted toN-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate by glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT).N-Acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate is then converted toN-acetylglucosamine-1,6-phosphate and to UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-GlcNAc is a substrate for O-linked glycosylation, which is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase. The O-linked glycosylation is reversed byO-GlcNAc β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase). The relationship between the hexosamine pathway and subsequent O-GlcNAc modification has been examined extensively (16Hart G.W. Annu. Rev.

There is also evidence that theO-GlcNAc modification of key transcription factors might contribute to insulin resistance (24Patti M.E. Virkamaki A. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. Yki-Jarvinen H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that O-GlcNAc transferase is highly expressed in β-cells (26Akimoto Y. Kreppel L.K. Hirano H. Hart G.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2407-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Akimoto Y. Kreppel L.K. Hirano H. Hart G.W. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), implicating potential involvement of the hexosamine pathway on β-cell function. Moreover, it was shown that streptozotocin, a diabetogenic reagent, elevates O-GlcNAc levels in islets, implying that this pathway can contribute to the destruction of β-cells (28Liu K. Paterson A.J. Chin E. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2820-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In the diabetic state potentially damaging oxidative stress is provoked in islets as well as in other cells (29Ihara Y. Toyokuni S. Uchida K. Odaka H. Tanaka T. Ikeda H. Hiai H. Seino Y. Yamada Y. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 30Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 31Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L.

Because the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase are known to be very low in islets compared with other tissues (32Tiedge M. Lortz S. Drinkgern J. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it may be that β-cells are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress. Several studies have provided evidence that oxidative stress caused by diabetes mediates the toxic effect of hyperglycemia on β-cells (33Kaneto H. Fujii J. Myint T. Miyazawa N. Islam K.N. Kawasaki Y.

PDX-1 expression and DNA binding activity are also suppressed by oxidative stress provoked by the diabetes state (34Matsuoka T. Kajimoto Y. Watada H. Kaneto H. Kishimoto M. Umayahara Y. Fujitani Y.

In this study, we show that activation of the hexosamine pathway in β-cells leads to suppression of PDX-1 DNA binding activity, of several β-cell specific genes, and of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Also, we show that these phenomena are produced by the induction of oxidative stress rather than increased O-linked glycosylation. These results suggest that activation of the hexosamine pathway may contribute to the β-cell dysfunction of diabetes by provoking oxidative stress. Islets were isolated from the pancreas of 200–250-g male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) by collagenase digestion with a method described previously (38Sutton R. Peters M. McShane P. Gray D.W.R. Morris P. Transplantation. 1986; 42: 689-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, the common bile duct was cannulated and injected with 6 ml of cold M199 medium containing 1.5 mg/ml collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The islets were then separated with Histopaque 1077 (Sigma) density gradient. The washed islets were picked individually under a dissecting microscope and cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium (11 mm glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Joslin Diabetes Center. Groups of about 500 islets were cultured for 3 days in 6-cm bacteriologic Petri dishes in 3 ml of RPMI containing either low (5 mm) or high (20 mm) glucose concentrations, prior to the studies described below. For some studies, the islets were exposed for 24 h to 5 mm glucosamine (Sigma) and 20 or 50 µm of theO-GlcNAcase inhibitor PUGNAc (39Haltiwanger R.S. Grove K. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3611-3617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) in RPMI with 11 mm glucose. A recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA encoding GFAT was prepared using the AdEasy system (40He T.-C. Zhou S. DaCosta L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). In brief, the GFAT encoding region (kindly provided by Dr. Donald A. McClain) was cloned into the HindIII-EcoRV site of a shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV. One microgram of the resultant plasmid was linearized with PmeI and cotransformed into electrocompetentEscherichia coli BJ5183 cells with 0.1 µg of adenoviral backbone plasmid, pAdEasy-1, by homologous recombination with electroporation (2, 500V, 200 Ohms). Then the resultant plasmid was retransformed into E. coli XL-Gold Ultracompetent cells (Strategene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid was linearized withPacI and then transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) into the adenovirus packaging 293 cells, which were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Ten days after transfection, cell lysate was obtained from the 293 cells. The cell lysate was added to 293 cells again, and when most of the cells were detached, cell lysate was obtained again (this process was repeated three times). Control adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) was prepared in the same manner. To determine viral titers, confluent 293 cells were infected with a 1:10,000 dilution of the final lysate containing Ad-GFAT (with GFP). After 18 h of incubation, the effective titer was determined by the following formula: 107 × the average number of GFP-positive cells/field (×100 magnification) (plaque-forming units/ml). This number was considered to be proportional to the number of infective particles in the original lysates. Isolated rat islets (∼500 islets) were infected with Ad-GFAT or Ad-GFP, using a 1-h exposure to 30 µl of the adenovirus (1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml). One hour after infection the islets were cultured in 3 ml of RPMI medium (5 or 20 mm glucose) in 6-cm bacteriologic Petri dishes. Total RNA was extracted from islets using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). After quantification by spectrophotometry, 500 ng of RNA was heated at 85 °C for 3 min and then reverse-transcribed into cDNA in a 25-µl solution containing 160 µm dNTP, 50 ng of random hexamers, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 units of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Incubations were performed for 10 min at 25 °C, 60 min at 42 °C, and 10 min at 95 °C. The final cDNA reaction products were then diluted with H2O to a concentration corresponding to 20 ng of starting RNA (20-ng RNA equivalents) per 3 µl. Primer design was optimized for multiplex PCR with EugeneTM version 2.2 (Daniben Systems, Cincinnati, OH). Polymerization reactions were performed with a Perkin-Elmer 9700 Thermocycler using a 50-µl reaction volume containing 3 µl of cDNA (20-ng RNA equivalents), 160 µm cold dNTPs, 2.5 µCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 10 pmol of appropriate oligonucleotide primers, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). The oligonucleotide primers and cycle number used for multiplex PCR were as follows: insulin: TCT TCT ACA CAC CCA TGT CCC (forward), GGT GCA GCA CTG ATC CAC (reverse), 15 cycles; glucagon: ACC TAG ACT CCC GCC GTG (forward), ATG TCT GCG CCC AAG TTC (reverse), 15 cycles; GLUT2: TGG GTT CCT TCC AGT TCG (forward), AGG CGT CTG GTG TCG TAT G (reverse), 20 cycles; glucokinase: TGA CAG AGC CAG GAT GGA G (forward), TCT TCA CGC TCC ACT GCC (reverse), 25 cycles; GFAT: GAA CAG GCA AAG ACA AGA AAG G (forward), CCA CCA TCA CAG GCA ACT C (reverse), 25 cycles. The thermal cycle profile employed a 10-min denaturing step at 94 °C (1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 55 °C, and 1 min of extension at 72 °C) followed by the number of cycles and an extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. In each step, the gene products of interest were amplified with an internal control gene (rRNA, cyclophilin, or α-tubulin) to correct for experimental variations between samples. The oligonucleotide primers were as follows: cyclophilin: AAC CCC ACC GTG TTC TTC (forward), TGC CTT CTT TCA CCT TCC C (reverse); α-tubulin: CTC GCA TCC ACT TCC CTC (forward), ATG CCC TCA CCC ACG TAC (reverse). The primers for rRNA were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The amplimers were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried, and the amount of [α-32P]dCTP incorporated in each amplimer was measured with a PhosphorImager and quantified with the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To ensure the validity of the measurement of mRNA levels by semiquantitative-radioactive multiplex PCR, control experiments were performed using normal rat islet cDNA to show that the amount of each amplimer obtained in a multiplex PCR was independent of the presence of the other primers, excluding the possibility of strong interferences between primers as we reported previously (6Jonas J.-C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Iikova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14112-14121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In brief, the number of cycles were adjusted to be in the exponential phase of the amplification of each product, and we verified that the amount of each PCR product in a multiplex reaction increases linearly with the amount of starting cDNA (5–40-ng RNA equivalents), ensuring that changes in the ratio of PCR product to control gene product truly reflect a change in mRNA abundance of that gene relative to the control gene. Whole cell extracts were obtained from uninfected islets and islets (∼500 islets) infected with Ad-GFAT or Ad-GFP. After treatment with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), supernatants were collected. Ten micrograms of cell extracts were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immun-BlotTM PVDF membrane; Bio-Rad) using transfer buffer containing 20% methanol, 25 mm Tris base, and 192 mm glycine (300mA, 2 h). After blocking at room temperature for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% nonfat dry milk, the membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl) containing a 1:1,000 dilution of monoclonal mouse anti-O-linked glucosamine antibody (RL-2 antibody; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), and washed three times in TBS buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS containing 1:1,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Bio-Rad) coupled to horseradish peroxidase, followed by three 10-min washings with TBS-T. Immunoreactive bands were made visible by incubation with lumiGLO (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak, New Haven, CT). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was determined by static incubation. Isolated rat islets (50 islets) were preincubated for 30 min with 2 ml of HEPES-balanced Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer and then incubated for 60 min in the same buffer supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and either 2.8 or 16.7 mmglucose. The insulin secreted into the medium was determined using a radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) using rat insulin as the standard. Hydrogen peroxide levels were determined using a PeroxiDetectTM kit (Sigma). In brief, samples (100 µl) containing different concentrations of glucosamine were incubated for 30 min with 1 ml of aqueous peroxide color reagent (aqueous solution containing 100 mm sorbitol and 125 µm xylenol orange) and 10 µl of ferrous ammonium sulfate reagent (25 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate in 2.5m sulfuric acid), and the hydrogen peroxide level was measured by the absorbance at 560 nm. Hydrogen peroxide levels are expressed relative to sample treated with 10 µmH2O2, with the value being arbitrarily set at 100. Nuclear extracts were obtained from uninfected islets and islets (∼500 islets) infected with Ad-GFAT and Ad-GFP. The cells were treated with 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and high salt buffer (420 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol in above buffer) was added to the pellet, followed by 1 h of incubation at 4 °C. The supernatants were used as nuclear extracts. Two micrograms of nuclear extract were incubated with 2 µg of poly(dI-dC) at 4 °C in a 20 µl of reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3% Ficoll). The binding reaction was initiated by adding 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the rat insulin gene PDX-1 binding region and surrounding sequences (ACG TCC TCT TAA GAC TCT AAT TAC CCT ACG T) was used as a binding probe. In some of the reaction mixtures, anti-PDX-1 antiserum (13Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Umayahara Y. Matsuoka T. Kaneto H. Fujitani Y. Kamada T. Kawamori R. Yamasaki Y. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was added 1 h before addition of the DNA probes. After the binding reaction, the samples were analyzed by separation on 6% polyacrylamide gel (150 V, 1 h) in 1× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris-HCl, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA), followed by autoradiography. All results are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Student's t test. To examine the possible involvement of the hexosamine pathway on pancreatic β-cell function, primary rat islets were exposed to GFAT-expressing adenovirus (Ad-GFAT) or control adenovirus (Ad-GFP) expressing GFP only. Fig.1 A shows representative islets 3 days after infection with Ad-GFAT. Islet cells except for some in the center of the islets were GFAT(GFP)-positive. Total RNA was isolated 3 days after infection, and RT-PCR was performed. As shown in Fig.1 B, infection with Ad-GFAT led to an increase in GFAT expression in the islets as compared with uninfected islets or islets infected with a control adenovirus, Ad-GFP. Also, the extent ofO-linked glycosylation was increased after exposure to Ad-GFAT; the immunoreactivity determined with RL-2 antibody identified increases of at least three proteins (∼70, 80, and 110 kDa) forO-linked N-acetylglucosamine (Fig.1 B). To examine the effects of hexosamine pathway activation on the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, static incubation was performed using the islets exposed to Ad-GFAT or after treatment with glucosamine. As shown in Fig. 1 C, glucosamine suppressed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, overexpression of GFAT decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion at 3 day of culture in 20 mm glucose but not in 5 mm glucose. In contrast, insulin secretion was not decreased after exposure to Ad-GFP (Fig. 1 C). To further evaluate the possible involvement of the hexosamine pathway on β-cell function, we studied the effects of overexpression of GFAT and glucosamine treatment on β-cell specific gene expression. Three days after the infection, total mRNA was isolated and used for multiplex RT-PCR followed by densitometry analyses. Insulin mRNA was decreased by GFAT overexpression in the presence of a high glucose concentration (20 mm), whereas no decrease was observed in the Ad-GFP-infected islets (Fig.2 A). GLUT2 and glucokinase mRNA levels were also decreased, whereas glucagon, Kir 6.2, and SUR mRNA levels were unchanged. Similarly, treatment with glucosamine also caused a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of several β-cell-specific genes (insulin, GLUT2, and glucokinase), whereas glucagon gene expression was unaffected (data not shown). To understand the molecular basis of the suppression of transcription in these three genes, we looked for changes in the DNA binding activity of PDX-1. When primary rat islets were exposed to Ad-GFAT at a high glucose concentration (20 mm), PDX-1 DNA binding was markedly decreased (Fig. 2 B). The specificity of the band in Fig. 2 B for PDX-1 was confirmed by its ablation by PDX-1 antibody but not by preimmune serum. O-Linked glycosylation is thought to be induced by activation of the hexosamine pathway. Overexpression of GFAT was found to increase O-linked glycosylation in islets (Fig.1 B). To examine the possible involvement ofO-linked glycosylation in hexosamine pathway-mediated β-cell dysfunction, we enhanced O-linked glycosylation using an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor PUGNAc, as shown in Fig.3 A. Despite these changes, insulin, GLUT2, and glucokinase mRNA levels were not affected (Fig.3 B). Moreover, PDX-1 DNA binding was not affected by PUGNAc treatment (Fig. 3 C). Thus, O-linked glycosylation alone does not seem to duplicate the suppressive effects of GFAT overexpression. Oxidative stress is known to be provoked by high glucose concentrations (29Ihara Y.

https://openalex.org/W2074450526,"Chemokines coordinate many aspects of leukocyte migration. As chemoattractants they play an important role in the innate and acquired immune response. There is good experimental evidence that N-terminal truncation by secreted or cell surface proteases is a way of modulating chemokine action. The localization of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV on cell surfaces and in biological fluids, its primary specificity, and the type of naturally occurring truncated chemokines are consistent with such a function. We determined the steady-state catalytic parameters for a relevant selection of chemokines (CCL3b, CCL5, CCL11, CCL22, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL12) previously reported to alter their chemotactic behavior due to CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV-catalyzed truncation. The results reveal a striking selectivity for stromal cell-derived factor-1α (CXCL12) and macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22). The kinetic parameters support the hypothesis that CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV contributes to the degradation of certain chemokinesin vivo. The data not only provide insight into the selectivity of the enzyme for specific chemokines, but they also contribute to the general understanding of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV secondary substrate specificity."

Previous studies show that constitutive expression of KLF4 inhibits DNA synthesis but the manner by which KLF4 exerts this effect is unclear. In the present study, we developed a system in which expression of KLF4 is controlled by a promoter that is induced upon treatment of cells containing the receptors for the insect hormone, ecdysone, with ponasterone A, an ecdysone analogue. The rate of proliferation of a stably transfected colon cancer cell line, RKO, was significantly decreased following addition of ponasterone A when compared with untreated cells.

Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Through studies involving gene knockout, all three KLFs have been shown to be important in regulating development of tissue-specific functions (9Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R.

Fuchs E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Expression of KLF4 is particularly enriched in epithelial tissues such as the intestine and skin (1Shields J.M.

In the intestinal epithelium, KLF4 is abundantly expressed in the post-mitotic, differentiated epithelial cells outside the proliferating zone of crypt cells (1Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 2Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

Dyn. 2000; 217: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, in conjunction with several other KLFs, KLF4 is highly expressed in naive, quiescent B lymphocytes and becomes rapidly down-regulated upon mitogenic activation (18Glynne R. Ghandour G. Rayner J. Mack D.H. Goodnow C.C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 216-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The in vitro pattern of expression of KLF4 mirrors its in vivoexpression. For example, KLF4 is primarily expressed in a growth-arrested state brought on by serum deprivation, contact inhibition, DNA damage, or growth-inhibitory cytokines (1Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 19Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of KLF4 is decreased in conditions associated with increased proliferation such as in neoplasm of the intestinal tract (21Dang D.T. Bachman K.E. Mahatan C.S. Dang L.H. Giardiello F.M. Yang V.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies, therefore, demonstrate a correlation between KLF4 expression and a process of growth arrest. Consistent with the notion that KLF4 may be important in regulating growth, previous studies have demonstrated that KLF4 is an inhibitor of cellular proliferation. For example, constitutive expression ofKLF4 in transfected fibroblasts or colon cancer cells resulted in the inhibition of DNA synthesis (1Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 22Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may in part be explained by the ability of KLF4 to activate the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter (19Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), a cell cycle inhibitor, and to suppress the cyclin D1 promoter (23Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Tseng C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a positive cell cycle regulator. However, the exact mechanism by which KLF4 inhibits cell proliferation is somewhat unclear, with evidence suggesting that it causes either apoptosis (20Chen Z.Y. Shie J. Tseng C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or cell cycle arrest (22Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further define the molecular mechanism by which KLF4 regulates the cell cycle, we developed a system using an inducible promoter to control the expression of KLF4. We show by two independent means that induced KLF4 expression results in an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with a concomitant decrease of those in the S phase. The results of our study therefore provide evidence that KLF4 is a cell cycle regulator and does so by creating a block in the G1/S transition phase of the cell cycle. pVgRXR, a plasmid engineered to constitutively express both the VgEcR and RXR receptor subunit, was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). VgEcR was generated by fusing the DNA-binding domain of the D. melanogaster ecdysone receptor (EcR) to a modified transactivation domain of the herpes simplex virus 1 VP16 protein (24No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 25Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). RXR (retinoid X receptor) is the mammalian homologue of USP (ultraspiracle), the natural partner to theDrosophila ecdysone receptor (26Yao T.P. Forman B.M. Jiang Z. Cherbas L. Chen J.D. McKeown M. Cherbas P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 27Yao T.P. Segraves W.A. Oro A.E. McKeown M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1992; 71: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Upon binding to ecdysone, the heterodimeric VgEcR and RXR form a functional ecdysone receptor that is required for the optimal interaction with the ecdysone receptor element (EcRE). The plasmid pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 was obtained by subcloning the full-length coding region of the KLF4 cDNA into pAdLoxEGI (28Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marban E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter was constructed from the pAdLox plasmid (29Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by substituting the ecdysone inducible promoter from pIND (Invitrogen) for the cytomegalovirus promoter and by inserting an expression cassette containing the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) (30Zhang G. Gurtu V. Kain S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), which was followed by an internal ribosome entry site (31Johns D.C. Nuss H.B. Marban E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31598-31603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). TheKLF4 cDNA was inserted between the XhoI andEcoRI sites in the multiple cloning sites following the internal ribosome entry site. Transfection was accomplished using the LipofectAMINE reagent from Life Technologies (Gaithersberg, MD). To test the co-expression of EGFP andKLF4, EcR-CHO cells, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line containing the stably integrated pVgRXR vector, were cultured on glass coverslips in 6-well dishes. Cells were transfected with pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 and treated for 24 h with 5 µm ponasterone A (Invitrogen). The coverslip was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 8 min followed by washing twice with PBS. Cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 15 min, washed twice with PBS, and incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS for 20 min. Fifty µl of a 1:100 diluted anti-KLF4 serum in PBS containing 10% FBS was added to the coverslip and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The coverslip was washed 3 times with 10% FBS in PBS followed by the addition of 100 µl of a 1:200 dilution of Cy3-labeled secondary antibody and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslip was then washed with 0.01% Tween 20 in PBS for 30 min and placed face down in 100 µl of mounting media containing 50% glycerol in PBS. Stained cells were visualized under a confocal microscope using filters designed to detect GFP and Cy3. The primary antibody was eliminated in control experiments. The EcR-RKO/pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 cell line was generated by co-transfecting pVgRXR and pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 at a molar ratio of 1:20 into the RKO human colon cancer cells. Two days following transfection, 150 µg/ml Zeocin was added to the medium to select for resistant clones. To identify clones that contained the inducible KLF4, cells were treated with 5 µm ponasterone A for 24 h. Individual clones that exhibited green fluorescence were expanded and further sorted by Star Plus (Becton Dickinson) following induction to enrich for cells stably expressing EGFP. The level of KLF4induction was tested by Northern and Western blot analyses upon hormonal treatment. EcR-RKO cells were similarly obtained as above except that transfection was performed with pVgRXR alone. Zeocin-resistant clones were selected and the degree of RXR expression measured by Western blot analysis. The recombinant adenovirus containing EGFP and KLF4 (AdEGI-KLF4) or GFP alone (AdEGI) was generated by Cre-lox recombination of purified ψ5 viral DNA (29Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 or pAdLoxEGI, respectively, as previously described (28Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marban E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant products were plaque-purified and expanded by infecting HEK293 cells for 8 h. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were freeze-thawed 3 cycles to release the viruses, which were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation to achieve a titer of ∼1010 plaque forming units/ml. EcR-RKO cells were grown to 90% confluence in 10-cm dishes and replenished with fresh media containing 2% FBS followed by the addition of 108 plaque forming units of recombinant virus per dish. Infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6–8 h, at which time the media were changed and incubation continued overnight. Cells were then treated with 5 µm ponasterone A for 24 h and then collected for further analyses. RNA was extracted from cells using the TriZol reagent (Life Technologies) following the manufacturers recommendations. Twenty µg of total RNA was resolved by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.4 mformaldehyde and transblotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization and washing were performed under high stringency conditions using radioactively labeled KLF4 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes. Western blot analyses were performed using standard procedures. Protein samples were dissolved in a loading buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), heated at 100 °C for 3 min, and loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel in running buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. At the completion of electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a membrane, which was immunoblotted with a rabbit anti-KLF4 serum (1:1,000 dilution; Ref. 1Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) or anti-RXR serum (1:1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz). Following incubation with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG; Santa Cruz), KLF4 or RXR was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EcR-RKO/pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes at a density of 2.8 × 105cells/dish. After 24 h, ponasterone A was added to a final concentration of 5 µm. Media containing ponasterone A were changed every other day. Control cells received vehicle (ethanol) only. Cell numbers were measured with a hemocytometer daily up to 8 days following seeding. MTS assays were performed based using the manufacturers recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI). EcR-RKO and EcR-RKO/pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 1.0 × 103 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and 150 µg/ml Zeocin. After 24 h, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, 150 µg/ml zeocin, and either 5 µm ponasterone A or vehicle alone. The number of cells at this time (t = day 0) and at 1, 3, and 5 days was determined using the colorimetric MTS assay. Results are depicted as absorbance at 490 nm as a function of time. DNA content was measured following staining of cells with propidium iodide. EcR-RKO/pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 cells were treated with 5 µm ponasterone A or vehicle alone for 24 h. Cells were subsequently trypsinized, washed once in cold PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol at −20 °C overnight. Fixed cells were pelleted and stained in the propidium iodide solution (50 µg/ml propidium iodide, 50 µg/ml RNase A, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm EDTA) in the dark at 4 °C for 1 h prior to flow cytometric quantification of DNA by a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Similarly, FACS analyses were conducted in EcR-RKO cells infected with recombinant AdLoxEGI-KLF4 or AdLoxEGI viruses followed by treatment with 5 µm ponasterone A or vehicle alone for 24 h. To investigate the mechanism by which KLF4 regulates the cell cycle, we first established an inducible system in whichKLF4 expression could be controlled. We generated a DNA construct called pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 that would produce a bicistronic message of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and KLF4 separated by an internal ribosomal entry site (31Johns D.C. Nuss H.B. Marban E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31598-31603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Expression ofEGFP and KLF4 was controlled by a promoter that contained a response element to a hormone-activated EcR (24No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). A CHO cell line, called EcR-CHO, that had a stably integrated dimeric ecdysone receptor and RXR (26Yao T.P. Forman B.M. Jiang Z. Cherbas L. Chen J.D. McKeown M. Cherbas P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 27Yao T.P. Segraves W.A. Oro A.E. McKeown M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1992; 71: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) derived from the plasmid pVgRXR was transiently transfected with pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 and treated with an ecdysone analogue, ponasterone A. As seen in Fig.1, GFP and KLF4 were produced in the same transfected cells (panels A and B, respectively), as evidenced by direct fluorescence visualization of the former and by immunocytochemical staining of the latter. As a control, transfected cells (Fig. 1 C) from which the primary KLF4 antibody was eliminated during staining lacked any fluorescence (Fig.1 D). These results indicate that the pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 construct was able to produce both proteins in transfected cells upon induction. We then established a cell line that contained stably integrated pVgRXR and pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 by co-transfecting a human colon cancer cell line, RKO. Clonal derivatives were selected by the antibiotic Zeocin. We chose RKO cells because of their exceedingly low level ofKLF4 mRNA, which is probably due to mutations in upstream genes that regulate KLF4 expression (32Dang, D. T., Mahatan, C. S., Dang, L. H., Agboola, I. A., and Yang, V. W. (2001) Oncogene, in press.Google Scholar). A stably transfected clone, called EcR-RKO/pAdLoxEGI-KLF4, was treated with ponasterone A or vehicle alone for 24 h and visualized with a fluorescence microscope. As shown in Fig.2 A, the addition of ponasterone A resulted in the appearance of numerous green cells in the culture (+PA), whereas, the uninduced control cells exhibited no fluorescence (−PA). The addition of ponasterone A also resulted in a significant increase in the level of the KLF4 transcripts as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). To begin investigating the effect of induced KLF4 expression on cell proliferation, we seeded EcR-RKO/pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 cells in low densities and treated them with ponasterone A or vehicle alone for up to 8 days. Cell numbers were assessed by direct daily counting (Fig.3 A) or by MTS assay every other day (Fig. 3 B). As seen, the ponasterone A-treated cells did not proliferate during the first 4 days of treatment when compared with the control cells. After 4 days of treatment, the number of induced cells did begin to increase but at a slower rate compared with the uninduced cells. As demonstrated by the Western blot analysis in Fig. 3 C, the level of KLF4 protein was low in uniduced cells (day 0) but was increased 1 day following induction and maintained at a similar level up to 6 days. These results suggest that the decreased proliferation in induced cells is a consequence of KLF4 production. To address the mechanism by which KLF4 inhibits cell proliferation, we performed FACS analyses of EcR-RKO/pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 cells treated or not with ponasterone A for 24 or 48 h. As shown in Fig.4 A, a great majority of cells exhibited green fluorescent after 24 h of ponasterone A treatment. This was accompanied by a change in the cell cycle profile as illustrated in Fig. 4 B. Specifically, the induction ofKLF4 caused a statistically significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase (Fig. 4 C). The difference in the percentage of cells in the G2 phase between treated and control groups was not significant. In addition, FACS analyses showed no evidence of apoptosis in the induced cells, which would have been manifested by a DNA content, that is less than G1 as in Fig. 4 B. The results obtained after 48 h of induction were similar to those at 24 h (results not shown). Importantly, accompanying the G1/S block associated with hormonal induction was a concomitant increase in the amount of p21WAF1/Cip1 mRNA (Fig. 4 C, inset). These results suggest that the ability of KLF4 in blocking the cell cycle is mediated by p21WAF1/Cip1. As an alternative and independent means to measure the effect of KLF4 on the cell cycle, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus, called AdEGI-KLF4, using the pAdLoxEGI-KLF4 plasmid as a shuttle vector (see “Experimental Procedures”). We also established a RKO cell line, called EcR-RKO, which had a stably integrated pVgRXR construct (Fig.5 A, lane 3). Following infection with the AdEGI-KLF4 recombinant virus, EcR-RKO cells were treated with ponasterone A or vehicle alone for 24 h and the degree of KLF4 expression assessed by Northern and Western blot analyses. As shown in Fig. 5 B, both the levels of KLF4 mRNA and protein were significantly increased in infected and induced cells when compared with infected but uninduced cells (Fig.5 B, upper and lower panel, respectively). The induced KLF4 expression was accompanied by the appearance of green fluorescence in cells treated with ponasterone A (Fig.5 C). To control for a possible effect of EGFP on the cell cycle, we also generated a recombinant adenovirus, called AdEGI that contained only EGFP. As seen in Fig. 5 D, EcR-RKO cells infected with the AdEGI virus and induced with ponasterone A also exhibited intense green fluorescence at 24 h. Importantly, FACS analysis of infected cells showed only those infected by AdEGI-KLF4 and induced with ponasterone A had a statistically significant increase in the G1 population and a statistically significant decrease in the S population when compared with the infected but uninduced cells (Fig. 5 E). There was no difference in the cell cycle profiles of AdEGI virus-infected cells between induced and uninduced conditions (Fig. 5 F). These results suggest that the alteration in cell cycle profile upon ponasterone A addition is the result of induction in KLF4 and not in EGFPexpression. KLF4 was first identified some 5 years ago as a gene whose expression is temporally associated with growth arrest (1Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). This correlation has been documented in several independent in vitro conditions (1Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 19Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S.

In vivo, the predominant expression of KLF4 in differentiated cells of several epithelial tissues also suggests that it is a growth arrest-specific gene (1Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 2Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

Dev. 1999; 81: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is particularly telling that KLF4, along with several other Krüppel-like factor-encoding genes, is highly expressed in naive, quiescent B lymphocytes and is rapidly down-regulated upon activation due to mitogenic stimulation (18Glynne R. Ghandour G. Rayner J. Mack D.H. Goodnow C.C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 216-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that KLF4 may have an inhibitory function in regulating cell proliferation. Consistent with this notion, KLF4 was shown to inhibit DNA synthesis when constitutively produced in transfected cells (1Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The present study established the mechanism by which KLF4 exerts its negative effect on cell growth. This was accomplished by the development of an inducible system for KLF4 expression. By either stable transfection or adenovirus-mediated infection of RKO cells, we demonstrated that induced expression of KLF4caused a significantly decreased rate of proliferation, which was likely due to a block in the cell cycle at the G1/S boundary. The result of our study is consistent with that from a previous one, which examined the effect of constitutive KLF4expression in a stably transfected colon cancer cell line, HT-29 (22Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also consistent with the finding that, among the genes regulated by KLF4 are p21WAF1/Cip1 and cyclin D1, two genes with key, albeit opposite, effects in controlling G1/S transition in the cell cycle (35Donjerkovic D. Scott D.W. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 36Harper J.W. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 91-107PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar). As KLF4 is an activator of transcription of p21WAF1/Cip1 (19Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and a suppressor of transcription of cyclin D1 (23Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Tseng C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a logical consequence of KLF4s activation is the impediment in the transition from G1 to S phase as observed in the present study. The physiological implication of our finding extends our previous observation that cell cycle arrest due to DNA damage is accompanied by p53-dependent activation of KLF4 expression (19Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Moreover, an activated KLF4 transcriptionally induces p21WAF1/Cip1 expression. This is further supported by the present study showing that the level of p21WAF1/Cip1 transcript is significantly increased due to the induction of KLF4(Fig. 4 C). Combining the results of these studies, it appears likely that KLF4 is an essential member of the p53 tumor suppressor network of cell cycle regulators. A recent study showed that expression of KLF4 is up-regulated by treatment of the human colon cancer cell line, HT-29, with the cytokine interferon-γ (20Chen Z.Y. Shie J. Tseng C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this system, interferon-γ induced growth arrest in HT-29 cells by causing apoptosis. Moreover, transient transfection of several colon cancer cell lines with aKLF4-expressing plasmid was shown to promote apoptosis as evidenced by DNA fragmentation (20Chen Z.Y. Shie J. Tseng C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was proposed thatKLF4 may be a downstream target gene of interferon-γ and may mediate the apoptotic effect of interferon-γ. In our system, however, we did not observe any evidence of apoptosis by FACS or DNA staining (results not shown) during the first 48 h of induction in either stably transfected or infected cells. As the same group has reported in a different study that stable expression of KLF4in HT-29 cells caused cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis (22Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is unclear at this time whether KLF4 is in fact a pro-apoptotic factor. The negative effect of KLF4 on the cell cycle progression suggests that KLF4 may play an important role in regulating the transition of cells from a proliferative to a non-proliferative state such as those observed in vitro and in vivo (1Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 2Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J.

Dev. 1999; 81: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It may also be reasonable to speculate that one of KLF4s functions in terminally differentiated epithelial cells in organs such as the gut or skin is to prevent the cells from re-entering the cell cycle. Conversely, in situations where there is increased proliferation such as that encountered in neoplasm, one may expect to see a decrease in KLF4 expression, which may in turn contribute to the tumorigenic phenotype. Indeed, expression ofKLF4 is diminished in benign intestinal adenomas when compared with the surrounding normal intestinal mucosa in both mouse and human models of a hereditary polyposis syndrome (21Dang D.T. Bachman K.E. Mahatan C.S. Dang L.H. Giardiello F.M. Yang V.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similarly, levels of KLF4 mRNA have been shown to be lower in sporadic cases of colonic adenomas and carcinomas (22Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it should be cautioned that the expression pattern of KLF4 in cancer tissues might not always be consistent with its putative role as a tumor suppressor. For example, increased expression ofKLF4 has been observed in dysplastic squamous epithelium and squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (38Foster K.W. Ren S. Louro I.D. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. McKie-Bell P. Grizzle W. Hayes M.R. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Ruppert J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 423-434PubMed Google Scholar), and in breast cancer (39Foster K.W. Frost A.R. McKie-Bell P. Lin C.Y. Engler J.A. Grizzle W.E. Ruppert J.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6488-6495PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence suggests that KLF4 may be deregulated or misexpressed in certain tumorous tissues (22Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Foster K.W. Ren S. Louro I.D. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. McKie-Bell P. Grizzle W. Hayes M.R. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Ruppert J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 423-434PubMed Google Scholar). A potential explanation for the apparent discrepancies stated above is that certain tumors may contain mutated forms of KLF4, which may exert a dominant negative effect on cell function. Previous studies indicating that KLF4 interacts with multiple regulatory proteins including Sp1 (40Zhang W. Shields J.M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17917-17925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), p53 (19Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S.

The purpose of this study was to clarify how interactions with anionic GAGs (hyaluronic acid and heparan sulfate) modify the cellular uptake and distribution of lipoplexes and polyplexes. Experiments on cellular DNA uptake and GFP reporter gene expression showed that decreased gene expression can rarely be explained by lower cellular uptake. In most cases, the cellular uptake is not changed by GAG binding to the lipoplexes or polyplexes. Reporter gene expression is decreased or blocked by heparan sulfate, but it is increased by hyaluronic acid; this suggests that intracellular factors are involved. Confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated that extracellular heparan sulfate and hyaluronic acid are taken into cells both with free and DNA-associated carriers.

The majority of gene transfer protocols utilizes viral delivery systems. Although many promising results have been achieved, the safety concerns and the difficulty of production on a large scale limit the usefulness of the recombinant viral vectors. This has prompted further development of viral vectors but also the search for efficient, nonimmunogenic, and easy-to-prepare nonviral vector systems.In nonviral gene therapy, the disease is treated with exogenously given plasmid DNA that is transcribed and translated to produce the therapeutic protein(s). However, the delivery of naked plasmid DNA to the target cells is not efficient because of the large size and multiple negative charges of the DNA molecule (1Ledley F.D. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1996; 13: 1595-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, increasing attention has focused on the development of nonviral carriers such as cationic lipids (2Felgner P.L.

These carriers complex with DNA to form condensed structures (usual mean diameter, 40–200 nm) that are termed either lipoplexes or polyplexes (8Felgner P.L. Barenholz Y. Behr J.P. Cheng S.H.

The complexes have a positively charged surface, which facilitates the delivery of DNA into the target cells due to electrostatic binding to the cell surface (7Haensler J. Szoka F.C. Bioconjug. Chem. 1993; 4: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Although numerous gene delivery vehicles work in cultured cells, they are not efficient enoughin vivo. Sometimes gene delivery by the complexes is less than it is with naked DNA (11Wolff J.A. Malone R.W. Williams P. Chong W. Ascadi G. Jani A. Felgner P.L.

The factors that control gene transfer to the cells are still poorly understood (14Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger K. Poellinger K. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). A good understanding of the mechanisms of gene delivery and identification of the limiting factors should help in the development of efficient delivery systems for DNA.In recent years, extracellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)1 have been found to be one of the main biological factors that affect gene delivery (15Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 16Mounkes L.C. Zhong W. Cipres-Palacin G. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. J. Biol.

They are the major components in the extracellular matrix of many tissues (for example, vascular walls and connective tissues), but they are also found inside the cells and on the cell surface (18Wight T.N. Heinegård V.C. Hascall V.C. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Press, New York1991: 45-78Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, GAGs have been shown to have a dual role in gene delivery. Cell membrane-associated GAGs have been shown to mediate the cellular entry of DNA complexes both in vitro (15Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) and in vivo(16Mounkes L.C. Zhong W. Cipres-Palacin G. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26164-26170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), suggesting that GAGs may act as (central) receptors for gene delivery complexes. On the other hand, the interactions between the extracellular or secreted GAGs and various complexes decrease the gene transfer depending on the structures and charge densities of the carriers and GAGs (15Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that the GAG-mediated inhibition of transgene expression is rarely associated with DNA release or relaxation of the complexes by GAGs (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This indicates that other mechanisms of GAG-mediated inhibition must exist.In this study, we show that the inhibitory effects of GAGs on gene transfer cannot be explained, in most cases, by the decreased cellular uptake of the complexes. Furthermore, GAGs may bind to the cationic carrier or to the surface of positively charged complexes, and in some cases, GAG may eventually replace DNA in the complex resulting in the uptake of GAG into the cells instead of DNA. Finally, by confocal microscopy we found that extracellular GAGs are taken into cells by the cationic carriers and the cationic complexes and that they may alter the intracellular behavior of the complexes.DISCUSSIONNegatively charged extracellular glycosaminoglycans are one of the major biological barriers for gene transfer mediated by both cationic lipids and polymers (15Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to understand why GAGs, especially heparan sulfate, inhibit the transfection by lipoplexes and polyplexes. Previously we showed (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) that DNA is only rarely released prematurely from the complexes by the strong electrostatic attraction between the cationic carrier and anionic heparan sulfate, as in the case of PEI. Since transfection was inhibited in many other cases as well (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), other mechanisms for inhibition of gene transfer must exist. Interactions with GAGs might alter the composition of the complexes and thereby affect cellular uptake or intracellular trafficking of the complexes. Our present results, however, show that GAGs do not have a significant effect on cellular uptake of various complexes. Thus, the inhibition of gene transfer is, in most cases, caused by the changes in the intracellular distribution of the lipoplexes and polyplexes.In this study, we show that the influence of GAGs on the complexes depends on the properties of both the GAG and the carrier. Sulfated GAGs have stronger interactions with carrier-DNA complexes than hyaluronic acid because of the higher negative charge density of sulfated GAGs compared with hyaluronic acid. Our results show that hyaluronic acid can bind to the surface of the positively charged complexes but does not interact with negatively charged complexes. Heparan sulfate, on the other hand, can interact with DOTAP and PEI complexes even if the surface of the complexes is negatively charged. This indicates that weakly charged hyaluronic acid cannot compete with DNA for cationic binding sites of carrier, whereas heparan sulfate can.Previously we have shown that based on the effects of GAGs on gene transfer, the delivery systems can be divided into the following three groups: (i) carriers with endosomal buffering capacity, (ii) liposomes with fusogenic DOPE, and (iii) others (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The first group includes the systems that are most sensitive to the effects of GAGs, whereas liposomes with fusogenic lipid (DOPE) are the most resistant.PEI polyplexes, with endosomal buffering capacity, are the most sensitive, whereas non-buffering PLL polyplexes are more resistant to interactions with GAGs. Heparan sulfate is known to bind PEI and release DNA from the complexes (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Therefore, both the cellular uptake and gene expression are blocked by heparan sulfate (Table I). Hyaluronic acid, on the other hand, decreased the cellular uptake of PEI-containing polyplexes, which partially explains the decreased gene expression. On the basis of our earlier studies (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), PLL forms very stable complexes with DNA probably because of the high charge density and flexibility of PLL molecules. In fact, the stability of PLL polyplexes, as demonstrated by their resistance to charge excess of heparin sulfate, may be the reason for the low transfection efficiency by PLL polyplexes (Table I). DNA may not be released from these polyplexes in the cells either. The different behaviors of PEI and PLL is probably because PLL contains only primary amino groups, whereas PEI contains primary, secondary, and tertiary amino groups (28Tang M.X. Szoka F.C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Also the different molecular structures of the linear PLL versus the branched PEI may influence the electrostatic complexation by these carriers (28Tang M.X. Szoka F.C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar).Our results show that lipoplexes with DOTAP are more sensitive to interactions with GAGs, especially heparan sulfate, than lipoplexes with DOTAP/DOPE. Recently Xu et al. (29Xu Y. Hui S-W. Frederik P. Szoka F.C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 341-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) showed that DOTAP and DOTAP/DOPE lipoplexes have similar colloidal properties, but the lipoplexes differed morphologically from each other. DOTAP forms with DNA multilamellar structures in which DNA is entrapped between the lamellae (29Xu Y. Hui S-W. Frederik P. Szoka F.C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 341-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30Gustafsson J. Arvidson G. Karlsson G. Almgren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 31Koltover I. Salditt T. Rädler J.O. Safinya C.R. Science. 1998; 281: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). DOTAP/DOPE, on the other hand, forms many extensively elongated tubular hexagonal phase lipid structures around the DNA chains (29Xu Y. Hui S-W. Frederik P. Szoka F.C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 341-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 31Koltover I. Salditt T. Rädler J.O. Safinya C.R. Science. 1998; 281: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 32Sternberg B. Sorgi F.L. Huang L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). It is possible that multilamellar structures of DOTAP allow heparan sulfate to interact and disturb these lipoplexes, whereas the tubular structures of DOTAP/DOPE lipoplexes might be more stable against heparan sulfate.Recently it has been shown that cationic lipoplexes are endocytosed into the cells after binding to the negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans located in the cell surface (15Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 16Mounkes L.C. Zhong W. Cipres-Palacin G. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26164-26170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The surface charge of the complexes is crucial for the cell uptake of the complexes because negatively charged complexes (charge ratio ± 0.25) were not internalized significantly into the cells in our study, although the size of these complexes was comparable with those at charge ratio ± 4 (29Xu Y. Hui S-W. Frederik P. Szoka F.C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 341-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we used a 3-fold negative charge excess of extracellular GAGs compared with carrier. This amount of GAGs should cover the complexes and change the surface charge of the complexes negative. Interestingly, in most cases the extracellular GAGs did not alter the cellular uptake of DNA (Table I). This finding suggests that the cellular uptake route of complexes associated with GAGs may be different than in complexes without GAGs. Although GAGs did not affect the cellular uptake of complexes, they had a major impact on gene expression of complexes. Hyaluronic acid increased GFP expression of the complexes, except in complexes with PEI, whereas heparan sulfate significantly reduced the gene expression in all cases. This suggests that the complexes covered by hyaluronic acid and heparan sulfate may have different route of entry or distribution inside the cells, causing differences in gene expression by the complexes.Both heparin (33Castello J.J.

Roque C. Lafont F. Rousselet A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 8-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and hyaluronic acid (35Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have been shown to be internalized into smooth muscle cells. Heparins are taken into the smooth muscle cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and are degraded rapidly in endosomes (33Castello J.J. Wong K. Herman B. Hoover R.L. Albertini D.F. Wright T.C. Caleb B.L. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 124: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) without further accumulation into the nucleus (34Barzu T. Pascal M. Maman M. Roque C. Lafont F. Rousselet A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 8-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Exogenous hyaluronic acid is taken efficiently into proliferating smooth muscle cells by endocytosis (35Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), presumably via CD44 receptors (36Lesley J. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. Hyman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26967-26975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, however, the cellular uptake of heparan sulfate and hyaluronic acid was much less than the cellular uptake of GAGs with either cationic carrier or cationic complexes. We observed that the cationic carriers increase the cellular uptake of GAGs, which has also been shown by others (19Belting M. Petersson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast to the data of Belting and Petersson (19Belting M. Petersson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we could not see a significant accumulation of GAGs into the nucleus. This difference might be explained by our use of a different cell line. Additionally, Belting's group (19Belting M. Petersson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) studied the cellular uptake of secreted macromolecules from conditioned medium that contained large amounts of anionic macromolecules. These will compete against each other for the binding sites of the cationic carrier.In summary, extracellular GAGs do not significantly affect the cellular uptake of most carrier-DNA complexes, although the surface properties of the complexes are changed. Instead, extracellular GAGs have an influence on intracellular behavior of the complexes, thus significantly affecting the gene expression mediated by the complexes. Furthermore, the extracellular GAGs are internalized into the cells with free carrier, with cationic carrier-DNA complexes, and in some cases with carrier released from DNA. In this study we have demonstrated the influence of GAG interactions on cellular trafficking of lipoplexes and polyplexes. In addition to these factors, internalization of GAGs might have some unknown effects on translation and transcription. It is important to understand the role of molecules that interfere with gene delivery. Such information provides new strategies for the development of safe and efficient delivery vehicles for gene therapy. Gene therapy holds great promise in the treatment of genetic and acquired diseases. The majority of gene transfer protocols utilizes viral delivery systems. Although many promising results have been achieved, the safety concerns and the difficulty of production on a large scale limit the usefulness of the recombinant viral vectors. This has prompted further development of viral vectors but also the search for efficient, nonimmunogenic, and easy-to-prepare nonviral vector systems. In nonviral gene therapy, the disease is treated with exogenously given plasmid DNA that is transcribed and translated to produce the therapeutic protein(s). However, the delivery of naked plasmid DNA to the target cells is not efficient because of the large size and multiple negative charges of the DNA molecule (1Ledley F.D. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1996; 13: 1595-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, increasing attention has focused on the development of nonviral carriers such as cationic lipids (2Felgner P.L. Ringold G.M. Nature. 1989; 337: 387-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 3Leventis R. Silvius J.R. Biochim. Biophys.

These carriers complex with DNA to form condensed structures (usual mean diameter, 40–200 nm) that are termed either lipoplexes or polyplexes (8Felgner P.L. Barenholz Y. Behr J.P. Cheng S.H.

The complexes have a positively charged surface, which facilitates the delivery of DNA into the target cells due to electrostatic binding to the cell surface (7Haensler J. Szoka F.C. Bioconjug. Chem. 1993; 4: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Although numerous gene delivery vehicles work in cultured cells, they are not efficient enoughin vivo. Sometimes gene delivery by the complexes is less than it is with naked DNA (11Wolff J.A. Malone R.W. Williams P. Chong W. Ascadi G. Jani A. Felgner P.L.

The factors that control gene transfer to the cells are still poorly understood (14Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger K. Poellinger K. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). A good understanding of the mechanisms of gene delivery and identification of the limiting factors should help in the development of efficient delivery systems for DNA. In recent years, extracellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)1 have been found to be one of the main biological factors that affect gene delivery (15Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 16Mounkes L.C. Zhong W. Cipres-Palacin G. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). GAGs are linear, negatively charged polysaccharides. They are the major components in the extracellular matrix of many tissues (for example, vascular walls and connective tissues), but they are also found inside the cells and on the cell surface (18Wight T.N.

The objective of this study was to understand why GAGs, especially heparan sulfate, inhibit the transfection by lipoplexes and polyplexes. Previously we showed (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S.

Thus, the inhibition of gene transfer is, in most cases, caused by the changes in the intracellular distribution of the lipoplexes and polyplexes.In this study, we show that the influence of GAGs on the complexes depends on the properties of both the GAG and the carrier. Sulfated GAGs have stronger interactions with carrier-DNA complexes than hyaluronic acid because of the higher negative charge density of sulfated GAGs compared with hyaluronic acid. Our results show that hyaluronic acid can bind to the surface of the positively charged complexes but does not interact with negatively charged complexes. Heparan sulfate, on the other hand, can interact with DOTAP and PEI complexes even if the surface of the complexes is negatively charged. This indicates that weakly charged hyaluronic acid cannot compete with DNA for cationic binding sites of carrier, whereas heparan sulfate can.Previously we have shown that based on the effects of GAGs on gene transfer, the delivery systems can be divided into the following three groups: (i) carriers with endosomal buffering capacity, (ii) liposomes with fusogenic DOPE, and (iii) others (17Ruponen M.

Hyaluronic acid, on the other hand, decreased the cellular uptake of PEI-containing polyplexes, which partially explains the decreased gene expression.

In fact, the stability of PLL polyplexes, as demonstrated by their resistance to charge excess of heparin sulfate, may be the reason for the low transfection efficiency by PLL polyplexes (Table I). DNA may not be released from these polyplexes in the cells either. The different behaviors of PEI and PLL is probably because PLL contains only primary amino groups, whereas PEI contains primary, secondary, and tertiary amino groups (28Tang M.X. Szoka F.C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Also the different molecular structures of the linear PLL versus the branched PEI may influence the electrostatic complexation by these carriers (28Tang M.X. Szoka F.C.

It is possible that multilamellar structures of DOTAP allow heparan sulfate to interact and disturb these lipoplexes, whereas the tubular structures of DOTAP/DOPE lipoplexes might be more stable against heparan sulfate.Recently it has been shown that cationic lipoplexes are endocytosed into the cells after binding to the negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans located in the cell surface (15Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 16Mounkes L.C. Zhong W. Cipres-Palacin G. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26164-26170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The surface charge of the complexes is crucial for the cell uptake of the complexes because negatively charged complexes (charge ratio ± 0.25) were not internalized significantly into the cells in our study, although the size of these complexes was comparable with those at charge ratio ± 4 (29Xu Y. Hui S-W. Frederik P. Szoka F.C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 341-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we used a 3-fold negative charge excess of extracellular GAGs compared with carrier. This amount of GAGs should cover the complexes and change the surface charge of the complexes negative. Interestingly, in most cases the extracellular GAGs did not alter the cellular uptake of DNA (Table I). This finding suggests that the cellular uptake route of complexes associated with GAGs may be different than in complexes without GAGs. Although GAGs did not affect the cellular uptake of complexes, they had a major impact on gene expression of complexes. Hyaluronic acid increased GFP expression of the complexes, except in complexes with PEI, whereas heparan sulfate significantly reduced the gene expression in all cases. This suggests that the complexes covered by hyaluronic acid and heparan sulfate may have different route of entry or distribution inside the cells, causing differences in gene expression by the complexes.Both heparin (33Castello J.J.

Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have been shown to be internalized into smooth muscle cells. Heparins are taken into the smooth muscle cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and are degraded rapidly in endosomes (33Castello J.J. Wong K. Herman B. Hoover R.L. Albertini D.F. Wright T.C. Caleb B.L. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 124: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) without further accumulation into the nucleus (34Barzu T. Pascal M. Maman M. Roque C. Lafont F. Rousselet A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 8-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Exogenous hyaluronic acid is taken efficiently into proliferating smooth muscle cells by endocytosis (35Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), presumably via CD44 receptors (36Lesley J. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. Hyman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26967-26975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, however, the cellular uptake of heparan sulfate and hyaluronic acid was much less than the cellular uptake of GAGs with either cationic carrier or cationic complexes. We observed that the cationic carriers increase the cellular uptake of GAGs, which has also been shown by others (19Belting M. Petersson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast to the data of Belting and Petersson (19Belting M. Petersson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we could not see a significant accumulation of GAGs into the nucleus. This difference might be explained by our use of a different cell line. Additionally, Belting's group (19Belting M. Petersson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) studied the cellular uptake of secreted macromolecules from conditioned medium that contained large amounts of anionic macromolecules. These will compete against each other for the binding sites of the cationic carrier.In summary, extracellular GAGs do not significantly affect the cellular uptake of most carrier-DNA complexes, although the surface properties of the complexes are changed. Instead, extracellular GAGs have an influence on intracellular behavior of the complexes, thus significantly affecting the gene expression mediated by the complexes. Furthermore, the extracellular GAGs are internalized into the cells with free carrier, with cationic carrier-DNA complexes, and in some cases with carrier released from DNA. In this study we have demonstrated the influence of GAG interactions on cellular trafficking of lipoplexes and polyplexes. In addition to these factors, internalization of GAGs might have some unknown effects on translation and transcription. It is important to understand the role of molecules that interfere with gene delivery. Such information provides new strategies for the development of safe and efficient delivery vehicles for gene therapy. Negatively charged extracellular glycosaminoglycans are one of the major biological barriers for gene transfer mediated by both cationic lipids and polymers (15Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 19Belting M. Petersson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to understand why GAGs, especially heparan sulfate, inhibit the transfection by lipoplexes and polyplexes. Previously we showed (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) that DNA is only rarely released prematurely from the complexes by the strong electrostatic attraction between the cationic carrier and anionic heparan sulfate, as in the case of PEI. Since transfection was inhibited in many other cases as well (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), other mechanisms for inhibition of gene transfer must exist. Interactions with GAGs might alter the composition of the complexes and thereby affect cellular uptake or intracellular trafficking of the complexes. Our present results, however, show that GAGs do not have a significant effect on cellular uptake of various complexes. Thus, the inhibition of gene transfer is, in most cases, caused by the changes in the intracellular distribution of the lipoplexes and polyplexes. In this study, we show that the influence of GAGs on the complexes depends on the properties of both the GAG and the carrier. Sulfated GAGs have stronger interactions with carrier-DNA complexes than hyaluronic acid because of the higher negative charge density of sulfated GAGs compared with hyaluronic acid. Our results show that hyaluronic acid can bind to the surface of the positively charged complexes but does not interact with negatively charged complexes. Heparan sulfate, on the other hand, can interact with DOTAP and PEI complexes even if the surface of the complexes is negatively charged. This indicates that weakly charged hyaluronic acid cannot compete with DNA for cationic binding sites of carrier, whereas heparan sulfate can. Previously we have shown that based on the effects of GAGs on gene transfer, the delivery systems can be divided into the following three groups: (i) carriers with endosomal buffering capacity, (ii) liposomes with fusogenic DOPE, and (iii) others (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The first group includes the systems that are most sensitive to the effects of GAGs, whereas liposomes with fusogenic lipid (DOPE) are the most resistant. PEI polyplexes, with endosomal buffering capacity, are the most sensitive, whereas non-buffering PLL polyplexes are more resistant to interactions with GAGs. Heparan sulfate is known to bind PEI and release DNA from the complexes (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Therefore, both the cellular uptake and gene expression are blocked by heparan sulfate (Table I). Hyaluronic acid, on the other hand, decreased the cellular uptake of PEI-containing polyplexes, which partially explains the decreased gene expression. On the basis of our earlier studies (17Ruponen M. Ylä-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), PLL forms very stable complexes with DNA probably because of the high charge density and flexibility of PLL molecules. In fact, the stability of PLL polyplexes, as demonstrated by their resistance to charge excess of heparin sulfate, may be the reason for the low transfection efficiency by PLL polyplexes (Table I). DNA may not be released from these polyplexes in the cells either. The different behaviors of PEI and PLL is probably because PLL contains only primary amino groups, whereas PEI contains primary, secondary, and tertiary amino groups (28Tang M.X. Szoka F.C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Also the different molecular structures of the linear PLL versus the branched PEI may influence the electrostatic complexation by these carriers (28Tang M.X. Szoka F.C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Our results show that lipoplexes with DOTAP are more sensitive to interactions with GAGs, especially heparan sulfate, than lipoplexes with DOTAP/DOPE. Recently Xu et al. (29Xu Y. Hui S-W. Frederik P. Szoka F.C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 341-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) showed that DOTAP and DOTAP/DOPE lipoplexes have similar colloidal properties, but the lipoplexes differed morphologically from each other. DOTAP forms with DNA multilamellar structures in which DNA is entrapped between the lamellae (29Xu Y. Hui S-W. Frederik P. Szoka F.C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 341-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30Gustafsson J. Arvidson G. Karlsson G. Almgren M. Biochim. Biophys.

DOTAP/DOPE, on the other hand, forms many extensively elongated tubular hexagonal phase lipid structures around the DNA chains (29Xu Y. Hui S-W. Frederik P. Szoka F.C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 341-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 31Koltover I. Salditt T. Rädler J.O. Safinya C.R.

Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and MS-Fit, we identified the 20-kDa Prx VI-binding protein as a cyclophilin A (CyP-A). The binding of recombinant human CyP-A (hCyP-A) to Prx VI was confirmed by using the hCyP-A protein overlay assay and Western immunoblot analysis with hCyP-A-specific antibodies. hCyP-A enhanced the antioxidant activity of Prx VI, as well as the other known mammalian Prx isotypes. hCyP-A supported antioxidant activity of Prx II and Prx VI both against thiol (dithiothreitol)-containing metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) systems and ascorbate-containing MCO systems. Prx II was reduced by hCyP-A without help from any other reductant, and the reduction was cyclosporin A-independent. These results strongly suggest that CyP-A not only binds to Prx proteins but also supports its peroxidase activity as an immediate electron donor.

CyPs also catalyze cis/trans interconversion ofX-Pro epitopes in proteins (24Galat A. Riviere S. Protein Profile: Peptidyl-Prolyl Cis/Trans Isomerase. Oxford Univ. Press, 1998Google Scholar).

In experimental models that investigate the functioning of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore for the protective effects of CsA, the mitochondrial isoform, CyP-D was the primary target for protection. CyP-D selectively targeted to the voltage-dependent anion channel-adenine nucleotide translocase (VDAC-ANT) complex (the core component of the PT pore), which has been known to be involved in cell necrosis induced by oxidative stress and impaired Ca2+homeostasis (reviewed in Ref. 33Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). CsA blocks the PT pore presumably because of the simple occupation of the active site of CyP-D (34Liu J. Albers M.W. Wandless T.J. Luan S. Alberg D.G. Belshaw P.J. Cohen P. Mackintosh C. Klee C.B. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3896-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the PT pore blockage by CsA is a calcinurin-independent process (35Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 36Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, considering the MPT prevention capacity of extra-mitochondrially added Prx (37Kowaltowski A.J. Netto L.E.S. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12766-12769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the physiological meaning of CyP-A-dependent activation of Prx enzymes can be considered as one of the most important CsA-independent MPT-maintaining processes in the cell. For investigation of the details of MPT-implicated Prx functioning, CyP-D/Prx III (mitochondrial Prx isotype) interaction will be explored, as well as CyP-A binding to cytosolic Prx isotypes.In the neuronal cell model, protection of CsA is consistent with calcineurin inhibition, which prevents the dephosphorylation of nitric oxide synthetase and its subsequent activation (38Dawson T.M. Steiner J.P. Dawson V.L. Dinerman J.L. Uhl G.R Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In this case, CyP-A, which is localized to the cytosol, is presumably the best candidate for the inhibition of calcineurin by complexing with CsA. However, CsA-insensitive protection of cells by CyP-A has been reported in organic peroxide-stressed myocytes (39Doyle V. Virji S. Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Until recently, intrinsic antioxidant or redox activity of CyP-A has not been reported. Therefore, CyP-A protects the myocytes against peroxides through the enhancement of the peroxidase activity of Prx by supplying the reducing equivalents, and this could be a reasonable explanation in this experimental model.Among the four Cys residues (Cys52, Cys62, Cys115, Cys161) of hCyP-A, Cys115and Cys161 were responsible for the reduction and the activation of Prx (Fig. 7). The distance between Cys115 and Cys161 is calculated to be 20.08 Å (SYBYL, Tripos. Inc.), and the two Cys residues are localized at opposite sides in the globular structure of hCyP-A (1VBS.pdb). Consequently, the formation of intramolecular disulfide linkage between Cys115 and Cys161 through the reduction of Prx is not assumed to be possible. Considering the exposed (Cys161) and partially buried (Cys115) status in the globular structure, intermolecular disulfide bond formation involving two Cys161 residues is feasible, but not between two Cys115 residues or Cys115–Cys161, unless considerable conformational changes occur. In addition, the possibility of either one of the two or both of the Cys residues oxidizing to sulfinic acid through sulfenic acid coupled to Prx reduction cannot be ignored. Further study of ultimate physiological electron donor and tentative cyclophilin reductase will be necessary for elucidating the mechanism of the electron flow of cyclophilin-coupled Prx functioning.Although various biological functions and activities have been reported with respect to Prx proteins such as an inhibition of apoptosis (40Zhang P.

Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), only the peroxidase activity is commonly accepted as the catalytic activity of Prx. More than a thousand times higher affinity (<10 µm) to H2O2 than that of catalase (25 mm) (10Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G.

Prac. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), lead us to assume that Prx proteins might be functioning to remove particularly low concentrations of peroxide that are produced as a second messenger. Recently, growing evidence suggests a transient and modicum generation of hydrogen peroxide as part of membrane receptor signaling (reviewed in Ref. 45Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). A report that demonstrates the capacity of Prx, which removes hydrogen peroxide generated in growth signaling (46Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), supports this assumption. The detailed role of isotype-specific Prx/CyP-A complex in the membrane-receptor signaling as one of the possible signal modulators remains to be evaluated. Peroxiredoxin (Prx)1 is a member of a growing family of thiol peroxidases that reduce peroxides to corresponding alcohols using reactive cysteine residue(s) in its active center (1Chae H.Z.

Recent searches of the public data bases show more than 100 members of the Prx family from archaebacteria to human. All of the Prx family members that have been examined for their antioxidant capacity show a measurable protection of glutamine synthetase (GS) inactivation against oxidative insults (1Chae H.Z.

Their GS protection capability is caused by peroxide reducing activity in the presence of an appropriate electron donor such as thioredoxin (Trx). All Prx family members that contain two conserved cysteine residues (Prx I-IV) and one member containing one conserved cysteine residue (Prx V) have an H2O2 reducing activity that uses thioredoxin as an immediate electron donor and is thus named thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) (9Chae H.Z.

CyP-D selectively targeted to the voltage-dependent anion channel-adenine nucleotide translocase (VDAC-ANT) complex (the core component of the PT pore), which has been known to be involved in cell necrosis induced by oxidative stress and impaired Ca2+homeostasis (reviewed in Ref. 33Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). CsA blocks the PT pore presumably because of the simple occupation of the active site of CyP-D (34Liu J. Albers M.W. Wandless T.J. Luan S. Alberg D.G. Belshaw P.J. Cohen P. Mackintosh C. Klee C.B. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3896-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the PT pore blockage by CsA is a calcinurin-independent process (35Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 36Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, considering the MPT prevention capacity of extra-mitochondrially added Prx (37Kowaltowski A.J. Netto L.E.S. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12766-12769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the physiological meaning of CyP-A-dependent activation of Prx enzymes can be considered as one of the most important CsA-independent MPT-maintaining processes in the cell. For investigation of the details of MPT-implicated Prx functioning, CyP-D/Prx III (mitochondrial Prx isotype) interaction will be explored, as well as CyP-A binding to cytosolic Prx isotypes.In the neuronal cell model, protection of CsA is consistent with calcineurin inhibition, which prevents the dephosphorylation of nitric oxide synthetase and its subsequent activation (38Dawson T.M. Steiner J.P. Dawson V.L. Dinerman J.L. Uhl G.R Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In this case, CyP-A, which is localized to the cytosol, is presumably the best candidate for the inhibition of calcineurin by complexing with CsA. However, CsA-insensitive protection of cells by CyP-A has been reported in organic peroxide-stressed myocytes (39Doyle V. Virji S. Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Until recently, intrinsic antioxidant or redox activity of CyP-A has not been reported. Therefore, CyP-A protects the myocytes against peroxides through the enhancement of the peroxidase activity of Prx by supplying the reducing equivalents, and this could be a reasonable explanation in this experimental model.Among the four Cys residues (Cys52, Cys62, Cys115, Cys161) of hCyP-A, Cys115and Cys161 were responsible for the reduction and the activation of Prx (Fig. 7). The distance between Cys115 and Cys161 is calculated to be 20.08 Å (SYBYL, Tripos. Inc.), and the two Cys residues are localized at opposite sides in the globular structure of hCyP-A (1VBS.pdb). Consequently, the formation of intramolecular disulfide linkage between Cys115 and Cys161 through the reduction of Prx is not assumed to be possible. Considering the exposed (Cys161) and partially buried (Cys115) status in the globular structure, intermolecular disulfide bond formation involving two Cys161 residues is feasible, but not between two Cys115 residues or Cys115–Cys161, unless considerable conformational changes occur. In addition, the possibility of either one of the two or both of the Cys residues oxidizing to sulfinic acid through sulfenic acid coupled to Prx reduction cannot be ignored. Further study of ultimate physiological electron donor and tentative cyclophilin reductase will be necessary for elucidating the mechanism of the electron flow of cyclophilin-coupled Prx functioning.Although various biological functions and activities have been reported with respect to Prx proteins such as an inhibition of apoptosis (40Zhang P.

Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), only the peroxidase activity is commonly accepted as the catalytic activity of Prx. More than a thousand times higher affinity (<10 µm) to H2O2 than that of catalase (25 mm) (10Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G.

Prac. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), lead us to assume that Prx proteins might be functioning to remove particularly low concentrations of peroxide that are produced as a second messenger. Recently, growing evidence suggests a transient and modicum generation of hydrogen peroxide as part of membrane receptor signaling (reviewed in Ref. 45Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). A report that demonstrates the capacity of Prx, which removes hydrogen peroxide generated in growth signaling (46Kang S.W.

The detailed role of isotype-specific Prx/CyP-A complex in the membrane-receptor signaling as one of the possible signal modulators remains to be evaluated. Using the Prx VI (1-Cys Prx) overlay assay, we have identified CyP-A as a Prx VI-binding protein and its activation of Prx VI antioxidant activity. We also have shown CyP-A-dependent enhancement of GS protection activity, using all the known human Prx isotypes. hCyP-A supported GS protection activity of Prx II and VI even against the ascorbate-containing MCO system, and hCyP-A-dependent reduction of Prx II was also revealed. Considering the GS protection activity of Prx, which comes from the intrinsic peroxidase activity of Prx (9Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the Prx reducing activity of CyP-A (Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7), it is reasonable to speculate CyP-A as an immediate and a general electron donor for the peroxidase catalysis of Prx. Jäschke et al. (23Jäschke A. Huaifeng M. Tropschug M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported the binding of hCyP-A to Aop 1 (Prx III) and hCyP-A-dependent stimulation of Aop 1 antioxidant activity (23Jäschke A. Huaifeng M. Tropschug M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However the physiological meaning of that interaction is not certain, because the cellular location of Prx III is in the mitochondrial matrix and that of hCyP-A is cytosolic. Even though all known human Prx isotypes were activated with hCyP-A regardless of intracellular compartments, only the cytosolic Prx isotypes (Prx I, II, and IV) that show the potential for physical interaction with hCyP-A might have physiological relevance. CyP was originally isolated as a CsA-binding protein, and later calcineurin inhibiting capability when complexed with CsA was revealed. CyPs also catalyze cis/trans interconversion ofX-Pro epitopes in proteins (24Galat A. Riviere S. Protein Profile: Peptidyl-Prolyl Cis/Trans Isomerase. Oxford Univ. Press, 1998Google Scholar). CsA blocks the peptidylcis-trans-isomerase activity (PPIase activity) of CyPs by binding to the active site Trp122 residue of hCyP-A (25Fejzo J. Etzkorn F.A. Clubb R.T. Shi Y. Walsh C.T. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5711-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas each of the four Cys residues was dispensable for the binding of CsA to hCyP-A and the PPIase activity of hCyP-A (26Liu J. Albers M.W. Chen C. Schreiber S.L. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2304-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Our results and a previous report (23Jäschke A.

Biol. 1998; 277: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which investigated the GS protection activity of Prx II or Prx III and the reduction of Prx II (Fig. 7), clearly demonstrate the CsA independence of CyP-A binding and activation of Prx isotypes. Numerous reports have been published that state CsA protects cells against oxidative injury caused by anoxia/reoxygenation (27Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. J. Mol.

Because IMP-1 has been found in several clinically important carbapenem-resistant pathogens, there is a need for inhibitors of this enzyme that could protect broad spectrum antibiotics such as imipenem from hydrolysis and thus extend their utility. We have identified a series of 2,3-(S,S)-disubstituted succinic acids that are potent inhibitors of IMP-1. Determination of high resolution crystal structures and molecular modeling of succinic acid inhibitor complexes with IMP-1 has allowed an understanding of the potency, stereochemistry, and structure-activity relationships of these inhibitors."

A direct interaction of the two proteins was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay. Moreover, confocal microscopy combined with two color immunofluorescence showed co-localization of the CaR and filamin-A within parathyroid cells as well as HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the CaR. Deletion mapping localized the sites of interaction between the two proteins to a stretch of 60 amino acid residues within the distal portion of the CaR's COOH-terminal tail and domains 14 and 15 in filamin-A, respectively.

In the parathyroid gland, the CaR mediates low Ca2+o-evoked increases in secretion of the Ca2+o-elevating hormone, parathyroid hormone, as well as in parathyroid cellular proliferation (2Brown E.M.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar,11Schlegel A. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Mehta P. Zhang X.L. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolae may play important roles in ensuring the specificity with which various receptors couple to their downstream effector systems. Scaffold proteins are another mechanism that can contribute to the specificity of receptor-effector coupling. These are multidomain proteins that bind and spatially organize functionally related proteins (for review, see Ref. 12Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins, in addition to heterotrimeric G proteins, which interact directly with the CaR. Our studies reveal that the CaR interacts with domains 14 and 15 of filamin-A, which is a large actin-binding, putative scaffold protein that also binds caveolin-1 (13Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S.

Moreover, interfering with the CaR-filamin-A interaction nearly abrogates CaR- but not ADP-mediated activation of ERK1/2, suggesting that the specific interaction between the CaR and filamin-A could play an important role in the CaR's coupling to activation of MAPK. pbCaRt and pCD1–7 refer to cDNAs encoding the full COOH-terminal intracellular tail of the bovine CaR or various fragments thereof; the respective cDNAs encode amino acid residues 860–1085, 860–919, 860–973, 919–973, 919–1031, 972–1031, 972–1085, and 1031–1085 (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). The various cDNAs were obtained by polymerase chain reaction and subsequently cloned between the NdeI and SalI sites of the yeast two-hybrid bait vector, pAS2–1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). For the cDNA library construction, the yeast two-hybrid prey vector, pACT2 (CLONTECH), was modified so as to enable ligation of randomly primed cDNAs in a unidirectional manner. This was done by first digesting the two existing HindIII sites in pACT2 and thereafter filling in the four resultant sticky ends of the DNA with T4 DNA polymerase. The ends of the two DNA fragments were then ligated back together in their original orientation, giving a vector, pACT2m, in which the two endogenous HindIII sites are destroyed. Thereafter, a pair of complementary synthetic oligonucleotides containing a new HindIII site was ligated between the EcoRI and XhoI sites in the cloning box of pACT2 m. This created pACTGH, which was used in the cDNA library construction (see below). Vectors pFI1, pFI2, and pFI3 correspond to the cDNAs encoding amino acid residues 1212–1355, 1344–1541, and 1534–1719 of bovine filamin-A, 2All amino acid residue positions for bovine filamin-A referred to herein are numbered according to the corresponding positions in the previously published sequence for human filamin-A/ABP-280 (GenBank™ accession no. X53416). respectively, and were introduced into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pACTGH using PCR. To permit ready transfer of the cDNA inserts of clones from the yeast two-hybrid prey vector, pACTGH, into vectors used for bacterial fusion protein expression in the correct reading frame, the following plasmid derivative was constructed. TheEcoRI site in the vector, pQE-32 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), a bacterial expression vector that produces proteins of interest with a His6 tag (referred to hereafter as a His tag) into the NH2-terminal part of the fusion protein, was destroyed with T4 DNA polymerase, creating pQE32m. Thereafter, a new EcoRI site was introduced into pQE32m by ligating complementary synthetic oligonucleotides between the BamHI and HindIII sites in the cloning box. This new vector was named pQEGH. To permit production of bacterial fusion proteins for use in protein transduction experiments (16Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), complementary synthetic oligonucleotides were ligated between the BamHI and HindIII sites of pQE32 m, causing the BamHI site to be mutated. These oligonucleotides also introduced after the His tag in this vector derivative, named pQTAT, a cDNA sequence encoding the Tat peptide (16Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), YGRKKRRQRRR, followed by new BamHI, EcoRI, SmaI, and SalI sites. To create pQTFI3, the cDNA insert of pFI3 was subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pQTAT. The insert of clone pbCaRt was also subcloned into the pQTAT vector, creating pQbCt. For production of a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein, the cDNA insert of pFI3 was subcloned into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of the bacterial expression vector, pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), creating pXFI3. The OrientExpress cDNA kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used for cDNA synthesis from poly(A+) RNA purified from total RNA extracted from bovine parathyroid glands via two rounds of oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (Oligotex mRNA kit; Qiagen). The random primed cDNA was unidirectionally ligated into the EcoRI andHindIII sites of pACTGH. Part of the resultant ligated cDNA was electroporated into DH10b bacteria (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid library DNA was obtained using the plasmid mega kit (Qiagen). Saccharomyces cerevisiaeY190 yeast containing the vector, pbCaRt, were transformed with the bovine parathyroid cDNA plasmid library described above using the lithium acetate method as detailed elsewhere (17Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar) and incubated at 30 °C with SD/−Leu/−Trp/−His/+25 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole media. After 5–10 days of incubation, rapidly growing yeast colonies were picked and re-grown on identical media. Thereafter, the β-galactosidase assay was carried out on these re-grown colonies to identify those that responded by turning blue. Plasmid DNA, containing the cDNA library insert, was purified from yeast that were positive for both HIS3 and lacZreporter gene activation and were re-transformed into Y190 yeast containing either pbCaRt or the negative control vectors, pAS2–1 and pVA3–1 (CLONTECH). A cDNA clone was considered to be positive in the yeast two-hybrid system when the transformed cells grew on media lacking histidine and gave a blue color in the β-galactosidase assay, but failed to induce the two reporter genes with the negative control plasmids. For deletion mapping, pCT1-7-containing Y190 yeast were transformed with pYC3 and evaluated to determine if they were positive forHIS3 and lacZ reporter gene activation. pCD5-containing yeast were subsequently transformed with either pFI1, pFI2, or pFI3, and reporter gene activation was again analyzed. DNA sequencing was performed using dRhodamine Terminator chemistry (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at the University of Maine DNA Sequencing Facility (Orono, ME), using an ABI model 373A Stretch DNA sequencer with the XL upgrade (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA and protein sequences were analyzed using the EditView (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and MacVector (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) software packages. Total RNA was obtained from bovine parathyroid glands using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and poly(A+) RNA was purified using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen). Five μg of the resultant poly(A+) RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel in 2.2 m formaldehyde together with an RNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transferred to a nylon membrane (Duralon, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The membrane was prehybridized in 50% formamide, 4× Denhardt's solution (50× Denhardt's solution contains 5 g of Ficoll, 5 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 5 g of BSA/50 ml), 5× SSPE (20× SSPE contains 2.98 m NaCl and 0.02 EDTA in 0.2 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.0), 10% dextran sulfate, 200 μg/ml calf thymus DNA, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 0.5% SDS. The membrane was then incubated with a random primed 32P-labeled filamin-A cDNA insert from the pYC3 clone. After washing, the membrane was exposed to a phosphorimager screen, and signal intensity was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). An overnight culture of TOP10F' bacteria (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing the pQbCt plasmid was diluted 1/15 and grown for 90 min at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the bacteria were incubated for another 5 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were subsequently resuspended in buffer A (8 m urea, 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mmKH2PO4), 20 mm imidazole, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated twice for 15 s each to lyse the cells. Insoluble material was sedimented, and the supernatant was incubated with pre-washed nickel-NTA beads (Qiagen) for 150 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with buffer A. In order to renature the bound, His-tagged protein, buffer B (buffer A without urea) was added dropwise with vortexing over a period of 30 min to a final concentration of ∼80 mm urea. Thereafter, the beads were washed five times with buffer B and mixed overnight at 4 °C with purified GST or GST-FI3 protein that had been prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unbound protein was removed with five washes of buffer B that had been modified slightly by adding an extra 13 mm NaCl, whereafter bound protein was eluted at 95 °C with protein loading buffer containing 2% SDS and 0.1m dithiothreitol. Protein samples were then separated on a Novex 8 × 10-cm pre-cast 10% SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen) and stained with Novex Colloidal Blue stain (Invitrogen). Preparation of TAT fusion proteins for protein transduction was performed essentially as described elsewhere (16Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), but with some minor modifications. In brief, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacteria transformed with pQTFI3 were resuspended in 8 m urea, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, and 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, lysed by sonication, and sedimented. Imidazole and NaCl were added to the filtered supernatant to concentrations of 10 and 250 mm, respectively. The sample was applied to a nickel-NTA column, washed with buffer without Triton X-100, and proteins remaining bound to the column were then eluted with 0.5m imidazole. The eluted proteins were subsequently applied to PD-10 columns pre-equilibrated with 4 m urea, 20 mm ethanolamine, pH 9.5, and 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. After this change in buffer, the proteins were applied to a Q Sepharose High Performance column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unbound proteins were removed with 20 mmethanolamine, pH 9.5, containing 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and the remaining bound proteins were eluted with 1.5 m NaCl. This eluted protein sample was desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with DMEM, and subsequently flash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70 °C until use. As assessed by PAGE with Coomassie staining, the bacterially produced Tat-filamin protein sample was about 50% pure, with two major protein bands, one of which had the apparent molecular mass expected of the Tat-filamin-A fusion protein and was immunoreactive on Western blotting with an anti-His antibody. The other major band was not immunoreactive and was presumably a contaminating bacterial protein. A His-tagged Tat-peptide, RGSH6GGYGRKKRRQRRRGG, was synthesized at the Biopolymers Laboratory (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). This peptide corresponds to amino acid residues 2–25 in pQTAT and was used as a negative control in the protein transduction experiments. Dispersed bovine parathyroid cells were prepared by digestion of neonatal bovine parathyroid glands with collagenase and DNase as described previously (18Brown E.M. Hurwitz S. Aurbach G.D. Endocrinology. 1976; 99: 1582-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), seeded on glass coverslips, and allowed to attach for 1 h. HEK-293 cells stably transfected (4Kifor O. Diaz R. Butters R. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) with the human CaR cDNA (19Garrett J.E. Capuano J.V. Hung B.C.P. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12919-12925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) or non-transfected HEK-293 cells (which do not express the CaR) were grown on glass coverslips in DMEM (without sodium pyruvate) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Attached cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 5 min with 2% formaldehyde in PBS. After washing again with PBS, the cells were permeabilized by incubation for 10 min with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. The slides were then incubated with 0.1 m glycine, pH 7.6, for 10 min to quench intrinsic fluorescence, and nonspecific binding was minimized by treatment with blocking solution (1% BSA and 1% normal goat serum in PBS) for 1 h. Slides with attached parathyroid cells were then incubated in blocking solution overnight in a humidified chamber at 4 °C with a 1:100 dilution of an affinity-purified, polyclonal anti-CaR antibody raised in a rabbit (denoted 4637, raised to a peptide containing residues 345–359 of the bovine CaR; generous gift of Drs. Kimberly Rogers and Edward Nemeth, NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). After washing five times, the slides were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After washing three more times, the cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-filamin-A antibody (a generous gift of Drs. John Hartwig and Thomas Stossel, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) at a dilution of 1:20 for 1 h at 37 °C. After five additional washes, the cells were finally incubated with fluorescein-coupled, goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS and twice with water, and then mounted with anti-fading mounting fluid (Vectashield; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence images were obtained using the 100× objective of a Bio-Rad MRC1024/2P multi-photon microscope equipped with krypton and argon lasers at the Brigham and Women's Hospital Confocal Microscopy Core facility. Slides with attached HEK-293 cells (transfected or non-transfected) were treated similarly, except that they were first incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal anti-CaR antibody at a 1:50 dilution (denoted LRG, raised against a peptide containing residues 374–391 of the human CaR; a generous gift of Drs. Kimberly Rogers and Edward Nemeth), washed as above, and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to Alexa-568 (Molecular Probes). They were subsequently washed as above, incubated with a polyclonal anti-filamin-A antiserum (a generous gift of Drs. John Hartwig and Thomas Stossel) at a 1:20 dilution for 1 h at 37 °C, washed again, and finally incubated with fluorescein-coupled, goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, mounted with Vectashield, and fluorescence images obtained as above. A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (p42/44) MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204, respectively) was purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Preparation of cellular extracts and Western blot analyses were carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction and as described below. Subconfluent, CaR-transfected HEK-293 cells in 12-well plates were incubated overnight in 0.5 mmCa2+o in DMEM without serum but containing 0.2% BSA and 4 mm glutamine, and with either the His-tagged Tat-filamin fusion protein (10–100 nm) or the His-tagged Tat peptide (100 nm) as a negative control. The cells were then treated in the same medium with 0.5 or 3.0 mm Ca2+o with or without the His-tagged Tat or Tat-filamin peptides, or with 1 μm ADP and 0.5 mmCa2+o with or without Tat-filamin, for 10 min at 37 °C (see “Results” section for details). The cells were subsequently washed once with ice-cold PBS, and then lysed with 100 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 50 mmdithiothreitol. To perform Western analysis, each well was washed twice with 1 mm EDTA in PBS, and the cells were lysed with 175 μl of lysis solution (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). The viscosity of the samples was reduced by brief sonication, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. Aliquots of 50 μg of protein from the resultant whole cell lysates were denatured in the lysis buffer, to which had been added 100 mm freshly prepared dithiothreitol, and were then heated at 90 °C for 5 min. The proteins were resolved electrophoretically on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose blots at 240 mA for 1 h in transfer buffer containing 19 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 0.015% SDS, and 20% methanol (v/v). The blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C in a buffer containing PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% BSA, and 5% skimmed milk (blocking solution). The following day, the blots were incubated with a blocking solution that was identical except for containing a reduced content of skimmed milk (1%) at 4 °C overnight with phospho-ERK1/2-specific antibody (New England Biolabs). A 1:1000 dilution of the stock provided by the manufacturer was utilized for the primary antibody. Following incubation with the primary antibody, blots were subsequently washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (washing solution) at room temperature for 30 min each. The blots were further incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-coupled, goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times with the washing solution at room temperature for 30 min each, and specific protein bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The data for MAPK activation are presented as the means ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. Statistical analyses were carried out using analysis of variance together with a Scheffe F test. A pvalue of <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. To identify intracellular proteins, other than heterotrimeric G-proteins, interacting with the bovine CaR (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar), the full carboxyl-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of the receptor was used as a bait to screen a bovine parathyroid cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. Of the 5.2 × 105 transformants screened, one clone, pYC3, was found to activate the HIS3 nutritional reporter gene in yeast and to be positive in the β-galactosidase assay. Re-transformation of pYC3 into yeast with either the empty vector, pAS2–1, or pVA3–1, which encodes part of the murine p53 protein, gave negative responses. BLAST search of the NCBI data bases with the pYC3 sequence revealed 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the human actin binding protein, ABP-280/filamin-A (13Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The deduced protein sequence encoded by pYC3 shares greater than 99% amino acid identity with the corresponding region of human filamin-A and spans amino acid residues 1212–1719 of the latter. The two amino acid differences between the bovine and the human sequences are replacements of the Arg at position 1312 and of the Met at position 1316 in the human protein with Cys and Thr, respectively, in the bovine protein. The protein encoded by pYC3 extends from repetitive domain 10 of filamin-A through part of domain 15 (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 13Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J.

The gene consists of 13 exons separated by 12 introns and spans about 35 kilobases. Further sequence analysis and mapping showed that this locus contained three transglutaminase genes arranged in tandem:EPB42 (band 4.2 protein), TGM5, and a novel gene (TGM7). A full-length cDNA for the novel transglutaminase (TGZ) was obtained by anchored polymerase chain reaction. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded a protein with 710 amino acids and a molecular mass of 80 kDa. Northern blotting showed that the three genes are differentially expressed in human tissues. Band 4.2 protein expression was associated with hematopoiesis, whereas TGX and TGZ showed widespread expression in different tissues. Interestingly, the chromosomal segment containing the human TGM5, TGM7, andEPB42 genes and the segment containing the genes encoding TGC,TGE, and another novel gene (TGM6) on chromosome 20q11 are in mouse all found on distal chromosome 2 as determined by radiation hybrid mapping.

Enzymes of this family catalyze a Ca2+-dependent transferase reaction between the γ-carboxamide group of a peptide-bound glutamine residue and various primary amines, most commonly the ε-amino group of lysine residues (1Folk J.E.

Seven different transglutaminase gene products have previously been characterized in man (3Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb.

Functions include fibrin clot stabilization in hemostasis, semen coagulation, formation of cornified envelopes in keratinization, and stabilization of extracellular matrix structures (3Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 5Aeschlimann D. Thomazy V. Connect. Tissue Res. 2000; 41: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The essential role of transglutaminases in these processes is witnessed by the serious impairment of wound healing and keratinization, which are associated with transglutaminase deficiencies (6Board P.G.

Besides playing a structural role, transglutaminase cross-linking has been shown recently to have a profound effect on cells by regulating the biological activity of signaling molecules such as transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-2, and midkine as well as by modulating cell-matrix interactions (5Aeschlimann D. Thomazy V. Connect. Tissue Res. 2000; 41: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Transglutaminases can promote cell-matrix interaction through both cross-linking of cell surface-associated fibronectin (8Corbett S.A. Lee L. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol.

The latter finding further supports a function of transglutaminases as structural proteins in addition to their enzymatic role and is consistent with the loss of catalytic activity of one member of the gene family, band 4.2 protein. Even though each type of transglutaminase has its own typical tissue distribution, the individual enzymes are present in a number of different tissues and often in combination with other transglutaminases. The recently reported unexpected absence of a distinct developmental phenotype in TGC1 null mice (11DeLaurenzi V. Melino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) may relate to co-expression with other transglutaminases and indicates redundancy in this protein family for the first time. All transglutaminase enzymes are encoded by a family of closely related genes. Alignment of the gene products reveals a high degree of sequence similarity, and all family members exhibit a similar gene organization with remarkable conservation of intron distribution and intron splice types. Comparison of the structure of the individual genes shows that they may be divided into two subclasses (3Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb.

Exon IX of the former group is separated into two exons (X and XI) in the TGM1 andF13A1 genes, and the nonhomologous N-terminal extensions of factor XIII a-subunit and TGK are comprised by an additional exon. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated that an early gene duplication event gave rise to two different lineages, one comprising TGC, TGE, and band 4.2 protein and the other comprising factor XIII a-subunit and TGK (12Polakowska R.R.

Transglutaminase genes were thought to be scattered in the human genome, because the genes encoding TGK and factor XIII a-subunit have been mapped to chromosomes 14 (18) and 6 (25Board P.G. Webb G.C. McKee G. Ichinose A. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1988; 48: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), respectively, whereas TGC and TGE have been mapped to chromosome 20 (14, 26), band 4.2 protein to chromosome 15 (27, 28), and TGP to chromosome 3 (29Gentile V.

We recently have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel member of the transglutaminase gene family, TGX, from human foreskin keratinocytes (4Aeschlimann D. Koeller M.K. Allen-Hoffmann B.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3452-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Two related transcripts with apparent sizes of 2.2 and 2.8 kb were obtained that encoded proteins of 638 and 720 amino acids with molecular masses of 72 and 81 kDa, respectively. We now have characterized the structure of the gene encoding TGX and shown that the two previously isolated gene products result from alternative splicing of exon III. We have mapped the gene to the 15q15.2 region of chromosome 15. Analysis of its flanking sequences revealed the presence of a cluster of three transglutaminase genes within ∼100 kb, including the gene encoding band 4.2 protein and a novel transglutaminase gene (TGM7). We have further characterized the new transglutaminase, TGZ, encoded by theTGM7 gene by determining its primary structure and tissue distribution. Our findings provide new insights into the evolution of the transglutaminase gene family. Oligonucleotides were from Oligos Etc., Inc.

PCR cycles (Robocycler, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were 45 s at 94 °C (denaturation), 2 min at 60 °C (annealing), and 3 min at 72 °C (elongation) for a total of 37 cycles, with the first cycle containing an extended denaturation period (6 min), during which the DNA polymerase was added (hot start), and the last cycle containing an extended elongation period (10 min). Two positive clones were identified, BAC-33(P5) and BAC-228(P20) (Genome Systems), and their identity was verified by Southern blotting. BAC plasmid DNA was prepared using a standard alkaline lysis protocol (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1991: 1.7.1-1.7.3Google Scholar) with the modifications recommended by Genome Systems. 2 µg of BAC plasmid DNA was restricted withBamHI, EcoRI, and SpeI and probed with a 32P-labeled ∼500-bp NcoI/BspHI and ∼600-bp BspHI/NdeI cDNA fragment of TGX, respectively, as described below. PCRs were carried out with 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Fisher) and 100–200 ng of plasmid DNA from BAC clones in 100 µl of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 50 pmol of the desired oligonucleotide primers. PCR cycles (Robocycler) were 45 s at 94 °C (denaturation), 1 min at 60 °C (annealing), and 5 min at 72 °C (elongation) for a total of 32 cycles. The following oligonucleotides were used as upstream and downstream primers, respectively, in the individual reactions: intron 2, 5′-GGACCACCTGCTTGTTCGCCGGGG and 5′-AGGGGCTGGGGCTGTGATGGCGTG; intron 3, 5′-ACCTCTTGAAAATCCACATCGACTCCT and 5′-CAGTTCTTGCTGCCTTGGTAGATGAAGCC; intron 4, 5′-GACAGTGAACCCCAGAGGCAGGAG and 5′TCTGTGGCTGGGTCAGTCTGGAAGTGCA (P3); intron 5, 5′-GCCTGCACTTCCAGACTGACCCAGCCACA and 5′-TCCAGTTTCCATTGAGCACCCCA; intron 6, 5′-TGCTGGGTCTTTGCTGCCGTCATGTGC and 5′-TCCTTCTTCTTATTCCCCAAAATCCTGCC; intron 7, 5′-TAGATGAGTATTATGACAACACAGGCAGG and 5′-GCGTCCAGCACCTGCCAGCCTCC; intron 8, 5′-TGAGTGCTGGATGGCCCGGAAGG and 5′CCCGCTCGTCACTCTGGATGCTC; intron 9, 5′-TTCACCAGGACACGAGTTCTGTTGGCA and P2 (see above); intron 10, P1 and 5′-TCAGGACTGCTTTTCTCTTCACCC; intron 11, 5′-ACCCCTGCAAAATCTCCTATTCCC and 5′-AATATCACCTGTATGGAGAGTGGCTGG; and intron 12, 5′-TTGAGGACTGTGTGCTGACTGTGG and 5′-AATGATGCTTGCTTGGTGTTGGGG. A partial sequence of intron 1 was obtained initially from the direct sequencing of DNA from BAC-228(P20). The complete intron 1 sequence was subsequently amplified from human genomic DNA (Promega) using the oligonucleotides 5′-CCAGCTGTTCTGTGGGGAGCATCC (forward) and 5′-GGTTTTCTGCCTCTGTCCAAGTCC (reverse) and 5′-AGGGGAAGTAGACACTCTGGCAC (forward) and 5′-AGCTCTGGAGGTCTGTGAGGGC (reverse). PCRs were carried out with 1.25 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and 260 ng of genomic DNA in a total of 100 µl of supplied reaction buffer supplemented with 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2 µl of Me2SO, and 50 pmol of primers. A total of 37 cycles were carried out in the Robocycler with annealing at 68 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 2 min, and denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s. Plasmid DNA from BAC clones was further purified for direct sequencing by digestion with 200 µg/ml RNase A (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C and by subsequent microdialysis using Spectra/Por 2 membranes (Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Laguana Hills, CA). PCR products were gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) for sequencing. Cycle sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using the Cyclist Exo− PfuDNA sequencing kit (Stratagene) and precast 6% polyacrylamide gels with the CastAway sequencing system (Stratagene) or using the dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and an ABI 310 automated sequencer. A modified RACE protocol (4Aeschlimann D. Koeller M.K. Allen-Hoffmann B.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3452-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was used to determine the transcription start site and obtain additional sequence information of exon I of TGX. Briefly, double-stranded cDNA was prepared from poly(A)+ RNA of cultured normal human keratinocytes (prepared as described previously (4Aeschlimann D. Koeller M.K. Allen-Hoffmann B.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3452-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)) with the Copy kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The cDNA was purified from nucleotides using the GlassMax DNA isolation kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) and tailed in the presence of 200 µm dCTP with 10 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C to anchor the PCR at the 5′ end. The PCR was anchored by performing a total of 5 cycles of one-sided PCR at a lower annealing temperature (37 °C) with the abridged anchor primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) only. After the transfer of 25% of this reaction at 94 °C to a new tube containing abridged anchor primer and TGX-specific primer P3 (see above), the first round of amplification was carried out for a total of 37 cycles under the conditions described above except for annealing at 55 °C. Nested PCR was done with the universal amplification primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and TGX-specific primer P4 (5′-TGAAGTACAGGGTGAGGTTGAAGG) as described above (annealing at 60 °C) using 1 µl of the first round PCR. Oligonucleotide P5, 5′-CATGGTAGCTGCCTCCGGTTCCTG, containing a 5′-infrared label (IRD 800) was purchased from MWG Biotech (Ebesberg, Germany). Primer P5 (5.3pmol) was hybridized to 1 µg of poly(A)+ RNA from primary keratinocytes (4Aeschlimann D. Koeller M.K. Allen-Hoffmann B.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3452-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and reverse transcription was performed with 200 units of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 20 µl for 90 min at 42 °C according to manufacturer instructions. The enzyme was heat-inactivated, and the primer extension products were extracted with phenol chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and then analyzed on a 4.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel adjacent to dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing reactions (Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) derived from a double-stranded genomic DNA fragment using the same primer. 18 µg of human genomic DNA was digested with BamHI, EcoRI, and HindIII restriction enzymes, separated in a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to a Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad). The gel was calibrated using the Lambda DNA/HindIII markers (Promega).32P-labeled probes were prepared by random prime labeling using the Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and PCR products corresponding to intron 2 and exon X were used as DNA templates. Probes were hybridized to the blot overnight at 65 °C in 500 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 7% SDS. The membrane was washed at 65 °C to a final stringency of 40 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS, and the result was developed by exposure of the membrane to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were used to prepare metaphase chromosome spreads (33Bebbington C.R. Hentschel C.C.G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1987: 184-188Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in PB-Max karyotyping medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 72 h and synchronized by culture in the presence of 10−7m amethopterin (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) for another 24 h. Cells were released from the mitotic block by extensive washing and subsequent culture in the above medium containing 10−5m thymidine for 5 h. The cells were subsequently arrested in metaphase by the addition of colcemid to a final concentration of 0.1 µg/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). Harvested cells were incubated in 0.075 m KCl for 25 min at 37 °C and fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) solution, and chromosome spreads were prepared by dropping the cells onto the glass slides. After air drying, chromosomes were treated with 100 µg/ml RNase A in 2× standard saline citrate for 1 h at 37 °C, denatured in 70% (v/v) formamide in 2× standard saline citrate for 3 min at 75 °C, and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series. DNA probes were prepared by random prime labeling of plasmid DNA of BAC-33(P5) and BAC-228(P20) with fluorescein-conjugated dUTP using the Prime-It Fluor fluorescence labeling kit (Stratagene). The probes were denatured at 75 °C for 10 min in hybridization buffer consisting of 50% formamide (v/v) and 10% dextran sulfate (w/v) in 4× standard saline citrate and prehybridized at 42 °C for 20 min to 0.2 µg/ml human competitor DNA (Stratagene) to block repetitive DNA sequences. The probes were subsequently hybridized to the chromosome spreads at 37 °C overnight, followed by washing to a final stringency of 0.1× standard saline citrate at 60 °C. Spreads were mounted in phosphate-buffered glycerol containing 200 ng/ml propidium iodide to counterstain chromosomes. Slides were examined by epifluorescence microscopy using an ×100 objective, and the images were captured with a DC-330 charge-coupled device camera (DAGE-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, IN) using an LG-3 frame grabber board (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) in a Macintosh 8500 work station and a modified version of the NIH Image 1.6 software (Scion Corp.). Images representing fluorescein labeling and propidium iodide staining of the same field were superimposed using Adobe PhotoShop 3.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA) to map the gene to a chromosomal region. PCR amplification of band 4.2 sequences was performed as described for the genomic library screening but using 100 ng of BAC plasmid DNA and the oligonucleotides 5′-GTTCTAGGCTTCTCTAGTTGGCAGG (forward) and 5′-CGCTGGCTTGGCTCACCCTGTCCC (reverse) for 5′-UTR/exon I or 5′-CCTGAAAACACCATGTGTGCCAAG (forward) and 5′-GTTCAGGGGCTACCACGGTGACGC (reverse) for exon XIII. Southern blots of BAC plasmid DNA restricted with BamHI, EcoRI, and SpeI were probed with the respective 32P-labeled fragments of band 4.2 protein as described and compared with those probed for TGX. Long range genomic PCR in combination with direct sequencing from the BAC clones was used to isolate the sequence between the EPB42 and TGM5 genes. PCRs were performed with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase as described above but using 5% Me2SO and the primers 5′-GATTCCACTGTGTCCCATCCAGA (forward) and 5′-GTCACCTCTCAACAGGACAAGGG (reverse) and 5′-GGGCCATTACCCTAGTCTCTTATTG (forward) and 5′-TAATAAAGTGTGACCAGCCTTCCTAG (reverse). A total of 36 PCR cycles were carried out with a combined annealing extension step at 68 °C for 10 min and denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s. The location of theTGM7 gene in respect to the TGM5-EPB42gene cluster was confirmed in a similar manner using oligonucleotides 5′-TGGGCAAGGCGCTGAGAGTCCATG (forward, P7) and 5′-GTTTACCTGTCTGCCTCTACGCTG (reverse) and the Taq-Plus Long PCR system (Stratagene) according to manufacturer instructions. PC-3 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, UK), established from a human prostate adenocarcinoma, were cultured in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Total RNA was isolated using Tri Reagent™ (Sigma) according to manufacturer instructions. When needed, poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using the Micro-Fast Track 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of total RNA or 500 ng of poly(A)+RNA by reverse transcription for 1 h at 42 °C using 200 units of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase and 0.025 µg/µl oligo(dT)15 primer in a 20-µl reaction mixture containing 0.5 mm dNTPs and 10 mmdithiothreitol in first strand buffer. For the cloning of TGZ, we used a series of degenerate and gene-specific oligonucleotides to isolate overlapping DNA fragments, essentially following our previously described strategy (4Aeschlimann D. Koeller M.K. Allen-Hoffmann B.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3452-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Isolated and sequenced TGZ fragments in a 5′→3′ direction were obtained with the following primers: 5′-CAACCTTGCGGCTTGAGTCTGTCG (forward, P8) and 5′-CAGCAGCTCTGACGGCTTGGGTC (reverse, P9); P8 and 5′-CATACACCACGTCGTTCCGCTG (reverse, P10), with nested reactions 5′-ATCACCTTTGTGGCTGAGACCG (forward) and 5′-CAAGGTTAAAAAGTAGGATGAAAGTTC (reverse) and 5′-CACAGTGTGACTTACCCGCTG (forward, P11) and P10; P11 and 5′-CGATGGTCAAGTTCCTATCCAGTTG (reverse, P12), with nested reaction 5′-CTTAAAGAACCCGGCCAAAGACTG (forward) and P12; 5′-TGTTGTTTCCAATTTCCGTTCCGC (forward) and 5′-TCTGGCACCCTCTGGATACGCAG (reverse); 5′-CTTAGGGATCAGCCAGCGCAGC (forward, P13) and 5′-GGGTGACATGGACTCTCAGCG (reverse, P14), with nested reactions P13 and 5′-TATCTTTTAGGACCAGCATGGACCTC (reverse) and 5′-GCGGATGAACCTGGACTTTGG (forward) and P14; and 5′-TGGGCAAGGCGCTGAGAGTCCATG (forward) and 5′-AGGACAGAGGTGGAGCCAAGACGACATAGCC (reverse). PCRs were performed with 2 µl of the reverse transcription reaction using 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and the respective buffer supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 25 pmol of each primer in a total volume of 50 µl. 40 PCR cycles were carried out in a GeneAmp 9600 thermalcycler (Applied Biosystems), each cycle consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with the first cycle containing an extended denaturation period (10 min) for the activation of the polymerase and the last cycle containing an extended elongation period (10 min). The 5′ end of the cDNA was isolated by 5′-RACE as described above with the exception of using the gene-specific oligonucleotides P9, 5′-TGAAGCTCAGCCGGAGGTAGAAG, and 5′-GACAGACTCAAGCCGCAAGGTTG. Amplified products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels, extracted using the QIAquick gel extraction kit, and sequenced as described. A human RNA master blot containing poly(A)+ mRNA of 50 different tissues was obtained fromCLONTECH. 32P-labeled probes were prepared by random prime labeling of DNA fragments of the different transglutaminase gene products using the Multiprime DNA labeling system. DNA fragments of 500–700 bp comprising the 3′ end of TGX, TGZ, and band 4.2 protein were generated by restriction with PstI and AccI,NcoI and NotI (exons XII and XIII), andXhoI, respectively. The cDNA encoding human band 4.2 protein (34Korsgren C. Lawler J. Lambert S. Speicher D. Cohen C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 87: 613-617Google Scholar) was provided kindly by Dr. Carl M. Cohen (Boston, MA). Hybridization was performed under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The labeled membrane was exposed to BioMax MR film, and the films were developed after 15–24 h for first exposure and 3–5 days for second exposure. cDNA from various cell lines and human tissue was prepared as described previously (4Aeschlimann D.

A panel of cDNAs from human tissue (multiple tissue cDNA panel I) was obtained fromCLONTECH. A 365- or 287-bp fragment of TGZ was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-TGGGCAAGGCGCTGAGAGTCCATG (forward) and 5′-GCTGGAGGGCGGGTCTCAGGGAGC (reverse) or 5′-AGGACAGAGGTGGAGCCAAGACGACATAGCC (reverse), respectively, with an annealing temperature of 60 °C.

By yeast two-hybrid screening and subsequent two-hybrid and pull-down analyses, we have shown that GGA proteins, through their VHS (Vps27p/Hrs/STAM) domains, interact with acidic dileucine sequences found in the cytoplasmic domains of TGN-localized sorting receptors such as sortilin and mannose 6-phosphate receptor. A mutational analysis has revealed that a leucine pair and a cluster of acidic residues adjacent to the pair are mainly responsible for the interaction. A chimeric receptor with the sortilin cytoplasmic domain localizes to the TGN, whereas the chimeric receptor with a mutation at the leucine pair or the acidic cluster is mislocalized to punctate structures reminiscent of early endosomes. These results indicate that GGA proteins regulate the localization to or exit from the TGN of the sorting receptors.

A chimeric receptor with the sortilin cytoplasmic domain localizes to the TGN, whereas the chimeric receptor with a mutation at the leucine pair or the acidic cluster is mislocalized to punctate structures reminiscent of early endosomes. These results indicate that GGA proteins regulate the localization to or exit from the TGN of the sorting receptors.

Recent studies have identified a novel family of potential ARF effectors, termed GGAs (for Golgi-localizing, γ-adaptin ear homology domain, ARF-binding proteins).

These data suggest that GGA proteins are involved in membrane trafficking from the TGN to endosomal/lysosomal compartments. GGA proteins have a common domain organization. At the NH2terminus, they have a Vps27p/Hrs/STAM (VHS) domain, which is conserved in various proteins involved in endocytic trafficking (11Lohi O. Lehto V.-P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Following this domain, there is a highly conserved region in the GGA family, which we refer to as the GGAH (for GGA homology) domain. At the COOH terminus, GGA proteins have a domain homologous to the ear domain of the γ-adaptin subunit of the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex, which we refer to as AGEH (for adaptor γ ear homology) domain. Between the GGAH and AGEH domains, there is a proline-rich region that is reminiscent of the hinge region of adaptin molecules. The GGAH domain directly interacts with the GTP-bound form of ARFs (5Boman A.L. Zhang C.-J. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 7Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguilar R.C. Vargas J.D. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. J.

Like adaptins, the hinge-like region has been shown to be responsible for interaction with clathrin (12Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The AGEH domain interacts with various cytosolic molecules such as γ-synergin (6Hirst J. Lui W.W.Y.

Commun. 2000; 271: 719-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the function(s) of the VHS domains is known neither for the GGA proteins nor for other VHS-containing proteins. Recently, three-dimensional structures of the VHS domains of Hrs (13Mao Y. Nickitenko A. Duan X. Lloyd T.E. Wu M.N. Bellen H. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and TOM1 (14Misra S. Beach B.M. Hurley J.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11282-11290Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have been determined by x-ray crystallographic analyses and found to show limited but significant homology to the NH2-terminal domain of epsin (15Hyman J. Chen H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 16Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Because the epsin NH2-terminal domain binds to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (16Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), it was attractive to speculate that the VHS domain could also binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or other acidic phospholipids. In the present study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using a fragment containing the VHS and GGAH domains of GGA1 as bait and found that the cytoplasmic domains of sortilin and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 3 (LRP3) interact with the VHS domains of GGA proteins. Both of the cytoplasmic domains have a cluster of negatively charged amino acids followed by a leucine pair at their COOH termini. Mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) also have the acidic dileucine sequences and were found to bind to the GGA VHS domains. cDNA fragments covering the VHS+GGAH (aa 1–327), VHS (aa 1–147), and GGAH (aa 141–327) domains of humanGGA1 and the VHS domains of human GGA2 (aa 1–163) and GGA3S (aa 1–113) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of their respective full-length cDNAs (8Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 719-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments covering the VHS domains of human STAM1 (aa 1–143) and TOM1 (aa 1–152) and the cytoplasmic domains of human cation-independent (CI)-MPR (aa 2328–2491) and cation-dependent (CD)-MPR (aa 212–277) were obtained by PCR amplification of a human liver cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.). A cDNA fragment covering the entire cytoplasmic domain of rat LRP3 (aa 521–770) was obtained by PCR amplification of its full-length cDNA (Ref. 17Ishii H. Kim D.-H. Fujita T. Endo Y. Saeki S. Yamamoto T.T. Genomics. 1998; 51: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar; a kind gift from Dr. Tokuo Yamamoto, Tohoku University, Japan). Mutations of residues within the acidic dileucine sequence of human sortilin were introduced into the cDNA for its cytoplasmic domain (aa 779–831) by a PCR-based strategy. For two-hybrid assays, the cDNA fragments for the VHS or VHS+GGAH domains and for the cytoplasmic domains were subcloned into the pGBT9 bait and pACT2 prey vectors (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. For expression in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST) or with thioredoxin (TRX)-His6, the cDNA fragments for the cytoplasmic domains and for the VHS domains were subcloned into the pGEX-4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK) and pET-32 (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI), respectively. Mammalian expression vectors for Tac chimeras were constructed by ligation of the cytoplasmic domain cDNA downstream of the transmembrane domain of the human Tac antigen cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. Hiroshi Ohno, Kanazawa University, Japan), followed by subcloning into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Construction of an expression vector for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged GGA1 was described previously (8Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 719-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Monoclonal mouse anti-Tac antibody (7G7.B6) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-TRX antibody, polyclonal goat anti-EEA1 antibody, and monoclonal rat anti-HA antibody (3F10) were purchased from Sigma, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cy3-conjugated and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., (West Grove, PA). Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (18Takatsu H. Sakurai M. Shin H.-W. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24693-24700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast Y190 cells harboring the pGBT9 vector for the VHS+GGAH domain of GGA1 were transformed with a pACT2-based library of human brain cDNAs (CLONTECH), grown for 5–7 days on synthetic medium containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole and lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine, and subjected to a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity. pACT2 plasmids rescued from the positive clones were subjected to sequence analysis. Two-hybrid assays for interactions between the VHS domains and the cytoplasmic domains were performed by essentially the same procedures as described previously (8Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 719-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Takatsu H. Sakurai M. Shin H.-W. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24693-24700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, reporter yeast cells harboring the pGBT9-based bait and pACT2-based prey vectors were grown on synthetic medium containing 100 mm 3-aminotriazole and lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine or on medium lacking tryptophan and leucine. The cells grown on the latter medium were then subjected to a filter assay for β-galactosidase using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. The VHS domains fused to TRX-His6 and the wild-type (WT) and mutated cytoplasmic domains fused to GST were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified using ProBond nickel-chelating resin (Invitrogen) and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Ltd.), respectively, as described previously (19Futatsumori M. Kasai K. Takatsu H. Shin H.-W. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The purified TRX-His6-VHS domain fusion protein (∼60 µg) was incubated with the GST-cytoplasmic domain fusion protein (∼20 µg) prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and blotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The blot was incubated sequentially with polyclonal rabbit anti-TRX antibody and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and was detected using a Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA transfection and immunofluorescence analysis were performed as described previously (8Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 719-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Takatsu H. Sakurai M. Shin H.-W. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11574-11580Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells grown in wells of 8-well Lab-Tek-II chamber slides (Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) were transfected with the expression vector for a Tac fusion protein alone or together with that for HA-tagged GGA1 using the FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated for 10–16 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated sequentially with monoclonal mouse anti-Tac antibody and monoclonal rat anti-HA or polyclonal goat anti-EEA1 antibody and with Alexa488-conjugated and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. The stained cells were observed using a confocal microscope (TCS-SP2, Leica Mikrosysteme Vertrieb GmbH, Bensheim, Germany). To identify proteins that interact with GGA proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with the use of the VHS+GGAH domain of human GGA1 as bait. By screening a human brain cDNA library, four positive cDNA clones were obtained. Among them, one clone covered a portion of the transmembrane domain and an entire cytoplasmic domain of sortilin (aa 774–831) and another covered a portion of the cytoplasmic domain of LRP3 (aa 748–770). As shown in Fig.1A and summarized in Table I, reporter yeast cells harboring the VHS+GGAH domain of GGA1 and the cytoplasmic domain of either sortilin or LRP3 were able to grow on a histidine-deficient plate and exhibited β-galactosidase activity. When the VHS and GGAH domains were examined separately, only the former showed interactions with the sortilin and LRP3 cytoplasmic domains. We then examined whether the VHS domains of the other two GGAs could also interact with the cytoplasmic domain. The GGA2 VHS domain interacted with the sortilin cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1 A and Table I) and LRP3 (data not shown). By contrast, the VHS domain of GGA3-short (GGA3S), which lacks a 33-amino acid region within the VHS domain as compared with those of GGA1 and GGA2 (5Boman A.L. Zhang C.-J. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol.

The sequence of GGA3-long (GGA3L), which contains the 33-amino acid region, has been also reported (5Boman A.L. Zhang C.-J. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 7Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguilar R.C. Vargas J.D. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1 B). However, we could not examine whether the GGA3L VHS domain also interact with the cytoplasmic domains because our attempts to isolate its cDNA fragment by PCR of human brain, liver, and kidney libraries were unsuccessful.Table IInteractions between the VHS domains and the cytoplasmic domains revealed by two-hybrid and pull-down analysesVHS/GGAH domainCytoplasmic domainGrowth on His−plateβ-Galactosidase activityPull-downGGA1 (VHS+GGAH)Sortilin (WT)++1-a++, +, and − indicate yeast cells that grew well, grew less but significantly, and did not grow, respectively.++1-b++, +, and − indicate yeast cells that developed blue color in 1- or 15-h incubation with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside or did not develop blue color, respectively.ND1-c++, +, and − indicate interactions comparable with that between GGA1 (VHS) and sortilin (WT), weaker but significant interactions, and no interactions, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The VHS domain is found in various proteins that function in the endocytic pathway and in signal transduction (11Lohi O. Lehto V.-P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1 B). Therefore, a reasonable speculation was that the VHS domains of other proteins could also interact with the sortilin and LRP3 cytoplasmic domain. However, this was not the case; the VHS domains examined, those of STAM1 and TOM1, failed to interact with the cytoplasmic domains of sortilin (Fig. 1 A and Table I) and LRP3 (data not shown). In the VHS domain, GGA1 shares 64 and 73% of its amino acids with GGA2 and GGA3L, respectively, whereas 29 and 33% are shared with STAM1 and TOM1, respectively (Fig.1 B), suggesting that residues conserved in the GGA family but different from those of other VHS proteins are crucial for the interaction with the cytoplasmic domains. A primary structural feature common to the cytoplasmic domains of sortilin and LRP3 is that both have a cluster of negatively charged amino acids followed by a leucine pair near their COOH termini (Fig.1 D). In addition, both have a serine residue flanked by acidic residues, which can be phosphorylated by casein kinase-II (CK-II) (21Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 23Jones B.G. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Thulin C.D. Fry M.D. Walsh K.A. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5869-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The “acidic dileucine sequences” are also found in the cytoplasmic domains of CI- and CD-MPRs; notably, the acidic dileucine sequence of sortilin is identical to that of CI-MPR (Fig.1 D). We therefore examined whether the cytoplasmic domains of CI- and CD-MPRs were also able to interact with the GGA1 VHS domain using the two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 1 C and summarized in Table I, the cytoplasmic domain of CI-MPR but not that of CD-MPR showed a significant interaction with the VHS domain. A similar tendency was observed with the VHS domain of GGA2 (data not shown). The acidic dileucine sequence of CD-MPR has an arginine residue within the acidic cluster (Fig. 1 D) such that the positive charge could disturb the interaction requiring the negatively charged cluster. These results led to a speculation that the acidic dileucine sequence is responsible for the interaction with the GGA VHS domains. To confirm this speculation and to determine sequence requirements for the interaction with the VHS domain, we introduced amino acid substitutions within the acid dileucine sequence of sortilin (Fig.1 D). As shown in Fig. 1 C and summarized in TableI, mutations of the leucine residues to alanines (Leu → Ala/Leu → Ala) and of the three consecutive acidic residues that are proximal to the leucine pair to non-acidic residues (Asp → Asn/Glu → Gln/Asp → Asn) abrogated the interaction with the GGA1 VHS domain. By contrast, a mutation of the two aspartic acids distal to the leucine pair (Asp → Asn/Asp → Asn) resulted in an extremely reduced but still significant interaction. The results obtained with mutants of the serine residue that can be phosphorylated by CK-II were somewhat complicated. The serine-to-alanine mutation (Ser → Ala) extremely weakened, although did not completely abolished, the interaction with the GGA1 VHS domain. The other substitution of the serine with an aspartic acid (Ser → Asp), which mimics a phosphorylated serine residue (23Jones B.G. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Thulin C.D. Fry M.D. Walsh K.A. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5869-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), had no obvious effect on the interaction. The interactions between the GGA VHS domains and the acidic dileucine sequences were also tested biochemically. To this end, GST-fusion proteins of the cytoplasmic domains and TRX-His6 fusion proteins of the VHS domains expressed in E. coli were purified. Using these fusion proteins, we first examined the specificity of the sortilin cytoplasmic domain to the VHS domains. As shown in Fig. 2A, the VHS domains of GGA1 and GGA2 were pulled down efficiently with the GST-sortilin cytoplasmic domain, whereas the STAM1 VHS domain was not. Essentially the same results were obtained with the CI-MPR cytoplasmic domain fused to GST (Fig. 2 A). These data are in good agreement with those obtained by two-hybrid assays. Apparently conflicting with the two-hybrid data was the result that the VHS domain of GGA3S was efficiently pulled down. The discrepancy appeared to be due to a nonspecific interaction of the GGA3S VHS domain with the GST portion of the GST-cytoplasmic domain fusion proteins because the GGA3S VHS domain fused to TRX-His6 was efficiently pulled down with GST (Fig. 2 A). We then examined the sequence requirements of the sortilin cytoplasmic domain for interaction with the GGA1 VHS domain by the pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the Ser → Asp mutant pulled down the GGA1 VHS domain as efficiently as the WT sortilin cytoplasmic domain, and the Ser → Ala and Asp → Asn/Asp → Asn mutants pulled down the VHS domain less efficiently. By contrast, the Asp → Asn/Glu → Gln/Asp → Asn and Leu → Ala/Leu → Ala mutations almost completely abrogated the interaction with the VHS domain. These data are consistent with the two-hybrid data. MPRs are known to cycle between the TGN and late endosomes to deliver lysosomal hydrolases through the latter compartment to lysosomes (reviewed in Refs. 24Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 25Hille-Rehfeld A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 177-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 26Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a previous study has shown that transiently expressed sortilin localizes in the TGN region, and a chimeric protein comprising the luminal and transmembrane domains of the Tac antigen and the cytoplasmic domain of sortilin is colocalized with CI-MPR (27Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Røgaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). These data lead to the possibility that the acidic dileucine sequence of sortilin common to MPRs determines the subcellular localization of sortilin. To address this possibility, we examined the localization of the Tac chimera with the WT or mutated sortilin cytoplasmic domain by immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3, the Tac chimera with the WT sortilin tail localized exclusively in the perinuclear region (panel B) as reported previously (27Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Røgaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), whereas Tac itself was found largely on the cell surface (panel A). Furthermore, the staining for the Tac chimera was superimposed on that for coexpressed GGA1 (panels E–E′′), indicating that the chimeric protein localized to the TGN. By contrast, the localization of the Tac-sortilin chimera with an Leu → Ala/Leu → Ala mutation was different; it was found on punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm and in the cell periphery as well as in the perinuclear region (panel C). A similar staining pattern was observed for the Tac-sortilin chimera with an Asp → Asn/Glu → Gln/Asp → Asn mutation (panel D). The Ser → Ala, Ser → Asp, or Asp → Asn/Asp → Asn mutation had no obvious effect on the distribution of the Tac chimera (data not shown). Thus, the ability of the sortilin cytoplasmic domain to bind to the GGA VHS domain correlated well with its ability to localize the Tac chimera to the TGN. The punctate staining for the chimera with the Leu → Ala/Leu → Ala or Asp → Asn/Glu → Gln/Asp → Asn mutation overlapped significantly with that for EEA1 (panels F—F′′ andG–G′′, respectively), an early endosome marker, but not with that for Lamp-1 (data not shown), a late endosome/lysosome marker, indicating that these mutations cause mislocalization of the chimera to early endosomes. GGAs are a family of TGN-associated peripheral membrane proteins that have been proposed to function to facilitate protein trafficking between the TGN and lysosomes/vacuole. The data presented here show that GGAs can interact with the cytoplasmic domains of TGN-localized transmembrane proteins including sortilin, CI-MPR, and LRP3. The interactions occur between the VHS domains of GGAs and the conserved acidic dileucine sequences at the COOH termini of the cytoplasmic domains. A mutation of the leucine pair or the cluster of acidic residues proximal to the pair abrogates the interaction and causes mislocalization of a chimeric receptor with the sortilin cytoplasmic tail from the TGN to endosome-like structures. MPRs are known to cycle between the TGN and late endosomes and to function as sorting receptors for lysosomal hydrolases (24Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 25Hille-Rehfeld A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 177-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 26Le Borgne R.

Sortilin has, in its luminal domain, a cysteine-rich region homologous to two corresponding segments of yeast Vps10p (27Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H.

Emr S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 7: 544-551Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), leading to a possibility that sortilin could also function as a sorting receptor for some lysosomal proteins. GGA proteins are recruited onto TGN membranes by virtue of ARFs and bind to clathrin in mammalian cells (5Boman A.L. Zhang C.-J. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol.

Taken together with the data presented here, it is likely that GGAs regulate the trafficking of lysosomal proteins by interacting with the sorting receptors. A Tac chimera containing the sortilin cytoplasmic domain localizes to the TGN. By contrast, a chimera containing the mutated sortilin tail (Leu → Ala/Leu → Ala or Asp → Asn/ Glu → Gln/Asp → Asn), which cannot interact with GGAs, is mislocalized from the TGN to endosome-like structures. A previous study using systematic alanine-scanning mutagenesis determined that the COOH-terminal acidic dileucine sequence of CI-MPR is the major determinant of sorting of lysosomal enzymes (29Chen H.J. Yuan J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7003-7012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although that study did not see the localizations of the CI-MPR mutants, their data are in keeping with the idea that the interaction between GGAs and the receptor cytoplasmic domain is crucial for lysosomal protein sorting. The acidic dileucine sequences are predicted to be able to interact with adaptor molecules other than GGAs. For example, the acidic clusters with serine residues phosphorylated by the CK-II of MPRs were shown to interact with the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex and proposed to be required for MPR exit from the TGN (reviewed in Ref. 26Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The interaction is thought to be mediated by another adaptor protein, PACS-1, which was originally identified as a protein that binds to the phosphorylated acidic cluster of the TGN-localized endoprotease furin (Ref. 30Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 31Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, the PACS-1 study suggested that the interaction between PACS-1 and the phosphorylated acidic cluster mediates retrieval of furin from post-TGN compartments rather than its anterograde transport from the TGN (23Jones B.G. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Thulin C.D. Fry M.D. Walsh K.A. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5869-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the above CI-MPR mutational study suggested that a hydrophilic nature, but not phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles, at the serine position is important for lysosomal protein sorting (29Chen H.J. Yuan J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7003-7012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which is compatible with the data presented here. Taking into account the data presented thus far on GGAs, it is tempting to speculate that GGAs regulate the exit of sorting receptors from the TGN by recognizing the acidic dileucine sequences, whereas PACS-1 regulates their retrieval from post-Golgi compartments by recognizing the phosphorylated acidic clusters. During the review process of this paper, a similar study was reported by Nielsen et al. (32Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjær A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). They identified GGA2 as a protein interacting with the sortilin cytoplasmic tail by two-hybrid screening and found that a deletion of the leucine pair abolished the ability of the tail to interact with GGA2 and led a Tac-sortilin chimera to a mild defect in its internalization. These data support our present data. However, apparently in conflict with our data was their finding that a deletion of the acidic cluster had no effect on the internalization of the Tac-sortilin chimera. This discrepancy might be because of the difference between our and their experimental systems; we observed the steady-state localization of the Tac-sortilin chimera, whereas they observed its internalization from the cell surface. We thank Drs. Tokuo Yamamoto and Hiroshi Ohno for kindly providing LRP3 and Tac cDNAs, respectively."

However, the molecular mechanisms for MSR on macrophages possessing the capacity of cytokine induction remain unclear and need further investigation.The activated macrophages not only transform into foam cells via uptake of OxLDL, but also aberrantly produce a battery of inflammatory cytokines that play pivotal roles in the process of atherogenesis. It has been demonstrated that interleukin-1β (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) (2Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9931) Google Scholar, 17Ross R. N. Engl. J.

Invest. 1995; 95: 2020-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that cytokines secreted from activated macrophages can be initiated or potentiated by one of the MSR ligands, OxLDL (21Jovinge S. Ares M.P. Kallin B. Nilsson J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1573-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), thus dysregulating expression of MSR and likely promoting the development of localized inflammatory reactions. Indeed, the macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF cause adjacent endothelial cellular expression of procoagulant activity, changing the endothelial cell surface from antithrombotic to thrombotic.On the other hand, fucoidan, the principal polysaccharide sulfate ester occurring in the various species of Phaeophyceae (brown seaweed), although it is a non-lipoprotein, is recognized as an MSR ligand and effectively competes with OxLDL in MSR ligand binding studies (9Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 10Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Up-regulation of MSR expression in human THP-1 monocytic macrophages upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate priming has been reported (16Palkama T.

The expression of uPA via MSR ligand-mediated signaling molecules include protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK), phospholipase C-γ1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), and protein kinase C (PKC), indicating a molecular model for regulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator expression by the specific ligand of MSR (1Hsu H.Y. Hajjar D.P. Khan K.M. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1240-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, herbimycin A (HB) inhibits fucoidan-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 (1Hsu H.Y. Hajjar D.P. Khan K.M. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1240-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that an unidentified PTK is involved in fucoidan-induced signaling. In this paper, we demonstrate again that geldanamycin (GA) or HB inhibits fucoidan-induced phosphorylation of various protein tyrosines and expression of IL-1. It is known that GA or HB inhibits the activation of certain tyrosine kinases; however, their cellular target is heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) (26Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its expression is induced by cell stress. Obviously, the MSR-induced cytokines IL-1 and TNF could lead to cellular stress including inflammation. Both GA and HB, benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotics, inhibit various signal transduction proteins including non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (NRPTK) pp60Src. Pharmacologically, HB or GA binds in a specific manner to Hsp90 and inhibits pp60Src·Hsp90 heterocomplex formation (26Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Xu Y. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Whitesell L.

Although ligands of MSR such as fucoidan and polyinosinic acid induce IL-1 production in human THP-1 macrophages (16Palkama T. Immunology. 1991; 74: 432-438PubMed Google Scholar), they are unable to examine systematically the MSR ligand-regulated signaling cascade for IL-1 production in macrophages. Hence, we propose and investigate pp60Src and Hsp90, which may play certain roles in fucoidan-mediated effects such as the association between pp60Src and Hsp90 in forming a complex in the regulation of fucoidan-induced prointerleukin 1β (proIL-1) protein expression.In studies reported here, we observe tha both OxLDL and fucoidan up-regulate TNF production; additionally, fucoidan but not OxLDL induces proIL-1 protein and IL-1 secretion in murine macrophages J774A.1. We demonstrate for the first time that fucoidan differentially stimulates the signaling machinery including NRPTK, pp60Src, p21-activated kinase (PAK), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs; i.e. ERK, JNK, and p38). Recent studies indicate that IL-1 secretion is post-transcriptionally regulated via IL-1 converting enzyme (ICE, caspase 1) (29Mallat Z. Ohan J. Leseche G. Tedgui A. Circulation. 1997; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Geng Y.J. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 251-266PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B.

In here, we find that fucoidan-mediated specific signals regulate IL-1 secretion, and simultaneously, fucoidan induces ICE activity during alternation of proIL-1/IL-1 expression. Moreover, combining with pharmacological inhibitors and genetic mutants in protein kinase assays, we investigate the molecular mechanism for MSR ligand-mediated signal transduction pathways in the regulation of proIL-1/IL-1 expression. Specifically, we further dissect and confirm the role of several key signaling molecules in induction of proIL-1, and we establish two signaling cascades,i.e. the PTK(Src)/Rac1/PAK/JNK pathway and the PTK(Src)/Rac1/PAK/p38 pathway, in the regulation of proIL-1/IL-1 expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CulturesMurine macrophage J774A.1 cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD), propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heated-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cultured in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.

Briefly, the cells were incubated with 25 µg/ml fucoidan or 5 µg/ml OxLDL. At the indicated time, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (without Ca+2, Mg+2), harvested in 300 µl of cell suspension buffer (25 mm pH 7.5 HEPES, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml pepstatin A, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, from Promega Co.). The suspended cells were stored in 1.5-ml centrifugation tubes, frozen and thawed three times, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × gat 4 °C for 15 min; the pellets were discarded. The protein concentration of supernatant in cell extract was determined, and the rest of the supernatant was saved at −80 °C for future use. For assaying ICE activity, 32 µl of ICE-like enzyme assay buffer, 2 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide, and 10 µl of 100 mm dithiothreitol were added to 75 µg of protein of cell extract from tested samples at various times, and then adjusted with water to 98 µl. For each tested sample there was a negative control (the same as above tested sample with the addition of 2 µl of 2.5 mm ICE inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-CHO)) and a blank control (32 µl of ICE-like enzyme assay buffer, 10 µl of 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide, and 54 µl of water). All tested samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, 2 µl of 2.5 mm ICE substrate (Ac-YVAD-AMC) was added to each sample, followed by an additional 60-min incubation at 30 °C; then the intensity of the fluorescence of the tested sample was measured at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Calculation of the relative fluorescence units and the caspase activity for each sample, as well as construction of standard curve and AMC calibration curves were as described in the Technical Bulletin fromPromega Co.Assay Activity of ERK, JNK, p38, and PAK in Fucoidan-treated J774A.1 Cells with or without PK InhibitorsMethods for assaying these PKs, including cell lysate preparation, immunoprecipitation of PK, in vitro PK reaction, analysis of PK activity, and quantification of PK activity were as described previously (35Hsu H.Y.

Twu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41035-41048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, the conditions for growing J774A.1 cells to be transfected were identical to those of regular J774A.1 cells, except the cells were subpassaged the day before transfection and replaced with fresh medium. The transient transfection of DN-JNK, DN-Rac1, CA-Rac1, or control (i.e. the empty expression vector) at 10 µg of DNA/100-mm plate into cells was conducted by using LipofectAMINE PLUS® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (35Hsu H.Y. Twu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41035-41048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The efficiency of both transfection and expression was monitored by the hemagglutinin tag expression. DN-Rac1-transfected cells were stimulated with fucoidan for 120 min and 240 min, respectively, then used to assay the activity of JNK and p38 as described above. DN-JNK-transfected cells and DN-Rac1-transfected cells were harvested after 24, 48, and 72 h (each sample was treated with fucoidan for 8 h), as well as CA-Rac1-stably transfected cells were harvested after fucoidan treatment for 4, 12, or 24 h, respectively. ProIL-1 protein expression in cells was detected by Western blotting analysis.Statistical AnalysisStatistical differences between the experimental groups were examined by analysis of variance, and statistical significance was determined at p < 0.05. The experiments were conducted three times or as indicated, and all data are expressed as the mean ± S.E.DISCUSSIONIn atherosclerotic lesions, activated macrophages via overexpressed scavenger receptors aberrantly taking up OxLDL are also the main source of secretion of inflammatory cytokines TNF (2Ross R.

Pathol. 1993; 142: 1721-1728PubMed Google Scholar). Yet it is unclear whether there is a relationship between receptor ligand binding and stimulation of cytokine expression. Fucoidan, a polyanionic polysaccharide, has been used as an effective competitor for OxLDL or modified LDL in studies of receptor binding (9Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar,10Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, fucoidan stimulates production of proteases (1Hsu H.Y. Hajjar D.P. Khan K.M. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1240-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22726-22732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cytokines in macrophages (9, 16, and this paper); however, there is no molecular mechanism to date for fucoidan-mediated reactions. Using ELISA, we demonstrate here that 24-h fucoidan induces about 50-fold more TNF production than OxLDL does in J774A.1 cells. Based on the time course of TNF production (Fig. 1, A versus B), there are different patterns and mechanisms for TNF induction by the two ligands, although TNF preexists in untreated cells. In addition, only the relatively lower concentration of OxLDL (5 µg/ml) induced TNF because there was no induction of TNF at a higher concentration of OxLDL (50 µg/ml) (data not shown), comparable to the previous demonstration (21Jovinge S. Ares M.P. Kallin B. Nilsson J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1573-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Using RT-PCR for TNF mRNA, there was no apparent difference of TNF message among cells treated with fucoidan and OxLDL and untreated cells. The fact that there was increased TNF production but no alteration of TNF message under fucoidan stimulation indicates that fucoidan regulation of TNF expression is likely at a post-transcriptional level.Neither IL-1 nor proIL-1 preexists in quiescent J774A.1 cells. Upon fucoidan stimulation, IL-1 can be detected by ELISA after 6–8 h; IL-1 secretion is consistent with the sequential times for synthesis of proIL-1 mRNA and proIL-1 protein under stimulation for 2 and 4 h, respectively. The ICE activity of fucoidan-treated cells peaks around 6 h and simultaneously IL-1 secretion increases, which reflects that active ICE hydrolyzes proIL-1 into IL-1 as in various cells (31Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B. Nelson N. Van Ness K. Greenstreet T.A. March C.J. Kronheim S.R. Druck T. Cannizzaro L.A.

Aunins J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar), although the reason for continuous increasing IL-1 needs further study. Our results indicate that there are complicated mechanisms, likely at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels for fucoidan induction of proIL-1 protein and IL-1 secretion in macrophages. Surprisingly, there is no detectable expression of proIL-1/IL-1 in the cell incubated with OxLDL. One of explanations for the results is that binding of different ligands to the conserved lysine clusters of the collagen-like domain in MSR (43Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J.

For the first time we demonstrate that different MSR ligands transduce diverse signaling and further lead to different biochemical reactions such as cytokine production.Ligation of MSR induces signal transduction pathways in macrophages (1Hsu H.Y.

Recently, scaffolding and adaptor proteins have been identified that organize signaling proteins in cells and that contribute to the nature and specificity of signaling pathways. In an effort to identify proteins that might organize the signaling system(s) activated by the extracellular Ca2+ receptor (CaR), we used a bait construct representing the intracellular C terminus of the human CaR and the yeast two hybrid system to screen a human kidney cDNA library. We identified a clone representing the C-terminal 1042 amino acids (aa) of the cytoskeletal protein filamin (ABP-280). Analysis of truncation and deletion constructs of the CaR C terminus and the filamin cDNA clone demonstrated that the CaR and filamin interact via regions containing aa 907–997 of the CaR C terminus and aa 1566–1875 of filamin. Interaction of the two proteins in mammalian HEK-293 cells was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization of them using immunofluorescence microscopy. The functional importance of their interaction was documented by transiently expressing the CaR in M2 melanoma cells that lack filamin, or in A7 melanoma cells that stably express filamin, and demonstrating that the CaR activated ERK only in the presence of filamin. Co-expression of the CaR with a peptide derived from the region of the CaR C terminus that interacts with filamin reduced the ability of the CaR to activate p42ERK in a dose-dependent manner, but did not inhibit the ability of the ETA receptor to activate ERK. The fact that filamin interacts with the CaR and other cell signaling proteins including mitogen-activated protein kinases and small GTPases, indicates that it may act as a scaffolding protein to organize cell signaling systems involving the CaR.

G protein-dependent signaling systems are composed of three basic sets of proteins: receptors, heterotrimeric G proteins, and effector molecules that may be enzymes, RGS proteins, or ion channels (1Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). The traditional model of signaling by these systems suggests that the various components, receptors, membrane-associated G proteins, and effector proteins, interact preferentially in their activated states, and that the specificity of these interactions is determined primarily by the structures of the proteins. However, this model cannot explain the specificity or character of these signaling systems that is foundin vivo (2Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). For example, in the renal collecting duct, both vasopressin (AVP) and β-adrenergic receptors are coupled to adenylyl cyclase via Gαs, but only AVP receptors stimulate H2O transport. In intact platelets, AVP and platelet-activating factor activate phospholipase C (PLC), but do not inhibit stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, whereas in platelet membranes, AVP and platelet-activating factor activate PLC and inhibit stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (3Brass L.F. Woolkalis M.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5348-5355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that cell structure or additional proteins such as “scaffolding” proteins may place constraints on cell signaling systems that contribute to their specificity (4Bockaert J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13941-13948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, these second messenger systems are not sufficient to explain all of the biologic functions of the CaR (32Brown E.M. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 371-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify proteins that interact with the CaR and that could potentially organize the signaling proteins through which it acts, we used the yeast two-hybrid cloning approach with the C terminus of the CaR as bait to screen an adult kidney cDNA library. We identified a number of interacting proteins, one of which was filamin. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific unless specified otherwise. Tissue culture medium and serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., plasticware was from Falcon, the HEK-293 cells were from the American Tissue Culture Collection, restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega, and Superfect and plasmid preparation kits were from Quaigen. The cDNA coding for the human CaR was a gift from Drs. E. M. Brown and M. Bai (Harvard University, Boston, MA), and the full-length filamin cDNA was from Dr. John Hartwig (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The M2 and A7 melanoma cells, originally described by Cunningham et al. (33Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) were from Dr. Fred Southwick (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL). A cDNA representing the C-terminal 219 aa of the human calcium receptor (aa 861–1078) in the bait plasmid pAS2.1 was used to screen a human adult kidney cDNA library in pACT2 (Invitrogen). The S. cerevisiae strain PJ69-4A was obtained from John Aris (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL) and maintained on minimal medium supplemented with histidine, leucine, tryptophan, and adenine (34James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bait plasmid and cDNA library were co-transformed into the yeast, using the method of Geitz et al. (33Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), and plated on medium deficient in leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. The plates were replicated on media lacking histidine, tryptophan, leucine, and adenine. The colonies that grew under these conditions were tested for β-galactosidase activity. Yeast expressing the library plasmid pACT2 without an insert and the pACT2 vector with β-galactosidase were used as controls. Colonies in which the β-galactosidase activity exceeded the activity of the pACT2 vector without an insert by a factor of 2 were analyzed further by purifying the plasmids and sequencing the inserts from either end. The yeast bait constructs representing the predicted C terminus of the human CaR (aa 861–1078) and regions of it were prepared using PCR with the wild type human cDNA as a template. All primer pairs contained NdeI sites at the 5′ end of the 5′ oligonucleotide to allow in-frame cloning of the construct into the expression vector, pAS2.1. The 3′ primers contained TAA stop codons in frame and SalI sites to facilitate subcloning of the construct. The full-length C terminus of the CaR (aa 861–1078) was produced with the primer pairs AGA TCC ATA TGA TTC TCT TCA AG (containing an NdeI site at the 5′ end) and GCC CAG TCG ACT CCT TCC ATT (3′ SalI site). The fragment corresponding to aa 860–991 was produced by cutting the full-length C terminus with NdeI and BamHI, and cloning the fragment in frame into pAS2.1 The fragment corresponding to aa 860–908 was made by cutting the full-length C terminus with NdeI and Bam-HI, and cloning it in frame into pAS2.1. The fragment corresponding to aa 907–997 was produced by cutting the C terminus (above) withBamHI and SalI and cloning it in frame into pAS2.1. The fragment corresponding to aa 987–1078 was produced using a sense primer (TTG GAT CCG GCA CGG TCA CCT TC) that contained anNdeI site, and an antisense primer (GCC CAG TCG ACT CCT TCC ATT) that contained a SalI site. The PCR fragments were cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.2-TOPO (Invitrogen) and then subcloned in frame into pAS2.1 (Invitrogen) using the NdeI and SalI sites. The sequences of these fragments were verified by dideoxy sequencing. The filamin constructs were produced in a similar manner by PCR using the human cDNA clone as a template (15Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1105Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The fragment corresponding to aa 1566–1875 was produced using the sense primer containingEcoRI/SalI sites (GCC GAA TTC GTC GAC GTG GAG TTC ACC ATC G) and the antisense primer (TGA CAG ATC TCC GAG TTG ACT TAA TCC ACA TAG AA) that contained XhoI and BglII sites. The fragment corresponding to aa 2021–2647 was produced using the sense primer that contained BamHI/KpnI sites (CAC GGT ACC AGC AGC CGG ATC CCG GTG GTG AT) and the antisense primer that contained an XbaI site (TTC TCT CTA GAC CAG TCT TCT CC). The fragment corresponding to aa 2021–2209 was produced using the sense primer into which BamHI and KpnI sites had been incorporated (CAC GGT ACC AGC AGC CGG ATC CCG GTG GTG AT), and the antisense primer (CCC AGA TCT CGA GGG GTC ACA CGG TGA ACT GGA A) into which XhoI and BglII sites had been incorporated. The fragment corresponding to aa 2402–2647 was produced using a sense primer containing BamHI and KpnI sites (ACC CGG ATC CCT GGT ACC CCC TTC AA), and an antisense primer containing anXbaI site (TTC TCT CTA GAC CAG TCT TCT CC). The PCR products were cloned into pCR2.2-TOPO, amplified, and then subcloned into pACT2 in frame. The sequences were verified using dideoxy sequencing. For the mammalian expression studies, the fragment representing aa 907–1024 was subcloned from pBluescript into pCruzMycB using the KpnI and BglII sites. The monoclonal antibody against the CaR was produced in mice by standard techniques in the University of Florida hybridoma core facility. A synthetic peptide (WHSSAYGPDQRAQ) that corresponds to amino acids 15–29 in the extracellular N terminus of the CaR was synthesized by the University of Florida biotechnology core facility and injected into mice, and hybridomas were prepared. Supernatants were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for reactivity against the peptide. Positive clones were tested against membranes from HEK 293 cells that express an HA-tagged CaR and membranes prepared from the medulla and cortex of mouse kidneys. The monoclonal antibody to the CaR (6D4) identified specific bands of 125 and 140 kDa that were also identified by the anti-HA antibody in the membranes from the cells that expressed the HA-tagged CaR. HEK293 cells that express the CaR were grown to ∼80% confluence on polylysine-coated coverslips. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed three times in PBS, quenched for 30 min in PBS with 50 mm glycine, and washed again in PBS. The cells were blocked and permeabilized by incubating them for 30 min in PBS containing 3% BSA, 5% normal goat serum (NGS), and 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated in primary antibody (10 μg/ml CaR 6D4 or 10 μg/ml filamin) and 1 μg/ml rhodamine phalloidin in PBS containing 3% BSA, 5% NGS, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed three times with PBS and incubated in secondary antibody (1:200 FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG) in PBS containing 3% BSA, 5% NGS, and 0.1% Triton for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed in PBS and attached to slides with a solution that contained 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize nuclei. Images of the cells were obtained with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope, and images were stored using a digital Spot camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). cDNAs were transfected into HEK293 cells using the CaPO4co-precipitation technique (35). A total of 3 μg of DNA (a combination of cDNAs coding for proteins of interest with empty vector and carrier DNA) were added to 60-mm dishes and allowed to precipitate. The medium was changed after 18–20 h, and experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. For stable expression of the CaR in HEK-293 cells, stable clones were selected with G-418. cDNAs were transfected into M2 and A7 melanoma cells using Superfect according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Cells were lysed on ice in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer containing 125 mm NaCl, 62.5 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 0.625% C12Ε10 (Lubrol), and protease inhibitors. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,500 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C and incubated with an equal volume (500 μl) of the hybridoma supernatant from clone 6D4 (anti-CaR monoclonal antibody) or the anti-filamin antibody (45 μg) at 4 °C by slow rotation overnight. The samples were then incubated with 7.5 μl of rabbit anti-mouse antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitations were performed by incubating the extracts with Pansorbin cells (S. aureus, Calbiochem) for 30 min on ice and then centrifuging them at top speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1× IP buffer, layered over 0.9 ml of 20% sucrose in IP buffer, and centrifuged at top speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 6 min. The pellet was resuspended in PBS and centrifuged for 3 min at top speed. That pellet was resuspended in 1× electrophoresis buffer, heated to 90 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and processed for immunoblotting with the antibody indicated. HEK-293, M2, and A7 melanoma cells were serum-deprived overnight before experiments. At the time of experiments, the medium was replaced with a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mmMgCl2. At time 0, reagents were added at the concentrations indicated and incubated with the cells at 37 °C for the times indicated. Commonly, the cells were exposed to activators of the receptor for 5 min, at which time the reactions were stopped by rinsing the cells at 4 °C in buffer containing 50 mm NaF, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4–7.5, and placing the dishes on a dry ice and ethanol bath. The cells were scraped in iced buffer that contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 50 nm okadaic acid, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. Triton-soluble extracts were normalized for protein, size-fractionated using SDS-PAGE, and processed for immunoblotting. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The anti-active ERK antibody was obtained from Promega, and the anti-filamin monoclonal antibody was obtained from Serotec. The monoclonal antibodies to the HA epitope, 12CA5, and the Myc epitope, 9E10, were obtained from the University of Florida hybridoma core. In order to identify proteins that interact with the CaR and that could act as scaffolding proteins to organize the signaling molecules regulated by the CaR, we used the C-terminal 219 aa (aa 861–1078) of the human CaR representing the cytoplasmic tail as bait in the pAS2 vector (Invitrogen) to screen a human adult kidney cDNA library in pACT2 (Invitrogen) using the yeast two-hybrid system (36Gietz R.D. Triggs-Raine B. Robbins A. Graham K.C. Woods R.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We used the yeast strain PJ69-4A, which offers triple genetic selection and a reduced rate of false positive clones (34James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bait plasmid and the cDNA library were co-transformed into the yeast using the lithium acetate/single-stranded DNA/polyethylene glycol method of Geitz et al. (37Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods A.R. Yeast. 1995; 11: 335-360Crossref Scopus (1712) Google Scholar), and plated on medium deficient in Leu, Trp, and His. The plates were replicated on media lacking His, Trp, Leu, and adenine, and the surviving colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity. Positive clones were sequenced from either end. Four positive clones were isolated and sequenced, one of which was filamin 1 (ABP-280). The filamin clone was 3326 nucleotides in length and represented the C-terminal 1082 aa (aa 1566–2647), which includes the C-terminal 61 aa of repeat 14, repeats 15–24, and the two hinge regions (15Gorlin J.B.

Faranda S. Mancini M. Maestrini E. Toniolo D. Vezzoni P. Genomics. 1994; 21: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the CaR C terminus in yeast (Fig.1, Table I) demonstrated that the first 48 aa of the C terminus distal to the seventh membrane-spanning domain (aa 860–908), a region of many receptors that interacts with G proteins and that is required for signaling by the CaR, does not interact with filamin (39Ray K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The interacting region includes aa 907–997, but may also include additional amino acids because the full-length C terminus interacts with filamin more strongly based on growth and β-galactosidase assays (Table I). The interacting 91-aa region is rich in glutamine and proline residues but does not contain sequences that correspond to functional domains that mediate protein-protein interactions such as Src homology regions 2 and 3, or PDZ domains (Fig. 1,bottom).Table IInteraction of CaR C-terminal constructs with two filamin constructsCaR constructFilamin 1566–2647 growthFilamin 1566–2647Filamin 1566–1647 growthFilamin 1566–1647β-Gal unitsβ-Gal unitsVector (pAS2.1)−5−4.2860–1078++14.3++15.5860–991+10.1+11.0860–908−4.5−5.1907–997+12.6+12.3987–1078−7.3−6.2 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows a map of the filamin cDNA isolated from the human kidney cDNA library with a diagram of filamin showing the locations of the repeats and hinge regions. The truncation mutants used to map the region of filamin that interacts with the CaR are also shown with numbers corresponding to the first and last amino acids of each construct. The full-length filamin clone (aa 1566–2647) and a shorter construct (aa 1566–1875) corresponding to the last 61 aa of repeat 14, repeat 15, the 25-aa hinge region, repeat 16, and 15 aa of repeat 17, referred to as “repeats 15–16,” both interacted with the full-length CaR C terminus and the construct corresponding to CaR aa 907–997 (see Fig. 1) (15Gorlin J.B.

The full-length C terminus interacts with both filamin constructs more strongly than the shorter construct (aa 907–997), further suggesting that other regions of the CaR C terminus, probably containing amino acids C-terminal of aa 997, contribute to the interaction of the CaR with filamin (Table II). These results indicate that the CaR and filamin interact directly via peptides containing aa 907–997 in the CaR C terminus, and aa 1566–1875 corresponding to a region of filamin that contains most of repeat 14 through repeat 16.Table IIInteraction of filamin constructs with two CaR C-terminal constructsFilamin constructCaR 860–1078 growthCaR 860–1078CaR 907–997 growthCaR 907–997β-Gal unitsβ-Gal unitsVector (pACT2)−7.1−61566–2647++18.2+12.11566–1875++21.3+13.82021–2647−8−72021–2029−6−8.22402–2647−4.9−5.9 Open table in a new tab In order to determine if the CaR and filamin interact in mammalian cells, we coimmunoprecipitated the two proteins using either the anti-CaR antibody, 6D4, or the anti-filamin antibody.

Upon triggering of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), PAG/Cbp is rapidly dephosphorylated leading to dissociation of Csk from lipid rafts. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of PAG/Cbp resumes after 3–5 min, at which time Csk reassociates with the rafts. Cells overexpressing a mutant Csk that lacks the catalytic domain, but displaces endogenous Csk from lipid rafts, have elevated basal levels of TCR-ζ-chain phosphorylation and spontaneous activation of an NFAT-AP1 reporter from the proximal interleukin-2 promoter as well as stronger and more sustained responses to TCR triggering than controls. We suggest that a transient release from Csk-mediated inhibition by displacement of Csk from lipid rafts is important for normal T cell activation.

The subsequent recruitment of the tandem SH2 domain containing tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 to phosphorylated ITAMs generates an activated immune receptor signaling complex that is able to initiate downstream events leading to a functional T cell response (2Wange R.L.

The control and fine-tuning of the proximal signaling is not only essential for an effective T cell response to antigen, but also for avoiding exaggerated T cell activation and autoimmunity. Thus a balance must be maintained to avoid hypo- as well as hyper-reactivity and immunopathology. The TCR signaling machinery appears to be controlled by setting a threshold for activation to avoid too easy triggering. Suppression of the catalytic activity of Lck and Fyn by phosphorylation of a C-terminal residue (Tyr505 in Lck, Tyr528 in FynT) by the C-terminal Src kinase, Csk, appears to be an important means of negative regulation of TCR signaling (4Okada M.

Recent discoveries indicate that the assembly of TCR signaling complexes occurs in specific membrane subdomains with high cholesterol and glycolipid contents, called glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains or lipid rafts (9Xavier R.

Key components, including Lck and LAT, are targeted to rafts by virtue of their lipid modifications, whereas other proteins such as the ζ-chain can localize via interaction with raft components only after TCR engagement (11Zhang W.

Lipid rafts serve to concentrate and promote specific protein-protein interactions and the tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling intermediates by the Src family kinases during the proximal phases of immunoreceptor signaling via the TCR as well as via the B cell and Fc receptors (14Janes P.W.

The ubiquitously expressed, cytosolic Csk tyrosine kinase is critical for suppression of Src-like kinases and necessary for normal thymic development of T cells (17Imamoto A. Soriano P.

Niidome T. Kühn R. Aizawa S. Tarakhovsky A. Nature. 1998; 394: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Csk consists of an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain and a kinase domain similar to the Src kinases, but lacks the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine as well as the N-terminal lipid modification sites that targets Src kinases to lipid rafts (20Mustelin T. Burn P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, although Csk has been shown to move to sites of Src activity in fibroblasts (21Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5402-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), it has for some time been unclear how the cytoplasmic Csk can effectively regulate the lipid raft-associated Src kinases and whether this inhibition by Csk is temporarily released upon T cell activation. The recent identification of a lipid raft-associated transmembrane adaptor protein,phosphoprotein-associated withglycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (PAG) orCsk binding protein (Cbp) with the capacity to bind Csk provides a means for localizing Csk to the proximity of its substrates (22Brdicka T.

It was shown that Csk is associated with lipid rafts in normal T cells via PAG/Cbp and that Csk dissociates from the rafts concomitantly with TCR-mediated dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp (22Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Here, we extend these findings and show that the raft-associated Csk present in resting T cells is targeted via interaction of the Csk SH2 domain with PAG/Cbp. Furthermore, rapid Csk reassociation with lipid rafts coincides with termination of proximal TCR signaling. In addition, overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant Csk that displaces endogenous Csk from lipid rafts leads to both constitutive and sustained activation. Thus, Csk acts as a gatekeeper that must be temporarily sent off duty for efficient TCR signaling to occur. The human leukemic T cell line Jurkat TAg, a derivative of the Jurkat cell line stably transfected with the SV40 large T antigen (24Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar), and the Lck-deficient JCaM1 cell line (25Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) were kept in logarithmic growth in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Human peripheral blood T cells were purified from normal donors by negative selection (26Aandahl E.M. Aukrust P. Skålhegg B.S. Müller F. Frøland S.S. Hansson V. Taskén K. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). T cells were activated by addition of 5 µg/ml anti-CD3 ε mAb OKT-3 or by pervanadate treatment (0.01% H202 in 100 µmNa3VO4). For transfections, cells (2 × 107) in 0.4 ml of Opti-MEM were mixed with 2–80 µg of each DNA construct in electroporation cuvettes with 0.4-cm electrode gap (Bio-Rad) and subjected to an electric field of 250 V/cm with 960-microfarad capacitance. The cells were expanded in complete medium and harvested after 20 h. Isolation of lipid rafts or glycoprotein-enriched membrane microdomains was performed as described in detail elsewhere (11Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in 1 ml of an ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100 with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride) by 10 pestle strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, loaded at the bottom of a 40 to 5% sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 h. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected from the top. For immunoprecipitation, cells (5 × 107) were disrupted in precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 60 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucoside, with 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride). When stimulated with OKT-3, cell lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mAb (Babco, Richmond, CA), anti-Csk antibody (Santa Cruz, catalog number SC-286) or anti-PAG mAb (MEM-250) (22Brdicka T.

Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, protein A/G-Sepharose was added and the incubation continued for 1 h. Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. Detection of phosphotyrosine by anti-Tyr(P) mAb (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and immunoblotting with anti-Csk, anti-PAG, anti-LAT, anti-PLC-γ1, anti-Grb2, anti-HA, and anti-ζ antibodies was as before (27Couture C.

(SC-286 and SC-1239, respectively) were used. The anti-PAG antibody (and MEM-255) and the far-Western protocol were described previously (22Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The gene encoding human Csk (29Vang T. Taskén K. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Levy F.O. Biochim. Biophys.

Vectors encoding HA-Csk-SH3-SH2 and GST-Csk-SH3-SH2 were generated by stop mutations in amino acid 175 using full-length Csk in the respective vectors as template and using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Subsequently, HA-Csk-SH3-SH2(R107K), HA-Csk-SH3-SH2(S109C), and HA-Csk-SH3(W47A)-SH2 were made in a second round of mutagenesis to eliminate SH2 and SH3 binding capacity, respectively (30Cloutier J.F.

Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), was generated by mutagenesis of the wild type HA-Csk. GST-Csk-SH3-SH2 was purified as described previously (29Vang T. Taskén K. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Levy F.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mutants were verified by sequencing. The FLAG-PAG construct was described previously (22Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). For purification of Csk-associated proteins, purified peripheral T cells (5 × 108) were disrupted in precipitation buffer (as described above including 60 mm n-β-octyl-d-glucoside to disrupt rafts) and passed over a column where GST-Csk-SH3-SH2 was bound to glutathione-agarose, followed by washing with 50 bead volumes and elution with 50 mm phosphotyrosine in the same buffer. To assess activity of the proximal IL-2 promoter, cells were transfected by electroporation with a construct consisting of the NFAT-AP-1 elements from the proximal IL-2 promoter inserted in a luciferase reporter construct, incubated with 5 µg/ml OKT-3 or 25 ng/ml PMA and 5 µm ionomycin for 6 h, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity (Promega, Madison, WI). The presence of Csk in rafts, together with the observation that Csk association with these membrane microdomains is regulated upon T cell activation via dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp (22Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), suggest that Csk maintains a certain level of tonic inhibition of Src kinases, which is released during perturbation of the TCR. To address in more detail the level of inhibition by Csk, we first examined the kinetics of Csk dissociation and re-association with rafts. Purified T cells were stimulated by cross-ligation of the TCR/CD3, and samples were taken out at different time points, lysed, and subjected to lipid raft purification. In lipid rafts prepared from resting T cells (0 min), we observed tyrosine-phosphorylated PAG/Cbp and Lck (Fig.1 A) as well as Csk (Fig.1 B). The identity of PAG/Cbp was established based on mobility, localization, immunoreactivity, and Csk SH2-association (Fig.1, B–D). Upon T cell activation, we observed dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp and phosphorylation of LAT at 2 min, whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated PAG/Cbp reappeared at 5 min (Fig.1 A). The kinetics of Csk association was assessed by analysis of fractions containing lipid rafts (numbers 3 and 4 pooled) at the different time points. Fig. 1 B shows that whereas the amounts of PAG/Cbp remained constant, the majority of Csk was dissociated at 2 min following cross-ligation of the TCR/CD3 at the same time as dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp occurred. However, concurrently with PAG/Cbp rephosphorylation, Csk rapidly reassociated with lipid rafts and was present with increasing levels at 5 and 10 min following activation. As expected, PLCγ1 was recruited to rafts upon activation, whereas the amount of LAT in rafts did not appear to be regulated. Apparent minor differences in immunoreactive LAT levels at 2 min can be explained by the reduced ability of the anti-LAT antibody to recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT (confer phospho-LAT blot in Fig. 1 B), as previously observed with this antibody (33Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Expression of Csk mutants lacking the kinase domain or with a kinase-dead mutation (K222R) (30Cloutier J.F. Chow L.M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and with functional or deficient SH2 (wt, R107K or S109C (30Cloutier J.F. Chow L.M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Arbet-Engels C. Tartare-Deckert S. Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5422-5428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)) and SH3 domains (wt, W47A (32Holdorf A.D. Green J.M. Levin S.D. Denny M.F. Straus D.B. Link V. Changelian P.S. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2 A) show that a minor, but clearly detectable, fraction of Csk proteins with an intact SH2 domain (either full-length Csk-wt, Csk-K222R, or truncated Csk-SH3-SH2) are targeted to lipid rafts (Fig. 2, B andD). In contrast, mutation of critical residues for SH2 function (Arg107, Ser109) reduces raft localization. Furthermore, in far-Western analysis, PAG expressed in COS cells only interacted with wild type Csk or recombinant Csk SH2 domain when cotransfected with Fyn, indicating that the Csk SH2 domain requires a phosphotyrosine in PAG/Cbp for interaction (Fig.2 C, see also Fig. 1 D). These observations support the notion that targeting of Csk to rafts is mediated only via interaction of the Csk SH2 domain with phospho-PAG/Cbp. Therefore, we next expressed the truncated Csk-SH3-SH2 or Csk-SH3(W47A)-SH2 at higher levels, which showed that these mutant proteins could compete out endogenous Csk from the lipid rafts (Fig. 2 D). Presumably, displacement of wild type Csk occurs by saturating the SH2-binding phospho-Tyr317 in human PAG/Cbp, since the majority of the mutant Csk was in the soluble fractions numbers 7–12 (not shown). The soluble pool of wild type Csk (fractions numbers 7–12, data not shown) was only slightly affected by overexpression of mutant Csk, since the displaced, raft-associated pool is less than 5% of the total Csk (Ref.34Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Taskén K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar and Fig. 2 B). To assess the significance of the lipid raft-associated pool of Csk, we next examined the effect of overexpression of the truncated Csk (Csk-SH3(W47A)-SH2) with intact SH2 domain on proximal T cell activation in Jurkat T cells (Fig.3 A). Whereas activation of vector-transfected cells by anti-CD3 antibody leads to a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR ζ-chain and LAT, the level of phosphorylation of both molecules was higher and more sustained in cells overexpressing mutant Csk. Furthermore, basal levels of ζ-chain phosphorylation were elevated in resting Csk-SH3(W47A)-SH2-expressing cells (Fig. 3, A andB). Similar effects on TCR-induced ζ-chain phosphorylation were observed with other Csk mutants (Csk-K222R and Csk-SH3-SH2) being able to displace endogenous Csk from lipid rafts (data not shown). To address the basal level of ζ-chain phosphorylation in more detail without background from nontransfected cells, JCaM1 Jurkat cells with defective Lck were transfected with increasing amounts of Csk-SH3-SH2 together with wild type Lck or empty vector. Phosphorylation of the ζ-chain could then be induced by anti-CD3 antibody in the Lck-transfected cells (not shown). In resting cells, ζ-chain phosphorylation was absent in cells transfected with Lck alone ((Fig.3 C, fourth lane) but strongly induced by expression of increasing amounts of Csk-SH3-SH2 (fifth and sixth lanes), whereas no such effect was seen in the absence of Lck (first, second, and third lanes). To assess downstream T cell activation events with relevance to T cell function, Jurkat T cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter directed by the proximal IL-2 promoter containing the NFAT and AP1 response elements together with constructs directing expression of various Csk mutants (Fig. 3 D). Cells transfected with empty vector displayed low basal levels of NFAT-AP1 reporter activity and a TCR-induced increase in activity, while overexpression of wild-type Csk, as expected, completely abolished reporter activity. In contrast, cells transfected with constructs directing expression of Csk mutants with an intact SH2 domain (Csk-K222R, Csk-SH3-SH2, or Csk-SH3(W47A)-SH2), and with the capacity to displace endogenous Csk from lipid rafts, exhibited severalfold elevated levels of NFAT-AP1 reporter activity in the absence of TCR stimulation. In cells transfected with Csk-SH3-SH2 or Csk-SH3(W47A)-SH2, stimulation through TCR activated the NFAT-AP1 reporter to higher total levels, although the elevated basal levels reduced the relative effect of TCR stimulation. Surprisingly, cells transfected with Csk-K222R in three independent experiments displayed no induction in reporter activity upon TCR stimulation, although basal levels were substantially increased. It may be speculated that mutated full-length Csk has a better conformation of the SH3 domain, which interacts more strongly with other proteins (e.g. PEP). In contrast, the Csk-SH3(W47A)-SH2 that does not recruit tyrosine phosphatases gave strong TCR-mediated activation (W47A > SH3-SH2 > K222R). Alternatively, the increased basal level but lack of further stimulation through TCR observed with the Csk-K222R mutation in the ATP binding site may be due to substrate trapping (i.e. Lck is sequestered) or due to other Csk kinase domain interaction partners. Transfection of constructs with mutated SH2 domains (Csk-SH3-SH2(R107K) and Csk-SH3-SH2(S109C)) gave NFAT-AP1 reporter activities that were significantly lower than those of the Csk-SH3-SH2 construct but higher than basal levels. This is probably due to the presence of residual phosphotyrosine binding capacity related to these mutants (Fig.2 D and Refs. 30Cloutier J.F. Chow L.M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and 31Arbet-Engels C. Tartare-Deckert S. Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5422-5428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Unlike Src family PTKs, Csk does not have a C-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation site and therefore cannot be suppressed by the intramolecular “tail-bite” mechanism that is characteristic for Src-like kinases (35Mustelin T. Src Family Tyrosine Kinases in Leukocytes. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-155Google Scholar). Indeed, it appears that Csk is constitutively active and exerts a tonic suppression of the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn in the lipid rafts of resting T cells (Fig.4, left panel). Such basal levels of inhibition appear to set the threshold for T cell activation to prevent an aberrant immune response (20Mustelin T. Burn P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the presence of this tonic negative regulation, T cell activation requires two independent early steps: 1) initiation of activating pathways and 2) release from inhibition. A molecular mechanism for the latter is apparently provided by the TCR-induced, specific, and rapid dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp, resulting in dissociation of Csk from the lipid rafts where Lck and Fyn reside (22Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, middle panel). This allows a stronger and prolonged activation of Lck and Fyn and an improved TCR signaling. However, the relief is only temporary in that PAG/Cbp is again phosphorylated after several minutes and recruits Csk back to the lipid raft environment, where it can suppress the Src family PTKs (Fig. 4,right panel). If PAG/Cbp is phosphorylated by Lck and/or Fyn as proposed (22Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), this mechanism is a classical negative feedback loop that would limit the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates for Lck and Fyn. Our observations (Ref. 22Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar and this paper) imply that a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) responds to TCR ligation by dephosphorylating PAG/Cbp. This so far unidentified enzyme may also be present in lipid rafts. Dephosphorylation apparently occurs at all major physiological tyrosine phosphorylation sites as shown by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. One candidate for the PTPase that removes phosphate from PAG/Cbp is CD45, which also directly activates Lck and Fyn (36Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6302-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). However, unpublished data 2B. Schraven, unpublished data. show that PAG/Cbp dephosphorylation also occurs in the CD45-deficient J45.01 Jurkat T cells (22Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The phosphatase PEP, which can be complexed with Csk through binding to its SH3 domain (37Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), is another obvious candidate. PEP may also contribute to tonic inhibition of Lck and Fyn by dephosphorylating the positive regulatory phosphotyrosines in Lck (Tyr394) (7Gjorloff-Wingren A. Saxena M. Williams S. Hammi D. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3845-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and Fyn-T (Tyr416) (8Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Release of Csk from rafts would in addition remove the associated PEP and thereby improve the phosphorylation of Lck and Fyn at their activating sites. Overexpression of Csk-SH3(W47A)-SH2, which should not bind PEP due to mutation of the SH3 domain, affected NFAT-AP-1 activation more strongly than expression of Csk-SH3-SH2, suggesting a role for PEP or other interaction partners in lipid rafts. Nevertheless, the constitutive promoter activation in cells expressing either of these mutants indicates the important role of Csk in repression of the Src kinases in resting T cells. In conclusion, we show that Csk localized to lipid rafts via its SH2 domain is constitutively inhibiting T cell activation. When T cells are activated through the TCR, Csk rapidly dissociates from lipid rafts leading to release from inhibition. Shortly thereafter, Csk reassociates, which contributes to shutting down the TCR signaling. Csk thus functions as a regulatory gatekeeper for T cell activation.

It is not known how ATM phosphorylation activates hCds1 function and whether the phosphorylation is linked to the FHA. Here, we demonstrate that the hCds1-FHA domain is essential for Thr68phosphorylation. Thr68 phosphorylation, in turn, is required for ionizing radiation-induced autophosphorylation of two amino acid residues in hCds1, Thr383 and Thr387. These two amino acid residues, located in the activation loop of hCds1, are conserved in hCds1-related kinases and are essential for hCds1 activity. Thus, the hCds1-FHA domain mediates a chain of phosphorylation events on hCds1, which includes phosphorylation by ATM and hCds1 autophosphorylation, in response to DNA damage. hCds1 (Chk2) (1Matsuoka S.

Sci. 1995; 20: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), which appears to be important for integrating the DNA damage signal. It is not known how ATM phosphorylation activates hCds1 function and whether the phosphorylation is linked to the FHA. Here, we demonstrate that the hCds1-FHA domain is essential for Thr68phosphorylation. Thr68 phosphorylation, in turn, is required for ionizing radiation-induced autophosphorylation of two amino acid residues in hCds1, Thr383 and Thr387. These two amino acid residues, located in the activation loop of hCds1, are conserved in hCds1-related kinases and are essential for hCds1 activity. Thus, the hCds1-FHA domain mediates a chain of phosphorylation events on hCds1, which includes phosphorylation by ATM and hCds1 autophosphorylation, in response to DNA damage. ataxia telangiectasia-mutated ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related green fluorescent protein glutathioneS-transferase ionizing radiation gray DNA damage activates a signal cascade that causes a cell cycle arrest to allow cells to repair damage before progressing further in the cell cycle. In eukaryotes, disruption of this signal cascade can lead to genomic instability, which in mammals can lead to cancer (11Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar). Therefore, the DNA damage signal cascade and the proteins participating in this signal cascade are immensely important to understanding cancer and to finding effective treatments for cancer. Two groups of kinases play a key role in the DNA damage signal cascade: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)1 (5Savitsky K. Sfez S. Tagle D.A. Ziv Y.

Piwnica-Worms H. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 197-208PubMed Google Scholar), which inhibits the ability of Cdc25C to activate Cdc2. In addition to being a regulator of tumor suppressors, hCds1 may be a tumor suppressor itself. hCds1 is mutated in a variant form of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a highly penetrant familial cancer syndrome that is more commonly associated with inherited mutations in the p53 gene (18Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2528-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Being linked with a syndrome classically associated with p53 mutation may be an indication that hCds1 is a tumor suppressor that functions in the same pathway as p53. This notion is supported by the observation that hCds1 phosphorylates Ser20 of TP53 and stabilizes it in response to DNA damage (14Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). If hCds1 is indeed a tumor suppressor, it is surprising that the hCds1 mutation is so rare in cancers (one heterozygotic mutation in 49 cancers studied) (18Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2528-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). One explanation may be that the high frequency of the p53 mutation or destabilization may obviate the need for the hCds1 mutation. Activation of hCds1 in response to ionizing radiation (IR) requires phosphorylation of Thr68 of hCds1 by ATM (7Zhou B.B. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), may phosphorylate Thr68 in response to replication block. It is not known how hCds1 is activated by phosphorylation of its Thr68. hCds1 and hCds1-related kinases contain a domain called the FHA (forkhead-associated) domain. The FHA domain is a phospho-specific protein-protein interaction motif (21Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar,22Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In Rad53, the Cds1-homologue in budding yeast, the FHA domains integrate the DNA damage signal by coupling with phosphorylated Rad9. The FHA domain is found in proteins of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (10Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Most of FHA-containing proteins in eukaryotes are nuclear, and many have been linked to the regulation of DNA damage repair, cell cycle, and transcription. In addition to hCds1 and hCds1-related kinases, other well known FHA-containing proteins include the DNA repair protein Nbs1, which is mutated in the ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome called the Nijmegan breakage syndrome (23Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates III, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) and Chfr1 (24Scolnick D.M. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2000; 406: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), a mitotic checkpoint protein that is mutated in many cancers. At least in Rad53, it is clear that the FHA domain plays a crucial role in responding to the DNA damage signal, but it is not known how the signal transmitted through the FHA domain activates Rad53 or other FHA domain-containing proteins. It is also not known how the phosphorylation of Thr68 by ATM or ATR activates hCds1 and whether Thr68 phosphorylation is linked to the FHA domain. In this report, we investigated the mechanistic role of the FHA domain and Thr68 phosphorylation in transmitting the DNA damage signal to hCds1. Our results indicate that the hCds1-FHA domain is essential for initiating a chain of phosphorylation events on hCds1 that activate hCds1 in response to DNA damage. The hCds1-FHA domain is essential for Thr68 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage. Thr68 phosphorylation, in turn, is necessary for autophosphorylation of two amino acid residues in the activation loop of hCds1 that are essential for its activity, Thr383 and Thr387. The mammalian expression vector for hCds1 (V5-hCds1) was made by inserting hCds1 cDNAEcoRI/PvuII fragment (nucleotides −27 to +1609) into EcoRI/NotI sites of pcDNA6A (Invitrogen). The kinase-dead version of hCds1 construct was made by substituting the hCds1 cDNA fragment (−27 to +1411) with a fragment containing the K249R mutation. Site-specific mutagenesis of the other mutations was performed using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used have the following sequences with the lowercase letters indicating mutations, 5′-CATACAGCAAGAAACACTTTtGGATcTTCAGGGAAGTGG-3′ (CL78) for R145W, 5′-GACCTCTCTCATGAGAgCtTTATGTGGAACCCC-3′ (CL61) for T383A, 5′-GAACCTTATGTGGAgCtCCCACCTACTTGG-3′ (CL74) for T387A, and 5′-CCTTAGAGACcGTGTCCgCTCAGGAACTCTATTCTATTCC-3′ (CK10), for T68A. The construct for the expression of GST-hCds1 inSchizosaccharomyces pombe has been described previously (3Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The R145W mutation was introduced to this vector by site-specific mutagenesis. For bacterial expression of GST-hCds1,EcoRI/XhoI fragment of hCds1 was inserted intoBamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in frame. GST-tagged hCds1 was purified from yeast as described previously (3Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacterial expression of GST-hCds1 was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. GST-hCds1 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for kinase reaction. The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 15 min in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 µm ATP, and 1 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; AA0068) with 2 µg of GST-Cdc25C (200) (25Ogg S. Gabrielli B. Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30461-30469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as substrate. 293T cells were transfected with hCds1 expression constructs using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). The cell lysates were prepared 1–2 days after transfection as described previously (3Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

V5-tagged hCds1 was immunoprecipitated with 0.2 µl of anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and 5 µl of protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 150 µl of total volume for 1 h at 4 °C after preclearing the lysate with 5 µl of protein A-agarose. After washing beads with the lysis buffer (3Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antibodies to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled phosphopeptides were obtained and purified as described previously (13Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Endogenous hCds1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-hCds1 antibody (3Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N.

V5-tagged hCds1 was expressed in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody. Immunoprecipitated hCds1 was electrophoresed on an 8% Tris-Glycine gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. Immunoblotting was performed with phospho-specific antibody (1:100 dilution) that had been preadsorbed with 1 mg of 293T cell lysate in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. To determine the total amount of hCds1, immunoblotting was performed with anti-hCds1 or anti-V5-HRP antibody (Invitrogen) after stripping the filter. U2OS cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 0.5 µg of V5-hCds1 (wild type and mutants) and 50 ng of pEGFP-F(CLONTECH) using the Effectene reagent. After 24 h, cells were treated with ionizing radiation (5 Gy) and incubated for 14 h. The cells were trypsinized, fixed with 70% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 4 °C, and treated with 1 mg/ml propidium iodide and 0.4 mg/ml RNase A in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature. The percentage of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. We examined the role of the hCds1-FHA domain on hCds1 activity by investigating naturally occurring FHA domain mutations (Fig. 1). Two hCds1-FHA mutations have been described: Arg145 → Trp (R145W) in colon cancer cell line HCT15 and Ile157 → Thr (I157T) in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome-variant MGH005 (18Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2528-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, the R145W mutation abolished the IR-induced activity of transiently expressed hCds1. The I157T mutation did not significantly affect hCds1 activity (data not shown). The R145W mutation may inhibit hCds1 activity either by directly decreasing the kinase activity of hCds1 or by disrupting the transmission of the activating signal to hCds1. We found that the R145W mutation decreased the activity of recombinant hCds1 by less than 50%, suggesting that the FHA domain is more likely to function in responding to the activation signal (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2The FHA domain is important for ATM phosphorylation of hCds1. A, V5-tagged hCds1 transiently expressed in 293T cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody 1 h after IR (+, 5 Gy) or no treatment (−), and the kinase reaction was performed with GST-Cdc25C as substrate.KD, kinase-dead; R145W, FHA domain mutation; WT, wild type.

D, V5-tagged hCds1 transiently expressed in 293T cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody 1 h after IR (+, 5 Gy) or no treatment (−) and electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation level of Thr68 (top panel) was determined by immunoblotting with antibody specific for phosphorylated Thr68 (T68-P).

A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). To determine whether the FHA domain (amino acids 114–195) is important for Thr68 phosphorylation by ATM, we examined Thr68 phosphorylation after IR in the R145W mutant. Consistent with previous observations (8Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 9Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), Thr68 phosphorylation was important for hCds1 activity (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, Thr68 phosphorylation was abolished in the R145W mutant (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that the FHA domain is essential for ATM phosphorylation of hCds1 in response to IR. Deletions (21 and 42 amino acids) of the FHA domain that span Arg145 had similar effects as the R145W mutation (data not shown). Because a stable interaction between ATM and hCds1 was not seen, we have not been able to determine whether the FHA domain mediates Thr68 phosphorylation by directly recruiting ATM to hCds1. Some kinases are activated by phosphorylation of residues in the activation loop of the kinase, and hCds1 may be one of these. According to structural analyses, kinases that are activated by phosphorylation of the activation loop have Thr/Tyr in the position corresponding to Thr383 of hCds1 (reviewed in Ref. 27Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Kinases such as Chk1, which are not regulated by activation loop phosphorylation, have other residues in this position (28Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that phosphorylated residues in the activation loop align in a specific manner with catalytic loop residues resulting in a conformation favorable for the phosphate transfer (27Johnson L.N.

To determine whether hCds1 is regulated by phosphorylation of its activation loop, we compared the amino sequence of the activation loop of hCds1-related kinases (Fig. 3) and found that Thr383 and Thr387 of hCds1 were conserved among them. Using antibodies specific for phosphorylated Thr383 and Thr387, we were able to show that Thr383 and Thr387 in endogenous hCds1 were phosphorylated in response to IR (Fig.4 A). Because the sensitivity of these phosphopeptide antibodies was low, there was high background in our immunoblots. However, the IR-induced phosphorylation of Thr383 and Thr387 was consistently observable.Figure 4The hCds1 activation loop is phosphorylated in response to IR. A, phosphorylation of Thr383 and Thr387 in endogenous hCds1 from 293T cells was visualized 1 h after IR (+, 5 Gy) or no treatment (−) by immunoblotting with antibody specific for phosphorylated Thr383 (T383-P, top panel) and Thr387 (T387-P, middle panel). The total amount of endogenous hCds1, as detected with an affinity purified hCds1 antibody, is shown in the bottom panel. B, the kinase activity of transiently expressed V5-hCds1 containing T383A or T387A mutations was compared with the activity of the wild type (WT) and kinase-dead (KD) V5-hCds1 1 h after IR (+, 5 Gy) or no treatment (−) as in Fig. 2 A. C, the ability of hCds1 to induce G1 checkpoint. hCds1 (wild type, T68A, and T387A) and GFP were transiently co-expressed in U2OS cells for 24 h before being treated with 5 Gy of IR. 14 h after IR, the percentage of the hCds1-expressing (GFP-positive) (white bar) and untransfected (GFP-negative) (black bar) cells in G1 was determined by flow cytometry.

We also determined the effect of the mutations described above on the ability of hCds1 to trigger G1checkpoint after IR in U2OS cells (Fig. 4 C). As expected from Fig. 4 B, the T387A mutation also abolished the ability of hCds1 to trigger a G1 checkpoint. Unfortunately, we were not able to perform this study for hCds1 with the R145W mutation because it was expressed very poorly in U2OS cells. To determine whether the FHA domain and ATM phosphorylation of Thr68 are important for phosphorylation of Thr383 and Thr387, we examined the phosphorylation status of Thr383 and Thr387 in R145W and T68A mutant proteins. The FHA domain and Thr68were found to be important for phosphorylation of Thr383and Thr387 because Thr383 and Thr387 were not phosphorylated in the R145W or the T68A mutant after IR (Fig. 5 A). Consistent with this, phosphorylation of Thr383 and Thr387 after IR did not occur in ATM-mutated cells (Fig.5 B). On the other hand, phosphorylation of Thr68did not require Thr383 (Fig. 5 C) or Thr387 (data not shown). This suggests that ATM phosphorylation of Thr68 is required for the subsequent phosphorylation of Thr383 and Thr387 in vivo. Because phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases such as ATM and ATR phosphorylate Ser/Thr followed by a Gln residue (31O'Neill T. Dwyer A.J. Ziv Y. Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Abraham R.H. Lai J.H.

Another possibility is that they are autophosphorylated. Many kinases, including protein kinase A, are activated by autophosphorylation in the activation loop (reviewed in Ref. 27Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). To determine whether Thr383 and Thr387 of hCds1 are autophosphorylated, we examined the phosphorylation status of these two residues in transiently expressed kinase-dead hCds1 after IR. As shown in Fig.6 A, Thr383 and Thr387 were not phosphorylated in kinase-dead hCds1. Furthermore, Thr383 and Thr387 were found to be phosphorylated in bacterially expressed hCds1 but not kinase-dead hCds1 or mutant hCds1 (T383A or T387A) (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that hCds1 autophosphorylates the activation loop residues. To determine whether Thr383 and Thr387 were essential for the intrinsic kinase activity of hCds1, we compared the kinase activities of recombinant wild type hCds1 and T383A and T387A mutant proteins. As shown in Fig. 6 C, there was no detectable kinase activity in T383A and T387A mutants, suggesting that autophosphorylation of these two threonine residues may be essential for the kinase activity of hCds1. The work described in this report indicates that the FHA domain plays a central role in initiating a chain of phosphorylation events on hCds1 that stimulates the kinase activity of hCds1 in response to DNA damage (Fig. 6 D). The first phosphorylation step that is dependent on the FHA domain occurs at Thr68 by ATM kinase, which is activated by double-stranded DNA breaks. The exact role that the FHA domain plays in ATM phoshorylation of hCds1 is not known. Phosphorylation of Thr68, in turn, is then required for hCds1 autophosphorylation in vivo, which appears to be necessary for its activity. How Thr68 phosphorylation causes autophosphorylation of hCds1 is currently under investigation. Based on the findings presented here, we speculate that the tumors that carry an FHA domain mutation (e.g. HCT15) may have risen partly as a result of the failure to initiate the chain of hCds1 phosphorylation events described here. As a consequence, the hCds1-dependent processes such as DNA damage response, checkpoint, and apoptosis may have been compromised during tumor formation.

Single or combined substitutions of the three cysteines (Cys-321, Cys-323, and Cys-324) or incubation of wild-type CCR5-transfected cells with the palmitic acid analog 2-bromopalmitate prevented palmitoylation of the receptor. Moreover, failure of CCR5 to be palmitoylated resulted in both accumulation in intracellular stores and a profound decrease of membrane expression of the receptor. Upon metabolic labeling, kinetic experiments showed that the half-life of palmitoylation-deficient CCR5 is profoundly decreased. Bafilomycin A1, but not a specific proteasome inhibitor, prevented early degradation of palmitoylation-deficient CCR5 and promoted its accumulation in lysosomal compartments. Although membrane expression of the CCR5 mutant was diminished, the molecules reaching the membrane were still able to interact efficiently with the chemokine ligand MIP1β and remained able to function as HIV co-receptors. Thus we conclude that palmitoylation controls CCR5 expression through regulation of the life span of this receptor.

A glycosylated extracellular amino-terminal domain and a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain complete the structure of this superfamily of proteins, which transduces signals from a large and disparate number of extracellular ligands (1Ji T.H.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Among GPCRs, chemokine receptors mediate the biological effects of chemokines that are structurally related to pro-inflammatory cytokines and are primarily involved in the control of constitutive and pathological migration of leukocytes (4Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2399) Google Scholar, 5Thelen M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). However, a rapidly growing body of evidence shows that functions of chemokine receptors are not limited to locomotion and extends to a vast array of immune responses, organ and tissue development, as well as the pathogenesis of inflammatory, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases (6Murphy P.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 7Moser B. Loetscher P. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Two of these chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, have been identified as co-receptors that allow efficient entry of HIV into CD4+ host cells (8Littman D.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Upon binding to CD4, the interaction of HIV isolates with CXCR4 or CCR5 (X4 and R5 isolates, respectively) relies on the structure of the HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein, gp120 subunit. The binding of the HIV Env complex (gp120/gp41 subunits) to the receptors CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5 initiate conformational changes in the gp120/gp41 oligomer, leading to membrane fusion and, ultimately, internalization of the viral capsid into the host cell (9Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Science. 1998; 280: 1884-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 10Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev.

Identification of a CCR5 gene polymorphism results in expression of severely truncated molecules that fail to reach the cell surface and render individuals highly resistant to viral infection (15Samson M.

This pointed to the essential role of this chemokine receptor in HIV-1 entry. It has been shown that functional interaction of CCR5 with its natural ligands or with HIV Env involves preferentially the first two extracellular loops of the receptor, as well as the amino-terminal domain (18Rucker J. Samson M. Doranz B.J. Libert F. Berson J.F. Yi Y. Smyth R.J. Collman R.G. Broder C.C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M.

Besides this structural role, it has been postulated that CCR5-mediated signal transduction upon binding of the viral Env is required for infection by R5 isolates. However, when overexpressed, ectopic CCR5 molecules that cannot support agonist-dependent signaling or undergo endocytosis still exhibit an HIV co-receptor function (20Alkhatib G. Locati M. Kennedy P.E. Murphy P.M. Berger E.A. Virology. 1997; 234: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 21Gosling J. Monteclaro F.S. Atchison R.E. Arai H. Tsou C.L. Goldsmith M.A. Charo I.F.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In contrast, a more relevant biological system using primary T lymphocytes showed that inhibition of Gαi or specific desensitization of CCR5 prevents replication of R5 isolates in these cells (24Alfano M. Schmidtmayerova H. Amella C.A. Pushkarsky T. Bukrinsky M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Alfano M. Pushkarsky T. Poli G. Bukrinsky M. J.

Commun. 1999; 256: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the participation of CCR5-dependent signaling in HIV infection remains controversial (10Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). This situation is especially unclear because other aspects of CCR5 biology that may influence the capacity of the receptor to transduce signals have not been investigated. Such is the case of palmitoylation, which occurs at cysteine residues located at the boundary of the seventh transmembrane domain with the cytoplasmic tail of many GPCRs (27Morello J.P. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The rhodopsin receptor was the first GPCR for which palmitoylation was demonstrated (28Ovchinnikov Yu A. Abdulaev N.G. Bogachuk A.S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 29O'Brien P.J. Zatz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5054-5057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that this post-translational modification may lead to structural changes of the cytoplasmic tail and promote the formation of a fourth cytoplasmic loop that could influence GPCR function (30Moench S.J. Moreland J. Stewart D.H. Dewey T.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5791-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This thioesterification of cysteine residues by palmitate is distinct from other lipid modifications, such as prenylation and myristoylation, by its reversibility and its dynamic regulation (31Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation is particularly prevalent among soluble proteins implicated in cell adhesion, growth, and signaling, allowing their attachment to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane (32Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, in the case of transmembrane receptors, the high frequency of cysteine residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of many GPCRs is suggestive of an additional role for this type of modification. Palmitoylation of GPCRs has been found to cover a broad spectrum of biological activities (33Bouvier M. Loisel T.P. Hebert T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), including G-protein coupling efficiency (34O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, palmitoylation has been shown to regulate intracellular trafficking of some GPCRs (42Kawate N. Menon K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30651-30658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sadeghi H.M. Innamorati G. Dagarag M. Birnbaumer M. Mol.

Namba H. Yamashita S. Niwa M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although palmitoylation of GPCRs is well conserved, its biological role varies from one member of the superfamily to another, and a general model cannot be proposed. This applies especially to chemokine receptors, because palmitoylation of no member of this particular family has been investigated. The present study was undertaken to examine whether the three cysteine residues present in the carboxyl-terminal tail of CCR5 undergo palmitoylation. The possible functional role of this lipid modification in the stability of the receptor, its proper membrane expression, and its capacity to interact with its natural and viral ligands were assessed. Parental HeLa cells or indicator HeLa CD4LTRLacZ (46Dragic T. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2355-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HEK-293T human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing large T antigen were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. Cells in exponential growth were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE plus (Life Technologies, Inc.; HeLa) and the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (HEK-293T). All transfections (1 × 106 cells) were done with 1 µg of DNA, except when indicated otherwise. Mutagenesis of the plasmid encoding WT CCR5 cDNA cloned into pcDNA3was done to replace CCR5 cysteine residues at positions 321, 323, and 324 of the carboxyl-terminal tail by overlap extension using T7, Sp6, and two internal primers containing the mutation (47Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The forward primer used to mutate the three cysteines, either separately (simple mutation) or together (double and triple mutations), to alanine residues (Cys to Ala) wasX 1 X 2 X 3AAAY 1 Y 2 Y 3 Z 1 Z 2 Z 3TCTATTTTCCAGCAAGAGGCTCCCGAG, whereX 1 X 2 X 3(Cys-321),Y 1 Y 2 Y 3(Cys-323), andZ 1 Z 2 Z 3(Cys-324) correspond in the WT sequences to TGC, TGC, and TGT, respectively, and to GCC, GCC, and GCT when the cysteine residue was substituted by an alanine. The reverse primer sequence used wasX 4 X 5 X 6 Y 4 Y 5 Y 6TTTZ 4 Z 5 Z 6GAAGCGTTTGGCAATGTGCTTTTGGAA, whereX 4 X 5 X 6,Y 4 Y 5 Y 6, andZ 4 Z 5 Z 6were ACA, GCA, and GCA, respectively, in the WT and AGC, GGC, and GGC when the cysteine residue was substituted by an alanine. For serine replacement, (Cys to Ser) WT codons in each position were substituted by AGC, AGC, and AGT on the forward primer and by ACT, GCT, and GCT on the reverse primer. cDNA mutants were confirmed by sequence analysis. Prior to use, [1-14C]palmitic acid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was dried under vacuum and solubilized in Me2SO. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered buffer (PBS) and exposed for 3 h either to DMEM medium containing 8% dialyzed FCS and [14C]palmitate (100 µCi/ml) or to methionine (Met)-free DMEM medium (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) containing 8% dialyzed FCS and [35S]Met (100 µCi/ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For pulse-chase experiments, after metabolic labeling, cells were washed twice and cultured for the indicated time in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (chase). For Western blot experiments, cells were lysed in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100. Immunoblotting was performed using an anti-human CCR5 monoclonal antibody, MC-5 (48Segerer S. Mac K.M. Regele H. Kerjaschki D. Schlondorff D. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 52-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Simultaneous detection of β-tubulin or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was performed using monoclonal (BD PharMingen) or polyclonal (Interchim) antibodies, respectively. Immobilized antigen-antibody complexes were detected with secondary anti-species IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Pierce) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Acquisition and quantification of chemiluminescence signals were done using a LAS-1000+ apparatus (Fuji). For immunoprecipitation, after labeling with [35S]Met or [14C]palmitate, cells were lysed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 10% glycerol, 1% Cymal-5 (Anatrace)), as previously described (49Mirzabekov T.

After removing insoluble material, 1 mg of lysate was incubated with 2 µg of anti-CCR5 antibody 2D7 (19Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N. Chen H. Humblias J. Samson M.

Immunoprecipitates collected by centrifugation were electrophoresed directly on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) at 4 °C. After migration, [14C]palmitate and [35S]Met gels were first fixed in methanol/acetic acid/H2O (5:1:4, v/v) for 30 min, then in NAMP 100 Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at room temperature before being dried and exposed for 3 days to 1 month (35S and14C labeling, respectively). For quantification analysis, gels were recorded with a digital imaging system and computer-generated images were analyzed to obtain densitometric values (PhosphorImager 2850, Molecular Dynamics program). Statistical analysis was performed using the Spearman test for correlation between incorporation of [14C]palmitate and CCR5 expression. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. CCR5-transfected HeLa (1 × 105) cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well plates and stained by indirect immunofluorescence 24 h later. Cholera toxin (CTx) is pentavalent for ganglioside GM1 and causes formation of clusters of five GM1 molecules (50Merritt E.A. Sarfaty S. van den Akker F. L'Hoir C. Martial J.A. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated CTx (5 µg/ml, Sigma Chemical Co.) was applied to transfected cells for 30 min at 4 °C and removed by one wash in RPMI containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 20 mm Hepes. Anti-CTx monoclonal antibody (1/150 dilution, Sigma) was applied to the cells for 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were washed in PBS containing 0.5% BSA (blocking buffer), and indirect immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (51Renard P.

Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and, when indicated, permeabilized by incubation in blocking buffer containing 0.05% saponin. Specific antibodies (anti-CCR5 antibody 2D7 and anti-Lamp1 (PharMingen)) were applied for 1 h, and cells were washed in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h with Texas Red- or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/300 dilution, Southern Biotech Corp.). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst). Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis was performed on a Leica TCS64D instrument using an X63 oil immersion PL APO objective. To determine cell surface expression of mutants CCR5 molecules, 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.1% γ globulin, 0.1% sodium azide for 10 min at room temperature before staining with anti-CCR5 PE-conjugated 2D7 antibody (PharMingen). After three washes, cells were maintained in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with WT CCR5 cDNA or triple Cys 1,2,3 mutant cDNA, were first incubated 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 5 milliunits/ml heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8) (Seikagaku Corp.) to cleave and remove from the cell surface heparan sulfate that could attach MIP1β nonspecifically. After two washes in cold PBS, cells were incubated in PBS containing 0.25 nm iodinated MIP1β (2200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and various concentrations of unlabeled MIP1β for 1 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 200 µl. Cell pellets were washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 µm unlabeled MIP1β. Cell pellet-associated radioactivity was counted using an LKB-Wallac computer-controlled, 1272 CliniGamma counter. Binding data were analyzed using GraphPrad Prism 2.0 software. Infectious HIV-1 particles were produced by transfecting HEK-293T cells with either nef-deleted R5 HIV-1 HIV-1JR-CSF-luc, which carries the firefly luciferase (luc) reporter gene instead of nef (a gift from V. Planelles, Rochester, NY), or the WT HIV-1YU2, proviral DNAs. For pseudotyped virus, HIV-1 pNL4–3-lucenvelope-deficient (env (−)) proviral DNA containing aluc reporter gene instead of nef was co-transfected with an HIV-Env-expressing vector, as previously described (52Planelles V. Bachelerie F. Jowett J.B. Haislip A. Xie Y. Banooni P. Masuda T. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5883-5889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Culture supernatants containing the infectious HIV particles were harvested 2 days after transfection, cleared of cellular debris by filtration through a 0.45-µm pore size filter, and concentrated by centrifugation through filters (Centricon Plus-20, cut-off (100.000 nominal molecular weight limit), Millipore). The amount of viral particles was estimated by measuring the HIV-1 Gagp24 antigen using a capture assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Target cells were infected for 2 h at 37 °C with the indicated amounts of Gagp24, then washed, harvested at the indicated times post-infection, and lysed for luciferase or β-galactosidase assays. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9501, Berthold), and results were expressed as relative luciferase units per microgram of cell lysates protein. Background signal was subtracted from the value obtained for each sample. β-Galactosidase measurement on total cell extracts was performed using a kit according to the manufacturers' instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). MIP1β (provided by F. Baleux, Institut Pasteur, Paris) was chemically synthesized by the Merrifield solid method on a fully automated peptide synthesizer (Pioneer, Perspective Biosystems, and PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The detailed procedure used for chemokine synthesis was described previously (53Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified chemokine was determined by amino acid analysis on a 6300 Beckman amino acid analyzer after hydrolysis for 20 h in 6n HCl and 0.2% phenol in the presence of a known amount of norleucine as an internal standard. All chemicals for the synthesis were purchased from Perspective Biosystems and PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bafilomycin A1 (Sigma-Aldrich), ALLN (Sigma-Aldrich), or Z-LLL-H (provided by F. Baleux and previously described (51Renard P. Percherancier Y. Kroll M. Thomas D. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Bachelerie F. J. Biol.

Most GPCRs have conserved cysteine residues in their carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain that appear in many cases to be covalently attached to palmitate (27Morello J.P. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although palmitoylation of chemokine receptors has not been reported, the presence of a cluster of cysteine residues (Cys-321, Cys-323, and Cys-324) located at the boundary of the cytoplasm with the seventh transmembrane domain of CCR5 (Fig.1A) raises the possibility that these residues are palmitoylated and influence receptor functions. To test this prediction, HEK-293T cells lacking endogenous CCR5 expression were transiently transfected with a human CCR5 cDNA and metabolically labeled with [14C]palmitate. Thereafter, CCR5 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by a monoclonal anti-CCR5 antibody (2D7), which recognizes an epitope in the second extracellular domain of the receptor (19Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N. Chen H. Humblias J. Samson M. Parmentier M. Moore J.P. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic separation of immunoprecipitated material allowed identification of a single band that migrates with the mobility and apparent molecular weight of CCR5 (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Western blot analysis of the same samples confirmed the identity of the protein visualized in radioactive gels (Fig.3A).Figure 3Steady-state levels and cell surface expression of palmitoylation-deficient CCR5 mutants. HEK-293T cells were transfected with CCR5 cDNAs. A, 30 µg of total cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotted with anti-CCR5 and anti-LDH antibodies.

D, linear regression between the mean fluorescence intensity of CCR5 protein cell surface expression (data represent the mean of six independent experiments) and the amplitude of [14C]palmitate incorporation relative to [35S]Met labeling.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the amino acid(s) modified by palmitoylation, the carboxyl-terminal Cys-321, Cys-323, or Cys-324 residues were substituted with Ala to generate single (CCR5 Cys 1, CCR5 Cys 2, and CCR5 Cys 3, respectively), double (CCR5 Cys 1,2; CCR5 Cys 1,3; and CCR5 Cys 2,3), or triple (CCR5 Cys 1,2,3) CCR5 mutant receptors (Fig.1 B). Following 3 h of [14C]palmitate labeling, single Cys to Ala mutants showed reduced incorporation of palmitate (Fig.2 A, upper panel, lanes 3–5) compared with the wild-type (WT) molecule, thus indicating that all three cysteine residues are modified by palmitoylation. The contribution of each cysteine to the bulk of palmitoylation shown by CCR5 was analyzed using parallel incorporation of [35S]Met by each CCR5 derivative for the same length of time (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) to normalize the corresponding values of palmitate labeling (Fig. 2 B). The preponderant role of a single cysteine in the palmitoylation of a GPCR has been described for the rhodopsin receptor, where modification of the first cysteine of the cytoplasmic tail was proposed to be a prerequisite for subsequent palmitoylation of the downstream cysteine residue (54Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, in the case of CCR5, based on the slight differences observed between the reduction of CCR5 palmitoylation upon mutation of each one of the three cysteines (50%, 35%, and 30% for Cys 1, Cys 2, and Cys 3 mutants, respectively), a predominant role cannot be attributed conclusively to the first cysteine residue. All mutants carrying combined substitutions of two cysteines (CCR5 Cys 1,2; CCR5 Cys 1,3; and CCR5 Cys 2,3) exhibited increased reduction of palmitoylation compared with single Cys to Ala mutants. Replacement of the three cysteines (CCR5 Cys 1,2,3) led to a profound decrease of palmitate incorporation (95% inhibition compared with WT labeling), thus indicating that the carboxyl-terminal Cys-321, Cys-323, and Cys-324 are the residues modified by palmitoylation in CCR5"

For lymphoid chromosomal translocations, misrecognition by the RAG (recombination activating gene) complex of V(D)J recombination is one contributing factor that has long been proposed. The chromosomal translocations involving LMO2 (t(11;14)(p13;q11)), Ttg-1 (t(11;14)(p15;q11)), and Hox11 (t(10;14)(q24;q11)) are among the clearest examples in which it appears that a D or J segment has synapsed with an adventitious heptamer/nonamer at a gene outside of one of the antigen receptor loci. The interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving SIL (SCL-interrupting locus)/SCL (stem cell leukemia) is a case involving two non-V(D)J sites that have been suggested to be V(D)J recombination mistakes. Here we have used our human extrachromosomal substrate assay to formally test the hypothesis that these regions are V(D)J recombination misrecognition sites and, more importantly, to quantify their efficiency as V(D)J recombination targets within the cell. We find that the LMO2 fragile site functions as a 12-signal at an efficiency that is only 27-fold lower than that of a consensus 12-signal. The Ttg-1 site functions as a 23-signal at an efficiency 530-fold lower than that of a consensus 23-signal. Hox11 failed to undergo recombination as a 12- or 23-signal and was at least 20,000-fold less efficient than consensus signals. SIL has been predicted to function as a 12-signal and SCL as a 23-signal. However, we find that SIL actually functions as a 23-signal. These results provide a formal demonstration that certain chromosomal fragile sites can serve as RAG complex targets, and they determine whether these sites function as 12- versus 23-signals.

The list of causes of chromosomal translocations and deletions is not yet fully established, but the following factors are thought to be included: ionizing radiation, free radicals, and enyzmes of DNA metabolism (polymerases, nucleases, and topoisomerases) (1Lieber M.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1323-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Lieber M.R.

In lymphoid cells, an additional cause is misrecognition by the RAG complex (5Croce C.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 6Lieber M.R. Kirsch I. The Causes and Consequences of Chromosomal Translocations. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 239-275Google Scholar, 7Rabbitts T.H. Boehm T. Kirsch I.R. The Causes and Consequences of Chromosomal Translocations. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 393-409Google Scholar). The normal function of the RAG1 complex is to initiate the breaks of V(D)J recombination at pairs of consensus heptamer/nonamer sequences in which one recombination signal has a 12-base pair (bp) spacer between the heptamer and nonamer (12-signal) and the other signal has a 23-bp spacer (23-signal). Misrecognition by the RAG complex has been speculated for numerous lymphoid chromosomal translocations; however, there have been minimal or no quantitative tests of this issue.All chromosomal deletions and reciprocal translocations require at least two double strand DNA breaks at separate chromosomal regions. In some of these cases, one of the breaks is at a known V, D, or J segment, making the cause of the break at this location clearly attributable to the RAG complex. However, the cause of the other break is often less certain. If the non-V(D)J site has a convincing heptamer/nonamer sequence and consistently occurs in many patients, then it is reasonable to conjecture that the RAG complex is responsible. However, even for V, D, and J elements, the heptamer and nonamer portions of the signal sequence vary from the consensus, which has the following configuration: [coding end]/CACAGTG- - -12 or 23 spacer- - -ACAAAAACC. The number of theoretically possible heptamer/nonamer signals is well over 109 variations, and fewer than 100 have been tested for their in vivo efficiency (8Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Mizuuchi K. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1053-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 9Akira S. Okazaki K. Sakano H. Science. 1987; 238: 1134-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10Ramsden D.A. Wu G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). None have been tested in human cells. The consensus heptamer/nonamer is thus far the most efficient sequence for directing V(D)J recombination. Given that such a small fraction of the total number of variants has been tested, the vast majority of variations from the consensus are uncharacterized as to how efficiently they can direct V(D)J recombination if at all. This makes predicting the V(D)J recombination potential of a chromosomal breakpoint site very uncertain, and many such breakpoints may turn out to be cleaved by a mechanism unrelated to V(D)J recombination. Hence, one can only be truly certain of the cause of the breakage if one can recapitulate it under experimental conditions. An additional advantage of this is that one can then quantify the frequency of the breakage, which provides very important information for evaluating these sites as breakpoints.Some events involve two chromosomal locations, neither of which is a V, D, or J segment. In these cases where the translocation or rearrangement involves two non-V(D)J sites, both are subject to causal uncertainty. It is conceivable that one or both of these breakage sites are caused by a mechanism other than V(D)J recombination. Again, consistent location adjacent to a near-consensus heptamer/nonamer sequence has been the only basis for suggesting the RAG complex. In cases in which the position varies and/or the adjacent sequences do not contain convincing heptamer/nonamer sequences, the cause of the break is even more ambiguous. Only experimental testing of such breakpoints can provide a reliable answer.The complexity of evaluating non-V(D)J breakage sites is increased because mechanistic studies of V(D)J recombination have been unable to define the frequency with which a non-RAG breakage site can recombine with a RAG breakage site. RAG biochemical studies have shown that double strand breaks caused by the RAG complex do so at pairs of signal sites, one with a 12-signal and one with a 23-signal. Double strand breaks because of the RAGs at a pair of 12-signals (or a pair of 23-signals) occur but at frequencies that are 50- to more than 100-fold lower than for a 12/23 pair (8Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Mizuuchi K. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1053-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 9Akira S. Okazaki K. Sakano H.

Double strand breaks by the RAG complex at a single signal have not been possible to reliably distinguish from background levels of pairing and cleavage of two 12- or two 23-signals (13Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It remains a matter of speculation as to the efficiency with which the RAG complex would cleave one signal and recombine it with a break caused, for example, by another nuclease. The efficiency of V(D)J recombination when one signal only has a heptamer but no nonamer is reduced markedly. When the nonamer of the 12-signal is altered at every position, but the 23-signal is a consensus one, then the efficiency is about 20-fold reduced for one particular nonamer ablation substrate (8Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Mizuuchi K. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1053-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). When the 23-signal lacks a nonamer but the 12-signal is a consensus one, then the efficiency is reduced by at least 100-fold.The chromosomal translocations involving LMO2 (t(11;14)(p13;q11)) (14Cheng J.-T.

Science. 1990; 250: 1426-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This rearrangement juxtaposes SCL within the SIL-transcribed region, resulting in the activation of SCL (also known as Tal-1, TCL5), which is normally not expressed in T-cells (33Aplan P.D.

The breakpoint regions at both SIL and SCL possess heptamer-like sequences, although there is no obvious nonamer (25Brown L. Cheng J.-T. Chen Q. Siciliano M.J. Crist W. Buchanan G. Baer R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3343-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 34Aplan P.D. Lombardi D.P. Reaman G.H. Sather H.N. Hammond G.D. Kirsch I.R.

We find that the LMO2 fragile site functions as a 12-signal at an efficiency that is only 27-fold lower than that of a consensus 12-signal. Ttg-1 serves as a 23-signal at an efficiency that is 530-fold lower than that of a consensus 23-signal. Hox11 failed to undergo recombination as a 12- or 23-signal and was at least 20,000-fold less efficient than consensus signals. SCL has been predicted to serve as a 23-signal and SIL as a 12-signal. However, we find that SIL functions as a 23-signal at an efficiency that is 750-fold lower than a consensus 23-signal. Consistent with this finding, SIL did not appear to function as a 12-signal when screened to levels 25,000-fold lower than consensus 12-signals. SCL failed to recombine as a 12- or as a 23-signal and was at least 20,000-fold lower than consensus signals. These results provide a formal demonstration that certain chromosomal fragile sites can serve as RAG complex targets, determining whether they function as 12-versus 23-signals. These results also quantify one of the major factors that determine the lymphoid translocation efficiency.Figure 3Outline of the human V(D)J recombinase assay. The diagram depicts the introduction of circular plasmids into a human cell line, Reh, active for V(D)J recombination. After 48 h within the cells, the minichromosomes are harvested by rapid alkaline lysis and transformed into E. coli for genetic detection of recombinants on ampicillin plus chloramphenicol (Amp + Cam) LB agar plates. The recombination is depicted between a consensus 12 (open triangle)- and 23 (dark triangle)-signal of pGG49, leading to signal joint formation. When analyzing the recombination efficiency of the translocation breakpoint regions, we ligated the breakpoint regions into the plasmid in place of either the 12- or 23-signal. The pSCR19 substrate, for example, has the LMO2 breakpoint region cloned in place of the 12-signal. Hence, on pSCR19, the LMO2 site is paired with a consensus 23-signal. cat denotes the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene, and Stop denotes the prokaryotic transcription terminator (49Hesse J.E.

The recombination frequency is different for each breakpoint site (Fig. 7). The LMO2 site recombines with the highest efficiency, 0.34%, which is only 27-fold less than a consensus V(D)J recombination 12-signal efficiency. The Ttg-1 breakpoint recombines 530-fold lower than consensus signals, and the Hox11 site recombines at least 20,000-fold less efficiently than consensus signals. Our study also shows that the SIL fragile site functions as a 23-signal with a recombination efficiency of 0.012%. SCL presumably acts as a 12-signal, but the efficiency is at least 29,000-fold lower than consensus 12-signals.The reason that the recombination frequencies of Hox11 and SCL are so low is unclear. The nonamer sequences of the Hox11 site deviate strongly from the consensus for V(D)J recombination, and the nonamer of the SCL site examined here also deviates from the consensus. In addition, the heptamer of both Hox11 and SCL is [coding end]/CACAGCC (22Kagan J. Finger L.R. Letofsky J. Finan J. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1990; 250: 1426-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), which deviates at the distal two heptamer positions from the [coding end]/CACAGTG consensus (8Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Mizuuchi K. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1053-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The absence of any definitive proof that Hox11 or SCL can be targets of V(D)J recombination means that if these sites are cleaved by the RAG complex, it occurs at extremely low efficiencies. Alternatively, there remains the possibility that these sites may be cleaved by a non-RAG mechanism.SIL Acts as a 23-Signal Rather than as a 12-SignalOur data show that SIL acts as a 23-signal when paired with a consensus 12-signal. Consistent with this observation, it did not recombine when paired with a 23-signal. These results suggest that during the SIL/SCL interstitial deletion, SIL acts as a 23-signal and SCL presumably acts as a 12-signal.Our results provide some clarification regarding the secondary breakpoints within the SCL locus (34Aplan P.D. Lombardi D.P. Reaman G.H. Sather H.N. Hammond G.D. Kirsch I.R. Blood. 1992; 79: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bash R.O. Crist W.M. Shuster J.J. Link M.P. Amylon M. Pullen J. Carroll A.J. Buchanan G.R. Smith R.G. Baer R. Blood. 1993; 81: 2110-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of 63 SIL/SCL deletions that were sequenced previously (34Aplan P.D. Lombardi D.P. Reaman G.H. Sather H.N. Hammond G.D. Kirsch I.R. Blood. 1992; 79: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bash R.O. Crist W.M. Shuster J.J. Link M.P. Amylon M. Pullen J. Carroll A.J. Buchanan G.R. Smith R.G. Baer R. Blood. 1993; 81: 2110-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 55 occurred at the site assayed here. An additional 8 occurred at a secondary site located 1.7 kilobase pairs more proximal to SIL. This secondary site has clearer sequence features being a 12-site. Our experimental results showing that the SIL site functions as a 23-signal would be consistent with it synapsing with 12-signals. These results raise the question of why the secondary SCL site (not tested here) might have a sequence closer to consensus and yet appear 7-fold less frequently in T-ALL. Clearly, two additional factors, chromatin accessibility and growth advantage, will affect the frequency of a site being seen (see below). Presumably these two additional factors must favor the predominant SCL breakpoint site (the one tested in this study).One previous study tested one SIL-bearing substrate in murine cells in combination with a consensus 23-signal (12Lewis S.M. Agard E. Suh S. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the focus of that interesting study was on the identification of cryptic sites in a random stretch of DNA (the plasmid backbone). Only a limited effort was directed at analyzing the SIL site; in fact, only one recombinant colony was identified in a test of SIL as a 12-signal. Furthermore, the SIL region studied was too short to include the length of SIL DNA that might serve as a nonamer for 23-signal. Our study provides substantial data showing that SIL functions instead as a 23-signal.Although SIL acts as a 23-signal when paired with a consensus 12-signal, we could not detect any recombinants when pSCR27, a plasmid containing SCL and SIL in place of both the 12- and the 23-signals, was tested. A likely reason for this is that the efficiency of SIL and SCL individually is very low when each is paired with an optimal signal. Hence, the efficiency of SIL and SCL together is likely to be even lower.Efficiency of Recombination Relative to the Frequencies of the Corresponding LeukemiasAt least two other factors affect the frequency of these chromosomal rearrangements in addition to misrecognition by the RAG complex. One additional factor is the local chromatin structure. CpG methylation can dictate a chromatin structure that is markedly resistant to V(D)J recombination (44Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 45Engler P. Weng A. Storb U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Methylated regions have deacetylated nucleosomes and are transcriptionally inactive (46Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1541) Google Scholar, 47Hsieh C.-L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because the transcriptional activity correlates with active chromatin, it is useful to note which of the chromosomal breakpoints are within transcriptionally active regions in the genome. LMO2 and SIL are both actively transcribed in the T-cells in which the translocations occur, whereas Ttg-1, Hox11, and SCL are inactive (see the Introduction).A second additional factor is the growth advantage conferred by the translocation. Transgenic mice that overexpress the gene affected by the translocation manifest varying efficiencies of leukemogenesis. In one study, the CD2 promoter was used to drive either LMO2 or Ttg-1 in transgenic mouse models (48Larson R.C. Fisch P. Larson T.A. Lavenir I. Langford T. King G. Rabbitts T.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3675-3681PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of mice succumbing to leukemia was higher for the LMO2 transgenic mice than for the Ttg-1 mice. This type of study gives some sense of the probability of neoplasia conferred by corresponding levels of expression. Of course, in the actual translocations, the levels of expression may differ.The three factors discussed here may balance one another to give leukemogenesis rates that appear to be within one to two orders of magnitude of one another. The contribution of our study is to provide quantitation to the V(D)J recombination component, which has previously only been subject to conjecture. Alterations in chromosome structure are among the major genetic changes that initiate neoplasia. The list of causes of chromosomal translocations and deletions is not yet fully established, but the following factors are thought to be included: ionizing radiation, free radicals, and enyzmes of DNA metabolism (polymerases, nucleases, and topoisomerases) (1Lieber M.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1323-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Lieber M.R.

Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 4Gellert M. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 64: 39-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In lymphoid cells, an additional cause is misrecognition by the RAG complex (5Croce C.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 6Lieber M.R. Kirsch I. The Causes and Consequences of Chromosomal Translocations. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 239-275Google Scholar, 7Rabbitts T.H. Boehm T. Kirsch I.R. The Causes and Consequences of Chromosomal Translocations. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 393-409Google Scholar). The normal function of the RAG1 complex is to initiate the breaks of V(D)J recombination at pairs of consensus heptamer/nonamer sequences in which one recombination signal has a 12-base pair (bp) spacer between the heptamer and nonamer (12-signal) and the other signal has a 23-bp spacer (23-signal). Misrecognition by the RAG complex has been speculated for"

Like the prostaglandins of the A series, prostaglandins of the J series have a structural determinant (endocyclic cyclopentenone) that confers the ability to impair the conformation, the phosphorylation, and the transcriptional activity of the p53 tumor suppressor with equivalent potency and efficacy. However, J series prostaglandins have a unique structural determinant (exocyclic α,β-unsaturated ketone) that confers unique efficacy as an apoptotic agonist. In seeking to understand how J series prostaglandins cause apoptosis despite their inactivation of p53, we discovered that they inhibit the ubiquitin isopeptidase activity of the proteasome pathway. In this regard, J series prostaglandins were more efficacious inhibitors than representative members of the A, B, or E series prostaglandins. Disruption of the proteasome pathway with proteasome inhibitors can cause apoptosis independently of p53. Therefore, this finding helps reconcile the p53 transcriptional independence of apoptosis caused by Δ12-prostaglandin J2.

This transcriptional repression is a pharmacologically unique trait that distinguishes PG of the A and J series from other PG that act via membrane-spanning receptors (8Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). If the endocyclic α,β-unsaturated ketone shared by A and J series PG confers activity, as hypothesized (1Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar), then two predictions should be valid. First, individual A series and J series PG should act rather uniformly on the cellular processes they affect. Second, their cellular effects should be self-consistent with established models of NFκB and p53 function. However, not all experiments affirm these predictions. For example, the A and J series PG both repress NFκB transcription and inhibit IκB kinase (1Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 2Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar); however, only Δ12-PGJ2 is anti-inflammatory (11Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Likewise, the A and J series PG both repress p53 transcription; however, only the A series PG antagonize p53-dependent apoptosis (Ref. 4Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9215-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and see below). Herein we report the discovery of a molecular mechanism that clarifies the distinctive cellular effects of cyclopentenone PG. Namely, J series PG preferentially inhibit the ubiquitin isopeptidase activity (ubiquitin-specific protease) of the proteasome pathway. This pathway is the major nonlysosomal degradation pathway in cells (12Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 13Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). The degradation of target proteins via this pathway largely depends on their covalent modification with a ubiquitin polymer. This polymer consists of ubiquitin (8.5 kDa) subunits that are covalently attached via isopeptide bonds between the COOH terminus of one ubiquitin and the lysine ε-amino group of another ubiquitin. In turn, this polymer is covalently attached to a lysine ε-amino group on the target protein via another isopeptide bond. Ubiquitin isopeptidases are a large family of cysteine hydrolases that preferentially cleave these isopeptide bonds (14Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that inhibition of ubiquitin isopeptidase activity by PG depends on nuances of olefin-ketone conjugation. J series PG with a cross-conjugated α,β-unsaturated dienone are more efficacious inhibitors compared with A series PG with a single α,β-unsaturated ketone (Fig. 1). We further demonstrate that J series PG cause apoptosis, concurrently with inhibition of isopeptidase activity, and independently of p53-mediated gene transactivation. Our discovery has particular implications for the development of novel antineoplastic agents that are effective against cancers with dysfunctional p53 pathways.

PAb 1620 precipitates p53 occurring in a wild type conformation; PAb 240 precipitates p53 in a mutant conformation (19Bartek J. Iggo R. Gannon J. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 893-899PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bartek J. Bartkova J. Vojtesek B. Staskova Z. Lukas J. Rejthar A. Kovarik J. Midgley C.A. Gannon J.V. Lane D.P.

DO-1 precipitates p53 occurring in either conformation or as a p53-ubiquitin conjugate. We centrifuged the samples at 2500 × g to isolate the antigen-antibody-bead complexes. We washed the immunoprecipitate four times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.4% Tween 20. We then measured p53 or ubiquitin by immunochemical analysis with antibodies for p53 (FL-393) and ubiquitin (Ubi-1), respectively. Note that PAb 240 and PAb 1620 are monoclonal antibodies, despite their annotation. We incubated 5 × 104 RKO cells, plated on a Lab-Tek® II Chamber SlideTM (Nalge Nunc International Corp.), with the indicated compounds for the indicated times and then washed the cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline. We added 100 µl of annexin-binding buffer (10 mmHEPES, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4) and 5 µl of Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled annexin V and incubated samples for 15 min at room temperature. We washed the cells twice with 400 µl of annexin-binding buffer and resuspended them in 15 µl of 50:50 annexin-binding buffer:water. We stained the cells with propidium iodide (1 µm) and Hoechst 33342 (1 µm) and examined them by fluorescence microscopy. We determined caspase activity and DNA fragmentation as described previously (22Moos P.J. Fitzpatrick F.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 687-697PubMed Google Scholar). We determined p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA expression from cDNA microarray experiments (4Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9215-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We determined 20 S proteasome catalytic activity by monitoring the cleavage of substrates for the post-glutamyl peptidase (z-LLE-MCA) and chymotrypsin-like (z-LLL-MCA and LLVY-MCA) proteolytic activities of the 20 S proteasome. Briefly, we incubated RKO cells with the indicated compounds for the indicated times. We lysed cells in 250 µl of 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm ATP, pH 7.5 with 2 mm dithiothreitol added just prior to lysis. We sonicated lysates and dispensed 45-µl aliquots into four separate wells of a 96-well plate. We added 5 µl of each proteasome substrate (500 µm in lysis buffer) to separate 45-µl samples (final substrate concentration: 50 µm). We incubated the assay mixtures at 37 °C for 15 min and quantified fluorescence (substrate cleavage) by exciting the samples at λ = 360 nm and monitoring the emission at λ = 460 nm. We determined the 26 S proteasome regulatory activity by monitoring the cleavage of Ub-125I-lysozyme, prepared as described previously (23Hough R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2391-2399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We incubated RKO cells with the indicated compounds for the indicated times. To monitor 26 S proteasome regulatory activity, we incubated 22.5 µl of lysate, 2.5 µl of an ATP regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 60 µg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 6.6 mm phosphocreatine, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCl, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol), and 25 µl of125I-lysozyme-ubiquitin conjugates (136 cpm/µl). After 30 min at 37 °C, we removed a 20-µl sample and added 400 µl of bovine serum albumin solution (1% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.02% azide). We then isolated the acid soluble fraction by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (50 µl 100% w/v trichloroacetic acid, on ice, 15 min) and centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g. We determined the amount of125I in the supernatant by γ spectrometry and calculated the percentage of soluble 125I (supernatant125I/total 125I) to determine the extent of substrate proteolysis. We determined isopeptidase activity by monitoring cleavage of a peptide substrate (z-LRGG-MCA) that mimics the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin, which is involved in isopeptide bond formation. We observed that this substrate was subject to degradation by the proteasome; therefore, we incubated RKO cell lysates (0.5 µg/ml in 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm ATP, pH 7.5) with 30 µmMG115 to inhibit proteasome activity (>90% inhibition was achieved). These conditions were used to eliminate background proteolytic activity and to permit selective determination of isopeptidase activity. We next added various concentrations of prostaglandins to identify isopeptidase inhibitory activity. Prostaglandins were incubated for 0.5 h on ice prior to substrate addition. We incubated the assay mixtures at 37 °C for 3 h and quantified fluorescence as described above. Lysates were also monitored for proteasome activity to ensure that the isopeptidase inhibitory effect seen with the prostaglandins was not due to additive proteasome inhibition. PGA1 and A2 can repress transcription by p53, thereby antagonizing p53-dependent apoptosis (4Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9215-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). If their electrophilic cyclopentenone ring confers this activity, as we hypothesized, then Δ12-PGJ2 should act analogously to PGA1 and PGA2. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that RKO cells exposed to Δ12-PGJ2 acquired p53 that was transcriptionally inactive, as determined by a variety of assays. Δ12-PGJ2 transforms p53 protein in RKO cells from its wild type, native conformation into a mutant conformation (Fig.2A, lanes 1–3). This mutant p53 conformation is a less efficient substrate for serine 15 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of this residue on p53 is an early event in p53 activation. Etoposide increased total and phosphoserine 15 p53 in RKO cells relative to the control (Fig. 2B, lanes 1and 2). However, co-incubation with 20–60 µmΔ12-PGJ2 reduced serine 15 phosphorylation (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 4). The consequences of inhibiting this activating step are reflected in the transactivating ability of p53. Etoposide-stimulated transcription of a p53-dependent reporter gene was potently inhibited by 6–60 µm Δ12-PGJ2 (Fig. 2 C). It became apparent why p53 failed to transcribe genes when we examined its ability to bind an oligonucleotide containing a p53 consensus binding sequence. In this assay, etoposide (50 µm) promoted the formation of p53-32P-labeled oligonucleotide complexes (Fig. 2 D, lane 6) that could be supershifted with anti-p53 antibody (Fig. 2 D, lane 3), and competitively inhibited by excess “cold” oligonucleotide (Fig.2 D, lane 5). Excess cold mutant oligonucleotide inhibited only the nonspecific formation of p53-32P-labeled oligonucleotide complexes (Fig.2 D, lane 4). However, 60 µmΔ12-PGJ2, alone (Fig. 2 D, lane 7) or combined with etoposide (Fig. 2 D, lane 8) inhibited the formation of p53-32P-labeled oligonucleotide complexes. These data suggest that, in terms of their pharmacological effects on p53, J series PG are quantitatively and qualitatively indistinguishable from A series PG. Cyclopentenone PG have similar effects on wild type p53 in cell lines other than RKO cells, including HCT 116, A549, and MCF-7 cells (data not shown). In contrast to their uniform effects on p53 function, A and J series PG had divergent effects on apoptosis. As expected for agents that impair p53 function, PGA1 and PGA2 do not cause apoptosis (Fig. 3). However, Δ12 PGJ2 causes apoptosis, characterized by nucleosomal fragmentation, activation of caspase-3, and cellular association of annexin V (Fig. 3, A—C). The induction of apoptosis by Δ12-PGJ2, concurrent with its impairment of p53 function in RKO cells is difficult to reconcile with the conventional model of p53 tumor suppression (6Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 7Ljungman M. Neoplasia (Bratisl.). 2000; 2: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As expected, transcription of endogenous genes regulated by p53, typified by p21WAF1/CIP1, declined in RKO cells incubated with Δ12-PGJ2 (Fig.4 A). However, we noticed that these cells continued to accumulate p21WAF1/CIP1 protein (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). This implies that Δ12-PGJ2 had slowed the rate of p21WAF1/CIP1protein degradation. This effect is distinctive for Δ12-PGJ2; mRNA and protein levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 fall, in parallel, in RKO cells treated with PGA1 or PGA2 (4Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9215-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A and4 B, lanes 2 and 3). Proteolysis via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway modulates the activity of several transcription factors, tumor suppressors, and regulatory proteins, including p21WAF1/CIP1 and p53 (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar,25Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of the 20 S proteasome catalytic activity can also cause apoptosis (26Adams J. Palombella V.J. Sausville E.A. Johnson J. Destree A. Lazarus D.D. Maas J. Pien C.S. Prakash S. Elliott P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2615-2622PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that Δ12-PGJ2 inhibited the ubiquitin-dependent 26 S proteasome pathway. We used RKO and RKO-E6 cells as a model to test this hypothesis. RKO-E6 cells are derived from isogenic RKO cells stably transfected with the E6 oncoprotein. The E6 oncoprotein is an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that hastens proteasome-mediated degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein (27Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7637-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). One predicts that RKO-E6 cells will accumulate p53 to a lesser extent than will RKO cells under various conditions ranging from basal to genomic stress. In contrast, one predicts that both cell lines will accumulate p53 to a similar extent if Δ12-PGJ2 inhibits the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Consistent with our prediction, the ratio of p53 protein in RKO-E6 cells/RKO cells was lower in every case tested, except cells incubated with Δ12-PGJ2 (Fig.5 A, lane 5). Note that RKO-E6 cells incubated with etoposide accumulate 3-fold less p53 compared with isogenic RKO cells (Fig. 5A, lane 2), confirming that the E6 oncoprotein hastens the degradation of p53. Note also that RKO-E6 cells incubated with PGA1 and PGA2 accumulated negligible amounts of p53 compared with the vehicle control (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and4 versus lane 1), indicating that these cyclopentenone PG do not inhibit proteasome-mediated degradation of p53 as efficaciously as Δ12-PGJ2. Both RKO and RKO-E6 cells incubated with Δ12-PGJ2 accumulated appreciable p53 protein (∼2–3-fold compared with vehicle control (Fig.5 A, lane 5 versus lane 1). A separate control experiment showed that the 20 S proteasome inhibitor, MG115, affected RKO and RKO-E6 cells in a manner analogous to Δ12-PGJ2 (Fig. 5 A, lane 6 versus lane 5). Cellular p53 proteins are targeted for 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation by conjugation with polyubiquitin (28Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Consistent with our hypothesis, Δ12-PGJ2 caused RKO and RKO-E6 cells to accumulate high molecular weight p53 epitopes, recognized by anti-p53 antibody (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5and 10). Immunoprecipitation with anti-p53 antibody, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunochemical analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody, confirmed that these high molecular weight p53 epitopes were polyubiquitinated isoforms of p53 (Fig. 5 C, lanes 5 and 6). The accumulation of p53-polyubiquitin isoforms in Fig.5 C signifies that Δ12-PGJ2 inhibits the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect is not restricted to p53 or to RKO cells; Δ12-PGJ2 also caused a corresponding accumulation of polyubiquitin conjugates in HL-60 cells that lack p53 alleles (data not shown). Polyubiquitin conjugate accumulation was most pronounced in cells treated with J series PG (Fig. 5 D, lanes 2–4) compared with PGA1, PGA2, PGB1,15-keto-PGE2, or PGE2 (Fig.5 D, lanes 5–9). J series PG share a cross-conjugated unsaturated ketone, while the other PG do not have this chemical feature. Note that while PGJ2 does not possess cross-conjugation, it is rapidly converted to Δ12-PGJ2 in situ (29Fitzpatrick F.A. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11713-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 6Δ12-PGJ2 inhibits the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway at a site distinct from the proteasome. A, Δ12-PGJ2does not inhibit the catalytic or regulatory activities of the proteasome. RKO cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with Me2SO (vehicle), 20 µm MG115, or 60 µm Δ12-PGJ2. Cell lysates were analyzed for proteolysis of catalytic subunit substrates (ZLLE-MCA (▪), ZLLL-MCA (░), and LLVY-MCA (▧)) and a regulatory subunit-dependent substrate (Ub-125I-lysozyme (▤)). Data are the mean ± S.D., n = 3, with statistical significance indicated (*, ANOVA, p < 0.05). B, despite being a weak proteasome inhibitor, Δ12-PGJ2 is potent at causing polyubiquitin accumulation. RKO cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with Me2SO vehicle, 6–60 µm MG115, or 6–60 µm Δ12-PGJ2. Cellular accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins was determined by Western blot analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody. C, Δ12-PGJ2 causes the accumulation of high molecular weight species of polyubiquitin. The Western blot in B was quantitated by densitometry to determine the molecular weight distribution of polyubiquitinated species that accumulated in RKO cells after incubation with Me2SO (light gray stippled trace), 60 µm Δ12-PGJ2 (solid black trace), or 20 µm MG115 (darker gray trace).Arrows indicate the molecular mass of the most abundant polyubiquitin species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is unlikely that Δ12-PGJ2 inactivated the E6 oncoprotein, or other endogenous ubiquitin ligases, ubiquitin-activating enzymes, or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, because cells incubated with Δ12-PGJ2 accumulated p53-polyubiquitin conjugates. This implies that these enzymes are still functional in their roles of catalyzing ubiquitin conjugation (Fig.5 B). Δ12-PGJ2 retained its potency and efficacy as an apoptotic agonist in RKO-E6 cells (data not shown). This is consistent with our conclusion that PGJ2 causes apoptosis via a process that is independent of p53 transcription. The 26 S proteasome consists of multiple subunits, including two 19 S regulatory subunits that recognize and bind polyubiquitinated protein substrates, and a 20 S proteolytic subunit having broad substrate specificity (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). MG115, which acts at the 20 S catalytic site, inhibited hydrolysis of several proteasome substrates in whole cell lysates. We examined hydrolysis of substrates for the chymotrypsin-like (z-LLL-MCA and LLVY-MCA) and post-glutamyl peptidase (z-LLE-MCA) proteolytic activities, as well as a 19 S regulatory subunit-dependent substrate, Ub-125I-lysozyme (Fig.6 A). At a concentration exceeding that which causes polyubiquitin conjugate accumulation in intact cells, Δ12-PGJ2 (60 µm) did not significantly inhibit hydrolysis of any of these proteasome substrates (Fig. 6 A). In other words, MG115 (20 µm) is significantly more efficacious (≥9"
https://openalex.org/W2170043976,"The requirement of poly(A) signals to elicit transcription termination of RNA polymerase II (pol II) is firmly established. However, little else is known about the actual process of pol II transcription termination. Evidence presented in this paper, based on analysis of nascent transcripts of the human β- and ϵ-globin genes, demonstrates that pol II transcription termination involves two distinct and temporally separate events. The first event, termed pretermination cleavage (PTC), is mediated by sequence tracts located downstream of the poly(A) site which appear to promote heterogeneous cleavage of the nascent transcript. The second event, in which pol II disengages from the DNA template, requires that polymerase has transcribed both a PTC sequence tract and a functional poly(A) site."

Currently, there is substantial evidence for yeast and mammalian cells that the biological effects of poly(A) tails on mRNA decay and mRNA translation are mediated through the actions of proteins that bind to them. In prokaryotes, however, comparable information does not exist for protein binding to poly(A) tails.Here we report the results of experiments aimed at isolating and identifying E. coli proteins that interact with poly(A) tracts. Using methods similar to those employed to obtain yeast poly(A)-binding proteins, we purified and characterized two E. coli proteins that bind tightly to poly(A) tracts: one of these is the ribosomal protein S1, as has been found independently (24Kalapos M.P. Paulus H. Sarkar N. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), while the other is CspE (25Yamanaka K. Mitani T. Ogura T. Niki H. Hiraga S. Mol.

Our search for PABPs in E. coli cells revealed that two previously known proteins bind to poly(A) tracts under the high salt conditions used to define PABPs. One of the PABPs we isolated is CspE, a member of a family of small basic proteins that have in common an RNA binding CSD (40Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2861-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whereas all of the CSD proteins examined have RNA binding properties (41Phadtare S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), it is noteworthy that CspE, which has been reported to interact specifically with nascent RNA (26Hanna M.M. Liu K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), was the only CSD protein detected in our screen for proteins that bind to poly(A) tracts. We found that CspE impedes digestion of poly(A) tails by PNPase, and also slows poly(A)-facilitated digestion by PNPase near the junction of the poly(A) tail with the primary transcript, yielding decay intermediates consisting of primary transcripts that contain short additions of A residues. Additionally, CspE protected polyadenylated RNA I from both the poly(A) tail shortening activity of RNase E and the endonucleolytic cleavage that ordinarily occurs near the RNA I 5′ end.Ribosomal protein S1, the second poly(A)-binding protein detected by our screen, is a weakly held 30 S subunit protein that interacts with sequences at the 5′ ends of mRNA molecules (37Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) as well as with poly(A) tails (this work; see also Ref. 24Kalapos M.P. Paulus H. Sarkar N. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Binding of S1 to an “enhancer” located near the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence at the 5′ end of E. coli mRNA molecules promotes interaction between the SD and 16 S rRNA, as well as correct positioning of the translational start codon (e.g. Ref. 37Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar and 51Boni I.V. Isaeva D.M. Musychenko M.L. Tzareva N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In contrast with the results observed for CspE, binding of S1 to poly(A) had no detectable effect on the ribonucleolytic activity of PNPase or RNase E. However, the ability of this poly(A)-binding protein to interact with degradosome proteins as well as with ribosomes raises the prospect that S1 may functionally link the processes of mRNA degradation and translation in E. coli cells: by binding to sites located at both ends of mRNA molecules, protein complexes containing S1 may “bridge” 3′ and 5′ mRNA termini, as has been proposed for the elF4E·eIF4G·Pab1p complex in yeast and for its mammalian cell counterpart (e.g. Refs. 17Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar and 18Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion of communication between the two ends of RNA molecules inE. coli cells are the results of earlier work showing that events taking place at one end of a transcript can influence ribonucleolytic attack in vivo at the other terminus (5Xu F. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1995; 374: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 6Xu F. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In Escherichia coli, poly(A) tails can dramatically promote the decay of structural RNA and mRNA both in vitro and in vivo (e.g. Refs. 3Hajnsdorf E. Braun F. Haugel-Nielsen J. Régnier P. Proc. Natl.

Conversely, the presence on RNA molecules of long poly(A) tails can decrease cleavage within primary transcripts by ribonuclease (RNase) E, the principal endonuclease of E. coli (11Huang H. Liao J. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both PNPase and RNase E, which have the ability to remove poly(A) tails from transcripts (5Xu F. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1995; 374: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Huang H. Liao J. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) are known to be key components of a multiproteinE. coli ribonucleolytic complex that has been termed the RNA degradosome (12Carpousis A.J.

Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Proteins that bind selectively to homopolymeric A tracts or to poly(A) tails on RNA molecules in 1 m salt solutions (i.e. poly(A)-binding proteins; PABPs) were initially identified in mammalian cells (16Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and subsequently have been reported in yeast, plants, and bacteria. PABPs from eukaryotes can interact with proteins that initiate translation at the 5′ CAP of mRNAs, and consequently can both stimulate translation and facilitate circularization of mRNA molecules (Ref. 17Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar; for reviews, see Refs.18Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). PABPs also can impede the shortening of poly(A) tails, which in eukaryotic cells is a crucial initial step in mRNA decay. Currently, there is substantial evidence for yeast and mammalian cells that the biological effects of poly(A) tails on mRNA decay and mRNA translation are mediated through the actions of proteins that bind to them. In prokaryotes, however, comparable information does not exist for protein binding to poly(A) tails. Here we report the results of experiments aimed at isolating and identifying E. coli proteins that interact with poly(A) tracts. Using methods similar to those employed to obtain yeast poly(A)-binding proteins, we purified and characterized two E. coli proteins that bind tightly to poly(A) tracts: one of these is the ribosomal protein S1, as has been found independently (24Kalapos M.P. Paulus H. Sarkar N. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), while the other is CspE (25Yamanaka K. Mitani T. Ogura T. Niki H. Hiraga S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a member of a family of bacterial proteins that contains a “cold-shock” RNA-binding domain and has been implicated as a transcription anti-terminator (26Hanna M.M. Liu K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Bae W. Phadtare S. Severinov K. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1429-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We show that CspE binding impedes poly(A) tail removal by PNPase and RNase E, and that S1 interacts with both PNPase and RNase E as well as with poly(A) tails. Our findings raise the prospect that E. coli proteins that bind to poly(A) tails may link the functions of degradosomes and ribosomes. DISCUSSIONProteins that bind to poly(A) tails of eukaryotic messenger RNAs were first detected in mammalian cells almost three decades ago (16Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).

The zinc finger protein A20 is a cellular inhibitor of NF-κB activation by various stimuli and plays a critical role in terminating NF-κB responses. The underlying mechanism for NF-κB inhibition by A20 is still unknown. A20 has been shown to interact with several proteins including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factors 2 and 6, as well as the inhibitory protein of κB kinase (IKK) γ protein.

Aberrant activation of NF-κB is observed in a number of diseases such as arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer (10Chen F. Castranova V. Shi X. Demers L.M. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The activation pathway of NF-κB has been largely elucidated. In resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive dimer by the inhibitory protein of κB (IκB). After stimulation of cells, IκB is phosphorylated on two serine residues by two IκB kinases (IKKs), namely IKKα and IKKβ (11Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar, 12Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

This targets the IκB protein for ubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. The active NF-κB is then free for translocation to the nucleus, where it can bind specific sequences in the promoters of responsive genes. IKKα and IKKβ are part of a larger IKK complex that also contains an essential regulatory component IKKγ/NEMO (12Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13973-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). After treatment with TNF, cells lacking RIP or TRAF2 are deficient in or hyporesponsive to NF-κB activation, respectively (19Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P.

Furthermore, dominant negative forms of TRAF2 inhibit NF-κB activation (22Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence for TNF-dependent recruitment and activation of the IKK complex to the TNF receptor complex has been provided. TRAF2 has been proposed to be required for IKKγ recruitment to the TNF receptor, whereas RIP mediates IKK activation via IKKγ-mediated oligomerization (23Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G.

The proposed involvement of two putative IKK-activating kinases, NF-κB-inducing kinase and MEKK1, has been countered recently by knockout studies (28Matsushima A. Kaisho T. Rennert P.D. Nakano H.

Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5243-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Besides inhibition by IκB, NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to different stimuli is also inhibited by the zinc finger protein A20 (31Jäättelä M. Mouritzen H. Elling F. Bastholm L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1166-1173PubMed Google Scholar, 32Cooper J.T. Stroka D.M. Brostjan C. Palmetshofer A. Bach F.H. Ferran C. J. Biol.

The latter was first cloned as an immediate early response gene up-regulated by TNF in endothelial cells (33Dixit V.M. Green S. Sarma V. Holzman L.B. Wolf F.W. O'Rourke K. Ward P.A. Prochownik E.V. Marks R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 235: 2973-2978Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In the meantime, A20 expression has been shown to be strongly increased in several cell types in response to TNF (33Dixit V.M. Green S. Sarma V. Holzman L.B. Wolf F.W. O'Rourke K. Ward P.A. Prochownik E.V. Marks R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 235: 2973-2978Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 34Krikos A. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

The expression of A20 is controlled by NF-κB (34Krikos A. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17971-17976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that A20 is involved in a negative feedback loop for NF-κB activation. Recently, it was shown that A20-deficient cells fail to terminate TNF-induced NF-κB responses (36Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A. Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). In addition, mice deficient for A20 develop severe inflammation and cachexia and are hyperresponsive to TNF. These results further indicate that A20 is critical for terminating TNF-induced NF-κB responses. The underlying mechanism for inhibition of NF-κB activation by A20 is still unclear. A number of A20-binding proteins have been described previously (37Beyaert R. Heyninck K. Van Huffel S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A20 can be recruited to TRAF complexes via its NH2-terminal TRAF-binding domain (38Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 39Heyninck K. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), whereas its COOH-terminal domain mediates inhibition of NF-κB activation. Binding of this domain to IKKγ and the NF-κB-inhibitory protein ABIN has been proposed to be involved in its NF-κB-regulating activity (23Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 40Heyninck K. De Valck D. Vanden Berghe W. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Beyaert R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Here we report the molecular cloning of ABIN-2, a previously unknown protein that binds to the COOH-terminal domain of A20. When expressed ectopically, ABIN-2 inhibits activation of NF-κB by TNF, IL-1, or tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA). Moreover, evidence was obtained that ABIN-2 interferes with the NF-κB signaling pathway at a level upstream of the IKK complex. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) were a kind gift of Dr. M. Hall (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.4 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. HeLa cells were obtained from Dr. P. Agostinis (University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. L929r2 cells (41Vanhaesebroeck B. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Suffys P. Beyaert R. Lucas R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2469-2477PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% newborn bovine serum 5% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. Mf4/4 macrophages (42Desmedt M. Rottiers P. Dooms H. Fiers W. Grooten J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5300-5308PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in endotoxin-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Recombinant human TNF and recombinant murine IL-1β were produced in Escherichia coliin our laboratory and purified to at least 99% homogeneity. TNF had a specific biological activity of 8.8 × 106 IU/mg purified protein, as determined with the international standard code 87/650 (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, United Kingdom). IL-1β had a specific activity of 3.65 × 108 IU/mg purified protein, as determined with the international standard code 93/668. Expression vectors contain mutant green fluorescent protein (GFP) S65T, as well as a fusion of the former with murine A20 and deletion mutants thereof (GFP-A20-(1–369) and GFP-A20-(370–775)) (40Heyninck K.

Plasmids coding for RIP (40Heyninck K. De Valck D. Vanden Berghe W. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Beyaert R. J.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the yeast plasmid pAS2-A20 (44De Valck D. Heyninck K. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were described previously. The HA-tagged ABIN plasmid consists of a fusion of the ABIN cDNA with an NH2-terminal HA tag in the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. Plasmids encoding TRAF2 and TRAF6 were gifts of Dr. D. V. Goeddel (Tularik, San Francisco, CA). The plasmid coding for Tax was a kind gift of Dr. K.-T. Jeang (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The plasmid encoding IKKβ was a kind gift from Dr. J. Schmidt (Department of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria), and the plasmid coding for IL-1 receptor-associated kinase was a gift from Dr. L. O'Neill (Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland). The reporter plasmid pSRE-luc was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The plasmid pNFconluc, encoding the luciferase (Luc) gene driven by a minimal NF-κB-responsive promoter, was a gift from Dr. A. Israël (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The plasmid pUT651, encoding β-galactosidase (Gal), was supplied by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). RNA was extracted from mouse heart and lung tissue using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5′-RACE was performed using a SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH). Full-length ABIN-2 cDNA was constructed by assembling the RACE fragment and the expressed sequence tag clone AA105249 by fusion PCR (45Olsen O. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 3: 159-160Google Scholar). Forward and reverse primers used for amplification of the expressed sequence tag clone were 5′-agagaaggaggtagtcttgcttcg-3′ and 5′-gtccttgatgtaccaagtgtgcc-3′, respectively. Forward and reverse primers for amplification of the 5′-RACE fragment were 5′-ttggagacgcccaagtccccacgg-3′ and 5′-gcaagactacctccttctcttgc-3′, respectively. Forward and reverse primers used for fusion PCR of both fragments were 5′-ccgctcgagatgGGTGCGCCGGTGCCGTATCCGGATCCGCTGGAACCGCGTgaattcgggatccgtatgtcgtctggggacccaagg-3′ (uppercase letters represent the sequence for the inserted E tag) and 5′-ggagatcttcattggcagcactcagacag-3′, respectively; they were designed to facilitate cloning in the expression vector pCAGGS. Deletion mutants were constructed by PCR. All cDNA inserts were sequenced to verify their correctness. The Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid system was purchased from CLONTECH. L929r2 cDNA library screening was performed as described previously (46De Valck D. Heyninck K. Van Criekinge W. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. Beyaert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). cDNA inserts encoding candidate A20-interacting proteins were sequenced on both strands with a cycle sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). BLAST searches were performed with the online program offered by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Mouse multiple tissue Northern blot and mouse tissue first-strand cDNA (mouse MTC) were purchased from CLONTECH. Polyadenylated RNA was extracted from 2 × 106 L929r2 or Mf4/4 cells using a Micro-FastTrack Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). After electrophoresis on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel, the RNA was transferred by capillary elution to a Hybond-N+ membrane. Hybridization of the Northern blot was performed with partial ABIN-2 cDNA isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening as a probe. The intensity of the ABIN-2 signal, which was determined using a PhosphorImager and an ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), is expressed relative to the intensity of the β-actin signal of the same tissues. PCR on the mouse tissue first-strand cDNA was performed using a touch-down PCR program and primers to ABIN-2 that amplify an internal 400-bp fragment (namely, 5′-tgtcagctcctggtttgcttccgc-3′ and 5′-agagaaggaggtagtcttgcttcg-3′). Primers amplifying a 200-bp β-actin fragment were used as control (5′-ttccgatgccctgaggctct-3′ and 5′-caggaggagcaatgatcttg-3′). For immunoprecipitation, 106 HEK293T cells were seeded in 10-cm Petri dishes and transfected using the DNA calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (47O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 5043-5049Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody, cells were lysed in 500 µl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 µg/ml leupeptin, 200 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmPefablock) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 5.5 mg/ml β-glycerophosphate). Immunoprecipitation was performed with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) and binding to protein A-Trisacryl beads (Pierce). Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody (Babco, Richmond, CA), cells were lysed in lysis buffer E1A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein A-Trisacryl-bound immunocomplexes were washed twice with buffer E1A, twice with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl, and twice more with buffer E1A. Binding proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Detection of coprecipitating proteins was achieved with a monoclonal anti-E tag antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or a monoclonal anti-FLAG tag antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.), both of which were coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactivity was revealed with a Renaissance enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For detection of endogenous ABIN-2 protein expression, L929r2 or Mf4/4 cells were left untreated or treated with TNF for 24 h. Cells were lysed in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. Lysates were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, run on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a mixture of three ABIN-2-specific peptides (NH2-lnakwqrydasrdeyc-COOH, NH2-ggwrpessrsqqmepsc-COOH, and NH2-myqvsqrqdsrepgpc-COOH) coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin and with a secondary donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Signals were detected with a Renaissance enhanced luminescence system. To determine NF-κB activation by TNF, IL-1, or TPA stimulation, HEK293T cells were grown in 6-well plates and transiently transfected by DNA calcium phosphate coprecipitation (47O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 5043-5049Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with a total of 1 µg of DNA. The DNA mixture comprised 100 ng of pUT651, 100 ng of pNFconluc, and 800 ng of specific expression plasmids. 24 h after transfection, cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well. 24 h later, cells were left untreated or stimulated with TNF (1000 IU/ml), IL-1 (40 ng/ml), or TPA (200 ng/ml) for 6 h; they were subsequently lysed in 200 µl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm 1,2-cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). Luc and Gal activities were analyzed as described previously (46De Valck D. Heyninck K. Van Criekinge W. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. Beyaert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Luc values were normalized for Gal values to correct differences in transfection efficiency (plotted as Luc/Gal). To determine NF-κB activation induced by overexpression of intracellular signaling proteins, cells were seeded directly in 24-well plates and transiently transfected with 20 ng of pUT651, 20 ng of pNFconluc, and a total of 160 ng of specific expression plasmids. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed and analyzed as described above. HeLa cells were grown in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with 1 µg of total DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 24 h after transfection, cells were seeded on coverslips; 24 h later, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, and sequentially incubated for 2 h with a monoclonal E tag antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by incubation for 2 h with a biotinylated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody and incubation for 30 min with avidin-Texas red (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclei were stained for 10 min with 40 ng/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescence was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Axiophot) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm (emission, 510 nm) for GFP and 543 nm (emission, 600 nm) for Texas red. Thus far, the mechanism by which A20 inhibits NF-κB activation remains unclear. Because no enzymatic activity of the A20 protein has been described, we attempted to identify A20-interacting proteins that might play a role in the inhibition of NF-κB activation. A20 was used as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a murine fibrosarcoma L929r2 cDNA library. Ten clones expressed A20-interacting proteins, including A20 (44De Valck D. Heyninck K. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), 14-3-3 proteins (46De Valck D. Heyninck K. Van Criekinge W. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. Beyaert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and ABIN (40Heyninck K. De Valck D. Vanden Berghe W. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Beyaert R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). One clone contained the 3′ end (832–1967 bp) of a cDNA encoding a previously unknown protein that we termed ABIN-2 (A20-binding inhibitor of NF-κB activation-2). BLAST searches with this partial cDNA revealed homology to a mouse expressed sequence tag with GenBankTM accession number AA105249. Full-length ABIN-2 (Fig. 1) was subsequently isolated by 5′-RACE on RNA samples obtained from mouse lung and heart tissues. Because two independent RNA sources and two independent RACE experiments resulted in the same 5′ nucleotide, we concluded that ABIN-2 cDNA was complete. Full-length murine ABIN-2 cDNA (1967 bp) has a 5′-untranslated region of 82 nucleotides, an open reading frame of 1290 nucleotides, and a 3′-untranslated region of 594 nucleotides. The corresponding full-length human ABIN-2 cDNA could be reconstituted from the expressed sequence tag clones with GenBankTM accession numbers AA081482 and AW170250. Murine and human ABIN-2 showed 76% identity at the amino acid level. To examine the tissue distribution of ABIN-2 mRNA, we used the fragment isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screening as a probe in a multiple tissue Northern blot. ABIN-2 mRNA was detected in all tissues examined (Fig. 2 A). Analysis of ABIN-2 expression relative to β-actin expression in the same tissue showed that ABIN-2 was maximally expressed in kidney and only weakly expressed in skeletal muscle. An ABIN-2-specific fragment could also be PCR-amplified from first-strand cDNA prepared from all tissues examined (Fig. 2 B), further demonstrating the general expression of ABIN-2. ABIN-2 is expressed in all tissues as an mRNA species with an estimated length of 2000 nucleotides, which is in agreement with the length of the cloned ABIN-2 cDNA. A similar ABIN-2 mRNA was also detectable in several cell lines, including murine L929r2 fibroblasts and Mf4/4 macrophages. ABIN-2 mRNA expression levels were not modulated after treatment with TNF, lipopolysaccharide, or interferon-γ, which is in contrast with the inducible expression of A20 (Fig. 2 C). Western blotting of L929r2 and Mf4/4 cell extracts revealed that endogenous ABIN-2 is expressed as a 50-kDa protein, which corresponds to the molecular mass predicted from the amino acid sequence. Scanning of the Prosite data base with the predicted amino acid sequence did not reveal any known protein motifs.Figure 2Expression pattern of ABIN-2. A, mouse multiple tissue Northern blot for ABIN-2. The blot was hybridized with a radiolabeled ABIN-2 cDNA fragment isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen and analyzed by autoradiography. The same blot was reprobed with β-actin cDNA as a control for sample loading. B, mouse multiple tissue reverse transcription-PCR. ABIN-2-specific PCR amplification on first-strand cDNA from each tissue yields a 400-bp product. Amplification of β-actin was used as a control. C, mRNA expression in L929r2 and Mf4/4 cells. Cells were stimulated for 1 h with 1000 IU/ml TNF, 4 h with 10 µg/ml cycloheximide (CHX), 1 h with 1 µg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 1 h with interferon-γ (IFN-γ), or combinations thereof. ABIN-2 mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blotting. D, protein expression of ABIN-2. Lysates of L929r2 and Mf4/4 cells, which were either left untreated or treated with 1000 IU/ml TNF for 24 h, were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with a polyclonal ABIN-2-specific antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ABIN-2 fragment isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening from the cDNA library corresponds to its COOH terminus (amino acids 250–430). In addition, the full-length protein ABIN-2 also bound A20 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. To confirm the interaction in mammalian cells, the coding region of ABIN-2 was NH2-terminally fused to the E tag and cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pCAGGS. Transient transfection of this vector into HEK293T cells and immunoblotting with an anti-E tag antibody revealed a protein of 50 kDa (data not shown), which corresponds to the predicted molecular mass. Full-length ABIN-2 was also found to interact in mammalian cells with A20 because both proteins were able to coimmunoprecipitate in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for E-tagged ABIN-2 and chimeric GFP-A20 protein (Fig. 3 A). No interaction was observed between ABIN-2 and GFP as a negative control. The interaction between A20 and ABIN-2 was not influenced by stimulation of cells with TNF (data not shown). Partial deletion mutagenesis of A20 indicated that ABIN-2 specifically interacts with the zinc finger-containing COOH-terminal half of A20 (amino acids 370–"

However, FADD-deficient mice are embryonic lethal and FADD −/− T cells developed from FADD −/− embryonic stem cells in theRAG-1 −/− hosts lack the full potential to proliferate when stimulated through their T-cell receptor complex, suggesting that FADD protein might play a dualistic role in mediating not only cell death signaling but other non-apoptotic cellular pathways as well. Here we show that a substantial number of freshly isolatedFADD −/− peripheral T cells are cycling but are defective in their co-stimulatory response when stimulated. Analysis of several cell cycle proteins shows normal down-regulation of p27 inhibitor but increased levels of p21, decreased levels of cyclin D2, and constitutive activation of several cyclin-dependent kinases in activated T cells.

Mice with mutations at the Fas or FasL locus develop severe autoimmunity with symptoms that include splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, increased serum immunoglobulins, and kidney failure (14Cohen J.J.

Surprisingly, FADD-deficient mice are embryonic lethal with heart developmental problem and die around day 10 of gestation. Chimeric mice generated by injecting FADD −/−embryonic stem cells into the RAG-1 −/−blastocysts do not develop any lymphoproliferative diseases. Initial analysis of these mice showed T-cell development abnormalities and mature T lymphocytes lack the full potential to proliferate when stimulated with cross-linking TCR antibodies. Transgenic mice expressing the human FADD dominant-negative mutant also exhibit defective TCR-mediated proliferation and abnormal T-cell development (17Newton K. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Smith K.G.C. Strasser A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 18Zornig M. Hueber A.-O. Evan G. Curr.

More recently, analysis of T-cell-specific FADD-deficient mice showed an inhibition of T-cell development at the proliferative step between DN and DP transition (21Kabra N.H. Kang C. Hsing L.C. Zhang J. Winoto A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6307-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that FADD protein plays a role in mediating not only cell death signaling but T-cell proliferation as well. To understand the molecular defects of FADD −/− T proliferation, we have characterizedFADD −/−→RAG-1 −/−chimeras further. Here we show that a substantial number of restingFADD −/− peripheral T cells are cycling. However, they are defective in their co-stimulatory responses when stimulated with a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Western blot analyses of resting and stimulated T cells show normal regulation of the p27 inhibitor in the absence of FADD. However, all other cell cycle proteins examined are highly abnormal when FADD is not present. These data suggest that FADD is involved in the regulation of downstream cell cycle machinery in T lymphocytes. Anti-CD3 (500A2) and anti-CD28 (37.51) ascites were produced in house and titrated. The anti-CD3 ascites were used at the indicated dilutions. Anti-CD28 was used at a concentration of 5 µg/ml. The antibodies against CD4 (CT-CD4), CD8 (CT-CD8α), or CD62L(MEL-14) were purchased from Caltag (South San Francisco, CA). The anti-CD69 antibody (H1.2F3) was purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Antibodies against cell cycle proteins as well as p53 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells were lysed by a 30-min incubation in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (CalBiochem), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm NaF, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Sigma). Lysates (10 µg of total protein) were fractionated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The filters were incubated with various antibodies as described previously (9Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and developed with Renaissance (DuPont) per manufacturer's instructions. FADD-deficient ES cells were previously described (9Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). TheseFADD −/− ES cells were injected into blastocysts isolated from pregnant RAG-1 −/−mice to generateFADD −/−→RAG-1 −/−chimeras. Cell suspensions were prepared from lymphoid organs of mice (6–10 weeks of age). Briefly, lymph node cells and splenocytes were depleted of red blood cells by treatment for 5 min at room temperature with red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma). For cell staining and flow cytometric analysis, the lymphoid cells were cultured in anti-CD3 ascites (1:3000)-coated 24-well plate with 107 cells per well. Anti-CD28 was added to the medium as a soluble component. Cells were filtered and washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 4% fetal calf serum and 1 mm NaN3. Cells were stained at the times indicated in the aforementioned buffer for 20 min. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on the Beckman-Coulter (Fullerton, CA) EPICS XL-MCL. For cell cycle analysis, CD4+ and CD8+peripheral T cells were sorted on a Beckman-Coulter EPICS Elite ESP Sorter. Cells were taken at 0, 24, and 48 h postactivation with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. At each time point, cells were fixed in 100% ethanol and kept at 4 °C for at least 4 h. Cells were then pelleted and washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice. Finally, the cells were resuspended in propidium iodide (PI, Sigma)-RNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) (10 µg/ml PI and 100 µg/ml RNase) buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. Lymphoid cell suspension from mice was sorted for CD4+ or CD8+ peripheral T cells. 105 cells were cultured in triplicate in 96-well plates coated with various dilutions of anti-CD3 ascites. Anti-CD28 ascites was added in solutions where indicated at a 1:1000 dilution. [3H]thymidine (1 µCi PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added per well. Cells were harvested and 3H incorporation was measured by a scintillation counter at the times indicated. In our previous analyses ofFADD −/−→RAG-1 −/−chimeric mice, we showed that the total splenocytes or lymph node cells responded minimally to stimulation by anti-CD3 antibodies, Con A, or a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin (9Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of FADD in mature T-cell activation, we generated moreFADD −/−→RAG-1 −/−chimeric mice and examined the proliferation responses with purified T cells. Peripheral CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were isolated by magnetic beads and treated with various concentrations of anti-CD3 antibodies in the presence of anti-CD28 co-stimulation. Similar to the results obtained with unpurified populations, proliferation of FADD −/− T cells was dramatically reduced when compared with that of wild type cells over a range of antibody concentrations (Fig.1 a). To see if co-stimulation response is affected, we treated T cells with anti-CD3 antibody in the presence and absence of anti-CD28 antibody. Whereas CD28 cross-linking greatly enhanced the proliferative responses of wild-type T cells, it failed to provide co-stimulatory effects toFADD −/− T cells (Fig. 1 b). The level of CD28 on the cell surface of FADD −/− T cells is comparable with that on the wild-type counterparts (data not shown). These data indicate that the reduced proliferation of FADD-deficient T cells may result from their inability to respond to co-stimulation. We noticed that a fraction of freshly isolatedFADD −/− T cells from all mutant chimeric mice exhibit characteristics of activated T-cell blasts as visualized by microscopic examination and are also indicated by increased forward scatter profiles by flow cytometry (data not shown). In addition, a majority of freshly isolated peripheral matureFADD −/− T cells express higher levels of the activation marker CD69 (Fig. 2). These cells also dramatically down-regulated Mel-14 (CD62L) expression. Freshly isolated FADD −/− T cells are apparently cycling as they incorporate [3H]thymidine even without stimulation (data not shown). These results imply that some of the peripheral, circulating FADD −/− T cells are in an activated state and attempt to undergo cell cycle. To confirm this possibility, we analyzed the cell cycle profile of freshly isolated T cells by staining for DNA content and flow cytometry. As indicated in Fig. 3, almost all (98%) freshly isolated peripheral, wild-type T cells are in G0phase. In contrast, a fraction of FADD −/−cells are in the S phase and the G2/M phase (∼10%), which is a 10-fold increase over the wild-type level. This result agrees with the thymidine incorporation experiment and further indicates that FADD −/− cells are cycling constitutively at low levels and fail to establish and maintain the resting state in vivo. Stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies did not further increase the percentage of S phaseFADD −/− cells, unlike the wild-type T cells that rapidly undergo G0 to S transition. By 48 h of stimulation, more than 60% of the wild-type cells are cycling. Thus, whereas a small fraction of FADD −/− T cells have spontaneously progressed into the S phase, the majority failed to do so with or without stimulation through their T cell antigen receptors.Figure 3FADD −/− T cells are cycling in the absence of TCR stimulation and are unable to progress through a complete cycle. Purified lymph node and splenic T cells from FADD −/− chimeras and C57BL/6 were cultured with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Cell cycle analysis was performed at 0, 24, and 48 h poststimulation and 10000 events were collected for each histogram. The histograms displayed are those at time 0 where the percent of cells in Go/G1 and G2/M and S (S) are listed above each histogram. The %S for 24 and 48 h are also indicated to theright of each histogram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Progression through the G1 phase is dictated by the presence of D-type cyclins in complex with the G1 phase cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 (22Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5144) Google Scholar, 23Nurse P. Cell. 2000; 100: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In addition, cyclin E associates with CDK2 to enforce the G1to S phase transition and to facilitate entry into S phase. Cyclin A in conjunction with CDK2 pushes cells through the S phase. Finally, cyclin A/B and the cdc2 complex are required for the G2/M transition (24Morgan D.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Activities of these cyclin/CDK holoenzymes are tightly regulated by a number of inhibitors such as p16, p21, and p27. To determine whether FADD deficiency affects regulation of the cell cycle in T cells, we examined expression of a panel of cell cycle proteins by Western blot analyses. Total proteins were extracted from purified T cells, and the levels of cyclin D2/D3, CDK6, CDK2, CDC2, cyclin A, cyclin E, p21, and p27 inhibitors were assessed. Because of a small number of T cells that can be obtained from a limited number ofFADD −/− →RAG-1 −/−chimeric mice, we could not perform immunoprecipitation and kinase assays and are thus limited to only Western blot analysis of cell cycle proteins that are known to be induced by TCR signaling. Cyclin D1, cyclin B, CDK4, and the p16 family of inhibitors are either absent in T cells or are not induced by TCR signaling and hence were not examined (25Ajchenbaum F. Ando K. Decaprio J.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4113-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lucas J.J. Szepesi A. Modiano J.F. Domenico J. Gelfand E.W. J.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, freshly isolated wild-type resting T cells are in the G0 stage of the cell cycle with basal levels of cyclin and CDK expression and a high level of CDK inhibitor p27. Signals from CD3 and CD28 lead to a rapid induction of several key cyclins and CDKs and degradation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (Fig. 4). Like wild-type T cells, freshly isolatedFADD −/− T cells express high levels of inhibitor p27, which is down-regulated to a minimal amount within 24 h after stimulation (Fig. 4). Degradation of p27 is IL-2 dependent (28Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Together with our previous finding that stimulatedFADD −/− T cells produce IL-2 and can up-regulate CD25, these results suggest that early events of T cell activation and IL-2 signals proceed normally to some extent in the absence of FADD. In sharp contrast to normal regulation of p27, however, all other cell cycle proteins examined are highly irregular. Among the cyclins and CDKs examined, cyclin A, cyclin E, cdc2, CDK2, and CDK6, which normally are present at low levels and are further induced following stimulation, are highly expressed in non-treatedFADD −/− T cells (Fig. 4). Expression of these CDK and cyclins did not increase further upon stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Constitutive expression of cyclin A and cdc2 is consistent with the fact that increased proportions ofFADD −/− cells have entered the S phase. However, it is not clear why the levels of cyclin E, CDK6, and CDK2 G1-related proteins are highly elevated. Other G1-related proteins, cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 in contrast are expressed at lower levels in FADD −/− T cells and induction of these two proteins by TCR signals is moderate. Another major pleiotropic inhibitor of several key CDKs, p21, is greatly induced in mutant T cells to a level, which is several-fold higher than that of the wild-type cells. The expression of p21 inhibitor is regulated in part by the tumor suppressor gene p53 (29Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), but we found no dramatic p53 expression differences between wild-type and FADD −/− cells (data not shown). The reduced levels of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 and dramatic induction of p21 may account for the lack of G1 to S cell cycle progression in FADD −/− T cells. We have previously shown that FADD −/−mature T cells generated in RAG-1 −/− chimeras are defective in their ability to proliferate in response to anti-CD3 or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin stimulation (9Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Recently, we generated T-cell-specific FADD −/− mice and found that deletion of FADD at the DN stage results in an inhibition of DN to DP transition at the proliferative stage (21Kabra N.H. Kang C. Hsing L.C. Zhang J. Winoto A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6307-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results argue strongly that in addition to its function in apoptosis, FADD also plays a role in proliferation. We show here thatFADD −/− T cells are defective in co-stimulation and exhibit abnormal cell cycle regulation. Surprisingly, some of the unstimulated FADD −/−T cells are in the G2/M/S phases. One trivial explanation is FADD −/− T cells are undergoing lymphopenic homeostatic proliferation. However, lymph node cell number ofFADD −/− chimeras is similar to that of wild-type mice (9Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FADD −/− T cells exhibit blast appearance 2J. Zhang, unpublished data. and activated phenotype as evidenced by the high levels of CD69 activation marker and a decreased expression of CD62L. These attributes are in contrast to lymphopenic T cells, which acquire mostly memory-like markers (30Surh C.D. Sprent J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: F9-F14Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Examination of other activation markers in FADD-deficient T cells, including CD44, 3N. Kabra, J. Zhang, and A. Winoto, unpublished data. CD25 and CD122 (9Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) show normal inducible expression. It is interesting to note, however, that anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated FADD −/−T cells do not completely up-regulate CD69 as the wild-type T cells (Fig. 2). This can be caused by the defective co-stimulatory activity in FADD-deficient cells or T-cell hyporesponsiveness as a consequence of proliferation problems. Analysis of the cell cycle proteins in FADD-deficient T cells indicate that molecules involved with all phases of cell cycle, except for p27, are expressed aberrantly. Many of the molecules associated with G1 to S and G2/M are expressed constitutively at high levels, consistent with our observations that substantial fractions of FADD-deficient T cells have spontaneously overcome the G0 block in vivo. However, these cells have failed to cycle back to the G0 state, indicating a possible block at the G2/M phase. Paradoxically,FADD −/− T cells fail to transit through G1 to S and to G2/M phases following TCR stimulation, perhaps because of the exaggerated expression of p21. We thus conclude that FADD is intimately involved in the downstream events of cell cycle regulation in T cells, and FADD deficiency results in problems at multiple cell cycle checkpoints. It remains unclear how FADD modulates induction and degradation of cell cycle proteins but it is unlikely to involve death domain-containing cell surface receptors. Such proteins that are known to associate with FADD include Fas, TNFR-I, and the TRAIL receptors (DR4 and DR5 in human, mDR4/5 in mouse). However, mice with mutations in Fas, TNFR-I, or double mutation of Fas/TNFR-I do not exhibit an impaired T-cell proliferation. Inhibition of DR4/5 signals by injection of TRAIL-blocking antibody actually leads to an increase of T-cell proliferation (31Song K.M. Chen Y.G. Goke R. Wilmen A. Seidel C. Goke A. Hilliard B. Chen Y.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In addition, deficiency of FADD in T cells arrests T cell development at the DN to DP transition (21Kabra N.H. Kang C. Hsing L.C. Zhang J. Winoto A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6307-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas Fas and TNFR-I double deficiency allows normal T-cell development. Analysis of the nearly complete human genome data base did not reveal any new member of the TNF receptor superfamily (1Aravind L. Dixit V.M. Koonin E.V. Science. 2001; 291: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that FADD regulates proliferation through its interaction with a distinct set of cytoplasmic proteins during cell cycle. In support of this hypothesis, FADD is phosphorylated at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and associates with a cell cycle-regulated kinase (32Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I., P.H., K. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, the status of cell cycle proteins was examined in mouse T cells using a dominant-negative mutant of human FADD (33Hueber A.O. Zornig M. Bernard A.M. Chautan M. Evan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10453-10462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Expression of this human dominant-negative protein has been shown to inhibit T cell proliferation. Human FADD dominant negative (FADD-DN) inhibits G0 to S entry of T cells when stimulated with anti-CD3 plus CD28 antibodies, consistent with our findings with the FADD-deficient T cells. However, unlike our findings, these FADD-DN transgenic T cells were shown to be impaired in their ability to flux calcium, suggesting that early event of TCR/CD28 signaling is compromised. Regulation of cell cycle proteins also appears normal in FADD-DN transgenic T cells, and these cells maintain characteristics of resting cells in the absence of mitogenic stimulation, in sharp contrast toFADD −/− T cells that appear to enter the cell cycle spontaneously. The discrepancy between our results and that of dominant-negative mutant transgenic mice is not completely clear, but might reflect the differences in the nature of the two systems where the functions of FADD have been blocked. Although it is efficient at blocking Fas-mediated apoptosis, FADD-DN may only partially block its proliferative function. Alternatively, FADD-DN may exert nonspecific effects. For example, FADD-DN has been shown to inhibit cycloheximide-induced cell death (34Tang D.M. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7245-7252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a process not known to involve any receptors. In addition, the phenotypes of FADD-DN transgenic mice vary significantly among reports (17Newton K. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Smith K.G.C. Strasser A.

We have found that expression of a mouse FADD-DN protein at a high level did not perturb T-cell development nor inhibit T-cell proliferation (35Zhang J. DeYoung A. Kasler H.G. Kabra N.H. Kuang A.A.

Future biochemical and genetic experiments are necessary to further illuminate the molecular mechanisms by which FADD targets the cell cycle machinery.

https://openalex.org/W2044804986,"High mobility protein-1 (HMG-1) has been shown to regulate transcription by RNA polymerase II. In the context that it acts as a transcriptional repressor, it binds to the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form the HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex, which is proposed to inhibit the assembly of the preinitiation complex. By using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we show that the acidic C-terminal domain of HMG-1 and the N terminus of human TBP are the domains that are essential for the formation of a stable HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex. HMG-1 binding increases the affinity of TBP for the TATA element by 20-fold, which is reflected in a significant stimulation of the rate of TBP binding, with little effect on the dissociation rate constant. In support of the binding target of HMG-1 being the N terminus of hTBP, the N-terminal polypeptide of human TBP competes with and inhibits HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex formation. Deletion of segments of the N terminus of human TBP was used to map the region(s) where HMG-1 binds. These findings indicate that interaction of HMG-1 with the Q-tract (amino acids 55–95) in hTBP is primarily responsible for stable complex formation. In addition, HMG-1 and the monoclonal antibody, 1C2, specific to the Q-tract, compete for the same site. Furthermore, calf thymus HMG-1 forms a stable complex with the TBP/TATA complex that contains TBP from either human or Drosophilabut not yeast. This is again consistent with the importance of the Q-tract for this stable interaction and shows that the interaction extends over many species but does not include yeast TBP.

HMG-1 binding increases the affinity of TBP for the TATA element by 20-fold, which is reflected in a significant stimulation of the rate of TBP binding, with little effect on the dissociation rate constant. In support of the binding target of HMG-1 being the N terminus of hTBP, the N-terminal polypeptide of human TBP competes with and inhibits HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex formation. Deletion of segments of the N terminus of human TBP was used to map the region(s) where HMG-1 binds. These findings indicate that interaction of HMG-1 with the Q-tract (amino acids 55–95) in hTBP is primarily responsible for stable complex formation. In addition, HMG-1 and the monoclonal antibody, 1C2, specific to the Q-tract, compete for the same site. Furthermore, calf thymus HMG-1 forms a stable complex with the TBP/TATA complex that contains TBP from either human or Drosophilabut not yeast. This is again consistent with the importance of the Q-tract for this stable interaction and shows that the interaction extends over many species but does not include yeast TBP.

For RNA polymerase II transcription, the regulation of TBP1 binding to the TATA element is considered a principal determinant in promoter activity and therefore a primary target for regulatory factors. TBP can be considered modular in nature, with its highly conserved C terminus being necessary and sufficient for both binding to the TATA box and basal level transcription (5Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J.

Cell. 1990; 61: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition all activators and repressors that bind to human TBP (hTBP) are reported to bind to the C terminus (2Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev.

On the other hand, the interactions of regulatory factors with the 159-residue N terminus in hTBP appear much more limited, and its role in transcriptional regulation is not understood. In the only case that is characterized, it was shown that the N terminus down-regulates hTBP binding to the U6 TATA box, mediates cooperative binding with SNAPc to the U6 promoter, and facilitates an enhanced level of RNA polymerase III transcription of the U6gene (7Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Henry R.W. Ford E. Mital R. Mittal V. Hernandez N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, a monoclonal antibody specific for the Q-tract of the N terminus of hTBP was shown to inhibit selectivelyin vitro transcription from TATA-containing, but not TATA-less, promoters that were transcribed by RNA pol II or III. This antibody interaction did not affect TBP binding to the TATA box or inhibit the formation of the TFIIA/TFIIB/TBP/TATA complex, which suggests that the N terminus may be available for protein-protein interactions associated with subsequent assembly of the preinitiation complex (9Lescure A.

HMG-1 is a ubiquitous and highly conserved nuclear protein that has been reported to serve as a transcriptional repressor (10Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

The A- and B-domains, each containing about 80 residues with a high percentage of arginines and lysines, are homologous and structurally comparable and have been shown to bind nonspecifically to DNA (18Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 19Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bustin M.

BioEssays. 1993; 15: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The C terminus is quite different, being polyanionic, with the last 30 residues being a stretch of exclusively aspartic or glutamic acid residues. This segment reduces binding affinity to DNA and is not required for protein stability (22Bianchi M. Falciola L. Ferrari S. Lilley D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) but has defied a more definitive functional role. In this work, we show that the C terminus of HMG-1 and the Q-tract in the N terminus of human TBP are essential for stable HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex formation. HMG-1 increases the affinity of TBP for the TATA element 20-fold, which is reflected in a significant increase in the rate of TBP binding, while having little effect on the lifetime of the complex. This interaction provides a broader spectrum of regulatory controls for TBP binding and promoter activity. Calf thymus HMG-1 and HMG-2 proteins were purified in non-denaturing conditions using salt extraction, selective precipitation with ammonium sulfate, and further purification by high pressure liquid chromatography using a MonoQ column (23Marekov L.N.

Bianchi, was transfected into BL21(DE3) cells, and the expressed protein was purified using published protocols (25Stros M. Reich J. Kolibalova A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The expression vectors, pET-his6hTBP, pET11d-his6180hcTBP (from F. Pugh), pAR3038dTBP (from R. Tjian), and pET11d-his6yTBP (from R. Roeder), were transfected into BL21(DE3) cells, and the expressed proteins were purified using phosphocellulose chromatography and ammonium sulfate precipitation, as described by Pugh (26Pugh F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 37: 359-368PubMed Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins with full-length TBP or TBP with N-terminal deletions (ΔN) (from N. Hernandez) were obtained as pET11c expression vectors (7Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), transfected into BL21(DE3) cells, and expressed and purified using glutathione-agarose (Sigma) (7Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The GST-nTBP-(1–158) (from T. Kouzarides) was purified according to standard procedures and was used in competition experiments. The purity of all proteins isolated was >90% as evidenced by a single Coomassie-stained band on SDS-PAGE. The individual oligonucleotides of the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP; −40 to −1 and −1 to −40) were purchased from National Biosystems and32P-end-labeled by standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The EMSA procedures have been described (24Lu W. Peterson R. Dasgupta A. Scovell W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35006-35012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) but involved reacting the DNA probe with the proteins of interest in binding buffer (24 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 4 mmspermidine, 5 µg/ml poly(dG-dC), and 115 µg/µl bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 30 °C. All samples were electrophoresed in 0.35× TBE buffer (TBE, Tris borate-EDTA buffer) at 200 V for ∼1.5 h in 4–6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C. After completion of electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Antibodies used in the supershift experiments were obtained from R. Roeder (anti-HMG-1) and P. Chambon (monoclonal TBP antibodies (1C2 and 3G3)). The K d values were obtained by titration of 100 pm DNA over a range of TBP concentrations, with equilibrium established after 60 min at 30 °C. Experiments for the HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex were done with the HMG-1 concentration at 120 nm. The band intensities for the complex and free DNA in these studies and those in the kinetic determinations (below) were measured by exposing the dried gels to a PhosphorImager screen, which were scanned using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. The ImageQuant software program was used to measure accurately the band intensities. The K d value for the TBP/TATA complex is equal to the free TBP concentration at which there are equal concentrations of [DNA] and [TBP/DNA] (i.e. K d = [TBP][DNA]/[[TBP/DNA]). At the very low TBP concentrations, in which the TBP concentration was not in large excess relative to DNA, the [TBP]free was calculated by standard procedures. The fraction of complex was plottedversus the concentration of TBP to generate the binding curves. The best fit of the data was derived (using Sigma Plot for PC) using over 50 data points from five independent determinations. The off-rate constants for the complexes were determined by establishing the complex for 60 min and challenging the complex with 20 ng/µl poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). At the time points indicated, the samples were loaded on the gel. The same level of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) was added to the controls at the corresponding time points. Reactions were initiated at staggered intervals so that all samples could be loaded on the gel at the same time. DNA concentrations were at 100 pm, with TBP concentrations being at least 15-fold in excess. The HMG-1 concentration was 120 nm. The τ 12 values were derived from the linear plot of ln[c/co] versustime, with the k off obtained from the relationship, k off = ln 2/τ 12. The relative on-rates were estimated from a plot of the fraction complex formed versus time. These plots were also derived from more than 50 points from five independent runs, with the average values used to obtain the final plot. The gel electrophoresis for both the thermodynamic and kinetic studies was run for only 20 min to minimize any dissociation of the complex during electrophoresis. HMG-1 binds to TBP/TATA to form an EMSA-stable HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex, exhibiting a significantly greater stability than the TBP/TATA complex (24Lu W. Peterson R. Dasgupta A. Scovell W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35006-35012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To investigate the extent to which the acidic C terminus of HMG-1 contributes to the stability of the complex, the binding of HMG-1-(1–215) to TBP was compared with that for the didomain HMG-1(A-B)-(1–176) that lacks the C terminus. The EMSA profile in Fig.1 B compares the binding of HMG-1 (lanes 3–7) and HMG-1(A-B) (lanes 9–14) to the TBP/TATA complex. HMG-1 binding produces a complex with an increased mobility, as reported previously (24Lu W. Peterson R. Dasgupta A. Scovell W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35006-35012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex is evident at an (HMG-1/TBP) molar ratio of 4, whereas it is the sole species at a molar ratio of 40. On the other hand, no complex is detectable with HMG-1(A-B) at a molar ratio as high as 640. A strong new band of increased mobility becomes apparent at these increasingly higher HMG-1(A-B) levels (lanes 11–14).Lanes 15–18 confirm that this major band observed inlanes 11–14 is also observed when HMG-1(A-B) is reacted with the DNA probe in the absence of TBP. This indicates that at HMG-1(A-B) molar ratios of 80 or greater, the highly charged HMG-1(A-B) binds directly and preferentially to DNA and not to the TBP. This is consistent with the much higher DNA binding affinity expected for HMG-1(A-B) compared with HMG-1 (28Stros M. Stokrova J. Thomas J.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 29Sheflin L.G. Fucile N.W. Spaulding S.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3238-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30Grasser K.D. Teo S.H. Lee K.B. Broadhurst W. Rees C. Hardman C.H. Thomas J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We conclude that the C terminus is essential for the stability of the HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex. The role of the N terminus of hTBP was examined by comparing the relative binding of HMG-1 to both the full-length hTBP-(1–339) and the C-terminal TBP fragment (residues 159–339).Lanes 1–6 in Fig. 2, like the data in Fig. 1, show the strong binding profile for HMG-1 to TBP/TATA, with complete complex formation at a (HMG-1/TBP) molar ratio of 40. However, incubation of HMG-1 with cTBP/TATA complex does not lead to any detectable complex formation, as evident in lanes 9–14.Complexation of HMG-1 with cTBP/TATA could not be detected at (HMG-1/cTBP) molar ratios as high as 640. In fact, at ratios of about 200 and higher, HMG-1 inhibits cTBP binding to the TATA-containing probe. Together with this, a band of greater mobility is observed again, which results from HMG-1 binding directly and nonspecifically to the DNA probe. This interpretation is verified by reacting HMG-1 with the DNA probe in the absence of cTBP (lanes 15–17) which produces the same band profile. The relative stabilities of the TBP/TATA and HMG-1/TBP/TATA complexes were quantitatively compared by titrating the TATA-containing oligonucleotide with TBP, in the absence and presence of saturating levels of HMG-1. The EMSA binding profiles for the two complexes are shown in Fig.3A. Qualitative examination of the binding at low TBP levels (compare lanes 2 and11) shows more complex formed in the presence of HMG-1. The band intensity data were used to plot the fraction of each complex formed as a function of TBP concentration (Fig. 3 B), from which the corresponding K d values were determined. The K d value for the TBP/TATA complex was 1.5 nm, which is comparable to values reported previously (31Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Weideman C.A. Netter R.C. Benjamin L.R. McAllister J.J. Schmiedekamp R.A. Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. J. Mol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8280-8286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding plot for TBP binding in the presence of saturating levels of HMG-1 shows stimulated binding of TBP to the TATA element. Complex formation is observed at significantly lower TBP levels than required for the binding of only TBP to the TATA element. This complexation reduced the K d value by about 20-fold, with 50% HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex formation occurring at about 70 pm TBP. HMG-2 protein is similar to HMG-1 in size and exhibits a high degree of homology, with both proteins being implicated in the regulation of transcription (18Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 19Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bustin M. Lehn D.A.

However, HMG-2 has eight fewer acidic residues (22 versus 30 in HMG-1) in the C-terminal acidic tract (35Wen L. Huang J.K. Johnson B.H. Reeck G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 27: 1197-1214Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar,36Majumdar A. Brown D. Kerby S. Rudzinski I. Polte T. Randhawa Z. Seidman M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6643Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We determined that HMG-2 also stimulates TBP binding, with both proteins exhibiting comparable effects in enhancing TBP binding (data not shown). Since the K d value is a reflection of the ratio ofk d/k on, the impact of HMG-1 on the complex dissociation rate constant was determined. The EMSA profile for dissociation for each complex is shown in Fig.4A, with the data plotted in Fig. 4 B. The dissociation profiles for the complexes differ only slightly, indicating that the presence of HMG-1 has little effect on the half-life of the complex. The values of τ 12 are 160 and 130 min, respectively, for the TBP/TATA and the HMG-1/TBP/TATA complexes. The corresponding values for k off are 7.2 × 10−5 and 8.9 × 10−5s−1, respectively. The value for the TBP/TATA complex is comparable to previously reported values (33Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6260-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) obtained for TBP dissociation. This finding would indicate that the effect of HMG-1 on theK d value should be associated predominantly with an increase in the on-rate for TBP. To obtain an estimate of the relative on-rates and determine if this was generally consistent with theK d data, the comparative time course of TBP binding was monitored for the two complexes and is shown in Fig. 4 C. Comparison of the relative band intensities at the same time points (e.g. 5 min) shows that, qualitatively, the presence of HMG-1 stimulates the rate of TBP binding. As shown in Fig.4 D, quantitative measurements indicate that HMG-1 clearly stimulates the rate of TBP binding, enhancing the initial rate by about 10-fold. The initial slope for the formation of the HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex represents only an estimate or lower limit value due to the high rate of reaction and difficulty of obtaining consistent data at times less than 1 min. These kinetic data are, however, consistent with the thermodynamic data and indicate that HMG-1 decreases theK d value by primarily increasing the on-rate kinetics, while having little discernible effect on the dissociation kinetics. It was of interest to provide additional support for the role of the N terminus of TBP as the target for HMG-1. If HMG-1 interacts directly with the N terminus of hTBP and this provides the primary stability for the complex, then the presence of the exogenous N-terminal polypeptide would be expected to inhibit the formation of the HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex. Fig. 5shows the effect of increasing levels of GST-nTBP-(1–159), 34–260 nm (lanes 2–6), when it is preincubated with 80 nm HMG-1 for 20 min on ice, followed by 30 min of incubation with TBP/TATA. Little inhibition is observed at the lower level of nTBP (molar ratio (nTBP/HMG-1) of 0.5; (nTBP/TBP) of 34) (lane 2), whereas progressive inhibition occurs at the higher nTBP levels, with complete inhibition of complex formation observed at about the 225 nm level (molar ratio (nTBP/HMG-1) of 3; (nTBP/TBP) of 225) (lane 4–5). The presence of nTBP exhibited no detectable effect on TBP/TATA complex formation (data not shown). These data provide additional support for the N terminus of hTBP as the principal target for HMG-1 binding and for interaction with this region providing the primary stability in complex formation. In order to determine if a particular segment of the N terminus of hTBP might play a predominant role in the HMG-1 interaction, the effect that HMG-1 has on increasing the stability of the TBP/TATA complex was examined using hTBP deletion mutants. The schematic of hTBP and the five N-terminal deletion mutants used are shown in Fig. 6A. The non-conserved 159-residue N terminus can be conveniently divided into three regions as follows: the segment containing the initial residues from 1 to 54 (fragment I); the central region, inclusive of residues 55–95 and containing the Q-tract, which is made up of 34 consecutive glutamine residues (fragment II); and the segment from 96 to 158 (fragment III), which lies between the Q-tract and the conserved C terminus (residues 159–335). The ΔN nomenclature for the mutants is from Mittal and Hernandez (7Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The pairs of adjacent lanes in Fig.6 B show the relative stability of the TBP/TATA and the corresponding HMG-1/TBP/TATA complexes. Comparison of lanes 1 and 2 shows that the extent of GST-TBP binding to TATA (lane 1) is significantly increased by complexation with HMG-1. This is essentially the same value obtained when TBP (not in the GST fusion) is used. This indicates that the presence of the GST does not change the HMG-1/TBP binding, which is also what was observed previously with the SNAPc/TBP binding (7Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Henry R.W. Ford E. Mital R. Mittal V. Hernandez N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The relative increases for the mutant-TBPs were determined using a PhosphorImager (data not shown) and were compared with this value. The mutants were found to fall into two different groups. HMG-1 increases the stability of the complex formed for both ΔN + I + II (lanes 3 and4) and ΔN + II (lanes 5 and 6), with the stability being comparable, but slightly less, than that for hTBP itself. This suggests that segment II (the Q-tract) plays the major role in stabilizing the interaction with HMG-1, with segment I providing little additional stability. Fragment ΔN + I (lanes 11 and 12) has a reduced TATA binding affinity, in agreement with previous reports (7Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Henry R.W. Ford E. Mital R. Mittal V. Hernandez N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the addition of HMG-1 has no effect on stability (extended exposure in lanes 11′ and 12′ is shown in the right panel). To ensure that ΔN + I remained capable of binding to the TATA element and was not simply inactivated during the purification procedure, TFIIB was reacted with TBP/TATA to form a stable TFIIB/TBP/TATA complex (data not shown). There is no mobility shift and insignificant intensity change on reaction of HMG-1 with either ΔN + III or ΔN (lanes 7–10), indicating that HMG-1 has little or no interaction with them. The band intensity for the TBP/TATA complex with these latter two TBP mutants is greater than for the others, in agreement with previous findings that showed that the N terminus within hTBP reduces the binding affinity of TBP to the TATA element (7Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The latter three deletion mutants, ΔN, ΔN + I, and ΔN + III, represent the second group, all of which exhibit no significant interaction with HMG-1. These findings indicate that the Q-tract in segment II is a major target for HMG-1 binding. If the Q-tract is important for the HMG-1 interaction, HMG-1 should compete with an antibody specific to the Q-tract region and reduce or eliminate the formation of a supershifted complex. Antibodies that are targeted to epitopes that are not directly involved in the HMG-1 binding should correspondingly yield a supershifted complex in the presence or absence of HMG-1. Fig. 7A shows the sequence for the first 95 residues in the N terminus of hTBP, highlighting the location of the epitopes for two monoclonal antibodies (mAb). mAb1C2 was originally reported to be specific for residues 53–62 (shown in parenthesis), which lies at the junction of segment I and II and within the Q-tract. Recently, it was shown to be specific for the Q-tract (37Trottier Y. Lutz Y. Stevanin G. Imbert G. Devys D. Cancel G. Saudou F. Weber C. David G. Tora L. Agid Y. Brice A. Mandel J. Nature. 1995; 378: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mAb3G3 targets residues 1–10 in hTBP. In the first set of experiments, TBP, TATA, and the antibody (1C2 or 3G3) were incubated, followed by addition of increasing amounts of HMG-1. Lane 3 in Fig. 7 B shows that mAb1C2 produces a supershifted complex in the absence of HMG-1. The addition of increasing levels of HMG-1 produces the HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex as seen in the characteristic band for the complex (lanes 4–8). As seen in lane 5, the presence of HMG-1, at as low as 5 ng, competed effectively with mAb1C2 for binding to TBP and disrupted its binding to TBP/TATA, resulting in the loss of a supershifted complex. In contrast, the parallel experiments that used mAb3G3 (lanes 10–16) showed that HMG-1 binding did not disrupt antibody binding to TBP, as evident by the continued presence of the supershifted complex. These data indicate that HMG-1 and mAb1C2 compete for the same or overlapping sites and that the HMG-1 binding to TBP is stronger than that for mAb1C2 to TBP. On the other hand, HMG-1 and mAb3G3 do not compete for the same site(s) and bind simultaneously to different and non-overlapping sites. Fig. 7 C shows the titration in which the HMG-1/TBP/TATA complex was preestablished, and increasing levels of antibody were added in an attempt to compete with HMG-1 binding. The addition of increasing amounts of mAb1C2 to the complex did not displace HMG-1 from the complex. This antibod"

We have previously shown that both secretory and cytosolic phospholipase A2(PLA2) are involved in TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation. In this study, we have addressed the mechanism of PLA2 involvement with respect to downstream arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites and the functional coupling between PLA2s mediating NF-κB activation. We show that in addition to inhibitors of secretory and cytosolic PLA2s, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors attenuate TNF-α- and IL-1β-stimulated NF-κB activation. Exogenous addition of leukotriene B4(LTB4) restored NF-κB activation reduced by 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors or an LTB4 receptor antagonist, thus identifying LTB4 as a mediator in signaling to NF-κB. TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced AA release from cellular membranes was accompanied by phosphorylation of cytosolic PLA2. Inhibitors of secretory PLA2 and of 5-lipoxygenase/LTB4 functionality markedly reduced AA release and nearly completely abolished cytosolic PLA2phosphorylation. This demonstrates that secretory PLA2, through 5-lipoxygenase metabolites, is an essential upstream regulator of cytosolic PLA2 and AA release. Our results therefore suggest the existence of a functional link between secretory and cytosolic PLA2 in cytokine-activated keratinocytes, providing a molecular explanation for the participation of both secretory and cytosolic PLA2 in arachidonic acid signaling and NF-κB activation in response to proinflammatory cytokines.

Diverse PLA2enzymes hydrolyze the sn-2 bond of phospholipids releasing lysophospholipids and fatty acids. Both products are metabolized into bioactive lipids, like platelet-activating factor and eicosanoids. Many of the arachidonic acid (AA)-derived eicosanoids, including leukotrienes, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and hydroxy fatty acids, are potent proinflammatory mediators, whose action is in part mediated by interaction with cell surface G-protein coupled receptors (1Metters K.M.

Ten different groups of PLA2enzymes have been defined; eight are detected in human tissues (4Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol.

Increased levels of snpPLA2 in circulation and affected tissue have been found in association with various pathological conditions like, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, infections, lung inflammation, and psoriasis (21Vadas P.

Inflammation. 1994; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor, which plays a critical role in immune and inflammatory responses (24Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 25May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated by a wide range of inducers, including ultraviolet irradiation, cytokines, inhaled occupational particles, lipoproteins, and bacterial or viral products (26Chen F. Castranova V. Shi X. Demers L. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB, prototypically a heterodimer of p50 and p65 subunits, resides in the cytoplasm in an inactive form bound to the inhibitory protein IκB. Upon cellular activation, including in response to the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, IκB is phosphorylated by an IκB kinase complex and proteolytically degraded by proteasomes, leading to the activation of NF-κB (27Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). NF-κB then translocates into the nucleus, where it activates gene transcription of a number of genes involved in inflammatory processes.Two different TNF receptors, TNFR p55 and TNFR p75, can mediate NF-κB activation, but in most cells the TNFR p55 is the major signaling receptor. After receptor activation, members of the TNF receptor-associated factor protein family (28Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V.

Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). In parallel to NIK, other MAP3K family members are also able to activate the IκB kinase complex, including MEKK1 (35Nakano H.

The TNF-α-induced transduction pathway leading to activation of NF-κB has also been proposed to involve phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (37Schutze S. Berkovic D. Tomsing O. Unger C. Kronke M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), sphingomyelinase (38Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M.

Res. 1999; 55: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).In a previous study, we showed that selective inhibitors against either snpPLA2 or cPLA2 (41Thommesen L. Sjursen W. Gåsvik K. Hanssen W. Brekke O.L. Skattebøl L. Holmeide A.K. Espevik T. Johansen B. Lægreid A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3421-3430PubMed Google Scholar) inhibited activation of NF-κB in human-derived keratinocytes. The NF-κB inhibition was accompanied by a reduced expression of the cell surface adhesion molecule ICAM-1, illustrating the biological significance. The aim of the present study was to identify PLA2-generated signaling molecules, to investigate their mechanism of action, and to examine the possible sequential interaction between secretory and cytosolic PLA2 in NF-κB activation. We present evidence herein that snpPLA2 and 5-lipoxygenase activity regulate phosphorylation of cPLA2 and cellular AA release, contributing to NF-κB activation. Hence, a functional coupling between snpPLA2 and cPLA2 is of importance for PLA2-mediated modulation of NF-κB in response to either TNF-α or IL-1β.DISCUSSIONThe present study suggests the existence of a functional link between snpPLA2 and cPLA2, conveyed by 5-LO metabolites, modulating TNF-α- and IL-1β-stimulated NF-κB activation. These results also provide a molecular explanation to the participation of both secretory and cytosolic PLA2s in NF-κB activation. Several lines of evidence support the involvement of both PLA2s through a positive feedback loop in which snpPLA2, through 5-LO metabolites, modulates phosphorylation of cPLA2: 1) inhibitors of both snpPLA2 and cPLA2 separately block NF-κB activation; 2) the addition of group IIa snpPLA2 moderately amplifies cytokine-stimulated NF-κB activation; 3) inhibitors of the 5-LO pathway and an LTB4 receptor antagonist partially prevent cytokine-stimulated NF-κB activation; 4) 5-LO inhibitors attenuate cytokine-evoked cellular AA release and cPLA2phosphorylation; and 5) snpPLA2 inhibitors abolish AA release and cytokine-induced phosphorylation of cPLA2. In our experiments, we have used several structurally and mechanistically different inhibitors against snpPLA2 (SB203347 and 12-epi-scalaradial) and 5-LO enzymes (L-655,238 and MK-886) as well as the LTB4 receptor antagonist LY255283. In addition, in a previous study, we confirmed that even another snpPLA2 inhibitor (the active site-directed inhibitor LY311727; Ref. 69Schevitz R.W. Bach N.J. Carlson D.G. Chirgadze N.Y. Clawson D.K. Dillard R.D. Draheim S.E. Hartley L.W. Jones N.D. Mihelich E.D. Olkowski J.L. Snyder D.W. Sommers C. Wery J.-P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and several other cPLA2 inhibitors (e.g. the trifluoromethylketones AACOCF3 and (all-Z)-1,1,1-trifluoro-6,9,12,15,18-heneicosapentaen-2-one) reduced nuclear translocation of NF-κB in response to TNF-α and IL-1β (41Thommesen L. Sjursen W. Gåsvik K. Hanssen W. Brekke O.L. Skattebøl L. Holmeide A.K. Espevik T. Johansen B. Lægreid A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3421-3430PubMed Google Scholar). In the previous study, we also confirmed that the inactive cPLA2 inhibitor analogues AACOCH3 and (all-Z)-1,1,1-trifluoro-6,9,12,15,18-heneicosapentaen-2-ol had no effect on cytokine-induced NF-κB activation and ensuing inhibitor specificity.In this study, we found that exogenously added AA was able to restore cytokine-induced NF-κB activation in cells treated with an inhibitor toward snpPLA2, thus identifying that snpPLA2-generated AA yields active NF-κB signaling. Also, exogenously added AA reversed the effect of snpPLA2 and cPLA2 inhibitors on cellular [3H]AA release. Thus, AA metabolites, rather than other PLA2-generated products such as lysophosphatidylcholine and platelet activating factor, are prominent AA- and NF-κB-modulatory components in HaCaT cells. The inhibitory effect of the LTB4 receptor antagonist on NF-κB activation was completely overcome by the addition of LTB4 (Fig. 4 E), while that of the 5-LO inhibitor L-655,238 was only partially relieved after the addition of LTB4 (Fig. 4, C and D). This could indicate that other 5-LO metabolites than LTB4 are also functional in cytokine-induced NF-κB activation. LTB4 and 12-HETE are potent chemoattractants, e.g. for lymphocytes in human skin (70de Jong E.M. van Erp P.E. van Vlijmen I.M. van de Kerkhof P.C. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 1992; 17: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 71Furstenberger G. Richter H. Fusenig N.E. Marks F. Cancer Lett. 1981; 11: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), possibly connected to the participation of LTB4 in NF-κB activation and expression of adhesion molecules.Based on our results, we propose a model for the involvement of snpPLA2, 5-LO/LTB4 and cPLA2 in TNF-α/IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation (Fig.8). Interaction of TNF-α/IL-1β with their respective receptors leads to signal transduction, resulting in activation of the MAP3K family (including NIK) and the IκB kinases (IKKα and -β), leading to degradation of the IκB inhibitor and activation of NF-κB (31Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 72Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). In parallel, TNF-α/IL-1β may induce snpPLA2 activity, resulting in AA/LTB4mobilization and subsequently cPLA2 phosphorylation. In HaCaT keratinocytes, snpPLA2 activity is found extracellularly in the medium and associated with the cellular surface in resting cells (62Sjursen W. Brekke O.L. Johansen B. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); thus, synthesis (see Fig. 1) or secretion of snpPLA2s may not be necessary at this step (discussed below). Subsequently, snpPLA2s may release AA, which through conversion to 5-LO metabolites induces kinase cascades that mediate phosphorylation and activation of cPLA2. Regarding kinases promoting cPLA2 phosphorylation and activation in response to TNF-α/IL-1β, we find that atypical PKCλ/ι and p38, but not p42/44, MAP kinases are involved in snpPLA2/LTB4-mediated cPLA2 and NF-κB activation.3 The participation of p38 or p42/44 MAP kinases in TNF-α/IL-1β/sPLA2/LTB4-mediated cPLA2 activation has recently been suggested (65Syrbu S.I.

Moreover, p38 MAP kinase and PKCλ/ι have been implicated in TNF-α/IL-1β-stimulated NF-κB activation (76Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W.

Paya C. Arenzana-Seisdedos Virelizier J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4770-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, snpPLA2/leukotrienes may contribute to NF-κB activation by enhancing activity of distinct kinase cascades acting to phosphorylate cPLA2 and to increase phosphorylation-mediated events leading to increased NF-κB-dependent transcription. The leukotriene-evoked kinase cascades could couple to the known NF-κB signaling upstream of the recently identified NIK (31Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar) and the IκB-kinases (IKKα and -β), e.g. via interaction with the RIP-associated adapter protein p62 as recently reported for PKC-ζ (79Sanz L. Sanchez P. Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3044-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) or downstream RIP. Alternatively, the PLA2-generated metabolites may participate in signaling pathways that are parallel to the classical NIK-IKK-IκBα pathway, since parallel activation cascades through MAP kinase kinase kinases (TPL-2, TAK1, MEKK2, and MEKK3) are also able to activate NF-κB (32Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 36Zhao Q. Lee F.S. J. Biol.

We found that PLA2activity alone (as examined by the addition of AA, LTB4, or human group IIa snpPLA2 separately or in combinations) is not sufficient to induce NF-κB activation. Hence, PLA2activity contributes to NF-κB activation but needs additional signals from TNF-α/IL-1β-receptors, probably initiating activation of the IKKs.We found that the snpPLA2 inhibitor SB203347 only at elevated concentrations (40–60 µm) was able to completely block NF-κB activation, whereas the cPLA2inhibitor MAFP blocked NF-κB activation by 55% at 25 µm. Thus, although snpPLA2, AA, or LTB4 are unable by themselves to activate NF-κB, we propose that the PLA2-generated positive feedback loop mediated by LTB4 and other 5-LO metabolites may modulate NF-κB activation in response to cytokines. In contrast, cytokine-induced cellular AA release was completely blocked by snpPLA2 and cPLA2 inhibitors, showing that PLA2 enzymes are the main contributors to cytokine-elicited AA-release in these cells. Together these findings indicate a partial contribution of AA, 5-LO, and snp/cPLA2s to NF-κB activation. The involvement of this functional link between PLA2s and the PLA2/LTB4-mediated positive feedback loop in NF-κB activation may be dependent on the cellular presence of various PLA2s and 5-LO.An obvious requirement for our model for PLA2-mediated NF-κB activation is that the necessary PLA2s and 5-LO are expressed. RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1) showed that 5-LO in addition to PLA2 groups IIa, IId, IV, V, VI, and X are expressed in unstimulated postconfluent keratinocytes. Other investigators have also found expression of both 5-LO and the 5-LO-activating protein FLAP, detected as mRNAs and proteins, in post-confluent HaCaT cells. 5-LO undergoes Ca2+-dependent translocation to the nuclear membrane upon inflammatory activation (81Brock T. McNish R. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21652-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and may also be regulated in a p38 MAP kinase-dependent manner (82Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). TNF-α and IL-1β increase intracellular calcium levels (83Terry C.M. Clikeman J.A. Hoidal J.R. Callahan K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1493-H1501PubMed Google Scholar), which could thus contribute to 5-LO activation. However, 5-LO has been found to be active per se in unstimulated post-confluent HaCaT cells (84Janssen-Timmen U. Vickers P. Wittig U. Lehmann W. Stark H-J. Fusenig N. Rosenbach T. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Habenicht A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6966-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the enzymatic machinery necessary for immediate production of AA-generated 5-LO metabolites in response to cytokines is present in human HaCaT keratinocytes. Whether all snpPLA2enzymes expressed in HaCaT cells participate in TNF-α-/IL-1β-induced AA release, cPLA2 phosphorylation, and NF-κB activation is uncertain. Group X snpPLA2 may act directly on undisturbed cell membranes (49Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Although group V snpPLA2 can act directly on undisturbed neutrophils (75Cho W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), group IIa, IId, and V snpPLA2s are dependent on cellular activation to hydrolyze membranes of adherent cells (49Bezzine S.

We have previously shown that snpPLA2 activity is associated with HaCaT cells as well as in the culture medium (62Sjursen W. Brekke O.L. Johansen B. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Heparin treatment of unstimulated HaCaT cells in order to detach extracellular proteoglycan-bound snpPLA2 isoforms (groups IIa, IId, and V) led to increased snpPLA2 enzyme activity detected in the culture medium, indicating that enzymatically active proteoglycan-bound snpPLA2 isoforms are already associated with the cellular surface in unstimulated cells. Furthermore, we were not able to detect enhanced sPLA2 activity in the medium after TNF-α/IL-1β treatment, even in the presence of heparin. Hence, according to existing models and our previous results (62Sjursen W. Brekke O.L. Johansen B. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), group X snpPLA2 may continuously degrade membrane phospholipids in unstimulated as well as stimulated HaCaT cells, whereas proteoglycan-bound snpPLA2 isoforms (groups IIa, IId, and V) may participate in AA release upon TNF-α/IL-1β treatment. The inhibitors against snpPLA2 used in this study are designed against the group IIa enzyme. The group IId, V, and X enzymes are more closely related to group IIa than group I PLA2, and we cannot exclude the possibility that the inhibitors also affect these enzymes. Thus, which snpPLA2 isoforms participate in cytokine-induced AA and NF-κB activation in HaCaT cells is uncertain and should be examined in future studies.Our results illustrate that snpPLA2 plays a regulatory role in cytokine-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation and NF-κB activation in human keratinocytes. In contrast, only cPLA2was found to contribute to activation of NF-κB by LPS in human leukocytes (87Burgermeister E. Tibes U. Stockinger H. Scheuer W.V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 369: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This difference may indicate cell type-specific PLA2 signaling, which could be due to specific expression of PLA2s and AA-metabolizing enzymes, as illustrated for IL-1β-mediated 5-LO and NF-κB activation (88Bonizzi G. Piette J. Merville M.P. Bours V. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5264-5272PubMed Google Scholar, 89Bonizzi G. Piette J. Schoonbroodt S. Greimers R. Havard L. Merville M.P. Bours V. Mol. Cell.

Recently, however, complexes containing HAT activities have been found associated with elongating forms of RNA polymerase II (7Cho H. Orphanides G. Sun X. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y.

It appears to replace the Mediator complex, which interacts with RNA polymerase in the unphosphorylated state during the initiation of transcription. Elongator- and Mediator-polymerase interactions may therefore be reciprocally controlled by the action of CTD kinases (9Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M.

Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a three-subunit Hap complex that interacts with Elongator. As the Hap complex is found associated only with free Elongator, it may serve to regulate Elongator-polymerase interaction as well. Protein complexes were purified from S. cerevisiae strain BJ926 (α/a trp1/+prc1–126/prc1–126 pep4–3/pep4–3 prb1–1122/prb1–1122 can1/can1; from Dr. E.

Purification of Elongator and Hap protein complexes was as described (14Li Y. Bjorklund S. Kim Y.J. Kornberg R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 172-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein subunits were separated in an SDS-9% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidiene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) in 25 mmTris base/192 mm glycine/20% methanol/0.01% SDS and stained with Ponceau S. Protein bands were excised and digestedin situ with trypsin. Peptides were identified by MALDI-reTOF mass spectrometry and by sequencing (15Mann M. Hojrup P. Roepstorff P. Biol.

Cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.8 and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Hap2 protein was purified from the insoluble fraction of a cell lysate as described (18Cairns B.R. Levinson R.S. Yamamoto K.R. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2131-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and was used to raise antibodies in rabbits. For immunoprecipitation, crude anti-Hap2 antiserum (250 µl) was coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (25 µl) (19Li Y. Bjorklund S. Jiang Y.W. Kim Y.J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J. Kornberg R.D. Proc.

To the combined eluates was added 35 µl of 5× SDS gel-loading buffer, and one-third of the mixture was applied to a lane of an SDS gel. Killer sensitivity was assayed as described (20Kishida M. Tokunaga M. Katayose Y. Yajima H. Kawamura-Watabe A. Hishinuma F. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Parental and deletion strains were grown in YPD overnight, with and without 200 µg/ml of G418. Cells were diluted 10-fold with YPD medium, and 5 µl of the diluted cell suspension was spotted on a YPD plate. K. lactis IFO 1267 harboring killer plasmids, pGKL1 and pGKL2, was inoculated on the edge of the cell spot. The plate was incubated at 30 °C overnight to reveal the effect of the secreted killer toxin. Elongator was isolated as a complex with RNA polymerase II from the insoluble fraction of a yeast cell extract (9Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M.

We have also noted its presence, apparently associated with RNA polymerase II, in the soluble fraction (Fig.1 A). Three proteins that comigrated on a MonoQ column with RNA polymerase II from this fraction (marked by dots to the left of the bands in Fig. 1 B,fractions 54–60) were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting and sequencing as the Elongator subunits Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3. All three Elongator subunits were also found in a second peak from the column that contained very little RNA polymerase II (Fig.1 B, fraction 48). The identity of the subunits in the two peaks was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Elp1 and anti-Elp3 antibodies (Fig. 1 C). Additional proteins, with apparent molecular masses of 51, 38, and 31 kDa, comigrated with Elongator in the second peak (marked along with Elongator subunits bysix dots to the left of the bands in Fig. 1 B, fraction 48). We refer to these additional proteins as Hap1, Hap2, and Hap3 (HAT-associatedprotein). Peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-reTOF mass spectrometry and peptide sequencing identified Hap1, Hap2, and Hap3 as the products of yeast open reading frames YPL101W, YHR187W, and YMR312W, respectively. YHR187W was previously recovered from a genetic screen for resistance to killing byK. lactis toxin (11Yajima H. Tokunaga M. Nakayama-Murayama A. Hishinuma F. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and named IKI1. No known functional motifs were found in the Hap protein sequences, but homologs were identified in other organisms by data base searches (Fig.2). Hap1 homologs were particularly widespread, ranging from Schizosaccharomyces pombe toArabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila, mice, and humans (Fig.2 A). Three proteins with the same apparent molecular masses as Hap1, Hap2, and Hap3 were present in a third peak from the MonoQ column (Fig. 1 B, fraction 66). This peak was apparently devoid of both Elongator and RNA polymerase II. Identity of the proteins with the three Haps was confirmed by peptide sequencing and was supported by immunoblotting with anti-Hap2/Iki1 antibodies (Fig. 1 C). Immunoblotting also confirmed the presence of Hap2 in the peak with Elongator (Fig.1 C, fraction 48). Finally, the interaction of Haps with one another and with Elongator in this peak was supported by coimmunoprecipitation with anti-Hap2 antibodies (Fig.1 D). The Haps can therefore be isolated in two forms, as a six-subunit complex with Elongator and as a complex of the three proteins on their own. Elongator can be recovered in three forms, as a complex with RNA polymerase II, as a complex with Haps, and as a three-subunit complex alone (9Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.

If the interactions of Elongator with Haps and with RNA polymerase II are mutually exclusive, then the Haps may regulate the Elongator-polymerase interaction. The function of Hapsin vivo was investigated by deletion of HAP1 andHAP3 genes. In view of the identity of HAP2 withIKI1 and of the interaction of the Hap complex with Elongator, Iki− (sensitivity to K. lactis toxin (11Yajima H. Tokunaga M. Nakayama-Murayama A. Hishinuma F. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)) and Elp− phenotypes were assessed. Both Δhap1 and Δhap3 strains (labeled2 and 3 in Fig. 3) showed killer-insensitive phenotypes, whereas the parental strain (labeled 1) was killer-sensitive. Previously described Elp− phenotypes, slow start and 6-azauracil sensitivity, were weak but apparent (data not shown). Similar weak Elp−phenotypes are characteristic of single Δelp mutants and only become more pronounced in the presence of additional mutations (8Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J.

It might keep the HAT activity of free Elongator in check, allowing histone acetylation only in the presence of a transcribing polymerase (Fig.4 A). Alternatively, interaction with Haps might render Elongator susceptible to modifications affecting its activity (Fig. 4 B). These and other possibilities will be addressed in future studies. We thank Drs. Bradley Cairns and Song-li Wang for helpful discussions and Dr. J. Q. Svejstrup for anti-Elp antibodies."

Soluble C-terminally dimerized ICAM-1 was made by replacing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains with an α-helical coiled coil. Electron microscopy revealed C-terminal dimers that were straight, slightly bent, and sometimes U-shaped. A small number of apparently closed ring-like dimers and W-shaped tetramers were found.

Springer T.A. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Proteins. 2nd Ed. Sambrook and Tooze, New York1999: 228-232Google Scholar). ICAM-1 is expressed basally on the surface of cells important in immune responses. Its expression is enhanced further on these cells and induced on other cell types, including endothelial, epithelial, and fibroblastic cells, by inflammatory mediators. Increased ICAM-1 expression augments immune responses and leukocyte accumulation in inflamed tissues. ICAM-1 contains a binding site for αLβ2 in domain 1 and a binding site for the related leukocyte integrin αMβ2 in domain 3. ICAM-1 is also subverted by the major group of rhinoviruses as a receptor for entry into nasal epithelial cells and by Plasmodium falciparum for sequestration of infected erythrocytes in the peripheral vasculature.ICAM-1 consists of five extracellular IgSF domains (domains 1–5), a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain (1Dustin M.L.

However, the function of dimerization in the context of native, cell surface-expressed ICAM-1 remains to be determined.Multiple modes of dimerization have been suggested for ICAM-1. Previous cross-linking studies have suggested that domain 5 and/or the transmembrane domain can mediate dimerization (10Reilly P.L. Woska Jr., J.R. Jeanfavre D.D. McNally E. Rothlein R. Bormann B.-J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 529-532PubMed Google Scholar, 11Miller J. Knorr R. Ferrone M. Houdei R. Carron C.P. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, a crystal structure of domains 1 and 2 of ICAM-1 revealed a putative dimerization interface on the face containing β-strands B, E, and D (BED sheet) of domain 1. The αLβ2 binding interface is on the opposite side of domain 1 from the dimerization interface, such that the two Glu-34 residues are far from one another and pointing away from the interface. It was hypothesized that two αLβ2 molecules could bind simultaneously to the dimer (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The domain 1 dimerization interface contains at its center hydrophobic residues including leucines 18, 42, 43, and 44 (4). Its hydrophobicity suggests that this interface might be biologically relevant (14Janin J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 973-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the size of this interface is insufficient to drive strong dimerization, leaving its physiologic relevance inconclusive. Furthermore, in another crystal study with domains 1 and 2 of ICAM-1 in which three N-linked glycosylation sites were mutated, this dimer interface was not seen (5Bella J. Kolatkar P.R. Marlor C. Greve J.M. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4140-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Instead, a hydrophilic dimer interface, such as is commonly found in crystal lattice contacts, was seen.Thus far, it has not been clear whether the C-terminal and domain 1 dimer interfaces are structurally compatible with one another. Could dimerization occur at both interfaces simultaneously? Furthermore, what would be the nature of such dimers? One way to reconcile dimerization in domain 1 with dimerization near domain 5 or the transmembrane domain would be if dimerization at these regions occurred in cis, with formation of a closed, ring-like dimer (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). On the other hand, dimerization might occur in trans, linking different pairs of molecules at each interface. Furthermore, it has not yet been established whether domain 1 can, in fact, support dimerization. Moreover, it is not clear whether and how the maintenance of structural constraints by dimerization via domain 1 or the transmembrane domain would affect binding to αLβ2. In this study, we have investigated these issues.DISCUSSIONTo function effectively, ICAM-1 must be displayed with an appropriate orientation, valence, and distribution on the cell surface so it can interact with αLβ2 on the surface of an opposing cell. Furthermore, because αLβ2 and ICAM-1 are often coexpressed on leukocytes, there must be mechanisms that favor interactions between molecules on opposite cells over interactions between molecules on the same cell. Cross-linking of ICAM-1 on the cell surface has shown a predominance of dimers over monomers and also the existence of a substantial proportion of higher order oligomers of > 200 kDa (10Reilly P.L. Woska Jr., J.R. Jeanfavre D.D. McNally E. Rothlein R. Bormann B.-J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 529-532PubMed Google Scholar, 11Miller J. Knorr R. Ferrone M. Houdei R. Carron C.P. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The mAb CA-7 specific for domain 5 of ICAM-1 was found to bind poorly to native cell surface ICAM-1 or ICAM-1 with all but two residues of the cytoplasmic domain deleted, but it bound well to ICAM-1 with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor substituted for its native transmembrane domain. Furthermore, CA-7 bound well to soluble monomeric ICAM-1 but not dimeric ICAM-1 (11Miller J. Knorr R. Ferrone M. Houdei R. Carron C.P. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that ICAM-1 dimerized through its transmembrane domain, in agreement with the presence of a glycine patch in helical wheel displays which favors dimerization to avoid exposure of polar carbonyl and amide backbone groups in the membrane (Fig. 1) (10Reilly P.L. Woska Jr., J.R. Jeanfavre D.D. McNally E. Rothlein R. Bormann B.-J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 529-532PubMed Google Scholar, 11Miller J. Knorr R. Ferrone M. Houdei R. Carron C.P. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The shielding of an epitope in domain 5 is consistent with its proximity to a dimerization interface in the transmembrane domain or with an additional role for domain 5 in dimerization. In a crystal structure of domains 1 and 2 of ICAM-1, a dimerization interface was revealed in domain 1 (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) which presented another possible way in which ICAM-1 could dimerize. Residues important in binding ICAM-1 to αLβ2 are on the side of domain 1 opposite to this dimerization interface; whether dimerization in domain 1 would interfere with binding to ICAM-1 was one of the issues investigated in this study. Monomeric sICAM-1 is a bent rod (2Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 3Kirchhausen T. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); therefore, one way in which dimerization at both the C terminus and in domain 1 could be accommodated would be by formation of a ring-like dimer (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 36Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).In this study, we have for the first time investigated the architecture of ICAM-1 dimers in the electron microscope and have obtained evidence for several different ICAM-1 topologies (Fig.8) and their functional activity. In our initial experiments, we examined ICAM-1 dimers that were linked covalently through a disulfide-bonded C-terminal α-helical coiled coil. We found that C-terminal dimers had the potential for domain 1-mediated dimerization leading to ring-like dimeric and W-shaped tetrameric topologies. U-shaped molecules were also observed, which may represent circles in which noncovalent dimerization through domain 1 was disrupted by contact with the mica (32Carrell N.A. Erickson H.P. McDonagh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 551-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schürmann G. Haspel J. Grumet M. Erickson H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1765-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Figure 8Model of ICAM-1 topomers on the cell surface. ICAM-1 is drawn as five linked ovalsrepresenting domains 1–5 expressed on the cell surface (twoplanes representing the membrane bilayer). The αLβ2 binding site has been localized previously to the face of domain 1 opposite the dimerization interface (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), whereas the αMβ2 binding site is located in domain 3 (37Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and is predicted to lie on the same side of the ICAM-1 molecule as the αLβ2 binding site (see Footnote 3). To maintain the same dimerization interfaces in domains 1 and 5 upon conversion from the ring-like open dimer (A) to the W-shaped tetramer (C), a rotation of ∼180° and some hinge-like motions must occur in one or more of the interdomain linkages located between domains 1 and 5. In the figure, this is symbolized by rotation at the domain 4-domain 5 linkage (circular arrows) and a hinge-like motion at both ends of domain 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Previous studies suggested that in solution, dimerization through domain 1 alone was too unstable to form significant amounts of observable dimers (11Miller J. Knorr R. Ferrone M. Houdei R. Carron C.P. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We tested whether introduction of cysteine residues into appropriate positions in the domain 1 dimer interface visualized in the crystal study would lead to the formation of disulfide-linked dimers. Indeed, cysteine mutations at several sites in domain 1 allowed formation and isolation of disulfide-linked ICAM-1 dimers. Furthermore, disulfide bonds could be formed by substitution to cysteine of Leu-42 or Leu-43, but not Leu-18 or Leu-44. In the crystal-defined dimer interface, the Cβ-Cβ distances for the former but not the latter residues were within the range optimal for disulfide bond formation of 3.41–4.25 Å (24Hazes B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The latter residues were solvent-exposed and could have formed disulfides with a small shift in the monomer-monomer interface. Therefore, the specific disulfide bond formation by Leu-42 and Leu-43 suggests that disulfide bond formation was a consequence of favorable noncovalent interactions at the crystal-defined interface. These data provide evidence for domain 1-mediated dimerization of ICAM-1 in solution in a manner that is consistent with that observed previously in crystal studies (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).We tested whether dimerization in the domain 1 interface would result in an architecture that would be compatible with simultaneous dimerization C-terminal to domain 5. Indeed, domain 1/C-terminal dimers could readily form the predicted ring-like topology. On the cell surface, an equilibrium may exist between closed ring-like and open C-terminal dimers (Fig. 8, A and B).In addition to the ring-like domain 1/C-terminal dimers, we also observed significant amounts of W-shaped tetrameric molecules in which domain 1 and C-terminal dimerization occurs between different pairs of molecules (Fig. 8 C). Maintenance of the same domain 1-domain 1 and domain 5-domain 5 dimer interfaces in the ring-like dimer and in the W-shaped tetramer requires rotation at the domain 1-domain 2, domain 2-domain 3, domain 3-domain 4, or domain 4-domain 5 boundaries totaling ∼180° (for simplicity shown as a rotation about the domain 4-domain 5 boundary, with hinge-like motion at both ends of domain 4 in Fig. 8). A bend has previously been visualized between domains 3 and 4 in ICAM-1 (2Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 3Kirchhausen T. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and most of the rotation may occur at this junction. Rotational or hinge-like movements between domains are consistent with the variation in shapes of the dimeric and tetrameric molecules visualized in this study. Interdomain movement has been visualized at the interface between domains 1 and 2 of ICAM-1 (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and similar movements may occur at other domain interfaces.It has been observed previously that the domain 1 dimer interface is on the opposite side of domain 1 from the αLβ2binding face (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, it is predicted that in both the ring-like and the W-shaped structures, the αLβ2 binding surface in domain 1 would be oriented away from the cell surface, available for integrin engagement (Fig. 8). However, the compatibility of dimerization in domain 1 with ligand binding had not been tested previously. We have measured the affinity of different ICAM-1 topomers for the αLβ2 I domain. Our results show that dimerization in domain 1, C-terminal to domain 5, or at both sites did not impair binding to ICAM-1. Indeed, when corrected for the presence of 2-fold more binding sites, the affinities of the dimers for the I domain are within 1.5-fold of monomeric sICAM-1.The topologies we have defined have important implications for the function of ICAM-1 in cell adhesion. Interactions through domain 1 in the ring-like dimer and W-shaped tetramer will provide constraints on orientation on the cell surface (Fig. 8). Additional constraints may be provided by the putative dimerization interface in domain 5 which masks the CA-7 epitope. Because of symmetry considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the 2-fold rotational symmetry axis within the domain 1 dimer interface will be oriented perpendicular to the membrane, as shown in Fig. 8. This will present the binding site in domain 1 optimally for binding to αLβ2 on an opposing cell, either in the ring-like dimer or in the tetramer configuration (Fig. 8). We predict that the binding site for αMβ2 in domain 3 of ICAM-1 (37Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) is on the same face of ICAM-1 and would also be well exposed in both dimers. 3T. A. Springer, C. Jun, and J. Wang, unpublished data. However, the height above the membrane and orientation of these binding interfaces could differ among the ring-like dimer, open dimer, and W-tetramer, and thus interconversion among these topomers could have important consequences for regulating cell adhesion. For example, binding of αLβ2 to domain 1 and αMβ2 to domain 3 might be affected differently. Moreover, the W tetramers are available for further multimerization through domain 1, and thus long strings of ICAM-1 molecules could be built up which could have important implications for avidity regulation of cell adhesion. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1,1 CD54) is the most important of a group of related immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) molecules that serve as ligands for the integrin αLβ2 (1Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Proteins. 2nd Ed. Sambrook and Tooze, New York1999: 228-232Google Scholar). ICAM-1 is expressed basally on the surface of cells important in immune responses. Its expression is enhanced further on these cells and induced on other cell types, including endothelial, epithelial, and fibroblastic cells, by inflammatory mediators. Increased ICAM-1 expression augments immune responses and leukocyte accumulation in inflamed tissues. ICAM-1 contains a binding site for αLβ2 in domain 1 and a binding site for the related leukocyte integrin αMβ2 in domain 3. ICAM-1 is also subverted by the major group of rhinoviruses as a receptor for entry into nasal epithelial cells and by Plasmodium falciparum for sequestration of infected erythrocytes in the peripheral vasculature. ICAM-1 consists of five extracellular IgSF domains (domains 1–5), a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain (1Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Proteins. 2nd Ed. Sambrook and Tooze, New York1999: 228-232Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Electron micrographs of truncated, soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) show that its five IgSF domains assume a rod-like shape 18.7 nm in length, with a characteristic bend ∼11 nm from the N terminus between domain 3 (D3) and domain 4 (D4) (2Staunton D.E.

Cross-linking of ICAM-1 on the cell surface has shown a predominance of dimers over monomers and also the existence of a substantial proportion of higher order oligomers of > 200 kDa (10Reilly P.L. Woska Jr., J.R. Jeanfavre D.D. McNally E. Rothlein R. Bormann B.-J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 529-532PubMed Google Scholar, 11Miller J. Knorr R. Ferrone M. Houdei R. Carron C.P. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The mAb CA-7 specific for domain 5 of ICAM-1 was found to bind poorly to native cell surface ICAM-1 or ICAM-1 with all but two residues of the cytoplasmic domain deleted, but it bound well to ICAM-1 with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor substituted for its native transmembrane domain. Furthermore, CA-7 bound well to soluble monomeric ICAM-1 but not dimeric ICAM-1 (11Miller J. Knorr R. Ferrone M. Houdei R. Carron C.P. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that ICAM-1 dimerized through its transmembrane domain, in agreement with the presence of a glycine patch in helical wheel displays which favors dimerization to avoid exposure of polar carbonyl and amide backbone groups in the membrane (Fig. 1) (10Reilly P.L. Woska Jr., J.R. Jeanfavre D.D. McNally E. Rothlein R. Bormann B.-J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 529-532PubMed Google Scholar, 11Miller J. Knorr R. Ferrone M. Houdei R. Carron C.P. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The shielding of an epitope in domain 5 is consistent with its proximity to a dimerization interface in the transmembrane domain or with an additional role for domain 5 in dimerization. In a crystal structure of domains 1 and 2 of ICAM-1, a dimerization interface was revealed in domain 1 (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) which presented another possible way in which ICAM-1 could dimerize. Residues important in binding ICAM-1 to αLβ2 are on the side of domain 1 opposite to this dimerization interface; whether dimerization in domain 1 would interfere with binding to ICAM-1 was one of the issues investigated in this study. Monomeric sICAM-1 is a bent rod (2Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 3Kirchhausen T. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); therefore, one way in which dimerization at both the C terminus and in domain 1 could be accommodated would be by formation of a ring-like dimer (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 36Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).In this study, we have for the first time investigated the architecture of ICAM-1 dimers in the electron microscope and have obtained evidence for several different ICAM-1 topologies (Fig.8) and their functional activity. In our initial experiments, we examined ICAM-1 dimers that were linked covalently through a disulfide-bonded C-terminal α-helical coiled coil. We found that C-terminal dimers had the potential for domain 1-mediated dimerization leading to ring-like dimeric and W-shaped tetrameric topologies. U-shaped molecules were also observed, which may represent circles in which noncovalent dimerization through domain 1 was disrupted by contact with the mica (32Carrell N.A. Erickson H.P. McDonagh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 551-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schürmann G. Haspel J. Grumet M. Erickson H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1765-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Previous studies suggested that in solution, dimerization through domain 1 alone was too unstable to form significant amounts of observable dimers (11Miller J. Knorr R. Ferrone M. Houdei R. Carron C.P. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We tested whether introduction of cysteine residues into appropriate positions in the domain 1 dimer interface visualized in the crystal study would lead to the formation of disulfide-linked dimers. Indeed, cysteine mutations at several sites in domain 1 allowed formation and isolation of disulfide-linked ICAM-1 dimers. Furthermore, disulfide bonds could be formed by substitution to cysteine of Leu-42 or Leu-43, but not Leu-18 or Leu-44. In the crystal-defined dimer interface, the Cβ-Cβ distances for the former but not the latter residues were within the range optimal for disulfide bond formation of 3.41–4.25 Å (24Hazes B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The latter residues were solvent-exposed and could have formed disulfides with a small shift in the monomer-monomer interface. Therefore, the specific disulfide bond formation by Leu-42 and Leu-43 suggests that disulfide bond formation was a consequence of favorable noncovalent interactions at the crystal-defined interface. These data provide evidence for domain 1-mediated dimerization of ICAM-1 in solution in a manner that is consistent with that observed previously in crystal studies (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).We tested whether dimerization in the domain 1 interface would result in an architecture that would be compatible with simultaneous dimerization C-terminal to domain 5. Indeed, domain 1/C-terminal dimers could readily form the predicted ring-like topology. On the cell surface, an equilibrium may exist between closed ring-like and open C-terminal dimers (Fig. 8, A and B).In addition to the ring-like domain 1/C-terminal dimers, we also observed significant amounts of W-shaped tetrameric molecules in which domain 1 and C-terminal dimerization occurs between different pairs of molecules (Fig. 8 C). Maintenance of the same domain 1-domain 1 and domain 5-domain 5 dimer interfaces in the ring-like dimer and in the W-shaped tetramer requires rotation at the domain 1-domain 2, domain 2-domain 3, domain 3-domain 4, or domain 4-domain 5 boundaries totaling ∼180° (for simplicity shown as a rotation about the domain 4-domain 5 boundary, with hinge-like motion at both ends of domain 4 in Fig. 8). A bend has previously been visualized between domains 3 and 4 in ICAM-1 (2Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 3Kirchhausen T. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and most of the rotation may occur at this junction. Rotational or hinge-like movements between domains are consistent with the variation in shapes of the dimeric and tetrameric molecules visualized in this study. Interdomain movement has been visualized at the interface between domains 1 and 2 of ICAM-1 (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and similar movements may occur at other domain interfaces.It has been observed previously that the domain 1 dimer interface is on the opposite side of domain 1 from the αLβ2binding face (4Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-h. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, it is predicted that in both the ring-like and the W-shaped structures, the αLβ2 binding surface in domain 1 would be oriented away from the cell surface, available for integrin engagement (Fig. 8). However, the compatibility of dimerization in domain 1 with ligand binding had not been tested previously. We have measured the affinity of different ICAM-1 topomers for the αLβ2 I domain. Our results show that dimerization in domain 1, C-terminal to domain 5, or at both sites did not impair binding to ICAM-1. Indeed, when corrected for the presence of 2-fold more binding sites, the affinities of the dimers for the I domain are within 1.5-fold of monomeric sICAM-1.The topologies we have defined have important implications for the function of ICAM-1 in cell adhesion. Interactions through domain 1 in the ring-like dimer and W-shaped tetramer will provide constraints on orientation on the cell surface (Fig. 8). Additional constraints may be provided by the putative dimerization interface in domain 5 which masks the CA-7 epitope. Because of symmetry considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the 2-fold rotational symmetry axis within the domain 1 dimer interface will be oriented perpendicular to the membrane, as shown in Fig. 8. This will present the binding site in domain 1 optimally for binding to αLβ2 on an opposing cell, either in the ring-like dimer or in the tetramer configuration (Fig. 8). We predict that the binding site for αMβ2 in domain 3 of ICAM-1 (37Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) is on the same face of ICAM-1 and would also be well exposed in both dimers. 3T. A. Springer, C. Jun, and J. Wang, unpublished data. However, the height above the membrane and orientation of these binding interfaces could differ among the ring-like dimer, open dimer, and W-tetramer, and thus interconversion among these topomers could have important consequences for regulating cell adhesion. For example, binding of αLβ2 to domain 1 and αMβ2 to domain 3 might be affected differently. Moreover, the W tetramers are available for further multimerization through domain 1, and thus long strings of ICAM-1 molecules could be built up which could have important implications for avidity regulation of cell adhesion. To function effectively, ICAM-1 must be displayed with an appropriate orientation, valence, and distribution on the cell surface so it can interact with αLβ2 on the surface of an opposing cell.

Phosphorylation of PLSCR1 by cellular PKCδ has recently been implicated in promoting the transbilayer movement of plasma membrane PLs that results in cell surface exposure of PS in apoptotic cells (10Frasch S.C. Henson P.M. Kailey J.M. Richter D.A. Janes M.S. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23065-23073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Expression of cellular PLSCR1 is highly induced by IFNs, although the biologic significance of the marked transcriptional up-regulation of PLSCR1 by IFNs remains unknown (11Zhou Q.S. Zhao J. Al Zoghaibi F. Zhou A.M. Wiedmer T. Silverman R.H. Sims P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, increased expression of PLSCR1 following IFN treatment was not accompanied by any detectable change in transbilayer distribution of plasma membrane PS, nor was any increase in transbilayer PL scrambling in response to either Ca2+ ionophore or to induction of apoptosis observed (11Zhou Q.S. Zhao J. Al Zoghaibi F. Zhou A.M. Wiedmer T. Silverman R.H. Sims P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether the PL scramblase activity of PLSCR1 is under regulation by an obligatory co-factor that is unaffected by IFN, or whether the PL scramblase activity of the plasma membrane might be mediated by another factor. In mouse, a spontaneous mutation in PLSCR1 (designated TRA1) resulting in N-terminal truncation through codon 118 was associated with a leukemogenic transformation of monocytes, whereas a down-regulation of mutant TRA1 expression with induction of expression of the wild-type gene was found to occur upon induced differentiation of the leukemogenic monocytes to terminal macrophages (12Kasukabe T. Okabe-Kado J. Honma Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 2975-2985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How this apparent association of a truncation mutation in PLSCR1 with leukemogenic transformation might relate to the putative role of this protein in apoptotic cells or to its effects on membrane PLs also remains unknown. The N-terminal segment of PLSCR1 that is deleted in the TRA1 mutation is notable for being highly proline-rich and containing multiple PXXP motifs that might serve as binding sites for cellular proteins containing SH3 domains (13Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quillam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This N-terminal segment of the PLSCR1 polypeptide is also notable for the relatively low conservation of amino acid sequence when the PLSCR1–4 polypeptides are aligned (7Wiedmer T. Zhou Q.S. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Here we report evidence that c-Abl binds to this segment of PLSCR1 and phosphorylates PLSCR1 at two tyrosine residues (Tyr69/Tyr74) within a tandem repeat sequence in the N-terminal region of PLSCR1. The Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 is Abl-dependent and is induced by the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin. The murine anti-PLSCR1 mAbs 1D4, 4D2, and 219.1 were produced in our laboratory. 1D4 and 4D2 recognize human PLSCR1, whereas 219.1 recognizes both human and murine PLSCR1. Rabbit anti-human PLSCR1 polyclonal antibody αC was raised against the C-terminal 306–318 peptide of human PLSCR1, and rabbit anti-murine PLSCR1 polyclonal antibody 4720 was raised against the N terminus of murine PLSCR1. The anti-Abl mAb 24-11, anti-Abl polyclonal antibody K-12, and anti-Tyr(P) mAb PY99 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Abl mAb 8E9 was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA), and anti-MBP serum was from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B and Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The pSLX-c-Abl vector and the artificial Abl substrate GST-CTD-CRK fusion protein construct were described earlier (14Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The GST-Abl kinase domain fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. W. Todd Miller (State University of New York at Stony Brook). STI571 was the gift of Dr. Elisabeth Buchdunger (Novartis Pharma AG, Switzerland). Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). Effectene transfection reagent was obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets (containing inhibitors for serine and cysteine proteases) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals(Indianapolis, IN). All other chemicals, unless otherwise noted, were obtained from Sigma. The Abl−/− mouse fibroblasts, the Abl+/+ mouse fibroblasts that were reconstituted with c-Abl cDNA by retroviral infection of the Abl−/− fibroblasts (15Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14225-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Human Raji S5 cell line was established by stable transfection of Burkitt's B-cell lymphoma Raji cells with human PLSCR1 cDNA. Raji S5, chronic myelogenous leukemia K562, and acute T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. In certain experiments, cells were incubated with 50 µm cisplatin, 10 µm STI571, or 0.1 mm pervanadate for the times indicated in the figure legends. Exponentially growing 293T cells were transiently transfected by using Effectene transfection reagent according to manufacturer's suggestions. At 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and used immediately for experiments. The GST-SH3 domain fusion proteins containing SH3 domains of Abl, Crk, Fgr, and spectrin were kind gifts from Dr. Bingcheng Wang (Case Western Reserve University), those containing the SH3 domains of Src, Nck, Grb2, phospholipase Cγ, and p85 were generously provided by Dr. David D. Schlaepfer (The Scripps Research Institute), and the GST-Yes SH3 domain fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. Marius Sudol (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs encoding either full-length PLSCR1 (amino acids 1–318), or full-length PLSCR1 containing point mutations at Y69F/Y74F, Y69F, or Y74F, or the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–118), or the N-terminal truncated form (amino acids 119–318) of PLSCR1 were cloned into pMAL-C2 using the polymerase chain reaction-based method as previously described (16Zhou Q. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2356-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). MBP fusion proteins were expressed inE. coli and purified by affinity chromatography using amylose resin as previously described (1Zhou Q.S. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). After elution from the amylose resin, the recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and ultracentrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min to remove any aggregated protein. For a typical in vitro binding assay, 25 µg of GST-SH3 domain fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with 5 µg/ml MBP-PLSCR1 fusion protein in 100 µl of Binding Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol containing protease inhibitor mixture) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were sedimented by centrifugation and washed extensively with Binding Buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 4% β-mercaptoethanol, resolved on a 10% Tris glycine Novex gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and detected by Western blotting with anti-MBP antibody. Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with ice-cold Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes for further use. Cell lysates containing 100–500 µg of protein were precleared by incubation with 20 µl of a 50% slurry of Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle rotation. The supernatants were incubated with 2–10 µg of antibody for 2 h on ice and Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads were added to precipitate the immune complex by rotating at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 2 min and washed extensively. Immunoprecipitates were either stored at −80 °C for use in the kinase assays, or solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer for use in Western blotting. For Western blotting, proteins were resolved on 10% or 12% Tris glycine Novex gels and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% (w/v) blotto, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with primary antibody and 1 h with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed using SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrates (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Full-length c-Abl immunoprecipitated from 293T cells transfected with pSLX-c-Abl or GST-Abl kinase domain fusion protein purified from E. coliwas used to Tyr phosphorylate PLSCR1 in vitro. In a total volume of 20 µl of reaction mixture, 4 µg of either MBP-PLSCR1 or GST-CTD-CRK fusion protein was used as substrate in kinase assay buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (17Lewis J.M. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The reactions were initiated by addition of 1 µl of 0.8 mmATP containing 20 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP or 1 mm cold ATP. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography or Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) mAb PY99. Exponentially growing 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSLX-c-Abl or vector control by using Effectene transfection reagent. At 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested. Basal level and calcium ionophore-induced cell surface exposure of PS of the transfected cells were detected by the specific binding of coagulation factor Va as described previously (2Zhao J. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6603-6606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of human PLSCR1 reveals that its cytoplasmic segment contains a proline-rich segment (residues 1–118), which includes multiple PXXP motifs with potential to interact with protein SH3 domains. In order to gain initial insight into what cellular SH3-containing proteins might interact with PLSCR1 through this proline-rich segment of the polypeptide, we screened 13 different SH3 domains expressed as GST fusion proteins for their ability to specifically bind to PLSCR1, expressed as the fusion construct MBP-PLSCR1 (Fig. 1). This initial screen revealed a marked specificity of PLSCR1 for binding to the SH3 domain of the Abl tyrosine kinase, with >25% of the input MBP-PLSCR1 captured. We were unable to detect specific binding of PLSCR1 to any of the other SH3 fusion constructs tested, with the exception of a comparatively minor interaction with the spectrin SH3 domain. This apparent avidity of the MBP-PLSCR1 fusion construct for selectively binding to the Abl SH3 domain was also confirmed for native PLSCR1, purified from human erythrocyte membranes (data not shown). The potential for the cellular PLSCR1 and Abl proteins to interact was next explored by immunoprecipitation of the proteins from detergent lysates of 293T cells co-transfected with plasmids containing PLSCR1 and c-Abl cDNAs. As shown in Fig.2 A, immunoprecipitation performed using mAb 1D4 specific for PLSCR1 resulted in the co-precipitation of c-Abl antigen, whereas immunoprecipitation performed using mAb 24-11 specific for c-Abl resulted in the co-precipitation of PLSCR1 antigen. In various experiments, ∼1–5% of total cellular PLSCR1 and c-Abl were found to co-immunoprecipitate. Similar results were obtained by immunoprecipitation of c-Abl and PLSCR1 from the Raji S5 human cell line (data not shown). The Philadelphia chromosome of chronic myelogenous leukemia produces the Bcr-Abl fusion oncoprotein with intact Abl SH3 domain. The physical association of PLSCR1 with Bcr-Abl was examined in K562 cells. Both Bcr-Abl and c-Abl were detected in the immunoprecipitated proteins with the αC polyclonal antibody against PLSCR1 (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that plasma membrane PLSCR1 forms an intracellular complex with cytoplasmic c-Abl and Bcr-Abl, presumably through interaction of the Abl SH3 domain with one or more PXXP motifs contained within the endofacial N-terminal segment of PLSCR1. The physical association of PLSCR1 and Abl proteins in mammalian cells suggested that PLSCR1 might also be a substrate for Abl tyrosine kinase. To test whether c-Abl has the capacity to phosphorylate PLSCR1,in vitro kinase assays were first performed using full-length c-Abl immunoprecipitated from c-Abl-transfected 293T cells. Under these conditions, c-Abl exhibited constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in phosphorylation of both the Abl model substrate GST-CTD-CRK and human PLSCR1 purified from erythrocyte membranes. No phosphorylation of PLSCR1 was observed in the control immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3, left panel). The phosphorylation of PLSCR1 on the Tyr residue(s) was confirmed by Western blotting using mAb PY99 specific for Tyr(P) (data not shown). By contrast, a recombinant construct containing only the c-Abl kinase domain phosphorylated the model substrate GST-CTD-CRK but failed to phosphorylate PLSCR1 from erythrocytes (Fig. 3, right panel). These results suggest that an interaction of PLSCR1 with another domain of c-Abl, presumably the SH3 domain, is required for its efficient phosphorylation by the enzyme. The proline-rich N-terminal peptide of PLSCR1 (residues 1–118) was confirmed as the portion of the protein that is responsible for binding to the Abl SH3 domain, and as the segment of PLSCR1 that is also phosphorylated by c-Abl kinase (Fig. 4). Consistent with this interpretation, deletion of this segment of PLSCR1 abolished its binding to the Abl SH3 domain as well as abrogated phosphorylation of PLSCR1 by c-Abl (Fig. 4). Although the SH3 domain-binding site in PLSCR1 remains to be mapped, it presumably encompasses one or more of the five PXXP motifs within the segment spanning residues 1–118. Analysis of the efficiency of Abl kinase for various peptide substrates has suggested a potential consensus sequence for the Abl-preferred phosphorylation site of -IYAXP- (18Till J.H. Chan P.M. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4995-5003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Whereas the PLSCR1 polypeptide contains no exact match to this putative Abl substrate consensus sequence, it does contain homologous sequence within the tandem repeat68VYNQPVYNQP77. This suggested that Tyr69 and Tyr74 were the most likely site(s) of tyrosine phosphorylation by Abl kinase. We generated MBP-PLSCR1 fusion proteins containing double or single Tyr to Phe mutations at Tyr69 and/or Tyr74. As shown in Fig.5, these MBP-PLSCR1 fusion proteins did not affect binding between Abl SH3 domain and PLSCR1. By contrast, mutation at either residue Tyr69 or Tyr74 in this segment of PLSCR1 markedly reduced phosphorylation by c-Abl, and the phosphorylation by c-Abl was eliminated when both residues Tyr69 and Tyr74 were mutated to phenylalanine. These results suggested residues Tyr69 and Tyr74 as the sites of phosphorylation by c-Abl. Alternatively, Tyr69 and Tyr74 are required for c-Abl mediated phosphorylation of PLSCR1 at other Tyr residues within the polypeptide. To explore whether intracellular PLSCR1 might also be Tyr-phosphorylated by either c-Abl or by other tyrosine kinase(s), PLSCR1 was immunoprecipitated from 293T cells and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The presence of Tyr phosphorylation in the PLSCR1 polypeptide was determined by Western blotting with PY99 antibody (Fig.6). The extent of Tyr(P) modification detected in cellular PLSCR1 was markedly increased by prior transfection with cDNA for c-Abl (Fig. 6). Constitutive Tyr phosphorylation was also detected in PLSCR1 immunoprecipitated from Jurkat, K562, and Raji S5 cell lines (data not shown). Whereas phosphorylation of PLSCR1 by activated protein kinase Cδ has been implicated to promote accelerated transbilayer movement of plasma membrane PS, we were unable to detect any change in cell surface exposure of PS in response to the Tyr phosphorylation of plasma membrane PLSCR1 by c-Abl (data not shown). PLSCR1 is constitutively Tyr-phosphorylated and the extent of this phosphorylation is further increased by overexpression of c-Abl, implying that PLSCR1 might be a normal substrate of endogenous c-Abl kinase. In order to explore this possibility, we first determined whether the basal Tyr phosphorylation detected in PLSCR1 was affected by prior treatment of the cells with the Abl kinase inhibitor STI571. STI571 is a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative that exhibits selectivity in inhibiting the Abl tyrosine kinase. STI571 has been reported to be essentially inactive against all Ser/Thr kinases and most Tyr kinases tested, with the exception of known inhibitory activity toward the PDGF receptor kinase and c-kit kinase (19Carroll M. Ohno-Jones S. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Gilliland D.G. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 4947-4952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Buchdunger E. Cioffi C.L. Law N. Stover D. Ohno-Jones S. Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 139-145PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 A, prior incubation of 293T cells with this inhibitor effectively abrogated Tyr phosphorylation detected in PLSCR1, implying that PLSCR1 is constitutively phosphorylated by c-Abl, or by another tyrosine kinase inactivated by STI571. Similar results were obtained in Jurkat T and Raji S5 cells (data not shown). The direct role of c-Abl in regulating Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 was next examined in murine 3T3 cells deficient in the c-Abl kinase. Endogenous PLSCR1 was immunoprecipitated from either Abl−/− or Abl+/+ fibroblasts using antibody 4720 specific for murine PLSCR1, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and probed with either anti-Tyr(P) mAb PY99, or anti-PLSCR1 mAb 219.1 (Fig. 7 B). As these data indicate, Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 detected in the Abl+/+ fibroblasts was virtually abolished in the Abl−/− fibroblasts, implying that the c-Abl kinase accounts for most, if not all, of the Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 detected in mammalian cells. Due to the relatively low level of Tyr phosphorylation detected in murine PLSCR1, in these experiments 0.1 mm pervanadate was added to the cell cultures prior to cell lysis and immunoprecipitation (see legend, Fig. 7). c-Abl kinase is activated in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents, including the chemotherapeutic compound cisplatin (21Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). We therefore explored whether such genotoxic activation of c-Abl might also lead to an increase in phosphorylation of cellular PLSCR1 (Fig. 8). As illustrated by the data of Fig. 8 A, Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 was observed to increase in cells exposed to cisplatin, with maximum phosphorylation detected 2 h after cisplatin addition, and such phosphorylation was blocked by STI571. Activation of the kinase activity of c-Abl in cells exposed to cisplatin was confirmed by in vitro kinase assay of the immunoprecipitated c-Abl (Fig. 8 B). As expected, the induction of Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 by cisplatin was not observed in Abl−/− fibroblasts (Fig.9).Figure 9The induction of Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 by cisplatin is Abl-dependent. Abl+/+ and Abl−/− mouse fibroblasts were treated with or without 50 µm cisplatin for 2 h. During the last 20 min, cells were treated with 0.1 mm pervanadate. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-murine PLSCR1 antibody 4720. Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 was detected by Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) mAb PY99 (upper panel). Abundance of immunoprecipitated PLSCR1 protein in each lane was detected with anti-PLSCR1 mAb 219.1 (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our data establish that the Abl SH3 domain binds to the N-terminal proline-rich segment of PLSCR1 and that c-Abl phosphorylates Tyr residues of the PLSCR1 polypeptide, most likely Tyr69 and Tyr74 within the tandem repeat sequence68VYNQPVYNQP78. The c-Abl tyrosine kinase appears to maintain a basal level of Tyr phosphorylation of plasma membrane PLSCR1 at steady state, and this level is increased by exposure of cells to genotoxic stress. Although the functional implications of this interaction remain to be clarified, it is of interest to note that both c-Abl and PLSCR1 have been implicated in apoptosis, whereas mutations affecting putative regulatory domains within both c-Abl and PLSCR1 have been associated with oncogenic transformation and cell proliferation (10Frasch S.C.

Acta. 1997; 1333: F201-F216PubMed Google Scholar). As previously described, PLSCR1 has been shown to promote a Ca2+- and pH-dependent transbilayer movement of PLs in liposomes reconstituted with this protein that mimics the intrinsic PL scramblase activity of the plasma membrane (8Bassé F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 25Stout J.G. Bassé F. Luhm R.A. Weiss H.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2232-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the identity of PLSCR1 as the protein that mediates the intrinsic PL scramblase activity of the plasma membrane remains unresolved. Whereas our results suggest an interesting link between c-Abl tyrosine kinase and PLSCR1, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1 does not appear to directly stimulate plasma membrane PL scramblase activity. Moreover, the rapid increase in PLSCR1 tyrosine phosphorylation following cisplatin exposure does not temporally correlate with the delayed apoptotic response and consequent cell surface PS exposure in cisplatin-treated cells. Thus, either the PL scramblase activity of PLSCR1 is regulated through mechanism(s) other than Tyr phosphorylation by c-Abl, or accelerated transbilayer movement of plasma membrane PLs may be mediated by another protein, possibly another member of the PLSCR gene family. Potentially divergent biological roles of the various members of thePLSCR gene family is suggested by marked differences in their tissue distribution (7Wiedmer T. Zhou Q.S. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), by the marked differences in amino acid sequence in the proline-rich N-terminal segments of these proteins (7Wiedmer T. Zhou Q.S. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and by the observation that only PLSCR1 appears to be under transcriptional regulation by IFN among the four known members of the human PLSCR gene family. 2Q. Zhou, T. Wiedmer, J. Zhao, R. H. Silverman, and P. J. Sims, unpublished data. In this context, it is also of interest to note that the tandem repeat sequence68VYNQPVYNQP78 of PLSCR1 is not found in the other PLSCR family members, and we were unable to detect any evidence for Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR2–4 by c-Abl (data not shown). c-Abl tyrosine kinase was identified as the cellular homologue of theGag-v-Abl oncogene in Abelson murine leukemia virus (26Goff S.P. Gilboa E. Witte O.N. Baltimore D. Cell. 1980; 22: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The c-Abl gene is ubiquitously expressed and encodes two 145-kDa isoforms differing in their N termini (27Ben Neriah Y. Bernards A. Paskind M. Daley G.Q. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 44: 577-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 28Renshaw M.W. Capozza M.A. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The humanc-Abl gene on chromosome 9 is translocated to form the Philadelphia chromosome that is characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia (29Sawyers C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1330-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The Philadelphia chromosome produces an abnormal Bcr-Abl fusion protein with a constitutively active tyrosine kinase (30McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In leukemia cells, Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase has been linked to a large number of signal transduction pathways that are normally regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases (24Raitano A.B. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F201-F216PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast to the transforming properties of v-Abl and Bcr-Abl, overproduction of c-Abl does not transform cells, but rather can inhibit cell growth and induce cell death (31Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Goga A. Havlik M. Witte O. Cell. 1994; 77: 121-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 32Cong F. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13819-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The c-Abl protein is localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm (33Van Etten R.A. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). As expected of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, c-Abl has been linked to the transduction of extracellular signals through interaction with cell surface receptors. The c-Abl tyrosine kinase is regulated by integrins (17Lewis J.M. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), as well as the platelet-derived growth factor (34Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M.

The c-Abl tyrosine kinase contains three nuclear localization signals and a nuclear export signal, and it can shuttle between the nuclear and extranuclear compartments (35Taagepera S. McDonald D. Loeb J.E. Whitaker L.L. McElroy A.K. Wang J.Y. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7457-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Recent results have suggested a role for the nuclear c-Abl tyrosine kinase in the regulation of apoptosis (22Wang J.Y.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5643-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Indeed, even the oncogenic Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase can activate apoptosis when it is trapped in the nucleus of leukemia cells (36Vigneri P. Wang J.Y.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic function of nuclear Abl tyrosine kinase has been shown to contribute to the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin, presumably through the activation of p73 (14Gong J.G. Costanzo A.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that the Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 by c-Abl was also substantially increased by cisplatin treatment implying an interaction with activated c-Abl kinase that translocates to the plasma membrane under these conditions. It remains to be determined how this interaction between PLSCR1 and activated c-Abl kinase contributes to the overall cellular response to DNA damage. Mutations of both c-Abl and PLSCR1 have been associated with oncogenic transformation. Deletion of the N-terminal proline-rich region (codons 1–118) of PLSCR1 resulted in the loss of binding to the Abl SH3 domain (Fig. 4). Such truncation of PLSCR1 mimics a spontaneous mutation in murine PLSCR1 (designated as TRA1), which has been linked to a leukemogenic transformation in the MM monocytic cell line (12Kasukabe T. Okabe-Kado J. Honma Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 2975-2985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, transfection of cDNA encoding this mutant PLSCR1 to nonleukemogenic monocytic cells was reported to induce a leukemogenic transformation of these cells (12Kasukabe T. Okabe-Kado J. Honma Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 2975-2985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The actual role of PLSCR1 in the regulation of cell proliferation, and how this might relate to interaction with the Abl kinases, also remains to be explored. Both of the oncogenic proteins Bcr-Abl and v-Abl show an extranuclear localization (33Van Etten R.A. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Myristoylation of the v-Abl polypeptide has been suggested to facilitate its transforming activity for fibroblasts, implying a possible relationship of a membrane localization to its transforming potential (40Daley G.Q. McLaughlin J. Witte O.N. Baltimore D. Science. 1987; 237: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that PLSCR1 might modulate the transforming activities of extranuclear Abl kinases by affecting localization within the cell, including access to other substrates within the plasma membrane.

In the cyst state the modified vegetative cell (central body) is surrounded by a protective capsule consisting of a thin outer layer (exine) and a thicker inner layer (intine), both rich in proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. When the requirements for growth are again fulfilled, the A. vinelandii cell escapes the cyst capsule and re-enters the vegetative state.An important component in the intine and exine layers is alginate, a 1,4-linked linear polysaccharide consisting of β-d-mannuronic acid (M),1 and its C-5 epimer, α-l-guluronic acid (G). The M- and G-moieties are distributed as heteropolymeric (MG) and/or homopolymeric (MM or GG) blocks in the polymers (10Fischer F.G. Dõrfel H. Z. Phys.

A. vinelandii in addition synthesizes alginates during vegetative growth. This vegetative capsule seems to be responsible for bacterial adhesion to surfaces and may function as a diffusion barrier against O2 or heavy metals (19Clementi F. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1997; 17: 327-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Bacterial alginates are O-acetylated in varying degrees at O-2 and/or O-3 on mannuronic acid moieties (20Skjåk-Bræk G.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AlgE epimerases consist of varying numbers of two types of structural modules, A and R, of which the A-module alone is capable of catalyzing epimerization and determining the final distribution of G-moieties in the produced alginates (30Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The R-modules contain four to seven Ca2+-binding motifs, and the direct binding of Ca2+ by this module, as well as by the A-module, has been demonstrated previously (30Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The R-modules stimulate reaction rates and are probably involved in export of the AlgE proteins (23Ertesvåg H. Doseth B. Larsen B.

By producing a family of alginate epimerases, A. vinelandii is able to synthesize a variety of alginates with different physicochemical properties, the exact biological function of which is not yet clearly understood.The genomes of alginate-synthesizing organisms encode alginases that degrade the polymers at specific uronic acid sequences, but most bacterial lyases display low activity against the native highly acetylated polymers (33Gacesa P. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 34Sutherland I.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 323-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 35Sutherland I.W. Carbohydr. Polym. 1999; 38: 319-328Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The alginases associated with A. vinelandii are reported to cleave M-rich alginates most effectively (36Ertesvåg H. Erlien F. Skjåk-Bræk G. Rehm B.H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3779-3784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kennedy L. McDowell K. Sutherland I.W. J. Gen.

Sutherland I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 98: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), even though the periplasmic AlgL enzyme degrades M-G bonds with similar efficiency as M-M bonds (36Ertesvåg H. Erlien F. Skjåk-Bræk G. Rehm B.H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3779-3784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the AlgE7 protein displays both epimerase and lyase activity (29Svanem B.I.G. Skjåk-Bræk G. Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 68-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 1987 Gacesa (40Gacesa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 199-202Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) proposed that the reaction mechanism of these two enzyme activities were very similar (Fig. 1). Both mechanisms include removal of H-5 of the uronic acid, but instead of a replacement of this proton from the opposite side of the sugar ring as in epimerization, the alginases catalyze a β-elimination of the 4-O-glycosidic bond, generating unsaturated 4-deoxy-l-erythro-hex-4-enepyranosyluronate moieties at the non-reducing end. Based on stereochemical considerations, Feingold and Bentley (41Feingold D.S. Bentley R. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) predicted that a similar reaction mechanism could apply to both M-specific and G-specific lyases. If these theoretical considerations are correct it seemed possible that the AlgE7 lyase and epimerase activities originate from the same active site in the enzyme. In this paper we examine the relationship between these two reactions mediated by AlgE7, and the results strongly support the hypothesis that a common site is responsible for both activities.DISCUSSIONThe results reported here strongly suggest that not only are lyase and epimerase reactions mechanistically related but that they can both be catalyzed by the same active site in an enzyme. However, despite the very large number of alginate lyases studied (59Wong T.Y. Preston L.A. Schiller N.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 289-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), only AlgE7 has been reported to display this capacity at comparable rates. This obviously raises the question as to what conditions have to be met for AlgE7 to act as an epimerase and/or a lyase. The activity patterns observed when different alginate substrates were used showed that acetylation and continuous stretches of G-moieties are inhibitory for both reactions (Fig. 4 A and Table II), and a simple explanation for this could be that the common alginate binding site is incompatible with such a substrate composition. It is, however, more difficult to envision what determines whether the enzyme acts as a lyase or an epimerase on substrates that can be converted by one or both activities (i.e. mannuronan and the M. pyrifera alginate). When using pure mannuronan as substrate, the reaction rate is much faster for the epimerase up to a point where the substrate has become highly degraded, where after the lyase activity strongly dominates on the small depolymerized oligomers (DP < 11) (Fig. 6). This indicates that small oligomers are readily bound by the enzyme but that for the epimerization pathway to be favored, longer alginates are needed. This assumption is in good agreement with a recent study that showed that epimerization by AlgE4 and AlgE2 cannot take place on mannuronan substrates smaller than 8 and 6 moieties, respectively, 2M. Hartmann, D. B. Holm, G. A. B. Johansen, G. Skjåk-Bræk, and B. T. Stokke, submitted for publication. whereas AlgE7 is clearly able to degrade to smaller fragments. The same way of thinking may also explain the strong dominance of the lyase activity on the M. pyrifera alginate. AlgE7 can obviously bind to this polymer, but it may be that epimerization is somehow more sterically hindered by the nature of the substrate. These differences in substrate selectivity might be explained by assuming different stereochemical requirements for binding and positioning of the alginate substrate in the lyase compared with the epimerase reaction (Fig. 1).Based on results from NMR spectroscopy, potential cleavage sites for the AlgE7 lyase were G↓MM and/or G↓GM, whereas M↓MM and/or M↓GM sequences are less favorable. G↓MG sequences were also found to be cleavable (MG-alginates) but with strongly reduced efficiency. The fact that G-moieties dominated at the reducing end even when mannuronan was used as substrate highlights the complexity of the interplay between the lyase and epimerase activities. It probably means that the initially higher epimerase activity results in the formation of a new substrate that is more favorable for the lyase than the substrate provided from the start. Similarly, G↓MG sequences appear to be poorly cleavable, but the activity on substrates containing many such triads (like the MG-alginate) is self-stimulated by introducing cleavable G↓GM-sequences through the fill-in capacity of the epimerase activity.Even if pure mannuronan and the deacetylated M-rich alginate (∼5% G) are very similar substrates, the data obtained from complete degradation differed in that the total G-content (and FGG) and especially the amount of internal G-moieties was significantly higher in the M-rich alginate (Table II). As a consequence of this, the average size of the final oligomers was also higher. This may indicate that the AlgE7 epimerase preferentially attacks M-moieties next to a G in the alginate chains, as this mode of action (preferred attack) probably will result in formation of short G-blocks, which in turn inhibit the AlgE7 lyase from cleavage.Although there are obviously certain amino acid residues that are essential for both cleavage and epimerization to take place (like Asp-152), the experiments reported here indicate that the specificity of these reactions appears to be affected by many other residues in the protein. This was clearly illustrated by the reaction products of the hybrid enzyme AlgE7-E1, which more frequently contained M-moieties at the reducing ends compared with the products of the native AlgE7 reaction. The hybrid enzyme also generated stronger ΔG signals relative to those of ΔM, when the MG-alginate was used as substrate (Fig. 5 C), and the final DPn was lower (Table II). For epimerization, the previously reported variability in the epimerization patterns among the AlgE family enzymes support a similar conclusion (45Ramstad M. Ellingsen T.E. Josefsen K.D. Høidal H.K. Valla S. Skjåk-Bræk G. Levine D.W. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1999; 24: 636-646Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 56Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Schjerven H. Svanem B.I.G. Valla S. Metab. Eng. 1999; 1: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and here we also noted that the M. pyrifera substrate strongly favors the lyase reaction, whereas the same substrate could easily be epimerized from its original 41% G to 66% by AlgE6 (NMR data not shown). These observations all suggest that the specificity of both the lyase and epimerase activities are the result of presumably slight differences in the folding structures of the enzymes, and to understand the nature of these effects, it seems obvious that a three-dimensional structure of at least one of the A-modules would be very important.Another interesting question not addressed here is what biological significance the dual properties of AlgE7 might have. It seems likely that this is somehow related to cyst formation, as it is known that such differentiated cells contain different types of alginates (15Page W.J. Sadoff H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 145-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is also known that the expression of the AlgE enzymes are affected by the conditions that lead to induction of cyst formation (53Høidal H.K. Svanem B.I.G. Gimmestad M. Valla S. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).

In the cyst state the modified vegetative cell (central body) is surrounded by a protective capsule consisting of a thin outer layer (exine) and a thicker inner layer (intine), both rich in proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. When the requirements for growth are again fulfilled, the A. vinelandii cell escapes the cyst capsule and re-enters the vegetative state. An important component in the intine and exine layers is alginate, a 1,4-linked linear polysaccharide consisting of β-d-mannuronic acid (M),1 and its C-5 epimer, α-l-guluronic acid (G). The M- and G-moieties are distributed as heteropolymeric (MG) and/or homopolymeric (MM or GG) blocks in the polymers (10Fischer F.G. Dõrfel H. Z. Phys.

A. vinelandii in addition synthesizes alginates during vegetative growth. This vegetative capsule seems to be responsible for bacterial adhesion to surfaces and may function as a diffusion barrier against O2 or heavy metals (19Clementi F. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1997; 17: 327-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Bacterial alginates are O-acetylated in varying degrees at O-2 and/or O-3 on mannuronic acid moieties (20Skjåk-Bræk G.

In all studied alginate-producing organisms the epimerization of M to G is catalyzed by mannuronan C-5-epimerases at the polymer level (23Ertesvåg H. Doseth B. Larsen B. Skjåk-Bræk G. Valla S. J.

Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 68-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A. vinelandii genome encodes a family of seven secreted Ca2+-dependent epimerases (AlgE1–7) (29Svanem B.I.G. Skjåk-Bræk G. Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 68-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a Ca2+-independent periplasmic epimerase (AlgG) (28Rehm B.H. Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) similar to the epimerase (AlgG) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25Franklin M.J. Chitnis C.E. Gacesa P. Sonesson A. White D.C. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AlgE epimerases consist of varying numbers of two types of structural modules, A and R, of which the A-module alone is capable of catalyzing epimerization and determining the final distribution of G-moieties in the produced alginates (30Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The R-modules contain four to seven Ca2+-binding motifs, and the direct binding of Ca2+ by this module, as well as by the A-module, has been demonstrated previously (30Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The R-modules stimulate reaction rates and are probably involved in export of the AlgE proteins (23Ertesvåg H. Doseth B. Larsen B. Skjåk-Bræk G. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2846-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Baumann U. Wu S. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B.

Gene. 1997; 192: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). By producing a family of alginate epimerases, A. vinelandii is able to synthesize a variety of alginates with different physicochemical properties, the exact biological function of which is not yet clearly understood. The genomes of alginate-synthesizing organisms encode alginases that degrade the polymers at specific uronic acid sequences, but most bacterial lyases display low activity against the native highly acetylated polymers (33Gacesa P. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 34Sutherland I.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 323-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 35Sutherland I.W. Carbohydr. Polym. 1999; 38: 319-328Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The alginases associated with A. vinelandii are reported to cleave M-rich alginates most effectively (36Ertesvåg H. Erlien F. Skjåk-Bræk G. Rehm B.H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3779-3784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kennedy L. McDowell K. Sutherland I.W. J. Gen.

Sutherland I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 98: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), even though the periplasmic AlgL enzyme degrades M-G bonds with similar efficiency as M-M bonds (36Ertesvåg H. Erlien F. Skjåk-Bræk G. Rehm B.H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3779-3784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the AlgE7 protein displays both epimerase and lyase activity (29Svanem B.I.G. Skjåk-Bræk G. Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 68-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 1987 Gacesa (40Gacesa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 199-202Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) proposed that the reaction mechanism of these two enzyme activities were very similar (Fig. 1). Both mechanisms include removal of H-5 of the uronic acid, but instead of a replacement of this proton from the opposite side of the sugar ring as in epimerization, the alginases catalyze a β-elimination of the 4-O-glycosidic bond, generating unsaturated 4-deoxy-l-erythro-hex-4-enepyranosyluronate moieties at the non-reducing end. Based on stereochemical considerations, Feingold and Bentley (41Feingold D.S. Bentley R. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) predicted that a similar reaction mechanism could apply to both M-specific and G-specific lyases. If these theoretical considerations are correct it seemed possible that the AlgE7 lyase and epimerase activities originate from the same active site in the enzyme. In this paper we examine the relationship between these two reactions mediated by AlgE7, and the results strongly support the hypothesis that a common site is responsible for both activities. DISCUSSIONThe results reported here strongly suggest that not only are lyase and epimerase reactions mechanistically related but that they can both be catalyzed by the same active site in an enzyme. However, despite the very large number of alginate lyases studied (59Wong T.Y. Preston L.A. Schiller N.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 289-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), only AlgE7 has been reported to display this capacity at comparable rates. This obviously raises the question as to what conditions have to be met for AlgE7 to act as an epimerase and/or a lyase. The activity patterns observed when different alginate substrates were used showed that acetylation and continuous stretches of G-moieties are inhibitory for both reactions (Fig. 4 A and Table II), and a simple explanation for this could be that the common alginate binding site is incompatible with such a substrate composition. It is, however, more difficult to envision what determines whether the enzyme acts as a lyase or an epimerase on substrates that can be converted by one or both activities (i.e. mannuronan and the M. pyrifera alginate). When using pure mannuronan as substrate, the reaction rate is much faster for the epimerase up to a point where the substrate has become highly degraded, where after the lyase activity strongly dominates on the small depolymerized oligomers (DP < 11) (Fig. 6). This indicates that small oligomers are readily bound by the enzyme but that for the epimerization pathway to be favored, longer alginates are needed. This assumption is in good agreement with a recent study that showed that epimerization by AlgE4 and AlgE2 cannot take place on mannuronan substrates smaller than 8 and 6 moieties, respectively, 2M. Hartmann, D. B. Holm, G. A. B. Johansen, G. Skjåk-Bræk, and B. T. Stokke, submitted for publication. whereas AlgE7 is clearly able to degrade to smaller fragments. The same way of thinking may also explain the strong dominance of the lyase activity on the M. pyrifera alginate. AlgE7 can obviously bind to this polymer, but it may be that epimerization is somehow more sterically hindered by the nature of the substrate. These differences in substrate selectivity might be explained by assuming different stereochemical requirements for binding and positioning of the alginate substrate in the lyase compared with the epimerase reaction (Fig. 1).Based on results from NMR spectroscopy, potential cleavage sites for the AlgE7 lyase were G↓MM and/or G↓GM, whereas M↓MM and/or M↓GM sequences are less favorable. G↓MG sequences were also found to be cleavable (MG-alginates) but with strongly reduced efficiency. The fact that G-moieties dominated at the reducing end even when mannuronan was used as substrate highlights the complexity of the interplay between the lyase and epimerase activities. It probably means that the initially higher epimerase activity results in the formation of a new substrate that is more favorable for the lyase than the substrate provided from the start. Similarly, G↓MG sequences appear to be poorly cleavable, but the activity on substrates containing many such triads (like the MG-alginate) is self-stimulated by introducing cleavable G↓GM-sequences through the fill-in capacity of the epimerase activity.Even if pure mannuronan and the deacetylated M-rich alginate (∼5% G) are very similar substrates, the data obtained from complete degradation differed in that the total G-content (and FGG) and especially the amount of internal G-moieties was significantly higher in the M-rich alginate (Table II). As a consequence of this, the average size of the final oligomers was also higher. This may indicate that the AlgE7 epimerase preferentially attacks M-moieties next to a G in the alginate chains, as this mode of action (preferred attack) probably will result in formation of short G-blocks, which in turn inhibit the AlgE7 lyase from cleavage.Although there are obviously certain amino acid residues that are essential for both cleavage and epimerization to take place (like Asp-152), the experiments reported here indicate that the specificity of these reactions appears to be affected by many other residues in the protein. This was clearly illustrated by the reaction products of the hybrid enzyme AlgE7-E1, which more frequently contained M-moieties at the reducing ends compared with the products of the native AlgE7 reaction. The hybrid enzyme also generated stronger ΔG signals relative to those of ΔM, when the MG-alginate was used as substrate (Fig. 5 C), and the final DPn was lower (Table II). For epimerization, the previously reported variability in the epimerization patterns among the AlgE family enzymes support a similar conclusion (45Ramstad M. Ellingsen T.E. Josefsen K.D. Høidal H.K.

Eng. 1999; 1: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and here we also noted that the M. pyrifera substrate strongly favors the lyase reaction, whereas the same substrate could easily be epimerized from its original 41% G to 66% by AlgE6 (NMR data not shown). These observations all suggest that the specificity of both the lyase and epimerase activities are the result of presumably slight differences in the folding structures of the enzymes, and to understand the nature of these effects, it seems obvious that a three-dimensional structure of at least one of the A-modules would be very important.Another interesting question not addressed here is what biological significance the dual properties of AlgE7 might have. It seems likely that this is somehow related to cyst formation, as it is known that such differentiated cells contain different types of alginates (15Page W.J. Sadoff H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 145-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is also known that the expression of the AlgE enzymes are affected by the conditions that lead to induction of cyst formation (53Høidal H.K. Svanem B.I.G. Gimmestad M. Valla S. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The results reported here strongly suggest that not only are lyase and epimerase reactions mechanistically related but that they can both be catalyzed by the same active site in an enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2070386767,"Biotin carboxylase catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of biotin and is one component of the multienzyme complex acetyl-CoA carboxylase that catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis. The Escherichia coli biotin carboxylase is readily isolated from the other components of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex such that enzymatic activity is retained. The three-dimensional structure of biotin carboxylase, determined by x-ray crystallography, demonstrated that the enzyme is a homodimer consisting of two active sites in which each subunit contains a complete active site. To understand how each subunit contributes to the overall function of biotin carboxylase, we made hybrid molecules in which one subunit had a wild-type active site, and the other subunit contained an active site mutation known to significantly affect the activity of the enzyme. One of the two genes encoded a poly-histidine tag at its N terminus, whereas the other gene had an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag. The two genes were assembled into a mini-operon that was induced to give high level expression of both enzymes. “Hybrid” dimers composed of one subunit with a wild-type active site and a second subunit having a mutant active site were obtained by sequential chromatographic steps on columns of immobilized nickel chelate and anti-FLAG affinity matrices. In vitrokinetic studies of biotin carboxylase dimers in which both subunits were wild type revealed that the presence of the N-terminal tags did not alter the activity of the enzyme. However, kinetic assays of hybrid dimer biotin carboxylase molecules in which one subunit had an active site mutation (R292A, N290A, K238Q, or E288K) and the other subunit had a wild-type active site resulted in 39-, 28-, 94-, and 285-fold decreases in the activity of these enzymes, respectively. Thedominant negative effects of these mutant subunits were also detected in vivo by monitoring the rate of fatty acid biosynthesis by [14C]acetate labeling of cellular lipids. Expression of the mutant biotin carboxylase genes from an inducible arabinose promoter resulted in a significantly reduced rate of fatty acid synthesis relative to the same strain that expressed the wild type gene. Thus, both the in vitro and in vivo data indicate that both subunits of biotin carboxylase are required for activity and that the two subunits must be in communication during enzyme function.

Solbiati J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28593-28598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The overall reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase proceeds via two half-reactions as shown in the scheme in Fig. 1. To carry out this two-step reaction acetyl-CoA carboxylase requires three distinct components: biotin carboxylase, biotin carboxyl carrier protein, and carboxyltransferase. The biotin carboxylase component catalyzes the first half-reaction in Fig. 1, which is an ATP-dependent carboxylation of the vitamin, biotin. In vivo, biotin is covalently attached to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein designated as BCCP in Fig. 1. The second half-reaction, the transfer of the carboxyl group from carboxybiotin to acetyl-CoA to make malonyl-CoA, is catalyzed by the carboxyltransferase component. In mammals, all three acetyl-CoA carboxylase components reside on one polypeptide chain (2Tanabe T. Wada K. Okazaki T. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, in the prokaryotic (and chloroplast) forms of the enzyme, the components are a series of individual proteins that form a complex. The component proteins can be isolated from one another with the biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase components retaining enzymatic activity in their respective half-reactions (3Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, both the biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase components will utilize free biotin as substrate in vitro (3Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These features have made theE. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase the prototype for the study of other biotin-dependent carboxylases. The E. coli biotin carboxylase component encoded by theaccC gene has become the model system for studying biotin-dependent carboxylation reactions for several reasons. First, the gene encoding the enzyme has been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed (4Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Second, the crystal structure of the enzyme has been determined and remains the only three-dimensional model of a biotin-dependent carboxylase (6Waldrop G.L. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10249-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 7Thoden J.B. Blanchard C.Z. Holden H.M. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16183-16190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The structural studies of biotin carboxylase confirmed the enzyme is a homodimer having two well separated active sites that do not contain residues from both subunits (also referred to as a shared active site) as seen with other multisubunit enzymes such as aspartate transcarbamylase (8Wente S.R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (9Larimer F.W. Lee E.H. Mural R.J. Soper T.S. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15327-15329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, each subunit of biotin carboxylase contains a complete active site. This raises the question: why does biotin carboxylase function as a homodimer? Kinetic analyses have shown no signs of cooperative behavior for any of the three substrates (ATP, bicarbonate, or biotin), suggesting that there is no communication between the two subunits, yet the enzyme exists as a homodimer. To better understand the subunit structure of biotin carboxylase, the studies in this report address the following questions: (i) Are both subunits of the biotin carboxylase homodimer required for activity or is one subunit sufficient for catalysis? (ii) Similarly, is there communication between the subunits of biotin carboxylase or do they act independently? (iii) Furthermore, do the answers to the above questions obtained in vitro have any relevance to the function of the enzyme in vivo? The experimental approach for answering these questions was to make hybrid dimers of biotin carboxylase in which one subunit had a wild-type active site and the other subunit contained an active site mutation known to greatly decrease the activity of the enzyme (5Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Levert K.L. Lloyd R.B. Waldrop G.L.

The heterodimeric biotin carboxylase molecules were assayed for activity in vitro and also in vivo by measuring the rate of fatty acid biosynthesis in E. coli.

The two oligonucleotides were combined in ligase buffer, heated to 100 °C for 2 min, and allowed to cool gradually to room temperature to anneal the single stands to yield a double-stranded FLAG tag-encoding oligonucleotide having 5′ extensions at each end. One 5′ extension annealed to the product ofNcoI digestion and the other to the product ofNdeI digestion. Plasmid pGLW1 (Table I) encoding wild-type biotin carboxylase (note that we will call the gene (and encoded protein) encoding a wild-type active site as wild type, although with the added sequences the gene is not truly wild type) was cut with EcoRI and BamHI, and the 1.35-kilobase insert was ligated to pMTL23 cut with the same enzymes to obtain plasmid pKJ1 having an NcoI site upstream of theaccC coding sequence. This plasmid was cut withNcoI and NdeI and ligated to the FLAG oligonucle0otide to give pKJ2. To express the FLAG-tagged gene from the T7 promoter, pKJ2 was cut with NcoI-BamHI and ligated to pET14b cut with the same enzymes, resulting in plasmid pKJ3. The plasmid insert was sequenced to confirm the presence of the sequence encoding the FLAG tag at the 5′ end of the biotin carboxylase gene. The His-tagged wild-type accC gene from pGLW2 (TableI) was excised usingNcoI-BamHI and ligated to pET28b cut with the same enzymes, resulting in pHBC28. Plasmid p34S-Gm was digested withBamHI, and the 865-base pair gentamicin cassette was ligated to BamHI cut pHBC28 to obtain pGHBC28. To introduce the FLAG-tagged wild-type accC gene, theXbaI-BamHI accC fragment of pKJ3 was ligated to pMTL23p cut with XbaI-BglII to give pKJ5. Finally, pGHBC28 was cut with HindIII-XhoI and ligated to the 1.35-kilobase FLAG-tagged wild-type accCinsert from pKJ5 cut with the same enzymes, resulting in pWT/WT. TheHindIII-XhoI fragment contains a ribosome binding site upstream of the FLAG-tagged WTBC1 gene. The duplicate gene construct was confirmed by restriction mapping. The construction of the expression vectors pR292/WT, pN290A/WT, and pK238Q/WT (Table I) containing a His-tagged mutant accC gene plus the FLAG-tagged wild-type accC gene was done as follows. Plasmids pGLW10, pYML6, and pRBL5 (Table I) containing a His-tagged accC gene carrying an active site mutation were linearized with BamHI and ligated to the 865-base pair gentamicin cassette as described above, resulting in plasmids pGLW10G, pYML6G, and pRBL5G, respectively. The HindII-XhoI fragment of pKJ5 containing the FLAG-tagged wild-type accCgene was ligated to plasmids pGLW10G, pYML6G, and pRBL5G cut with the same enzymes, thus yielding plasmids pR292/WT, pN290A/WT, and pK238Q/WT, respectively. The presence of duplicated genes was confirmed by restriction mapping. These constructions followed the general scheme described above. Plasmid pYML3 (Table I) was cut with EcoRI plus BamHI to obtain the E288K accC gene fragment, which was ligated to pMTL22p cut with the same enzymes to obtain pYML22. Plasmid pYML22 was cut with NcoI plus NdeI and ligated to the FLAG oligonucleotide containing the same ends, yielding pFpYML22. The FLAG-tagged E288K accC gene was cut from pFpYML22 usingNcoI plus BamHI and ligated to pET14b cut with the same enzymes, resulting in pFpYML14. This plasmid was sequenced to confirm the presence of the FLAG tag. Plasmid pFpYML14 was digested with XbaI plus BamHI to obtain the FLAG-tagged gene plus the ribosome binding site, and this fragment was ligated to pMTL23p cut with XbaI plus BglII, resulting in pFpYML23. Plasmid pFpYML23 was cut with HindIII plusXhoI releasing the FLAG-tagged gene and ligated to pGHBC28 cut with the same enzymes, resulting in pWT/E288K. For expression of the tagged proteins, the plasmids pWT/WT, pR292A/WT, pN290A/WT, pK238Q/WT, and pWT/E288K were transformed into E. coli BLR(DE3) pLysS. A 100-fold dilution of an overnight saturated culture was made in 2× YT medium containing kanamycin and gentamicin. The culture was grown at 30 °C with constant agitation (300 rpm) until the A 600reached 0.6, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 2 mm to induce AccB protein expression. After 5 h of incubation the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C. The cell pellets were suspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.9) and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing the cell suspension (the phage T7 lysozyme encoded by pLysS makes the cells fragile to freeze-thaw treatment). DNase was added to degrade chromosomal DNA, and the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was supplemented with Triton X-100 (final concentration of 0.1%) and applied to a column containing immobilized nickel-chelate resin. The column was subsequently washed with 10 column volumes of binding buffer followed by 5 column volumes of binding buffer containing 60 mm imidazole. His-tagged biotin carboxylase was eluted from the column using binding buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The purified protein was dialyzed against a solution of 0.67 mm EDTA and 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 4 °C overnight. For anti-FLAG M2 affinity chromatography, columns containing the anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel were washed with 0.1 mmglycine-HCl, pH 3.5, for 20 min and immediately equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl and 300 mmNaCl, pH 7.4). The protein from the His tag purification step was dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline and applied to the equilibrated columns. The columns were washed with 10 column volumes of Tris-buffered saline, and the bound protein was eluted with 20 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 2 mg/ml FLAG octapeptide. Fractions (1-ml) of the eluate were collected and analyzed for protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by stained with Coomassie Blue. The fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm potassium HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 500 mm KCl at 4 °C overnight. The protein solutions were concentrated by reverse osmosis using a collodion membrane with a 25,000 molecular weight cutoff. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purified protein was transferred to a nylon membrane using CAPS buffer, and N-terminal sequencing was done to confirm the presence of the N-terminal octapeptide FLAG tag fused to biotin carboxylase by the Protein Services Facility at the University of Illinois. All plasmid constructs were sequenced to confirm that the FLAG sequence had been added to the 5′ end of the accC coding sequence. Both DNA and N-terminal protein sequencing were done by the University of Illinois Biotechnology Center. The genes for WTBC and mutant forms of biotin carboxylase R292A, E288K, N290A, and K238Q were removed from pGLW1, pLVL3, pYML3, pYML5, and pRBL3 (Table I), respectively, using EcoRI-NsiI and ligated to pBAD24 at the EcoRI-PstI restriction sites to obtain a ribosome binding site upstream of the gene. The WTBC, R292A, E288K, N290A, and K238Q biotin carboxylase genes and their ribosome binding sites were removed from their respective pBAD24 constructs and ligated into theClaI-HindIII sites of the medium copy number plasmid, pBAD30, resulting in pBADWTBC, pBADR292A, pBADN290A, pBADK238Q, and pBADE288K (Table I). The plasmids pBADWTBC, pBADR292A, pBADN290A, pBADK238Q, and pBADE288K (Table I) were each transformed into E. coliMC1061, grown in 2× YT medium containing ampicillin at 37 °C with constant agitation (300 rpm) until an A 600 of 0.6 was reached. Gene expression under the pBAD promoter was induced by adding arabinose to the cultures at a final concentration of 0.05%. Incubation was continued for an additional 45 min after induction in which 1 ml of the culture was added to a 15-ml plastic vial containing 5 µCi of [1-14C]acetate at 37 °C. After 10 min the labeling was stopped by adding cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5% followed by incubation on ice for 2 h. The samples were quantitatively transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged (12,000 rpm for 2 min) to pellet the trichloroacetic acid precipitates; any residual solution was removed by further centrifugation. The pellets were then extracted with 50 µl of methanol at 42 °C for 1 h followed by the addition of 100 µl of chloroform. The resulting chloroform-methanol extracts were carefully transferred to clean microcentrifuge tubes, and the solvent evaporated was concentrated under nitrogen. The lipids were then transferred to scintillation vials and counted in BPS solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The activity of biotin carboxylase was determined spectrophotometrically. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured by detecting the production of ADP using pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase and following the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm. Each reaction contained 17.5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 10.5 units of pyruvate kinase, 0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 8 mm MgCl2, 15 mm potassium bicarbonate, and 100 mm HEPES at pH 8.0. All reactions were carried out in a total volume of 0.5 ml in a 1-cm path-length quartz cuvette. When the kinetic parameters for biotin were determined, ATP was added to the reaction and held constant at 3.0 mm. Because the K m for biotin is high, it was necessary to supplement the reaction with KCl to ensure that the ionic strength remained constant at various concentrations of biotin. When the concentration of ATP was varied, KCl was omitted from the reaction mixture, and biotin was held constant at 150 mm. All reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and were maintained at 25 °C via a circulating water bath. All spectrophotometric data was collected using a Uvikon 810 (Kontron Instruments) spectrophotometer interfaced to a PC with a data acquisition program. The kinetic parameters K mand V max were determined by fitting the initial velocities versus the substrate concentration to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression analysis performed by the program Enzfitter. Values for V max andV max/K m were calculated per active site using a molecular weight of 50,000 for the biotin carboxylase monomer. Hybrid biotin carboxylase dimers were made in vivo by co-expression of differently tagged accC genes arranged in tandem as a synthetic operon (Fig.2). Both modified accCcoding sequences had 5′ extensions to the coding sequence that encoded tags for affinity purification of the encoded AccC protein. One of theaccC genes was marked with a His tag, and the otheraccC gene was marked with a FLAG tag. The sequences encoding the affinity tags were fused to the N terminus of biotin carboxylase instead of the C terminus, because the N-terminal location does not compromise the activity of the enzyme (5Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A gene cassette encoding gentamicin resistance was placed between the two accC genes to preclude the possibility of genetic recombination between the two genes, which could invalidate the experiments. Homologous recombination between the two copies would delete the antibiotic resistance cassette, resulting in sensitivity to gentamicin and inhibition of protein synthesis and subsequent cell death. When the genes for differently tagged biotin carboxylase were co-expressed from a plasmid (Fig. 2), three different types of biotin carboxylase dimers were formed in vivo (Fig.3). One type of dimer had two His-tagged subunits (called HH). Both subunits of another dimer type were FLAG-tagged (FF), and the third dimer had one subunit with a His tag and the other subunit with a FLAG tag (HF). There also is the possibility of formation of small amounts of a dimer containing a chromosomally encoded wild-type (WT) untagged subunit plus either a His- or FLAG-tagged subunit. The crude E. coli-soluble extract was first eluted from an immobilized nickel affinity column that bound all His tag-containing biotin carboxylase dimers (i.e. HH and HF), and eliminated the FF dimer (Fig. 3). The mixture of eluted HH and HF dimers were then chromatographed on the anti-FLAG affinity column to eliminate the HH dimer. The HF dimer was then eluted from the column. N-terminal sequencing was carried out to confirm that the purification protocol (Fig. 3) did produce the HF biotin carboxylase hybrid. The results showed the presence of both the His-and FLAG-tag sequences in the N terminus of the purified protein (data not shown). Note that our preparation procedure also removes any dimers that contained the wild-type (WT) subunit encoded by the chromosomal accC gene. It should be noted that the purification method would be compromised if a rapid equilibration occurred between the monomer and dimer forms of the protein. For example, if the intent was to purify dimers having one His-tagged normal and one FLAG-tagged mutant subunit (an HF dimer) and rapid subunit exchange did occur, then the HF dimer would rearrange to give rise to HH and FF dimers, which would complicate the analyses. In the case of biotin carboxylase this seemed unlikely to be a problem, because the monomeric protein has not been observed unless denaturing conditions are used. However, we tested for subunit exchange by mixing a culture expressing only a His-tagged biotin carboxylase with an otherwise identical culture that expressed only a FLAG-tagged biotin carboxylase. The cell-free extract of the mixed culture was then chromatographed as above. If subunit exchange occurred, then a protein species that bound to both column matrices would be formed. We were unable to detect formation of such a species. These results were confirmed by the analyses reported below, because appreciable subunit exchange would have resulted in appreciable levels of carboxylase activity caused by the formation of active dimers from dimers that contained one active subunit and one inactive subunit. The experimental approach described here for the preparation and purification of hybrids of biotin carboxylase is generally applicable to any dimeric protein. Moreover, this method offers several advantages over previous approaches for making hybrids of oligomeric proteins (11Kaplan N.O. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1968; 151: 382-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Penhoet E.E. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 318-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gibbons I.

https://openalex.org/W2036616391,"In the human malaria parasitePlasmodium falciparum (Pf), polyamines are synthesized by a bifunctional enzyme that possesses both ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) activities. The mature enzyme consists of the heterotetrameric N-terminal AdoMetDC and the C-terminal dimeric ODC, which results in the formation of a heterotetrameric complex. For the native bifunctional protein a half-life longer than 2 h was determined, which is in contrast to the extreme short half-life of its mammalian monofunctional counterparts. The biological advantage of the plasmodial bifunctional ODC/AdoMetDC might be that the control of polyamine synthesis is achieved by only having to regulate the abundance and activity of one protein. An interesting feature in the regulation of the bifunctional protein is that putrescine inhibitsPfODC activity ∼10-fold more efficiently than the mammalian ODC activity, and in contrast to the mammalian AdoMetDC the activity of the PfAdoMetDC domain is not stimulated by the diamine. To analyze post-translational processing, polymerization, and domain-domain interactions, several mutant proteins were generated that have single mutations in either thePfODC or PfAdoMetDC domains. The exchange of amino acids essential for the activity of one domain had no effect on the enzyme activity of the other domain. Even prevention of the post-translational cleavage of the AdoMetDC domain or ODC dimerization and thus the interference with the folding of the protein hardly affected the activity of the partner domain. In addition, inhibition of the activity of the PfODC domain had no effect on the activity of the PfAdoMetDC domain and vice versa. These results demonstrate that no domain-domain interactions occur between the two enzymes of the bifunctional PfODC/AdoMetDC and that both enzymatic activities are operating as independent catalytic sites that do not affect each other.

The two rate-limiting enzymes of polyamine synthesis are ornithine decarboxylase (ODC,1 EC 4.1.1.17) andS-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC, EC 4.1.1.50), which provide putrescine and decarboxylatedS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) for the synthesis of spermidine. Interference with polyamine biosynthesis is considered as antitumor and antiparasitic strategy, although the success of polyamine-related cancer therapeutic approaches has been modest (3Marton L.J.

However, 2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of ODC originally designed as an anticancer agent, has proved to be clinically successful in the treatment of African sleeping sickness caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma gambiense (6McCann P.P. Bacchi C.J. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Seed J.R. Nathan H.C. Amole B.O. Hutner S.H. Sjoerdsma A. Med. Biol. 1981; 59: 434-440PubMed Google Scholar). The selective toxicity of DFMO on T. gambiense is complex and discussed to depend on various metabolic differences between parasite and mammalian host including the presence of trypanothione, altered levels of AdoMet, and also the longer half-life of the parasite ODC when compared with the mammalian enzyme (7Müller S. Coombs G. Walter R.D. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This success has reinforced the view that the polyamine metabolism of parasitic protozoa might be suitable for chemotherapeutic exploitation. We suggest that because of a higher polyamine requirement of rapidly proliferating cells, the interference with their synthesis has more severe consequences for the parasite compared with the host organism. Malaria is the most important tropical disease in the developing countries; rough estimates indicate 500 million clinical cases per annum causing more than 1 million deaths. Malaria is undergoing resurgence, and the control of Plasmodium falciparum malaria has become a severe problem. Because of rapidly spreading drug resistance there is an urgent and pressing need for new antimalarial drugs. ODC and AdoMetDC are usually derived from separate genes and act individually as highly regulated monofunctional enzymes. In P. falciparum, however, ODC and AdoMetDC activities are located on a single polypeptide with the AdoMetDC domain in the N-terminal part connected to the C-terminal ODC domain by a hinge region (8Müller S.

Here we report on the expression and mutational analyses of the recombinant bifunctional P. falciparum(Pf)ODC/AdoMetDC and address possible functional consequences and the potential significance of the bifunctional nature of this parasite protein, which may help to validate this protein as a target for a chemotherapeutic intervention of malaria.

Parasites were grown in human erythrocytes (A+) in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 20 mm sodium bicarbonate, 5% heat-inactivated human plasma (A), and 5% AlbuMAX II (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 5% (v/v) hematocrit in 150-cm2 flasks at 37 °C with a gaseous phase of 90% N2, 5% O2, and 5% CO2. To determine the half-life of the PfODC/AdoMetDC, a synchronized Plasmodium culture at the trophozoite stage was incubated with cyclohexamide (50 µg/ml, Sigma) to prevent proteinde novo synthesis. The decay of ODC and AdoMetDC activities was measured after 30, 60, and 120 min in infected erythrocytes enriched with gelafundin (B. Braun Melsungen) (12Inselburg J. Zhang R.-D. Am. J. Med. Hyg. 1988; 39: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Pasvol G. Wilson R.J. Smalley M.E. Brown J. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1978; 72: 87-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Synchronization of the culture was performed by incubation of cells in 2 volumes of 0.3m alanine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 5 min at 37 °C (14Braun-Breton C. Rosenberry T.L. Pereira da Silva L.H. Res. Immunol. 1990; 141: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The percentage of infected erythrocytes was determined by light microscopy of Giemsa-stained thin smears, and the number of the erythrocytes was determined in a Coulter Max M cell counter. Trophozoite-infected erythrocytes of a synchronizedPlasmodium culture were separated from noninfected erythrocytes by discontinuous Percoll/alanine gradient centrifugation (15Kanaani J. Ginsburg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3194-3199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of trophozoite-infected erythrocytes was determined as described above, and subsequently Plasmodium parasites were isolated from the host erythrocytes by saponin lysis (16Christophers S.R. Fulton J.D. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1939; 33: 161-171Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For the determination of AdoMet, samples of isolated P. falciparumwere deproteinized by adding 0.2 m perchloric acid for 12 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min), aliquots of the supernatant were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC on a Spherisorb ODS II column (5 µm, 250 × 3 mm, Machery-Nagel) according to Guattari (17Guattari B. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 567: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Separation was performed isocratically at a flow rate of 0.55 ml/min using 40 mm ammonium dihydrogenphosphate, 6 mmheptanesulfonic acid sodium salt monohydrate, and 6% (v/v) methanol, pH 4.2, as mobile phase. The effluent was monitored by UV detection at 254 nm (diode array detector 440, Kontron). The ornithine content ofP. falciparum was determined by the method of Patchettet al. (18Patchett M.L. Monk C.R. Daniel R.M. Morgan H.W. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 425: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Isolated P. falciparum cells were deproteinized by heating at 95 °C for 5 min before being centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant were derivatized with equal volumes of o-phthalaldehyde reagent (40 mm o-phthalaldehyde, 0.2 m potassium borate buffer, pH 9.4, 0.14 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% methanol) and subjected to a Spherisorb ODS II (5 µm, 125 × 3 mm, Machery-Nagel) reversed phase HPLC for analysis. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (10 mm potassium dihydrogenphosphate, pH 5.9) and solvent B (acetonitrile/methanol/water, 4:3:3, v/v/v). Separation was performed at a flow rate of 0.9 ml min−1 applying the following gradient (percentage of solvent B): 0 min, 20%; 4 min, 27%; 11.5 min, 27%; 28 min, 100%; 31 min 100%; 40 min, 20%; 58 min, 20%).o-Phthalaldehyde-derivatized ornithine was detected by fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation 338 nm, emission 425 nm, SFM 25, Kontron). The entire coding region of the PfODC/AdoMetDC wild type and mutants cloned into the vector pASK-IBA3 (Institut für Bioanalytik, Göttingen, Germany) were expressed in the AdoMetDC- and ODC-deficient Escherichia coli line EWH331, kindly provided by Dr. H. Tabor (19Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12419-12426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and subsequently purified as described previously (8Müller S. Da'dara A.

The purified recombinant protein was subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography on a calibrated Superdex S-200 column (2.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with 40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% Brij-35 at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The homogeneity of the enzyme preparation was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were revealed by Coomassie staining (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory, Cold Spring Habor, NY1989Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified recombinant protein was determined according to Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211906) Google Scholar). The AdoMetDC domain comprises the amino acids 1–660 including 131 amino acids of the hinge region of the bifunctional protein (Fig. 1). Base pair 1–1980 of the coding region of the ODC/AdoMetDC was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic P. falciparum DNA using the sense oligonucleotide 5′-GCGCGCGGTCTCCGCGCATGAACGGAATTTTTGAAGG-3′ and the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-GCGCGCGGTCTCCTATCATTAATCTTTCTCATTTGTTTGTACC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pCRR2.1-TOPO using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli DH5α cells. Recombinant plasmid DNA was isolated and digested withBsaI (5 units/µl, New England Biolabs). The insert was gel-purified and cloned into BsaI-cut pASK-IBA7 expression vector (Institut für Bioanalytik). The clonedPfAdoMetDC was expressed in E. coliBL21-CodonPlusTM(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) and purified as described previously (8Müller S. Da'dara A. Lüersen K. Wrenger C. Das Gupta R. Madhubala R. Walter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8097-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Both AdoMetDC and ODC activities were assayed by trapping released 14CO2 fromS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine and l-[1-14C]ornithine (57 and 52 mCi/mmol, respectively, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (22Niemann G. von Besser H. Walter R.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar,23Da'dara A.A. Walter R.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The K m values of the bifunctional rPfODC/AdoMetDC and rPfAdoMetDC domains for the respective substrates were determined by varying the concentrations of ornithine and AdoMet from 10 to 200 µm. The inhibition constant (K i) for putrescine to inhibit ODC activity was determined under standard assay conditions with varying concentrations of ornithine and the addition of 50, 100, and 200 µm putrescine. K m andK i values were calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plots using the software GraphPad Prism 1.02 (GraphPad Software). An additional assay was used for a functional analysis of the activity rates of both active sites of the bifunctional ODC/AdoMetDC. Both reactions were performed simultaneously, and the reaction mixture contained (in a final volume of 250 µl) 40 mmKH2PO4 or Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for determination of AdoMetDC and ODC activities, respectively, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 40 µm pyridoxal 5-phosphate, 100 µm ornithine, and 100 µm AdoMet. The activity rates of ODC and AdoMetDC were determined by trapping 14CO2 derived from the respective added labeled substrates 50 nCi [14C]ornithine or [14C]AdoMet. The competitive inhibitors CGP40215A and CGP54169A are from a new series of AdoMetDC and ODC inhibitors synthesized and provided by Novartis Pharma (24Stanek J. Caravatti G. Capraro H.G. Furet P.

Regenass U. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1993; 32: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Both inhibitors, when used at a concentration of 100 µm, totally inhibited the respective domain activity (Ref. 26Krause T. Lüersen K. Wrenger C. Gilberger T.-W. Müller S. Walter R.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 2R. D. Walter, unpublished data. 14 oligonucleotides were designed to replace amino acid residues potentially involved in PfODC/AdoMetDC activity (TableI). The putative active site residues of the ODC domain Lys868, Lys970, Cys1355, Asp1356, and Asp1359 were exchanged by alanine, and Gly1382 was mutated into tyrosine. In the AdoMetDC domain, Ser73 was replaced by alanine. In addition, the amino acid residue Gly721(equivalent to Gly1382) of the PfHinge-ODC (26Krause T. Lüersen K. Wrenger C. Gilberger T.-W. Müller S. Walter R.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was mutated into tyrosine. 35 ng of the double-stranded supercoiled expression plasmid pASK-IBA3PfODC/AdoMetDC and 100 ng of mutagenic sense and antisense primers were used in a 50-µl PCR containing deoxyribonucleotides, reaction buffer, and PfuDNA polymerase according to manufacturer recommendations (Stratagene). The cycling parameters were 95 °C for 50 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 12 min for 17 cycles. The linear amplification product was treated with endonucleaseDpnI (10 units/µl, New England Biolabs) for 1 h to eliminate the parental template. An 8-µl aliquot from each PCR was used for the transformation of competent E. coli DH5α cells. All mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination reaction for double-stranded DNA (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory, Cold Spring Habor, NY1989Google Scholar). Approximately 95% of the analyzed colonies contained the desired mutation, and one clone of each construct was transformed for the expression in competent E. coli EWH331 cells. The expressed proteins were purified by Strep-tactin affinity chromatography according to manufacturer recommendations (Institut für Bioanalytik).Table IMutagenic oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis of PfODC/AdoMetDCPrimerDirectionSequence (5′–3′)WTsenseGTGTATTTATTGTCAGAGAGTTCTTTATACATTTTTGATGS73AsenseGTGTATTTATTGTCAGAGGCATCTTTATACATTTTTGATGS73AantisenseCATCAAAAATGTATAAAGATGCCTCTGACAATAAATACACWTsenseCTCCATTCTATTCTGTAAAAAGTAATAATGAGAAGTTGK868AsenseCTCCATTCTATTCTGTAGCAAGTAATAATGAGAAGTTGK868AantisenseCAACTTCATCATTATTACTTGCTACAGAATAGAATGGAGWTsenseAATCTTATATGTCTTCAAAATATGGAGCTAATGAATATGK970AsenseAATCTTATATGTCTTCAGCATATGGAGCTAATGAATATGK970AantisenseCATATTCATTAGCTCCATATGCTGAAGACATATAAGATTWTsenseGTATTTGGACAATCATGTGATGGCTTGGATATGC1355AsenseGTATTTGGACAATCAGCAGATGGCTTGGATATGC1355AantisenseCATATCCAAGCCATCTGCTGATTGTCCAAATACWTsenseGTATTTGGACAATCATGTGATGGCTTGGATATGATCD1356AsenseGTATTTGGACAATCATGTGCAGGCTTGGATATGATCD1356AantisenseGATCATATCCAAGCCTGCACATGATTGTCCAAATACWTsenseCATGTGATGGCTTGGATATGATCAATTCTATTACGD1359AsenseCATGTGATGGCTTGGCAATGATCAATTCTATTACGD1359AantisenseCGTAATAGAATTGATCATTGCCAAGCCATCACATGWTsenseGCTTCTCTATGAATATGCTGGGGCATACACTTTTGTCAGG1382YsenseGCTTCTCTATGAATATGCTTATGCATACACTTTTGTCAGG1382YantisenseCTGACAAAAGTGTATGCATAAGCATATTCATAGAGAAGCNucleotides that were exchanged in comparison to the wild type (WT) are underlined and in bold letters.

The recombinant wild-type and Gly1382-Tyr mutant PfODC/AdoMetDC as well as wild type and the equivalent Gly721-Tyr mutantPfHinge-ODC were subjected to gel filtration, and dot blot analyses of the collected fractions were performed. The fractions were transferred to nitrocellulose using a BioDot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 3% low fat milk powder in PBS (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory, Cold Spring Habor, NY1989Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently the membrane was incubated with polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the rPfODC/AdoMetDC protein (1:5000) for 1 h. After three washes with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with 1:10,000 diluted alkaline phosphatase-coated anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova) in PBS containing 1% low fat milk powder. After washing the membrane three times in 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, the proteins were visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 0.1 mNaCl, and 20 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5. To characterize and determine the steady-state kinetic parameters of ODC and AdoMetDC activities, the bifunctionalPfODC/AdoMetDC was recombinantly expressed as a Strep-tactin fusion protein in the E. coli strain EWH331 and purified according to Müller et al. (8Müller S. Da'dara A. Lüersen K. Wrenger C. Das Gupta R. Madhubala R. Walter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8097-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The yield was 250 µg liter−1 of bacterial cell culture. Likewise, the AdoMetDC domain of the bifunctional P. falciparum ODC/AdoMetDC consisting of the amino acids 1–529 and additional 131 amino acids of the hinge region (Fig.1) was separately expressed as a Strep-tactin fusion protein in the E. coliBL21-CodonPlusTM(DE3)-RIL and purified according to that described in Ref. 8Müller S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8097-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar. 1 liter of culture yielded ∼350 µg of recombinant PfAdoMetDC domain. The rPfAdoMetDC was found to be catalytically active, just as it has been reported for the separately expressed rPfODC (26Krause T. Lüersen K. Wrenger C. Gilberger T.-W. Müller S. Walter R.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The P. falciparum ODC/AdoMetDC exhibited ODC and AdoMetDC activity optimal between pH 7.0 and 8.5, peaking at pH 8.0 and 7.5, respectively, when tested with potassium phosphate and Tris/HCl buffer. Interestingly the AdoMetDC activity of the bifunctional protein was not inhibited by Tris/HCl as it has been reported for the mammalian AdoMetDC (27Pegg A.E. Williams-Ashman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 682-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K m values of the rPfODC/AdoMetDC for ornithine and AdoMet are 41 and 58 µm, respectively. These data confirm the values determined for the nativePfODC/AdoMetDC (8Müller S. Da'dara A. Lüersen K. Wrenger C. Das Gupta R. Madhubala R. Walter R.D. J. Biol.

The specific activities of the plasmodial AdoMetDCs (bifunctional and domain) were determined to be 20 and 51 nmol min−1mg−1, and the k cat for both enzymes are similar with 3.3 and 4.0 min−1, respectively. These data are comparable with the specific activity of the mammalian AdoMetDC, reported to be 24 nmol min−1 mg−1(Ref. 28Stanley B.A. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7901-7907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Table II). However, the specific ODC activity of the bifunctional rPfAdoMetDC/ODC protein differs considerably from that of the separately expressed ODC domain and from values reported for the mammalian ODC. The specific ODC activity of the bifunctional protein was determined to be 38 nmol min−1mg−1, whereas those for both separately expressed ODC domains were found to be 2.9 and 4.3 nmol min−1mg−1, dependent on whether they were expressed with a part of the preceding hinge region (26Krause T. Lüersen K. Wrenger C. Gilberger T.-W. Müller S. Walter R.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the bifunctional protein, although nearly 10-fold higher than that of the separately expressed ODC/hinge domain, is still much lower than the value of 12,800 nmol min−1 mg−1 reported for the mammalian ODC (Ref. 29Colemann C.S. Stanley B.A. Viswanath R. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3155-3158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Table II). Attributable to the bifunctional nature of the Plasmodiumprotein, the similar specific activities of 38 and 20 nmol min−1 mg−1 of PfODC andPfAdoMetDC, respectively, might lead to a balanced production of putrescine and decarboxylated AdoMet, depending on the availability of their respective substrates. To relate the enzyme activities of PfODC and PfAdoMetDC to their substrate concentrations, we determined the ornithine and AdoMet levels in P. falciparum. The analyses revealed a 6-fold higher concentration for ornithine compared with AdoMet. The values obtained were 9.5 ± 0.9 and 1.5 ± 0.2 nmol 1010cells−1 (n = 3), respectively. It is difficult to calculate precisely the molarity of both in thePlasmodium cell, but based on the relative volume of parasite to host erythrocyte (volume of host compartment 2/3, volume of parasite compartment 1/3; Ref. 30Yayon A. Vande Waa J.A. Yayon M. Geary T.G. Jensen J.B. J. Protozool. 1983; 30: 642-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), nonsaturated substrate levels of 28.5 and 4.5 µm for ornithine and AdoMet, respectively, were estimated. Considering enzyme kinetics and substrate levels, we expect that the reaction leading to putrescine is favored, which should lead to higher putrescine levels in Plasmodium such that the availability of decarboxylated AdoMet might be the limiting factor for spermidine synthesis as it has been discussed for mammalian cells (31Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Of some interest is that the PfODC activity of P. falciparum is inhibited by putrescine. The K ivalue of the PfODC was determined to be 68 µm, which is in the comparable range of the K m value for ornithine and allows feedback control of putrescine synthesis considering intracellular concentrations of 81 µm for putrescine2 and 29 µm for ornithine inPlasmodium. In contrast, the mammalian ODC is hardly"

In mammals, three major groups of MAPK have been identified, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3584) Google Scholar, 2Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4318) Google Scholar, 3Leppa S.

In response to these stimuli, specific MAPK kinase kinases are activated that modulate MAPK kinase such as MKK4 and MKK7, which sequentially phosphorylate the JNK kinase. Once activated, the JNK phosphorylates c-Jun, which in turn increases transcription activity of many target genes. The functions of the signal transduction mediated by the JNK group of MAPKs include the control of cell survival and apoptosis, the regulation of cell proliferation, and embryonic morphogenesis (1Davis R.J.

The rat and human homolog of JIP-1 was independently identified and termed islet-brain1 (IB1), because it is expressed in the insulin-secreting β-cells of the pancreas and in neurons (13Bonny C.

In these cells, activation of the JNK cascade by interleukin-1 reduces IB1/JIP-1 content and promotes apoptosis (15Bonny C. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Schorderet D.F. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16466-16472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Reduction of the content of IB1/JIP-1 in these cells increased phosphorylation of c-Jun and the apoptotic rate. Conversely, overexpression of IB1/JIP-1 prevented JNK activation and apoptosis (15Bonny C. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Schorderet D.F. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol.

MAPK8IP1 is a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes, because a missense mutation within the coding region of this gene was linked to human diabetes in a large pedigree (16Waeber G. Delplanque J.

The mutation was shown to be associated in vitro with an accelerated apoptosis and a decreased insulin transcriptional activity (16Waeber G. Delplanque J. Bonny C. Mooser V. Steinmann M. Widmann C.

Mice deficient in JNK1, -2, or -3 have no obvious phenotype whereas double mutants (JNK1−/− and JNK2−/−) die at mid-gestation with defective neural-tube closure because of an increased apoptosis (17Dong C.

Mice lacking the JNK3 gene are resistant to kanaic acid-induced apoptosis in the hippocampal region of the brain (19Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Thus, JNK functions are important during development and may play a permissive role for cell survival and/or for cell apoptosis. The selective disruption of MKK4 and c-Jun has a much more drastic phenotype than disruption of JNK1, -2, or -3. Both MKK4- and c-Jun-defective mice have an early embryological lethality caused by an abnormal liver development (20Ganiatsas S. Kwee L. Fujiwara Y. Perkins A. Ikeda T. Labow M.A. Zon L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6881-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Hilberg F. Aguzzi A. Howells N. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1993; 365: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar).Due to the pleiotrophic role of the JNK transduction signal in regulating cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis, the physiological function of IB1/JIP-1 in vivo is unpredictable. The present study was therefore undertaken to clarify the biological role of IB1/JIP-1 using a gene-targeting strategy.RESULTSThe murine gene encoding IB1/JIP-1 was cloned from a 129/SvJ mouse genomic library. A targeting vector was designed to replace exon 3 through exon 8 of the MAPK8IP1 gene with the neomycin resistance gene (Fig. 1). Three embryonic stem cell clones that had undergone homologous recombination were microinjected into C57BL/6 host blastocysts. One clone produced a germline chimeric male resulting in offspring heterozygous for the disrupted allele (Fig. 1). The heterozygotes IB1/JIP-1+/−mice were intercrossed in two different genetic background (C57BL/6 and 129 SvJ), and the progeny was genotyped. No mutant IB1/JIP-1−/− were found in live-born progenies of IB1/JIP-1+/− intercrosses, indicating that the complete absence of IB1/JIP-1 caused embryonic lethality. Embryos were genotyped at various stages of gestation to determine when embryonic death occurred. As shown in Table I, a total of 148 pups were analyzed, and one single mutant IB1/JIP-1−/− embryo was detected at day 3.5 post-coitum. A total of 98 pups (66%) were heterozygous (IB1/JIP-1+/−) whereas the remaining 49 pups (33%) were wild-type animals (IB1/JIP-1+/+), which is in accordance with the expected Mendelian distribution.Table IGenotypic ratios of embryos from IB1/JIP-1 heterozygote intercrossesAge1-aE3.5, E9.5, and E12.5 represent day 3.5, 9.5, and 12.5 of gestation; P 28 represents 28 days after birth.No. littersNo. pupsNo. each genotype1-b+/+, wild-type; +/−, heterozygotes; −/−, homozygous for the IB1/JIP-1 allele.E3.542711151E9.553312210E12.53163130P 28107223490Total (%)2214849 (33%)98 (66%)1 (1%)1-a E3.5, E9.5, and E12.5 represent day 3.5, 9.5, and 12.5 of gestation; P 28 represents 28 days after birth.1-b +/+, wild-type; +/−, heterozygotes; −/−, homozygous for the IB1/JIP-1 allele. Open table in a new tab To test whether IB1/JIP-1−/− embryos survive to the blastocyst stage, embryos were isolated from IB1/JIP-1+/−intercrosses 24 h post-coitum and grown in culture up to 5 days. For genotyping the embryos, we used a PCR strategy to identify the wild-type and disrupted allele by amplifying DNA fragments located either in exons 4 and 5 of the murine MAPK8IP1 gene or in exon 3 and in the neomycin gene. As shown in Fig.2, the genomic PCR amplification using the primers located in exons 4 and 5 identified a 406-bp fragment that includes the intronic sequence of 170 bp present between the two exons (Fig. 2, lane 1). Embryos were genotyped at two-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages. A total number of 41 embryos from 3 different litters were genotyped; 21 were heterozygotes (IB1/JIP-1+/−), and 20 were wild-type (IB1/JIP-1+/+). The absence of null mutant embryos (IB1/JIP-1−/−) in these 41 embryos was suggestive of a very early embryological death because of the absence of theMAPK8IP1 gene.Figure 2IB1/JIP-1 mRNA is detected during early embryogenesis. Reverse-transcribed RNAs, extracted from oocytes and zygotes at two different developmental stages (two-cell embryos and blastocysts), were PCR-amplified using primers specific for theMAPK8IP1 gene. This procedure resulted in the amplification of a single 236-bp product, seen after ethidium bromide staining. PCR amplification of mouse genomic DNA resulted in the amplification of a 406-bp product.

RNA from two-cell embryos and blastocysts were isolated, and RT-PCR was performed using the oligonucleotides located in exons 4 and 5. The RT-PCR strategy identified a 236-bp amplicon, which corresponds to the IB1/JIP-1 RNA lacking the intronic sequence located within the two exons (Fig. 2). The IB1/JIP-1 transcript was detected in the two-cell embryos indicating either that early transcription occurred during the process of embryonic genome activation and/or that IB1/JIP-1 transcripts were already present in the unfertilized oocyte (Fig. 2). IB1/JIP-1 mRNA was also found to be present in testis by Northern blot analysis (data not shown), and immunocytochemistry studies were then performed in unfertilized oocytes and mature spermatozoa and during various stages of embryonic development using affinity-purified antibodies raised against IB1/JIP-1 (Fig. 3,A–J). IB1/JIP-1 was immunodetected in zygote in pronucleate stage, in blastocysts, and in mature spermatozoa (Fig. 3,A–J). To explore the possibility that the disrupted allele could be associated with a loss of IB1/JIP-1 protein in a fraction of the spermatozoa, aliquots of freshly isolated spermatozoa were smeared on microscope slides. After immunostaining using the anti-IB1/JIP-1 antibodies, we counted the spermatozoa for positive and negative staining. Over 600 separate mature spermatozoa isolated form three heterozygous animals (IB1/JIP1+/−) were evaluated, and all expressed IB1/JIP-1. This result indicates that the presence of IB1/JIP-1 in all mature spermatozoa of heterozygous mice (IB1/JIP1+/−) is the consequence of a translated RNA transcribed during a dizygotic stage of spermatogenesis. Similarly, we detected the presence of IB1/JIP-1 in unfertilized oocytes, even when studying heterozygous animals (IB1/JIP1+/−) (data not shown). These results indicated that IB1/JIP-1 may play a role during fertilization, spermatogenesis, and oogenesis, possibly linked to the activated JNK pathway, which was described in X. laevis to be selectively activated during oocyte maturation (5Bagowski C.P.

Tubulin (TUB) was subsequently immunodetected on the same blot for normalization. IB1/JIP-1 content in brain peaked within the first 15 days (25Pellet J.B. Haefliger J.A. Staple J.K. Widmann C.

In a separate set of experiments, we therefore examined the genotypic ratios of the progeny obtained from male heterozygous mice (IB1/JIP-1+/−) with female heterozygous mice (IB1/JIP-1+/−), from male heterozygous mice (IB1/JIP-1+/−) with wild-type female (IB1/JIP-1+/+), and conversely the progeny of female heterozygous mice (IB1/JIP-1+/−) with wild-type male (IB1/JIP-1+/+). As shown in TableII, the genotypic ratios of these intercrosses were in accordance with the Mendelian distribution, thus excluding an impaired fertility linked to the haploinsufficiency of the IB1/JIP-1 protein.Table IIGenotypic ratios of the progeny obtained by intercrossing male or female IB1/JIP-1+/− heterozygotesMaleFemaleLittersAverage pups/litterOffspring genotype+/−+/+886.3 ± 2.1296 (53%)261 (47%)0+/++/−225.6 ± 1.956 (46%)67 (54%)0+/−+/−217.2 ± 2.045 (30%)106 (70%)0 Open table in a new tab We next examined by Western blotting the IB1/JIP-1 content in wild-type and IB1/JIP-1+/+-deficient mice. IB1/JIP-1 content was decreased by approximately 45% in the brain of heterozygous IB1/JIP-1+/− mice. Fig. 3 K depicts the IB1/JIP-1 content in brain during various development stages. Once normalized with the tubule content, the IB1/JIP-1 reduction found in the heterozygous IB1/JIP-1+/− mice was more apparent prior to day 15 post-natal. Glucose homeostasis was also evaluated monthly on regular chow in wild-type and heterozygous mice during 6 months in two different genetic backgrounds (C57BL/6 and 129 SvJ). Fasting plasma levels of glucose and insulin were similar between wild-type and heterozygous IB1/JIP-1+/− mice (data not shown). Lastly, pancreas histology was performed, and no obvious difference was observed in wild-type and heterozygous IB1/JIP-1+/−animals.DISCUSSIONWe have found that disruption of the murine geneMAPK8IP1 encoding IB1/JIP-1 leads to an early embryological death, prior to the blastocyst implantation. In culture, no complete null mutant IB1/JIP-1−/− was identified as early as two-cell stage, suggesting the requirement of IB1/JIP-1 in the first cell cycles. In accordance with the potential importance of the scaffold protein IB1/JIP-1 in early embryogenesis, we detected mRNA encoding the protein from two-cell and blastocyst stages. IB1/JIP-1 RNA and protein were also detected in unfertilized oocytes and in spermatozoa. Despite the expression of IB1/JIP-1 in unfertilized oocytes and testis, we did not find an alteration in fertility in heterozygote IB1/JIP+/− mice. The early death of fertilized null mutant IB1/JIP−/− oocytes indicates therefore that de novo transcription of theMAPK8IP1 gene is required for the survival of the fertilized oocyte.IB1/JIP-1 functions as a scaffold protein that organizes the JNK signal transduction pathway (1Davis R.J.

Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). As mentioned, the JNK pathway plays several roles during embryogenesis (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3584) Google Scholar, 2Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4318) Google Scholar, 3Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In X. laeviseggs, the JNK pathway is activated during oogenesis and stays activated in early embryogenesis (5Bagowski C.P. Xiong W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1459-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The selective disruption of genes involved in the control of the JNK activity leads, for several of them, to embryological death (17Dong C. Yang D.D. Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 18Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K. Chang L. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mech.

Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, the embryological death observed in IB1/JIP-1+/− embryos is the earliest one observed in the JNK cascade indicating the critical role of early transcription of MAPK8IP1 during the first cell cycles. These early cell stages are characterized by the conversion of the two parental genomes into a single embryonic genome with the initiation of the first divisions (24Latham K.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 193: 71-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early embryonic cells proliferate rapidly with doubling time as short as 2 h at day 6.5 post-coitum (24Latham K.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 193: 71-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oocyte cytoplasm plays a critical role by controlling and reprogramming nuclear function. The maternal cytoplasmic functions include the repression of genes in the first 10 to 20 h post-fertilization followed by reactivation of appropriate specific genes. Because IB1/JIP-1 is detected in wild-type and heterozygote IB1/JIP-1+/− oocytes, it is unlikely that cytoplasmic IB1/JIP-1 contributes to the reprogramming of the nuclear function. On the other hand, it has been shown that too early transcription or an inappropriate temporal transcription could induce embryonic lethality (24Latham K.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 193: 71-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A non-coordinated expression of specific genes during this process of embryonic genome activation may result in loss of normal embryogenesis. The earliest steps of embryonic genome activation involved decondensation of nuclear sperm and formation of the maternal and paternal pronuclei, followed by an alteration of chromatin structure to initiate early gene transcription. The disruption of any of these genes events may lead to inappropriate cell division and differentiation. Our data established that the MAPK8IP1 gene encoding IB1/JIP-1 is one of these critical genes for which early transcription is required to allow early embryo cleavage and survival. IB1/JIP-1 transcription in these stages may be required to allow proper JNK signaling to occur and/or to prevent an inappropriate level of JNK activation. In ex vivo experiments, it was shown that low cellular content of IB1/JIP-1 is associated with an increased apoptosis rate whereas experimentally increasing the cellular IB1/JIP-1 content could confer protection to stress-induced apoptosis (15Bonny C. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Schorderet D.F. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16466-16472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our data indicate that despite the maternal and paternal transmission of IB1/JIP-1 in heterozygote IB1/JIP-1+/− mice, the level of transmitted protein is unable to allow proper cell survival. The MAPK8IP1 gene encoding IB1/JIP-1 needs therefore to be transcriptionally active during the first cell cycles. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)1 are key enzymes involved in diverse cellular processes in response to extracellular stimuli. In mammals, three major groups of MAPK have been identified, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3584) Google Scholar, 2Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4318) Google Scholar, 3Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway is activated by many forms of stress including cytokines, heat shock, or radiation. In response to these stimuli, specific MAPK kinase kinases are activated that modulate MAPK kinase such as MKK4 and MKK7, which sequentially phosphorylate the JNK kinase. Once activated, the JNK phosphorylates c-Jun, which in turn increases transcription activity of many target genes. The functions of the signal transduction mediated by the JNK group of MAPKs include the control of cell survival and apoptosis, the regulation of cell proliferation, and embryonic morphogenesis (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3584) Google Scholar, 2Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4318) Google Scholar, 3Leppa S.

JNK homologs have been identified inDrosophila, and this signaling pathway is required for embryonic epithelial cell sheet movement and planar polarity (4Stronach B.E. Perrimon N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6172-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).

The specificity of JNK activation and function requires the presence of the scaffold protein c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) (6Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A.

PV6Gna bound to lectins specific for glucose but not galactose as did other glucose-derivatized polymers. However, hepatocyte adhesion onto the PV6Gna surface was inhibited in the presence of galactose and its analogues but not in the presence of glucose and its analogues. We also showed that hepatocyte adhesion to the PV6Gna surface was inhibited dose dependently by asialofetuin (ASF). Interactions between soluble PV6Gna and hepatocytes were inhibited by GalNAc, ASF, and EGTA in flow cytometry analysis using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated PV6Gna. Hepatocyte adhesion to the PV6Gna surface was inhibited more effectively by GalNAc than by methyl β-d-galactose. In flow cytometry analysis and cell adhesion assay, ASF competed for the inhibition of interaction between PV6Gna and hepatocytes 0.5–4 × 105-fold more effectively than did GalNAc. These results demonstrate involvement of asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs) in the interaction between PV6Gna and hepatocytes. Furthermore, to clarify the mechanism of the interaction between glycopolymers modified at the 6-OH position of glucose and the hepatocyte, we prepared a gel particle containing 6-O-methacryloyl-d-glucose (PMglc) synthesized by an enzymatic method. ASGPRs could be detected using Western blot analysis following precipitation with PMglc in hepatocyte cell lysate. The precipitation of ASGPRs was inhibited in the presence of galactose, ASF, PV6Gna, and EGTA. The precipitation was inhibited more effectively by GalNAc than by methyl β-d-galactose. ASGPRs were rarely precipitated by PMglc in the cell lysate that had been treated with ASF-conjugated Sepharose. Taken together, we suggest that mouse primary hepatocytes adhere to the PV6Gna surface mediated by ASGPRs, which specifically interacted with the glycopolymers modified at the C-6 position of glucose.

Multivalent glycopolymer ligands have been designed for clustering of L-selectin leading to the activation of the leukocyte cell surface and the inhibition of L-selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling (6Gordon E.J.

Interaction between the carbohydrate and the carbohydrate-binding proteins (CBPs)1 is achieved through hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl group of the carbohydrate to the polar amino acid side chain of the protein, including the packing of a hydrophobic sugar face against the aromatic amino acid side chain of the protein (8Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 6: 441-473Crossref Scopus (998) Google Scholar). CBPs interact with a particular carbohydrate by recognizing subtle differences in carbohydrate structure (9Sastry M.V. Banarjee P. Patanjali S.R. Swamy M.J. Swarnalatha G.V. Surolia A. J. Biol.

Thus, the carbohydrate specificity to the cells varies according to the kind of CBPs distributed on the cell. Asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs) are lectins for receptor-mediated endocytosis found at the hepatocyte cell surface that are bound to galactose/GalNAc-terminated ligands in a calcium-dependent manner (1Morell A.G.

Because ASGPRs are widely used as a model for the study of receptor-mediated endocytosis, galactose-derivatized materials have been a source applied to a cell-targeted drug delivery system for hepatocytes and as an artificial adhesion matrix for liver tissue engineering (15Julyan P.J.

Recently we developed a novel amphiphilic glucose-derivatized PV6Gna as an artificial adhesion matrix for hepatocyte cultures and investigated the effects of the substituted position of the hydroxyl group of glucose on recognition of mouse hepatocytes (19Kim S. Goto M. Cho C. Akaike T. Biotechnol. Lett. 2000; 22: 1049-1057Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mouse primary hepatocytes were specifically recognized by PV6Gna due to the modification of the C-6 position of glucose but not the C-1 and C-3 positions. The adhesion of hepatocytes to the PV6Gna surface was dependent on Ca2+ and independent of temperature unlike integrin-dependent adhesion. These results indicated that hepatocytes might be interacting with PV6Gna mediated by a CBP such as a glucose transporter as well as an ASGPR on the cell membrane surface. Mammalian hepatocytes were mainly recognized by glycopolymers that act as natural and artificial ligands having terminal galactose/GalNAc moieties, although chicken hepatocytes were recognized by terminal GlcNAc moieties (20Scnnaar R.L.

Accordingly there are many reports that address the behavior of hepatocyte adhesion to artificial polymer surfaces having terminal galactose moieties (23Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Ora A. Schnaar R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Griffith L.G. Lopina S. Biomaterials. 1998; 19: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have also developed poly-(N-p-vinylbenzyl-4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-d-gluconamide) (PVLA) having terminal galactose moieties as an artificial matrix for hepatocyte cultures (26Kobayashi A. Kobayashi K. Akaike T. J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed. 1992; 3: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Previous studies examined hepatic functions and gene regulation of hepatocytes cultured on a PVLA surface compared with different extracellular matrixes (27Nagaki M. Shidoji Y. Yamada Y. Sugiyama A.

Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1514-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, PV6Gna is the first polymer having glucose moieties capable of binding to mammalian hepatocytes. In this study, we evaluated the selectivity of PV6Gna against lectins and further found that the mechanism of binding of PV6Gna to hepatocytes was caused by recognition between ASGPRs and glucose moieties. Glycopolymers including PV6Gna were synthesized and conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) according to a method described previously (19Kim S. Goto M. Cho C. Akaike T. Biotechnol. Lett. 2000; 22: 1049-1057Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian UNITY plus 400 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as external standard. Polystyrene (PS) plates or dishes were obtained from Becton Dickinson. Biotin-labeled lectins and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from EY Laboratories and Vector Laboratories, respectively. Monosaccharides and glycosides were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan) except for methyl α-d-glucoside, methyl β-d-glucoside, and d-glucuronic acid, which were obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Collagenase and trypsin inhibitor were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical and Nacalai Tesque, respectively. Williams' medium E, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Asialofetuin (ASF) and fetuin were purchased from Sigma. The DC Protein Assay kit was purchased from Bio-Rad. Proleather was kindly given by Amano Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan). ASF-conjugated Sepharose was prepared by incubating CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 2.5 mg/ml ASF in coupling buffer (0.1m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.0) at 4 °C overnight as described by the manufacturer. Mouse monoclonal anti-ASGPR was a generous gift from Daiichi Pure Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). ICR mice were obtained from Japan SLC, Inc. A polystyrene enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate (IWAKI, Tokyo, Japan) was coated with 0.1 mg/ml of PVLA, PVMEA, PVMA, PVG, and PV6Gna for 4 h and blocked with 1 wt% BSA dissolved in PBS (PBS/BSA) for 2 h at room temperature. The plate was incubated with between 0.1 and 25 μm biotin-labeled Canavalia ensiformis lectin (ConA), Lens culinaris lectin (LcH), Allomyrina dichotoma lectin (Allo A), and Arachis hypogaea lectin (PNA) in the buffer recommended by the manufacturer for 1 h at room temperature and then washed five times with 0.1 wt% Tween 20 dissolved in PBS (PBS-T). To the plate was added 1 × 10−4-fold peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin in 1 wt% PBS/BSA. The plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed five times with PBS-T. An orthophenylenediamine solution (0.4 mg/ml orthophenylenediamine and 0.4μl/ml H2O2 in citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0) was used as a substrate of peroxidase. Absorbance at 492 nm was measured by a microplate reader (MTP-32, Corona Electric Co., Ibaraki, Japan). Hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of male ICR mice (5–7 weeks old) by a modification of the in situcollagenase perfusion method that includes perfusion with EGTA before collagenase treatment as described previously (29Morita M. Watanabe Y. Akaike T. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1585-1593PubMed Google Scholar, 30Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5208) Google Scholar). The perfusion buffer, pH 7.2, contained 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mmKCl, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.42 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mmHEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, and 5 mm glucose. The collagenase buffer, pH 7.5, contained 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.42 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mmHEPES, 0.15 g/liter collagenase, 0.05 g/liter trypsin inhibitor, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, and 0.016 mm phenol red. Briefly, the liver was perfused by the perfusion buffer and collagenase buffer through a needle aligned along the inferior vena cava. The collagenase-perfused liver was dissected, suspended in Hanks' solution (30 ml), and filtered through a cheesecloth and a 100-μm nylon membrane to remove connective tissue debris and cell clumps. Hepatocytes were purified by four centrifugations (42 ×g, 2 min) at 4 °C and a density gradient centrifugation (42 × g, 10 min) using 45% Percoll solution. Cell viability measured by trypan blue exclusion was more than 90%. The isolated hepatocytes (1 × 105cells/ml) were preincubated in the presence of carbohydrate inhibitors in Hanks' salt solution for 30 min on ice and allowed to adhere for 30 min at 4 °C onto the polystyrene plate, which had been coated with 0.1 mg/ml PV6Gna followed by blocking with 0.5 wt% PBS/BSA to prevent nonspecific adhesion. Nonadherent hepatocytes were removed from the dish by washing with PBS three times, and protein was extracted from the adhered hepatocytes with a 0.25 wt% NaOH solution. The percentage of cell adhesion was determined from the amount of protein measured by the improved Lowry method (DC Protein Assay kit). All values were normalized to the percentage of adhesion of the maximum, which was taken as 100%. Blood (0.1 ml) was collected from the heart of the ICR mouse, diluted with 0.04% EDTA (0.5 ml) in PBS solution, and washed with PBS solution (0.5 ml) by three centrifugations (1000 rpm, 5 min). Hepa 1-6 and NIH 3T3 fibroblast were incubated in tissue culture flasks containing complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium BulletKit-2 (EGM-2 BulletKit, Clonetics) under the same conditions described above. The media was renewed twice weekly. Cells at an 80% confluent state were rinsed and detached in 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in PBS for 5–7 min at 37 °C. The detached cells were washed with the fresh media three times by centrifugation (100 × g, 5 min) and suspended in the fresh media until used for experiments. Freshly isolated hepatocytes (5 × 105 cell/ml) were incubated with 100 μg/ml FITC-conjugated PV6Gna in Williams' medium E containing 0.1 wt% BSA and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. All cells were washed with PBS, 2.5 mm CaCl2 three times before the analysis of 5000 hepatocytes using a FACScanTM instrument (EPICS-XL, Beckman Coulter). The hepatocyte region was selected by adjusting the forward scatter and the side scatter. The surface-labeled hepatocytes with FITC-conjugated PV6Gna were selected from the region of PI-unlabeled hepatocytes to remove the cytoplasm-labeled damaged hepatocytes. PMglc was prepared as a new gel particle containing 6-O-methacryloyl glucose synthesized by a commercially available protease that catalyzes transesterification of glucose with vinyl methacrylate at the C-6 position of glucose as described previously (31Watanabe T. Matsue R. Honda Y. Kuwahara M. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 275: 215-220Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.6 g of d-glucose was incubated with 10 mm vinyl methacrylate in the presence of 1 g of Proleather in 10 ml of pyridine at 45 °C for 48 h. The product was separated by silica gel column chromatography and characterized by 13C NMR and HPLC analysis. The product was gelated in the presence of ammonium peroxodisulfate as an initiator in H2O for 30 min at 55 °C and sonicated to make a fine particle. PMglc was used following removal of large particles by filtering with a 4-μm membrane filter. For ASGPR precipitation with PMglc, freshly isolated hepatocytes were solubilized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 wt% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C before being added to PMglc in the lysis buffer containing 2 mmCaCl2 for 4 h at 4 °C. In the inhibitory test, the inhibitors were added in the lysates in advance. Pellets were washed four times in washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 wt% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmCaCl2) and resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2 wt% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were eluted from PMglc by boiling the samples for 5 min and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12% resolving gel followed by Western blot analysis with mouse monoclonal anti-ASGPR using standard techniques. For detection, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. A direct lectin-enzyme assay was carried out to determine the type of the sugar moiety of PV6Gna compared with other glycopolymers shown in Fig.1 that have glucose or galactose moieties. Dose-dependent binding of lectins to the glycopolymers is shown in Fig. 2. ConA and LcH showed a greater selectivity in binding to PVMA, PVG, and PV6Gna substituted at C-1, C-3, and C-6 of glucose, respectively, than to PVLA and PVMEA, which have galactose moieties. Allo A bound only to PVLA, whereas PNA bound to both PVLA and PVMEA, and neither lectin bound to the glycopolymers having glucose moieties such as PV6Gna. ConA and LcH as lectins have specificity to α-d-mannose or α-d-glucose, whereas Allo A and PNA are lectins specific to β-d-galactose (8Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 6: 441-473Crossref Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 32Loganathan D. Osborne S.E. Glick G.D. Goldstein I.J. Arch. Biochem.

In particular, ConA bound to PVMA with a higher affinity than to PV6Gna and PVG of the glucose-derivatized polymers as shown in Fig.2 a. This result is in agreement with the observation from the x-ray crystallography that the O-3, O-4, O-5, and O-6 positions of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside formed hydrogen bond with ConA, whereas the O-1 position did not contribute to binding with ConA (34Li T. Lee H. Park K. J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed. 1998; 9: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, the carbohydrate in PV6Gna was characterized by13C NMR spectra in Me2SO-d 6 and compared with authentic carbohydrates such as glucuronic acid and galactose as depicted in Fig. 3. Although the PV6Gna was readily soluble in both Me2SO and water, NMR analysis was carried out in Me2SO-d 6 only because the signals were observed to broaden in the latter solvent. The galactose existed as only the α-anomeric form, which is represented by a peak at 92.7 ppm in Me2SO. The C-2–C-4 signals of the galactose appeared at 68.9–69.5 ppm (Fig. 3 a), whereas the C-2–C-5 signals of the glucuronic acid appeared at 71.6–76.1 ppm (Fig. 3 b). Specifically, the peak at 68.9 ppm represents C-3 of α-d-galactose according to the 13C chemical shift for carbohydrates (35Kalinowski H.-O. Berger S. Braun S. Carbon-13 NMR Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1988: 441-443Google Scholar). The C-2–C-5 signals of carbohydrate in PV6Gna appeared at 71.5–76.3 ppm and paralleled those of glucuronic acid (Fig. 3 c). Together the results suggest that PV6Gna is a polymer that has glucose moieties and binds to ConA and LcH mediated by the hydrophilic glucose moieties exposed on the PS surface.Figure 2Direct lectin-enzyme assay for glycopolymers.

Hepatocytes exclusively adhered onto the polystyrene surface that had been coated with 0.1 mg/ml PVLA, PVMEA, and PV6Gna but not PVMA or PVG as shown in Fig.4 a. Mammalian primary hepatocytes are specifically recognized by the glycoproteins that act as natural and artificial ligands having terminal galactose/GalNAc moieties. As expected, hepatocytes interacted with PVLA and PVMEA having terminal galactose moieties. On the other hand, hepatocytes interacted only with PV6Gna among the glycopolymers that have glucose moieties. A photomicrograph of hepatocytes adhered to the PV6Gna surface is shown in Fig. 4 b indicating that it did not result from contamination by nonparenchymal cells, such as Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells, of our hepatocyte preparation. The results indicate that hepatocytes specifically recognize PV6Gna due to the substitution of the C-6 position of glucose but not at the C-1 and C-3 positions. We investigated the selectivity of the carbohydrate against the CBP used in the adhesion. TableI presents the inhibitory effects of various carbohydrates on the hepatocyte adhesion onto the PV6Gna surface. Hepatocyte adhesion to the PV6Gna surface was drastically reduced to ∼4% of control adhesion, which represents hepatocyte adhesion to the PV6Gna surface in the absence of competitive inhibitors and in the presence of 20 mm of d-galactose (Gal), 4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-d-glucose (lactose), methyl β-d-galactoside (methyl β-gal), 6-O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-d-glucose (melibiose), and GalNAc but not in the presence of 20 mm of glucose and its analogues. It is very interesting that the galactose-type carbohydrates exclusively inhibited hepatocyte adhesion to the PV6Gna that has glucose moieties. Our previous study showed that hepatocyte adhesion onto the PV6Gna surface occurred in a temperature-independent and Ca2+-dependent manner (19Kim S. Goto M. Cho C. Akaike T. Biotechnol. Lett. 2000; 22: 1049-1057Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Taken together the results indicate a relationship of the C-type lectin such as ASGPR with hepatocyte adhesion to the PV6Gna surface.Table IInhibition of hepatocyte adhesion to the PV6Gna surface by carbohydratesInhibitory carbohydrate (20 mm)Adhered cells%None100 ± 7d-Glucose93 ± 8Methyl α-d-glucoside100 ± 4Methyl β-d-glucoside97 ± 103-Methyld-glucose99 ± 7d-Mannose96 ± 10d-Fructose95 ± 5Sodiumd-glucuronate93 ± 2d-Glucosamine91 ± 4Maltose96 ± 2Sucrose99 ± 1Cellibiose91 ± 8Isomaltose94 ± 6d-Galactose4 ± 2Methyl β-d-galactoside3 ± 2Lactose4 ± 4Melibiose2 ± 2N-Acetyl-d-galactosamine4 ± 1 Open table in a new tab We examined the inhibitory effect that is dependent on the concentration of those galactose-type carbohydrates on the hepatocyte adhesion onto the PV6Gna surface. Hepatocyte adhesion to the PV6Gna surface was almost completely inhibited by 1 mm GalNAc, 5 mm methyl β-gal, 10 mm lactose, and 20 mm melibiose, respectively, as shown in Fig.5. Numerous studies have determined the difference of the affinity for carbohydrates of C-type lectins by using an inhibition binding assay and crystallographic analysis (36Lee R.T. Myers R.W. Lee Y.C.

For example, mannose-binding proteins have specificity for mannose, glucose, fucose, or GlcNAc, all of which have the equatorial hydroxyl group at the C-4 position, whereas mammalian hepatic lectins have specificity for galactose/GalNAc, which has the axial hydroxyl group of C-4. Despite 85% identity in the sequences of both the hepatic and macrophage receptors, they have distinct sugar binding properties. The hepatic receptor binds GalNAc with a greater affinity than Gal, whereas the macrophage receptor binds Gal and GalNAc with almost equal affinity (38Kolatkar A.R. Weis W.I J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6679-6685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Specifically, the rabbit and rat ASGPRs bound to GalNAc with a higher affinity than Gal. A terminal β-d-galactopyranosyl residue bound to the ASGPRs with a higher affinity than a α-d-galactopyranosyl residue and galactose when assaying the ability of the carbohydrates to inhibit125I-labeled asialoorosomucoid binding to the liver plasma membrane or the isolated lectin (36Lee R.T. Myers R.W. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6292-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In competition for binding to the carbohydrate recognition domain of rat hepatic lectin-1, GalNAc showed a greater binding affinity due to the effects of the acyl group of GalNAc binding to the carbohydrate recognition domain than did Gal (39Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We show in Fig. 5 that GalNAc inhibited hepatocyte adhesion to PV6Gna with between ∼5- and 20-fold higher affinity than the other carbohydrates, indicating that GalNAc has the most inhibitory effect on hepatocyte adhesion to the PV6Gna surface, and β-d-galactopyranosyl showed more of an increase of the inhibitory effect on the adhesion than did α-d-galactopyranosyl. Interestingly this means that hepatocytes may adhere to the PV6Gna surface through ASGPR on the cell surface membrane. To verify the possibi"

Here, we further investigated the coordinated molecular mechanisms by which α-ENaC expression is regulated. Using both stable and transient transfection assays, we demonstrate that the overexpression of high mobility group protein I-C (HMGI-C), a Ras/ERK-inducible HMG-I family member, represses glucocorticoid receptor (GR)/dexamethasone (Dex)-stimulated α-ENaC/reporter activity in salivary epithelial cells. Northern analyses further confirm that the expression of endogenous α-ENaC gene in salivary Pa-4 cells is suppressed by an ectopic HMGI-C overexpression. Through yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation assays from eukaryotic cells, we also discovered the interaction between HMGI-C and PIAS3 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)). A low level of ectopically expressed PIAS3 cooperatively inhibits GR/Dex-dependent α-ENaC transcription in the presence of HMGI-C. Reciprocally, HMGI-C expression also coordinately enhances PIAS3-mediated repression of STAT3-dependent transactivation. Moreover, overexpression of antisense HMGI-C construct is capable of reversing the repression mediated by Ras V12 on GR- and STAT3-dependent transcriptional activation. Together, our results demonstrate that Ras/ERK-mediated induction of HMGI-C is required to effectively repress GR/Dex-stimulated transcription of α-ENaC gene and STAT3-mediated transactivation. These findings delineate a network of inhibitory signaling pathways that converge on HMGI-C·PIAS3 complex, causally associating Ras/ERK activation with the repression of both GR and STAT3 signaling pathways in salivary epithelial cells.

Upon activation, GRs bind to the glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) and activate target gene transcription by either remodeling the chromatin structure or recruiting transcription initiation complex(es) containing RNA polymerase II to the promoter. Inhibition of GR-mediated transcription can occur through the activation of signaling pathway(s), such as MAPK/ERK. Through the studies identifying genes targeted by Ras/ERK pathway activation, our laboratory previously demonstrated that ERK activation led to the transcriptional repression of the α-subunit of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel (α-ENaC) gene (1Zentner M.D. Lin H.H.

A bona fide GRE, identified by us within the −1334 to −1306 base pair of rat α-ENaC promoter/enhancer region, which is conserved in human α-ENaC 5′-flanking region (4Sayegh R. Auerbach S.D. Li X.

However, the exact molecular pathways involved in the antagonistic cross-talk between Ras- and GR-mediated pathways that govern the overall transcriptional regulation of the α-ENaC gene remain largely unknown to date. In addition to repressing α-ENaC transcription, Ras/ERK pathway activation induces the expression of high mobility group I (HMG-I) protein, HMGI-C (5Li D. Lin H.H. McMahon M. Ma H. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25062-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HMGI-C, also known as a chromosomal architectural transcription factor, is a small and highly charged nuclear phosphoprotein that modulates DNA conformation-dependent, rather than DNA sequence specific, transcriptional activities (reviewed in Refs. 6Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 7Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the HMGI-C gene results in a pygmy phenotype and a loss of fat tissue in mice, suggesting that HMGI-C plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation (8Zhou X. Benson K.F. Ashar H.R. Chada K. Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar,9Anand A. Chada K. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanisms by which HMGI-C impinges on transcription remain to be elucidated. In general, high mobility group HMG-I proteins are proposed to exert their effects through facilitating the assembly of functional nucleoprotein complexes (10Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It is likely that nucleoprotein assembly facilitated by HMG-I members is promoted by either modifying DNA conformation or by recruiting nuclear proteins to an enhancer via binding of HMG-I family members to its interacting DNA element. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have established a direct correlation between the high level expression of the HMG-I family members and increased degree of neoplastic transformation (11Giancotti V. Pani B. D'Andrea P. Berlingieri M.T. Di Fiore P.P. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Philp R. Crane-Robinson C. Nicolas R.H. Wright C.A. Goodwin G.H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5310-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This is particularly evident for HMGI-C, which is mainly expressed in fully transformed cells, in addition to being involved in early embryonic development (11Giancotti V. Pani B. D'Andrea P. Berlingieri M.T. Di Fiore P.P. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Philp R. Crane-Robinson C. Nicolas R.H. Wright C.A. Goodwin G.H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1981-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Tallini G. Dal Cin P. Adv. Anat. Pathol. 1999; 6: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Indeed, the cell transformation induced by retrovirus (14Berlingieri M.T. Manfioletti G. Santoro M. Bandiera A. Visconti R. Giancotti V. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or ectopic Raf-1 overexpression (39Li D. Ph.D. thesis. University of Southern California, 1997Google Scholar) is reversed when the synthesis of HMGI-C protein is inhibited with a HMGI-C antisense approach. Although the HMGI-C protein or mRNA level is low or undetectable in differentiated or nonproliferating cells, the expression of HMGI-C can be transiently induced by Ras/ERK pathway activation and growth-stimulating factors (5Li D. Lin H.H. McMahon M. Ma H. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25062-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Lanahan A. Williams J.B. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the biological consequence of transient HMGI-C expression in non-transformed or non-malignant cells. In the past few years, emerging biochemical and genetic evidence have indicated that changes in the expression levels of HMG-I family elicit either stimulatory or inhibitory effects on target gene expression (16Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Here, we report an additional and heretofore unexpected role for HMGI-C in the down-regulation of α-ENaC gene expression. These transcriptional regulatory effects of HMGI-C appear to be mediated by its association with the protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3), which has been previously shown to bind to activated STAT3 and to block STAT3 DNA binding activity (17Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). PIAS3, a protein of 583 amino acids, has a molecular mass of 68 kDa and binds specifically to STAT3, but not to other STATs. Furthermore, PIAS3 belongs to a family of proteins, some of which inhibit the transactivation of other STAT-responsive genes (reviewed in Ref. 18Shuai K. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We demonstrate herein that HMGI-C interacts with PIAS3 in a cooperative way to inhibit GR/Dex-stimulated transcription of the α-ENaC gene and enhance PIAS3-mediated repression on STAT3-dependent transactivation. To our knowledge, this is the first report to provide a molecular mechanism by which the Ras/ERK signaling utilizes specific components of the chromosomal architecture protein, i.e.HMGI-C, and cytokine signaling pathway, i.e. PIAS3, collectively to repress GR-stimulated α-ENaC transcription and STAT3-dependent transactivation, respectively. Furthermore, these results provide a molecular explanation for the inhibitory effects on glucocorticoid activated gene expression by the Ras/ERK pathway in general, and for the Ras/ERK-mediated suppression of STAT3-responsive gene(s) as well. The rat parotid epithelial cell line Pa-4, also known as parotid C5 cells (19Quissell D.O. Barzen K.A. Redman R.S. Camden J.M. Turner J.T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1998; 34: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was plated on Primaria culture dishes (Falcon) in Dulbeccos's modified Eagle's/F-12 (1:1) medium (supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum, insulin (5 µg/ml), transferrin (5 µg/ml), epidermal growth factor (25 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (1.1 µm), glutamate (5 mm), and kanamycin monosulfate (60 µg/ml)), and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 35 °C. For establishing Pa-4/HMGI-C cells, Pa-4 cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3-HA-HMGI-C (see below for details) using LipofectAMINETM according to the manufacturer's instruction (Life Technologies) and selected with G418 for neomycin resistant colonies at a concentration of 600 µg/ml. Different clones of stably transfected cells were selected by limiting dilution. The expression of HMGI-C in Pa-4/HMGI-C cells was evaluated by Western analyses of cell lysates using an anti-HA antibody. Total RNA was extracted from Pa-4 or Pa-4/HMGI-C cells with TRIzol™ Reagents (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) per the manufacturer's instructions. The quality and quantity of RNA were analyzed by fractionating an equal amount of RNA from each sample on a 1.5% agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 mformaldehyde, staining with ethidium bromide, and comparing 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNAs among different samples. For Northern analyses, equal amounts of RNA (18 µg/sample) from parental, transfected, or treated cells were electrophoresed through a denaturing agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.), and UV cross-linked. All blots were pre-hybridized for 1 h with QuickHybTM (StratageneTM) and hybridized according to manufacturer's recommendations. To screen various blots, [32P]dCTP-labeled probes were synthesized using either rat α-ENaC (bases 1–905 (1Zentner M.D. Lin H.H. Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) or mouse PIAS3 (bases 576–1176 (17Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar)) cDNA fragments as a template. A rat β-actin probe was also included to ensure that the quality and quantity of RNA between lanes were comparable. All blots were washed in a 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS solution at 60 °C. To improve autoradiographic detection, exposure was carried out overnight at −80 °C using intensifying screens. HA-tagged HMGI-C was cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector as follows. An EcoRI site-encompassing 5′-primer, 5′-GAGAATTCATGAGCGCACGCGGTGAGG-3′ and aXbaI-encompassing 3′-primer, 5′-GATCTAGAATGTCGGCGCCCCCTAATC-3′ were employed in a PCR amplification using HMGI-C cDNA as a template. The resulting PCR product was cloned into HA-tag containing plasmid, HA-pBluescript SK (a kind gift from Dr. Michael Stallcup, University of Southern California). By digesting the resulting plasmid withBamHI/XbaI, the amplified PCR DNA fragment with a HA-tag was excised from pBluescript SK vector and recloned into pcDNA3.1 that had been linearized with the same restriction enzymes. After confirming with DNA sequence analyses, the expression of the resultant HA-HMGI-C pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid was verified by the in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega) with T7 RNA polymerase, obtaining a translation product of ∼14 kDa. The antisense HMGI-C construct was prepared as follows. First, the PCR fragment of HMGI-C was amplified from HMGI-C cDNA using aBamHI site encompassing 5′-primer, 5′-GAGGATCCATGAGCGCACGCGGTGAGG-3′ and EcoRI site encompassing 3′-primer, 5′-CGGAATTCCCTAATCTTCCTCTGCGG-3′. Subsequently, the PCR fragment was cloned into pSG5 (Stratagene) by ligating the desired insert and vector DNA following the digestion of both PCR fragment and vector with BamHI and EcoRI. Plasmids were transiently transfected into Pa-4 or Pa-4/HMGI-C cells by the LipofectAMINE™ mediated method as described previously (20Lin H.H. Tu Z.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27637-27644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In all transfection experiments, 0.1 µg of Renilla luciferase plasmid, pRL-TK (Promega), was included as an indicator plasmid to normalize for transfection efficiency. Plasmid encoding for FLAG-PIAS3 was generously provided by Dr. Kei Shuai (University of California at Los Angeles). The plasmid molar ratio and total amount of transfected DNA (2 µg) were kept constant by supplementing with appropriate amounts of the pCMV, and/or pkRSPA (21Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after the start of transfection, media was changed and cells were treated as indicated and harvested 24 h thereafter. For immunoprecipitation, the lysate volume equivalent to 100 µg of nuclear protein was suspended in 1 ml of Dignum D buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 75 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 3% bovine serum albumin) and pre-cleared with 40 µl of a pre-equilibrated protein A-Sepharose slurry for 30 min. The supernatant was then incubated with 0.2 µg of anti-FLAG antibody for 30 min, and followed by 90 min incubation with 30 µl of pre-equilibrated 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose slurry. The Sepharose beads were sedimented, washed three times with an incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4), and resuspended in 4 × SDS gel loading buffer (62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% (w/v) bromophenol blue). All the incubations above were carried out at 4 °C using an end over end rotator. Parental and HMGI-C/Lex A transfected L-40 yeast cells were pelleted and washed in ice water. Cell pellets were resuspended in pre-warmed (60 °C) cracking buffer containing glass beads, lysed by vortexing for 1 min, and boiled for 4 min. Fifty µl of supernatant were loaded on a gradient (4–20%) SDS-PAGE, electroblotted on Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and probed with an anti-Lex A antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). HA-HMGI-C was detected using murine anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance). PIAS3 was detected using murine anti-FLAGTM M5 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to visualize proteins of interest. L-40 cells with a genotype of MATa, ade2, his3, trp1, leu2, LYS2:lex A-lacZ,and URA3:Lex A-HIS3(22Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) were cultured in either complete (Yc), enriched (YPAD), or synthetically depleted (−WUK, −WUKHL) media (Difco). The Yc, YPAD, −WUK, and −WUKHL media were prepared as follows. Yc contained per liter basis, 1.2 g of yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids), 5 g of ammonium sulfate, 10 g of succinic acid, 6 g of NaOH, 0.1 g each of adenine, arginine, cysteine, leucine, lysine, threonine, tryptophan, and uracil, and 0.05 g each of aspartic acid, histidine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, tyrosine, and valine. YPAD contained per liter basis, 10 g of yeast extract, 20 g of peptone, and 0.1 g of adenine. Synthetically depleted −WUK medium contained the same components as Yc with the omission of tryptophan, uracil, and lysine, whereas −WUKHL medium lacks histidine and leucine as well. All yeast cells were grown at 30 °C. DNA construct used for yeast two-hybrid screening was prepared as follows. The rat full-length HMGI-C coding sequence was PCR amplified using forward and reverse primers of 5′-GAGAATTCATGAGCGCACGCGGTGAGG-3′ and 5′-GAGGTAGATCTTGAATGTCGGCGCCCCCTAAT-3′, respectively. The desired PCR product was cloned into pCRTM 2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), excised with EcoRI, and subcloned in-frame with the LexA coding sequence of the DNA-binding domain expression vector, BTM116 (23Bartel P. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, New York1997Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with HMGI-C, a mouse 17-day-old embryo two-hybrid cDNA library, harboring cDNA inserts from a mouse 17-day embryo and in-frame with the GAL4 coding sequence of the activation domain expression vector pGAD10, was obtained from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. Yeast strain L-40 was used and yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described in detail elsewhere (24Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M.

Briefly, L-40 cells, co-transformed with HMGI-C/BTM116 and cDNA/pGAD10, were grown for 16 h in −WUK medium prior to being plated onto −WUKHL plates. Candidates were selected and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as follows: L-40 cells were lifted from the plates with sterile nitrocellulose membranes, lysed by freeze/thaw for 30 s, and incubated with Z buffer (30 µm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.8 mm5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0) at 37 °C for 24 h. The interaction between HMGI-C and proteins encoded by the cDNA library activates His3 and LacZ reporter genes. His3 confers upon yeast the ability to grow on histidine-free selective medium, whereas LacZ produces β-galactosidase that can be detected colorimetrically by filter assays (24Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Total plasmid was rescued from positive candidates using Zymoprep™ Yeast Plasmid Rescue Kit (Zymo Research). To isolate plasmids encoding library cDNA, transformants that grew on ampicillin (100 µg/ml) containing medium were selected and further characterized by restriction enzyme digestions and asymmetric PCR-based sequencing (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were further analyzed by comparing them with those stored at GenBankTM and EMBL data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Previously, our laboratory utilized a mRNA differential display approach to identify downstream targets of Ras/ERK pathway activation that may be involved in modulating salivary epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation program(s). The small nuclear protein HMGI-C and the α-subunit of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel, α-ENaC, were identified as the Ras/ERK positive and negative responsive genes in salivary Pa-4 cells, respectively (5Li D. Lin H.H. McMahon M. Ma H. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25062-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because the kinetics of ERK-mediated induction of HMGI-C expression correlated well with that of ERK-mediated repression of the α-ENaC transcription, we considered whether or not HMGI-C might be a downstream effector of the ERK pathway that repressed GR-mediated expression of tissue specific genes, such as α-ENaC. To examine the possibility that HMGI-C expression alone was sufficient to repress α-ENaC transcription in cultured salivary epithelial cells, Pa-4 cells were transiently transfected with an ERK/GR-responsive −1.4α-ENaC/Luc reporter gene in the absence or presence of GR/Dex and increasing concentrations of a HMGI-C expression plasmid (Fig. 1 A). The choice of utilizing −1.4α-ENaC/Luc reporter in our assay was based on our previous observation that the GRE, located between nucleotides −1334 to −1306 in the rat α-ENaC 5′-flanking region, within −1.4α-ENaC/Luc reporter construct plays an essential role in dictating the overall α-ENaC expression level in salivary and lung epithelial cells (2Wang H.C.

Transfected Pa-4 cells were allowed to recover overnight, serum-deprived for 8 h, and Dex treated for 16 h prior to the reporter assays. As shown in Fig. 1 A, co-transfected HMGI-C inhibited the GR/Dex-stimulated −1.4αENaC/Luc reporter activities in a concentration-dependent manner (lane 6 versus lanes 7 through 10). Furthermore, low concentrations of co-transfected HMGI-C exerted a very modest inhibitory effect on −1.4α-ENaC/Luc expression in the absence of GR/Dex (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1). This modest inhibition of basal −1.4α-ENaC/Luc activity by HMGI-C probably reflects the residual glucocorticoid hormone in the culture system after serum starvation. While the GR/Dex treatment reproducibly induced the reporter activity by at least 5-fold, consistent with our previous report (3Lin H.H. Zentner M.D. Ho H.L. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the Dex-stimulated reporter activity was substantially inhibited by more than 30–50% with low concentrations of ectopic HMGI-C expression (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7 and 8 versus lane 6) and as much as by 80–90% with substantially abundant HMGI-C expression (Fig. 1 A, lanes 9 and 10 versus lane 6), respectively. Western analysis was performed to assure that there was a correlation between the protein expression levels of transfected HMGI-C and the amounts of HMGI-C plasmids utilized in each assay (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that the ectopic expression of HMGI-C alone, especially at low concentration, is sufficient to substantially repress GR-mediated α-ENaC expression without affecting its basal levels (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8 versus lanes 1 and 6) in Pa-4 cells. Steroid hormone receptors, such as the GR, enhance basal gene transcription by binding to their cognate DNA response sequences upstream or downstream of the core promoter. Since we had previously shown that the repression of α-ENaC transcription by ERK activation was dependent upon the presence of an intact GRE, we investigated whether HMGI-C also utilizes the same cis-element to elicit its inhibitory effect. To do this, we evaluated α-ENaC reporter expression in Pa-4 cells by comparing GR/Dex-stimulated transcription of the wild type and GRE-mutated reporter constructs in the presence or absence of ectopic HMGI-C expression. Expression constructs, −1.4α-ENaC/Luc and p(−1334/−1306)GL2-P that harbors one copy of α-ENaC GRE upstream of a heterologous SV40 promoter (3Lin H.H. Zentner M.D. Ho H.L. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and their corresponding GRE-mutated constructs were individually and transiently transfected in Pa-4 cells along with GR expression plasmid in combination with 0.15 µg of HA-HMGI-C expression construct (Fig.1 B). Consistent with our previous report (3Lin H.H. Zentner M.D. Ho H.L. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), Dex-stimulated reporter activities from both wild type constructs were reproducibly repressed by HMGI-C expression (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and12 versus lanes 2 and 10). Moreover, site-specific mutations on the GREs within both reporter constructs completely abolished this HMGI-C-mediated repression on GR/Dex-dependent transactivation of reporter constructs (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5–8 and 13–16 versus lanes 1–4and 9–12). As illustrated in Fig. 1, A andB, low levels of HMGI-C expression had almost no effect on the activities of these reporters in the absence of GR/Dex, supporting the notion that HMGI-C does not function as a general transcription repressor. Together, we conclude that α-ENaC GRE is indispensable for HMGI-C-mediated suppression of α-ENaC transcription. Because transiently transfected reporter constructs are less complex in their nucleosomal arrangement than genes in their native configuration, we investigated whether HMGI-C represses endogenous α-ENaC expression within its own native, higher order chromatin structure. To do this, a stably transfected clone, Pa-4/HMGI-C, which exhibited constitutive levels of HA-HMGI-C expression was established. Both Pa-4 and Pa-4/HMGI-C cells were cultured under serum-containing, -deprived, or -deprived/Dex-treated conditions, and then total RNAs from these cells were extracted for Northern blot analyses of endogenous α-ENaC expression. Moreover, the establishment of stably integrated Pa-4/HMGI-C cells as host cells for our assays also a"

IGF-I production by rat osteoblasts is stimulated by activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). In this report, we define two interacting PKA-regulated pathways that control IGF-I gene transcription in cultured human osteoblasts. Stimulation of cAMP led to a 12-fold increase in IGF-I mRNA and enhanced IGF-I promoter activity through a DNA response element termed HS3D and the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ). Under basal conditions, C/EBPδ was found in osteoblast nuclei but was transcriptionally silent. Treatment with the PKA inhibitor H-89 caused redistribution of C/EBPδ to the cytoplasm. After hormone treatment, the catalytic subunit of PKA accumulated in osteoblast nuclei. Inhibition of active PKA with targeted nuclear expression of PKA inhibitor had no effect on the subcellular location of C/EBPδ but prevented hormone-induced IGF-I gene activation, while cytoplasmic PKA inhibitor additionally caused the removal of C/EBPδ from the nucleus. These results show that IGF-I gene expression is controlled in human osteoblasts by two PKA-dependent pathways. Cytoplasmic PKA mediates nuclear localization of C/EBPδ under basal conditions, and nuclear PKA stimulates its transcriptional activity upon hormone treatment.

Members of the C/EBP family are related structurally and contain three well defined protein motifs: a NH2-terminal transactivation region, a central basic DNA-binding domain, and a COOH-terminal dimerization interface known as the leucine zipper segment (27Wedel A. Ziegler-Heibrock H.W.L. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).

The current experiments were initiated to assess regulation of IGF-I gene expression in human osteoblasts. We find that IGF-I gene transcription is acutely activated in these cells by PKA-mediated mechanisms that involve two separable but interacting pathways that converge on C/EBPδ. Cytoplasmic PKA maintains the predominant nuclear localization of C/EBPδ under basal conditions, and nuclear PKA stimulates its transcriptional activity upon hormone treatment. Both effects of PKA are indirect, since C/EBPδ does not appear to be a substrate for PKA.

Two oligonucleotides were generated, encoding sense and antisense sequences containing two tandem copies of the nls from SV40 large T antigen followed by a stop codon (boldface type) and flanked by a 5′ XhoI and a 3′ XbaI overhang (underlined): 5′-TCGAGCCTAAGAAGAAGAGGAAGGTCGGTACCGGAGGAGGTGAAGCACCCAAGAAGAAGCGAAAAGTAGGATCCACCGGATAA T-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTAGA TTATCCGGTGGATCCTACTTTTCGCTTCTTCTTGGGTGCTTCACCTCCTCCGGTACCGACCTTCCTCTTCTTCTTAGGC-3′ (antisense). The oligonucleotides were annealed, phosphorylated by T4 kinase, and ligated into the XhoI and XbaI sites of EGFP-PKI-(2–37). The coding region was confirmed by sequencing. Primary normal human osteoblasts cryopreserved in the third passage (lot 0F0630) were purchased from BioWhittaker Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Cells were used for experiments within one or two additional passages in our laboratory (no more than 10 population doublings). The osteoblastic phenotype was verified by the manufacturer by staining cells for alkaline phosphatase expression and by demonstrating mineralization in culture. Cells were propagated at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2in osteoblast growth medium (osteoblast basal medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20–30 mg/liter ascorbic acid, 50 mg/liter gentimicin, and 50 µg/liter amphotericin B, all from BioWhittaker Inc.). Cells were transfected at 50–70% confluent density with Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or Effectene (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) using protocols developed by the manufacturers. In situ hybridization was performed using a DIG-labeled human IGF-I riboprobe. An 817-base pair human IGF-IA cDNA was excised from pGEM1 (35Rotwein P. Folz R.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11807-11812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with RsaI and EcoRI and subcloned into the HincII andEcoRI sites of pBluescript KS to generate pBS-IGF-IA. Thein situ hybridization probe was generated from theKpnI-linearized plasmid by in vitro transcription in the presence of DIG RNA labeling mix using T7 RNA polymerase, following a protocol modified from Raap et al. (36Raap A.K. van de Rijke F.M. Dirks R.W. Sol C.J. Boom R. van der Ploeg M. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Confluent human osteoblasts grown in two-well tissue culture slide chambers were incubated in serum-free medium for 18 h followed by treatment with vehicle or forskolin in serum-free medium for 6 h. Cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and dehydrated by incubating successively in 70, 90, and 100% ethanol. After removal of lipids by incubation in xylenes for 10 min, cultures were rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol followed by PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) pepsin in 0.1 m NaCl at 37 °C for 20 min, rinsed in PBS, postfixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, and washed again in PBS. The probe was diluted to 5 ng/µl in hybridization buffer containing 60% deionized formamide, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 5% dextran sulfate, and 250 µg/ml sheared herring sperm DNA (denatured shortly before use). Probe solution (15 µl) was added to the fixed permeabilized cells, covered with a 22-cm2 coverslip, and incubated at 55 °C for 16 h. Following hybridization, coverslips were removed in 2× SSC buffer (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate), and three high stringency washes were performed in 50% formamide in 2× SSC buffer at 55 °C for 30, 20, and 10 min followed by a wash in PBS. The slides were incubated for 45 min at 25 °C in blocking buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% (w/v) blocking reagent) and for 45 min in 1:5 dilution of anti-DIG-fluorescein antibody in blocking buffer. The slides were washed in PBS, dehydrated as before, dried, mounted in VECTASHIELD medium containing 3.8 µg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear stain, and viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE 300). Images were captured with a Photometrics CoolSNAP fx camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) and Apple Macintosh G4 computer using IPLab software, version 3.5 (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA). Image processing was performed using Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Confluent human osteoblast cultures were preincubated in serum-free medium for 20 h, followed by the addition of drugs or vehicle (ethanol or Me2SO or both diluted 1:1000) in serum-free medium for 2–6 h. H-89 was added to cells 15 min prior to the addition of forskolin or PGE2. After drug treatment, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with a 1:1 mixture of acetone and methanol, and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated with primary antibodies, either polyclonal chicken anti-C/EBPδ (1:500 dilution) or polyclonal rabbit anti-PKAαC (1:100) in PBS plus 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 25 °C. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated with 100 ng/ml Hoechst dye and the appropriate labeled secondary antibodies, either Cy3-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgY (1:400) or Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000), for 2 h in the dark. Finally, cells were washed in PBS and were examined and imaged as described for in situ hybridization. Primary human osteoblasts were seeded in six-well plates at 96,000 cells/well and transfected the next day with 2 µg of firefly luciferase reporter genes or 1 µg each of reporter gene and expression plasmid (pcDNA3, pcDNA3-C/EBPδ, dominant negative PKA, EGFP, EGFP-PKIwt, or EGFP-PKInls). Transfections with promoter-reporter genes also included 1 ng of a vector containing the Renilla luciferase gene under control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer/promoter (pRL-CMV,Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. At 24–48 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, incubated in serum-free medium for 18 h, and treated with vehicle or drugs in serum-free medium for an additional 6 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega). Cultures were washed in PBS, scraped into 200 µl/well of passive lysis buffer and cleared by brief centrifugation. The entire supernatant was then assayed using an AutoLumat LB 953 luminometer (Berthold Systems, Inc., Aliquippa, PA). Light emission was measured by integration over 10 s of the enzymatic reactions. Firefly luciferase values were divided byRenilla luciferase to yield the relative enzymatic activity for each experimental point. All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times except for dominant negative PKA transfections, which were performed twice. Confluent osteoblast cultures were deprived of serum for 20 h and then treated with PGE2 for 4 h. Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described (18Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and aliquots were stored at −80 °C until use. Western immunoblotting was performed as described previously (18Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies included polyclonal chicken anti-C/EBPδ (1:500), polyclonal rabbit anti-PKAαC (1:1000), or polyclonal rabbit anti-Akt (1:1000), and the secondary antibodies were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgY or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (both at 1:3000). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemifluorescence followed by detection using the Molecular Imager FX imaging system and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Human and rat His-tagged C/EBPδ were purified from bacteria as follows. Plasmids pET29a-His-human C/EBPδ and pET29a-His-rat C/EBPδ were transformed into the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli. Cultures were grown to an A 600 of 0.7 in 1 liter of Circlegrow (Bio 101, Vista, CA) containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin and then were induced to express recombinant proteins by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma; final concentration of 1 mm) and incubation for 4 h. Bacterial pellets were harvested by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 30 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm imidazole). Cells were lysed by passaging twice through a French Pressure Cell Press (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) at 16,000 p.s.i., and bacterial debris was removed by centrifugation. The His-tagged proteins were purified by FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Qiagen) in binding buffer, washed with 30 column volumes of binding buffer, and eluted with a continuous imidazole gradient from 50 to 500 mm into 20 fractions. The protein-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 5 liters of dialysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol), and passed through the HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in dialysis buffer. After the column was washed with 5 volumes of dialysis buffer, proteins were eluted in a continuous salt gradient up to 1 m NaCl. Ten fractions were collected, analyzed for purity, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. Proteins were diluted to reduce the salt concentration to 200 mm prior to use. Purified, recombinant catalytic subunit of PKA was diluted to 10 µg/ml in 100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin. Recombinant CREBad, His-human C/EBPδ, or His-rat C/EBPδ proteins (500 ng each) were mixed on ice with 0.5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP in assay buffer (100 µm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 250 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5). The recombinant catalytic subunit of PKA (10 ng) was added, and reactions were allowed to proceed for 2 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped after being placed on ice by the addition of EDTA to 80 mm final concentration. After boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, the samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes), dried, and exposed to Phospho Screens (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 30 min followed by detection using Molecular Imager FX imaging system and Quantity One software. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student'st test for paired samples. Results were considered statistically different when p < 0.05. In previous studies, we and others have shown that IGF-I gene expression was regulated in primary cultures of rat osteoblasts by hormones such as PTH and PGE2 that enhanced production of cAMP (10McCarthy T.M.

https://openalex.org/W2155830798,"Eight proteins encoded by bacteriophage T4 are required for the replicative synthesis of the leading and lagging strands of T4 DNA. We show here that active T4 replication forks, which catalyze the coordinated synthesis of leading and lagging strands, remain stable in the face of dilution provided that the gp44/62 clamp loader, the gp45 sliding clamp, and the gp32 ssDNA-binding protein are present at sufficient levels after dilution. If any of these accessory proteins is omitted from the dilution mixture, uncoordinated DNA synthesis occurs, and/or large Okazaki fragments are formed. Thus, the accessory proteins must be recruited from solution for each round of initiation of lagging-strand synthesis. A modified bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase) can replace the T4 DNA polymerase for leading-strand synthesis but not for well coordinated lagging-strand synthesis. Although T4 DNA polymerase has been reported to self-associate, gel-exclusion chromatography displays it as a monomer in solution in the absence of DNA. It forms no stable holoenzyme complex in solution with the accessory proteins or with the gp41-gp61 helicase-primase. Instead, template DNA is required for the assembly of the T4 replication complex, which then catalyzes coordinated synthesis of leading and lagging strands in a conditionally coupled manner."
https://openalex.org/W2164542433,"Psoralen photoreacts with DNA to form interstrand cross-links, which can be repaired by both nonmutagenic nucleotide excision repair and recombinational repair pathways and by mutagenic pathways. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, psoralen cross-links are processed by nucleotide excision repair to form double-strand breaks (DSBs). In yeast, DSBs are repaired primarily by homologous recombination, predicting that cross-link and DSB repair should induce similar recombination end points. We compared psoralen cross-link, psoralen monoadduct, and DSB repair using plasmid substrates with site-specific lesions and measured the patterns of gene conversion, crossing over, and targeted mutation. Psoralen cross-links induced both recombination and mutations, whereas DSBs induced only recombination, and monoadducts were neither recombinogenic nor mutagenic. Although the cross-link- and DSB-induced patterns of plasmid integration and gene conversion were similar in most respects, they showed opposite asymmetries in their unidirectional conversion tracts: primarily upstream from the damage site for cross-links but downstream for DSBs. Cross-links induced targeted mutations in 5% of the repaired plasmids; all were base substitutions, primarily T --> C transitions. The major pathway of psoralen cross-link repair in yeast is error-free and involves the formation of DSB intermediates followed by homologous recombination. A fraction of the cross-links enter an error-prone pathway, resulting in mutations at the damage site."

Here we show that EPA stimulates the intracellular insulin signaling pathway in hepatoma cells.

The PCR amplifications were performed in 50 µl of medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 9.0, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 15 pmol of sense and antisense primers, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The reaction mixtures were subjected to 40 cycles of PCR amplification of PEPCK cDNA consisting of denaturation for 60 s at 94 °C, annealing for 60 s at 56 °C, and elongation for 120 s at 72 °C. The oligonucleotide primers (5′-AGCCTCGACAGCCTGCCCCAGG-3′ sense and 5′-CCAGTTGTTGACCAAAGGCTTTT-3′ antisense) allowed amplification of a 575-bp PEPCK cDNA product (17Rajas F. Croset M. Zitoun C. Montano S. Mithieux G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1165-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and verified with DNA sequencing (model 310, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The β-actin sequence of the upstream primer was 5′-TGACCCAGATCATGTTTGAGAGACC-3′, and the sequence of the downstream primer was 5′-CCATACCCAAGAAGGAAGGC-3′. After an initial denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, PCR was performed for 40 cycles. The conditions for PCR were 94 °C for 60 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The rat β-actin-coding region was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR and verified with DNA sequencing. Total RNA was prepared from cultured H4-II-E cells using Trizol. Twenty µg of total RNA was heat-denatured for 10 min at 70 °C in buffer containing 50% formamide, 2.4m formaldehide, 1 × 0.02 m MOPS, 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm Na2 EDTA, and then loaded onto a 1.2% agarose/formaldehide gel made up in 1× MOPS, pH 7.4, at 50 V for 3–4 h. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred onto a Hybond N membrane by capillary action and fixed onto the filters by ultraviolet light cross-linking. The blot was probed with either a rat PEPCK or rat β-actin probe labeled by the Gene Images random prime labeling module and detected by the Gene Images CDP-star detection module according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 30–60 min. Approximately 48–72 h before the assay, cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 1–3 × 105 cells/well. When cells reached 60–70% confluence, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA, and then EPA, docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, oleic acid, or palmitic acid was added at the indicated concentration. The cultures were incubated in a CO2incubator for 72 h at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stripped with 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA. The cell number was then determined using a cell counter. All samples were assayed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Representative data are presented. Cell proliferation assays were also performed by CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit according to the supplier (Life Technologies). Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well plates and treated as described under cell proliferation assay. The cultures were incubated in a CO2 incubator for 72 h at 37 °C and then added to 20 µl/well of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent, which contains a tetrazolium compound, MTS was added to the culture medium. The MTS tetrazolium compound is bioreduced by cells into a colored formazan product that is soluble in tissue culture medium. This conversion is presumably accomplished by NADPH or NADH produced by dehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cells (18Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). After incubating the plate 2–4 h in a CO2 incubator, the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded with a 96-well plate reader. All samples were assayed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Cells were treated as described under “Cell Proliferation Assays.” Live and dead cells from each subculture were counted by trypan blue at sequential time points during incubation, and the ratio of dead/(dead + live) cells was calculated. The mean values of these ratios and the S.E. were calculated at each time point. The data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. unless noted otherwise. Statistics were analyzed by one-way repeated measures analysis of variance with a significant level of 0.05. The effect of EPA on the tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular proteins was studied in HepG2 cells by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)). Treatment for 24 h with 100 µm EPA caused a significant increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 levels in HepG2 cells compared with those with vehicle treatment (455 ± 44 versus 105 ± 6% basal level, p < 0.01, n = 5) (Fig. 1 A). When HepG2 cells were incubated with 1–1000 µm EPA for 24 h, EPA caused a significant and dose-dependent increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 levels in the cells as shown in Fig.1 B. HepG2 cells were treated with 100 µm EPA for 24 h, followed by stimulation with 100 nm insulin for 1 min. EPA and insulin significantly increased tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 levels up to 362 ± 34 and 616 ± 35 densitometric units (DU), respectively, compared with vehicle alone (73 ± 6 DU). Combined stimulation with EPA and insulin resulted in a further increase of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 levels up to 714 ± 34 DU (p < 0.01, n = 5) (Fig. 1 C). The effect of EPA on IRS-1 phosphorylation is not mediated via insulin receptor (IR), because tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β chain was not different between the presence and absence of EPA (Fig. 1 D). EPA also increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in H4-II-E cells (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, we tested the effect of other n-3 PUFAs, docosahexaenoic acid,n-6 PUFAs, arachidonic acid, monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, saturated fatty acid, and palmitic acid on the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Other fatty acids, except EPA, did not increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig.2 B). In addition, acute incubation of HepG2 cells with 100 µm EPA for 0–30 min did not increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 levels (data not shown). We investigated the effect of EPA on tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in other cell lines, rat skeletal muscle cells, and L6 myocytes. EPA did not increase tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in L6 cells (data not shown).Figure 2EPA up-regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in H4-II-E cells and down-regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC in HepG2 cells. A, serum-starved H4-II-E cells were treated with 100 µm EPA for 24 h followed by 100 nm insulin for 1 min.

Control cells (lane 1) gave 88 ± 13 DU. EPA-treated cells (lane 2) gave 329 ± 36 DU. Cells treated with docosahexaenoic acid (lane 3) gave 76 ± 9 DU.

HepG2 cells were treated with 100 µm EPA for 24 h, followed by stimulation with 100 nm insulin for 1 min. EPA did not increase tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 (Fig. 2 C). SHC proteins are expressed as multiple isoforms (46, 52, and 66 kDa). Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC isoforms in vehicle-treated cells (46 kDa SHC, 584 ± 71 DU; 52 kDa SHC, 716 ± 46 DU; and 66 kDa SHC, 551 ± 76 DU) was increased by insulin (46 kDa SHC, 1413 ± 142 DU; 52 kDa SHC, 946 ± 39 DU; 66 kDa SHC, 885 ± 75 DU; p < 0.01) and conversely decreased by EPA (46 kDa SHC, 88 ± 12 DU; 52 kDa SHC, 109 ± 10 DU; 66 kDa SHC, 242 ± 17 DU; p < 0.01) as well as by combined treatment with EPA and insulin (46 kDa SHC, 164 ± 18 DU; 52 kDa SHC, 201 ± 25 DU; 66 kDa SHC, 316 ± 31 DU;p < 0.01 versus vehicle; p< 0.01 versus insulin-treated cells, n = 5) (Fig. 2 D). Downstream signaling of IRS-1 is mediated by several associated proteins, including GRB2 and PI3K (19Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocrinol. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of EPA on the interaction of GRB2 or PI3K with IRS-1. When HepG2 cells were pretreated with 100 µm EPA for 24 h, followed by stimulation with 100 nm insulin for 3 min, the amount of GRB2 associated IRS-1 (basal, 118 ± 16 DU) was increased either by EPA (214 ± 26 DU, p < 0.05) or by insulin (298 ± 37 DU, p < 0.01, n = 5) as well as by combined treatment with EPA and insulin (307 ± 30 DU, p < 0.01, n = 5) (Fig.3 A). No additive increase of GRB2 associated with IRS-1 was noticed when the cells were treated with both EPA and insulin (Fig. 3 A). Similarly treated cells were analyzed for the association of PI3K with IRS-1. The amount of PI3K associated IRS-1 in vehicle-treated cells (78 ± 11 DU) was increased either by EPA (376 ± 29 DU, p < 0.01,n = 5) or by insulin (530 ± 45 DU,p < 0.01, n = 5) as well as by combined treatment with EPA and insulin (662 ± 47 DU,p < 0.01 versus basal; p < 0.01 versus insulin-treated cells, n = 5) (Fig. 3 B). An additive increase of PI3K associated with IRS-1 was noticed by combined treatment with EPA and insulin (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, since MAPKs and Akt are downstream substrates for GRB2 and PI3K, respectively, we tested whether MAPKs and Akt are involved in cellular responses to EPA. Phosphorylated active MAPK was collected from cell lysates using anti-phospho-MAPK antibody, and its activity was determined by the amount of phosphorylated Elk1 fusion protein. HepG2 cells were pretreated with 100 µm EPA for 24 h, followed by stimulation with 100 nm insulin for 3 min, and analyzed for the MAPK activity. MAPK activity in vehicle treated cells (917 ± 64 DU) was increased by insulin (1652 ± 156 DU, p < 0.01) and conversely decreased by EPA (291 ± 23 DU, p < 0.01) as well as by combined treatment with EPA and insulin (710 ± 61 DU, p < 0.01 versus vehicle; p < 0.01versus insulin-treated cells, n = 5) (Fig.4 A). These findings were incompatible with GRB2-associated IRS-1 but compatible with tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC. We also measured the Akt kinase activity determined by the amount of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 fusion protein. Similarly treated cells were analyzed for the Akt kinase activity. Akt kinase activity in vehicle-treated cells (162 ± 10 DU) was increased either by EPA (251 ± 11 DU,p < 0.01) or by insulin (290 ± 25 DU,p < 0.01) as well as by combined treatment with EPA and insulin (476 ± 58 DU, p < 0.01versus basal; p < 0.01 versusinsulin-treated cells, n = 5) (Fig. 4 B). These findings were correlated with PI3K-associated IRS-1. Next, we examined the mechanism by which EPA stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. EPA is a natural ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and activates all three PPARs (PPAR-α, PPAR-δ, and PPAR-γ) with the highest affinity to PPAR-α. We tested the effect of other PPAR ligands on the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in HepG2 cells. The effective dose of PPAR-α-specific ligand (clofibrate), PPAR-δ ligand (cPGI2), or PPAR-γ-specific ligand (troglitazone) was chosen based on recent studies (20Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar, 21He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

A. 1996; 93: 5793-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). None of these ligands affected the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 (Fig.5 A). It has been reported that high intracellular glucosamine concentrations increase leptin production in adipose tissue (9Wang J. Liu R. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Rossetti L.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). We also reported that EPA up-regulates leptin mRNA expression and its secretion through hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (8Murata M. Kaji H. Takahashi Y. Iida K. Mizuno I. Okimura Y. Abe H. Chihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Increased inflow of free fatty acid to HepG2 cells produces increased amounts of fatty acyl-CoA, causing the inhibition of glycolysis, and subsequently increases fluctose 6-phosphate, which increases the substrate for glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, which plays a critical role as the rate-limiting enzyme in glucosamine biosynthesis. Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase enhances the production of glucosamine 6-phosphate and its metabolites formed by subsequent acetylation and uridylation of glucosamine 6-phosphate (9Wang J. Liu R. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Rossetti L.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar,11Hawking M. Barzilai N. Liu R. Hu M. Chen W. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2173-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 12Hawkins M. Angelov I. Liu R. Barzilai N. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4889-4895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). EPA would increase intracellular glucosamine 6-phosphate through this mechanism. DON, a well established inhibitor of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (23Marshall S. Bascote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, did not affect EPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig.5 B). To assess whether the step of protein synthesis is involved in stimulation by EPA of the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, HepG2 cells were treated with 100 µm EPA in the absence or presence of 20 µg/ml cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor, for 24 h, and IRS-1 was analyzed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphotyrosine. CHX blunted EPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig. 5 C), although the amount of IRS-1 was decreased by CHX treatment. We also investigated whether EPA affects glucose homeostasis in cell culture. Hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis is a major factor in maintaining glucose homeostasis. The rate-limiting enzyme of gluconeogenesis is PEPCK. This enzyme has no known allosteric control and is down-regulated by insulin at the transcriptional level. The rat hepatoma cell line H4-II-E cells have been used successfully to study the regulation of PEPCK expression, whereas HepG2 cells do not express PEPCK efficiently (24Granner D. Andreone T. Sasaki K. Beale E. Nature. 1983; 305: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 25Xing L. Quinn P.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1484-1494PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cohen B. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Science. 1996; 274: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The amount of PEPCK mRNA in H4-II-E cells was reduced by EPA treatment and, in contrast, increased by arachidonic acid treatment as compared with control cells (Fig.6). This observation is compatible with the result that EPA stimulated the IRS-1-PI3K pathway. Next we tested the effects of EPA on cell proliferation, considering the difference between EPA and insulin with regard to the regulation of MAPK activity in HepG2 cells. We found that EPA inhibited proliferation of HepG2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.7, A and B). The number of HepG2 cells was decreased by ∼30% following a 72-h incubation with 100 µm EPA (Fig. 7 A). The phenotypic features were not changed. To exclude the possibility that EPA acted as a death factor and accelerated cell death of HepG2 cells, we counted the numbers of live and dead cells. The ratio of dead cells to the total cell number of EPA-treated cells was not significantly different from that in vehicle-treated cells (Table I). Furthermore, to investigate whether the decrease in the cell number was linked to apoptosis, we tested the DNA fragmentation showing the typical oligosomal “ladder” configuration by ApoLadder EX (Takara Biomedicals). There were no ladder formation in the cells (data not shown). EPA-inhibited cell proliferation was dose-dependent (Fig.7 B), and the result of the cell proliferation assay using MTS solution (Fig. 7 C) was correlated well with that of the decrease in cell number induced by EPA. This observation is compatible with the finding that EPA inhibited MAPK activity in HepG2 cells. We also tested the effect of other fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid on proliferation of HepG2 cells. Other fatty acids, except EPA, did not inhibit cell proliferation (Fig. 7 D). Furthermore, we tested the effects of EPA on cell proliferation in other cell lines, rat L6 myocytes, mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and the human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, MKN 45. EPA did not inhibit cell proliferation of these cells (Fig. 7 E). We demonstrated for the first time that EPA treatment for 24 h caused stimulation of both the basal and insulin-induced IRS-1-PI3K pathway in HepG2 cells as well as reduction of the amount of PEPCK mRNA expression in H4-II-E cells. Furthermore, it is of great interest that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is specific for EPA, since other fatty acids cannot induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. These findings are consistent with recent reports that EPA improves insulin sensitivity (1Storlien L.H. Kraegen E.W. Chisholm D.J. Ford G.L. Bruce D.G. Pascoe W.S. Science. 1987; 237: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 2Popp-Snijders C. Schouten J.A. Heine R.J. van-der-Meer J. van-der-Veen E.A.

Metabolism. 1997; 46: 1458-1464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is our surprise that EPA inhibited MAPK activity as well as proliferation of HepG2 cells. We focused on clarifying the mechanism by which EPA stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. First, we examined the possibility of an involvement of PPARs. PPARs are nuclear receptors for fatty acids that regulate glucose and lipid homeostasis. The hypolipidemic actions of the fibrates appear to be primarily mediated through PPAR-α, whereas the glucose-lowering effects of the thiazolidinediones are mediated through PPAR-γ (27Willson T.M. Wahli M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). EPA binds efficiently all three PPARs and activates these receptors in cell-based assays (20Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar, 22Kallen C.B. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5793-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, neither PPAR ligands mimicked the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by EPA, indicating that PPARs probably are not involved in this mechanism, although the involvement of PPAR-δ is not completely ruled out. Human PPAR-δ-specific ligands have not been identified so far, and cPGI2, a ligand of PPAR-δ and PPAR-α, failed to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Moreover, neither the function nor the array of genes regulated by PPAR-δ is completely known. Therefore, the role of PPAR-δ on the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is not conclusive in our study. EPA has lipid-lowering effects and enhances insulin sensitivity in human and rodents, which is possibly mediated through PPAR-α and PPAR-γ, since these effects are similar to those of fibrates and thiazolidinediones. We speculate that EPA can improve insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia possibly through its stimulation of the insulin-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 as well as PPAR activation in accordance with dietary EPA intake. The second possibility is the involvement of hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which mediates EPA-induced leptin expression as shown in our previous report (8Murata M. Kaji H. Takahashi Y. Iida K. Mizuno I. Okimura Y. Abe H. Chihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, however, DON failed to affect EPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, suggesting that the involvement of hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in this mechanism is unlikely. Therefore, the precise mechanism of tyrosine-phosphorylation of IRS-1 by EPA remains unknown. The only positive result in this study is that CHX blunted EPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. We speculate that EPA could increase tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 through endogenous protein synthesis or that the quantity of unknown EPA-stimulated kinase could be decreased, although the nature of this molecule remains to be elucidated. IRS-1 is characterized to possess the 20–22 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites that are conserved between IRS-1 homologs. The surrounding amino acid residues are also highly conserved, and several of these represent potential binding sites for proteins that contain Src homology 2 domains (28Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn CR. Backer JM Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 29Araki E. Sun X.J. Haag B.L. Zhang Y. Chuang L.M. Zhang Y. Yang-Feng T. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1041-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). IRS-1 interacts with many Src homology 2 proteins with diverse phosphotyrosine motif requirements including PI3K and GRB2 (19Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocrinol. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn CR. Backer JM Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). PI3K and GRB2 bind to different phosphotyrosine residues with IRS-1 (30Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Skoinik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzer A. Vicentini L.M. Zhou M. Daly R. Myers Jr., M.J. Backer J.M. Ullrich A. White Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In the present study, EPA stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, binding of PI3K to IRS-1, and Akt kinase activity and down-regulated the amount of PEPCK mRNA expression. These results are compatible with the actions of insulin-mimetics. Unlike insulin action, however, EPA inhibited both MAPK activity and proliferation of HepG2 cells irrespective of the presence of insulin, although it increased the association of GRB2 with IRS-1. The dissociation of the downstream molecules in the IRS-1-GRB2-MAPK pathway remains difficult to explain, but it may suggest the presence of a potent inhibiting mechanism by EPA of MAPK activity even under full activation by IRS-1-GRB2 association. It is possible that this is in part mediated by the inhibition by EPA of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC, since phosphorylated SHC forms a complex with GRB2 and association of the SHC-GRB2 complex with the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Ras-GEF) mediates the localization of Ras-GEF to the plasma membrane (32Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Once at the plasma membrane, Ras-GEF activates Ras by catalyzing the Ras-GTP for Ras-GDP exchange. This pathway may be inhibited through down-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC by EPA. However, the mechanism by which EPA inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC remains unknown. It is therefore likely that EPA affects tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC, MAPK activity, and cell proliferation by an as yet unknown pathway. Most important, the inhibition of cell proliferation by EPA is compatible with the result that EPA inhibited MAPK activity in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, other fatty acids, except EPA, did not inhibit proliferation of HepG2 cells, and EPA did not inhibit cell proliferation in other cell lines, L6 myocytes, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and MKN 45 cells. On the basis of these results, we propose that EPA may suppress cell proliferation, at least in HepG2 cells, by inhibiting the MAPK pathway. Finally, the evidence that EPA caused not only up-regulation of IRS-1-PI3K pathway as well as down-regulation of gluconeogenesis but also inhibition of both the MAPK pathway and cell proliferation warrants further study to identify unknown mediators involved in EPA action cross-talking with the insulin signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2171364521,"The role of cytochromeb 559 in photosynthetic oxygen evolution has been investigated in three chloroplast mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in which one of the two histidine axial ligands to the heme, provided by the α subunit, has been replaced by the residues methionine, tyrosine, and glutamine. Photosystem two complexes functional for oxygen evolution could be assembled in the methionine and tyrosine mutants up to ∼15% of wild type levels, whereas no complexes with oxygen evolution activity could be detected in the glutamine mutant. PSII supercomplexes isolated from the tyrosine and methionine mutants were as active as wild type in terms of light-saturated rates of oxygen evolution but in contrast to wild type contained no bound heme despite the presence of the α subunit. Oxygen evolution in the tyrosine and methionine mutants was, however, more sensitive to photoinactivation than the WT. Overall, these data establish unambiguously that a redox role for the heme of cytochromeb 559 is not required for photosynthetic oxygen evolution. Instead, our data provide new evidence of a role for cytochrome b 559 in the protection of the photosystem two complex in vivo.

Babcock G. Ort D. Yocum C. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 213-247Google Scholar, 2Hankamer B. Barber J. Boekema E.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 641-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The study of this complex is important not only because of the unique chemistry involved in the photosynthetic oxidation of water to dioxygen but also because PSII has been identified as a weak link in the photosynthetic electron transport chain (3Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 4Aro E.M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). PSII, and in particular the D1 subunit, is prone to irreversible light-induced damage, sometimes termed photoinhibition, which, unless repaired, causes a reduction in net rates of photosynthesis (5Melis A. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b 559 (Cytb 559) is a ubiquitous component of PSII and is found in the most minimal PSII complex capable of light-induced charge separation, the so-called D1/D2 complex described by Nanba and Satoh (6Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is composed of two small hydrophobic polypeptides, termed α (PsbE) and β (PsbF), each of which spans the membrane once. Unlike other cytochromes, Cyt b 559 possesses a marked heterogeneity in the midpoint redox potential of its heme cofactor, with high, low, and intermediate potential forms described (7Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Recent structural data obtained from cyanobacterial PSII have confirmed an αβ heterodimeric structure (8Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar) with the heme molecule ligated by single His residues in each of the subunits, as predicted earlier from EPR spectroscopy (9Babcock G.T. Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Oertling W.A. Metz J.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3638-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Whether one or two Cytb 559 are present per PSII in vivo is under debate, although a variety of recent evidence suggests just one (7Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Despite recent advances in understanding the structure and biochemistry of PSII, the role of Cyt b 559 remains unclear. Suggested functions within PSII include a redox role in photosynthetic water oxidation (10Fiege R. Shuvalov V.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), an involvement in the early steps of assembly of PSII (11Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol.

Enzymatic activities such as a plastoquinol oxidase (18Kruk J. Strzalka K. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 62: 273-279Crossref Google Scholar) and a superoxide dismutase (19Ananyev G. Renger G. Wacker U. Klimov V. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 41: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have also been proposed. The analysis of Cyt b 559 with regard to PSII function, particularly in vivo, has been hindered, however, by the lack of appropriate Cyt b 559 mutants that still accumulate PSII. For example, previous attempts to manipulate the heme-binding pocket of the cytochrome through mutation of one or both of the His axial ligands to Leu in the cyanobacterium,Synechocystis 6803, led to the loss of PSII from the membrane (20Pakrasi H.B. De Ciechi P. Whitmarsh J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we describe the characterization of Cytb 559 mutants created in the green algaChlamydomonas reinhardtii, a widely used eukaryotic model to study photosynthesis (21Hippler M. Redding K. Rochaix J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have focused our studies on one of the two His ligands to the heme, residue His23 of the α subunit, encoded by the psbE gene. Based on the assumption that the binding of heme to Cyt b 559is important for assembly of PSII (20Pakrasi H.B. De Ciechi P. Whitmarsh J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we included in our choice of mutants residues that could still coordinate the heme (such as Met and Tyr) but may perturb its redox properties and possibly affect PSII function. To aid our characterization of these mutants, we have developed a procedure for the isolation of oxygen-evolving PSII·LHCII supercomplexes from wild type (WT) C. reinhardtii. This type of complex, recently isolated from a PSI-deficient strain of C. reinhardtii and characterized by electron microscopy (22Nield J. Kruse O. Ruprecht J. da Fonseca P. Buchel C. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27940-27946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), consists of a dimer of PSII core complexes, surrounded by chlorophyll-binding subunits, that retains the extrinsic subunits associated with the water-oxidizing complex (PsbO, PsbP, and PsbQ) and is highly active in oxygen evolution (23Eshaghi S. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate unambiguously that Cyt b 559 heme is not required for photosynthetic oxygen evolution and that mutation of the α subunit His ligand leads to enhanced sensitivity of PSII activity to light stress. C. reinhardtiistrain CC-125 was used as the wild type strain and was obtained from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center (Department of Botany, Duke University, Durham, NC). Cells were grown in Tris-acetate phosphate (TAP) medium or high salt minimal medium as described in Ref. 11Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. Strains obtained after chloroplast transformation were kept on TAP medium supplemented with 100 µg·ml−1spectinomycin, 50 µg·ml−1 ampicillin, and 10 µm 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl (TAPAS D plates). 3-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl was included to prevent a selectional pressure for photoautotrophy. Plasmid pF3 contains the psbE gene with upstream and downstream flanking sequences of 1.75 and 1.97 kb, respectively (11Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To select for transformed C. reinhardtii cells, theaadA-selectable marker (obtained as a 1.9-kbEcoRV/SmaI fragment from plasmid pUC-atpX-AAD) (24Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), which confers resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin, was inserted into an EcoRV restriction site of plasmid pF3, located 323 base pairs upstream of the psbE translation initiation codon. Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis of thepsbE gene was performed using a modification of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-“megaprimer” approach (25Kammann M. Laufs J. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Synthetic mutagenic oligonucleotides (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 5′-ACCGTAATACTCATAATAACCCAG-3′, 5′-ACCGTAATACTTTGAATAACCCAG-3′, and 5′-ACCGTAATACTATAAATAACCCAG-3′ were used to create mutants H23M, H23Q, and H23Y, respectively. These primers were designed to delete a restriction site for the enzyme AlwNI and to create a novel KpnI site (underlined), along with the His23 mutation (Fig. 1A). The PCRs were performed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermocycler using essentially the method described in Ref. 27Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 3-12Google Scholar except that Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used. The final PCR fragment of about 1.3 kb was digested with SacI and AccI and ligated toSacI/AccI-restricted pF3aad to give the transforming plasmids. The sequence of the cloned insert was determined using an ABI/PerkinElmer 377 automated sequencer to confirm the absence of unwanted mutations. Plasmid DNA precipitated onto gold particles (1.0-µm diameter) was introduced into the chloroplast genome of C. reinhardtii CC-125 using a biolistic method, employing a Bio-Rad Biolistic PDS-1000/He system (28Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 510-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on spectinomycin (TAPAS D plates), and homoplasmicity was confirmed by Southern blotting and PCR analysis. The isolation of total C. reinhardtii DNA and DNA gel blot analyses were performed according to Ref. 29Andronis C. Kruse O. Deak Z. Vass I. Diner B.A. Nixon P.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. The psbE-specific DNA probe is described in Ref. 11Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. To confirm the homoplasmicity of thepsbE mutants, a PCR analysis was performed using primers SA1 and SA5 as described in Ref. 11Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. For WT, a 0.75-kb fragment was amplified, whereas in strains PF3aad#1, H23M, H23Q, and H23Y, a 2.6-kb fragment was generated because of the presence of the 1.9-kb spectinomycin resistance cassette (Fig. 1 A). No 0.75-kb band was detected in these strains, consistent with the absence of WT copies of the psbE gene. To verify that the desired point mutations were present in the chloroplast genome of the various C. reinhardtii mutants, the purified DNA fragments obtained by PCR were directly sequenced. To test for photoautotrophy, small samples of cells were plated on high salt minimal medium plates and incubated for ∼2–3 weeks under fluorescent light of intensity 2 µE·m−2·s−1 or 20 µE·m−2·s−1. Light-induced O2 evolution activity in whole cells was measured with a Clark-type electrode. The measurements were performed in TAP medium at 25 °C, under saturating light conditions, in the presence of 1 mm potassium ferricyanide and 1 mm2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone. Fluorescence induction kinetics of dark-adapted cells were performed using a pulse-amplitude-modulation fluorometer (PAM 101, Walz) using a white actinic light of intensity 1000 µE·m−2·s−1. Cells, grown in TAP medium, were harvested by gentle filtration through glass microfiber filters (Whatman, GF/C, 25-mm diameter) to yield a chlorophyll content of 50 µg/filter. 400 µl of fresh TAP medium were added onto the layer of the filtered cells, and samples were dark-adapted for 3 min prior to the fluorescence measurement. 5 liters of cell culture grown in TAP medium were harvested during the late exponential phase of growth at an OD750 of 0.65–0.8. Thylakoid membranes were prepared according to Ref. 30Diner B.A. Wollman F.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar with some modifications (11Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thylakoids were finally resuspended in buffer MMNB2 (25 mm Mes/KOH, pH 5.7, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 2m betaine) to a concentration of about 1–2 mg·ml−1, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. PSII·LHCII supercomplexes from C. reinhardtii strains PF3aad#1, H23Y, and H23M were prepared employing a method developed originally for spinach (23Eshaghi S. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Discontinuous gradients of 34-ml volume from 5.5–20% (w/v) sucrose were poured in 2-ml steps of 0.9% (w/v) sucrose increments. The gradients were prepared on ice from freshly made stock solutions of 5 and 20% (w/v) sucrose in buffer MMNB1 (25 mm Mes/KOH, pH 5.7, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1 m betaine) containing 0.03% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside (DM). C. reinhardtii thylakoid membranes were brought to a final volume of 1.5 ml containing 0.5 mg·ml−1 chlorophyll and 25 mm DM in buffer MMNB2 and quickly solubilized by pipetting five times with a micropipette. Solubilization of thylakoids from mutant strains was carried out at 35 mm DM (H23M) and 30 mm DM (H23Y). Freshly prepared sucrose gradients were overlaid with the solubilized thylakoids; a volume of 0.7 ml containing a total amount of 0.35 mg of chlorophyll was loaded per gradient. The gradients were centrifuged at 131,000 × g for 13–15 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW-28 swing-out rotor. Brakes were switched off at 24 ×g during deceleration at the end of the centrifuge run. The gradients showed three major chlorophyll-containing bands, the lower of which corresponded to the PSII·LHCII supercomplex fraction. The middle and upper bands contained the fractions of PSI and LHCII, respectively. The fractions were concentrated by centrifugation in Centricon YM-100 centrifugal filter devices (Amicon) at 1500 ×g. Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Chlorophyll was quantified according to Ref. 31Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Shimadzu MPS-2000 spectrophotometer. The protein composition of thylakoids and thylakoid membrane fractions was analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gels, containing 0.7 m urea, using the Tricine-SDS-PAGE system described in Ref. 33Miyazaki A. Shina T. Toyoshima Y. Gounaris K. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 142-147Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar. Prestained Low Molecular Weight Standards (Bio-Rad) were run alongside samples. Protein bands were visualized by staining gels with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Immunoblotting was performed as described in Ref. 11Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar using enhanced chemiluminescence. Redox difference spectra were recorded as dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized spectra within the 520–600-nm region of the spectrum. PSII·LHCII supercomplex samples at 20 µg of Chl/ml in buffer MMNB1 containing 0.03% (w/v) DM were oxidized by adding 1 mm K3Fe(CN)6, and the spectrum was recorded and stored as the base line. A few grains of Na2S2O3 were then added, and the reduced spectrum was recorded. To ensure complete reduction of Cyt b 559, more Na2S2O3 was added, and another spectrum was recorded. A redox difference extinction coefficient of 23.4 mm−1·cm−1 at 559 nm was used to determine the heme concentration (33Miyazaki A. Shina T. Toyoshima Y. Gounaris K. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 142-147Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Heme was assayed as the reduced pyridine hemochrome using the method described for samples with low heme concentrations by Berry and Trumpower (34Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). 0.5 ml of assay solution (200 mm NaOH, 40% (v/v) pyridine), 3 µl of 0.1 mK3Fe(CN)6, and 0.5 ml of PSII·LHCII supercomplex sample containing 20 µg of Chl in buffer MMNB1, 0.03% (w/v) DM were thoroughly mixed in a 1-ml cuvette. The oxidized spectrum was recorded and stored as the base line. A few grains of Na2S2O3 were then added, and the spectrum of the reduced pyridine hemochrome was recorded immediately before effects of dithionite on the base line accumulated. Several successive spectra were measured to ensure that the conversion to the pyridine hemochrome had been complete. The dual wavelength difference coefficient ε556–540 = 23.98 mm−1·cm−1 given in Ref. 34Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar was used to determine the heme concentration. Cryogenic EPR spectra were collected on a Varian E-line EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 liquid helium cryostat. Spectrometer conditions were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.28 GHz; microwave power, 0.03 milliwatts (Chl Z+/Car+), 2 milliwatts (Cyt b 559, Q A−), or 5 milliwatts (S2 multiline); magnetic field modulation amplitude, 4 G (Chl Z+/Car+) or 20 G (Cytb 559, Q A−, S2 multiline); temperature, 30.0 K (Chl Z+/Car+), 10.0 K (Cytb 559, Q A−), or 6.0 K (S2 multiline). The Chl Z+/Car+ and Cytb 559 signals were collected under nonsaturating conditions. In order to obtain good signal-to-noise ratios in the spectra, multiple scans were collected of illuminated and nonilluminated samples as follows: four scans (Chl Z+/Car+) or 16 scans (Cyt b 559, Q A−, S2 multiline). The PSII supercomplex samples contained 1.7 mg·ml−1 (PF3aad#1) and 1.9 mg·ml−1chlorophyll (H23Y). C. reinhardtiicells grown with air bubbling and stirring at an incident light intensity of 20–50 µE·m−2·s−1 in TAP medium until their mid to late exponential phase (OD750 of 0.6–0.8) were placed in flat glass dishes at 25 °C, stirred, and subjected to heat-filtered low light illumination of 100 µE·m−2·s−1 or high light illumination of 1000 µE·m−2·s−1 (provided by an apparatus equipped with a 1-kilowatt halogen lamp). Lincomycin (cell culture-tested; Sigma) at 100 µg·ml−1 was then added to some of the samples to inhibit chloroplast protein synthesis. 8-ml samples were taken at set intervals during a time course of 4–5 h, and oxygen evolution was measured. The mutants H23M, H23Q, and H23Y of the α subunit of Cyt b 559 were constructed in C. reinhardtii using the biolistic technique developed by Boynton and co-workers (35Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Hosler J.P. Johnson A.M. Jones A.R. Randolph-Anderson B.L. Robertson D. Klein T.M. Shark K.B. Sanford J.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The use ofC. reinhardtii rather than cyanobacteria to generatepsbE mutants is simplified by the fact that thepsbE is monocistronic and is not part of apsbEFLJ operon (36Alizadeh S. Nechushtai R. Barber J. Nixon P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To select for transformants, a spectinomycin resistance cassette was inserted upstream of thepsbE gene (Fig.1 A). After bombardment of wild type cells with a plasmid carrying a mutant psbE gene linked to the spectinomycin resistance cassette, the site-directed mutation was incorporated into the psbE gene on the chloroplast genome through homologous recombination. The WT control strain in these experiments was designated PF3aad#1 and contains the spectinomycin-resistance cassette upstream of a wild type copy ofpsbE. Fig. 1 B, which shows a DNA gel blot of total DNA isolated from the mutants H23M, H23Q, and H23Y, the wild type control strain PF3aad#1, and the wild type, confirms that the transformants were homoplasmic so that all copies of the chloroplast genome contained the engineered mutations. The psbE-specific probe hybridized to a 1.2-kb HindIII/KpnI fragment in the WT but to a 0.8-kb HindIII/KpnI fragment in PF3aad#1 and unresolved 0.40- and 0.41-kb fragments in the His23 mutants due to insertion of a new KpnI site (Fig. 1 A). Homoplasmicity of the mutants was further confirmed by PCR analysis using primers flanking the psbE gene (data not shown). ThepsbE gene in the transformants was sequenced to verify that the engineered base changes were present in the chloroplast genome of the mutants (data not shown). DNA sequencing also confirmed that no other spontaneous mutations were incorporated into the psbEgene during construction of the mutants. TableIsummarizes the growth and oxygen-evolving characteristics of the WT and mutant strains. None of the mutants created at His23 were capable of photoautotrophy either on agar plates or in liquid medium (see “Experimental Procedures”); hence, they were propagated mixotrophically in the presence of acetate. The H23Y and H23M mutants were, however, able to assemble significant levels of oxygen-evolving PSII complexes. Depending on the culture, light-saturated oxygen evolution rates at 5–15% of the levels of WT and the control WT, PF3aad#1, were measured (Table I). The ratio of variable chlorophyll fluorescence to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence (F v/F m), which is a measure of PSII activity (37Krause G.H. Weis E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 313-349Crossref Scopus (3642) Google Scholar), also indicated the presence of functional PSII centers in the H23Y and H23M mutants (Table I). In contrast, a psbE null mutant lacks all PSII activity (11Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In all measurements, strain PF3aad#1 behaved like the original WT (CC-125). Quantitative immunoblotting confirmed the presence of D1 and D2 in light-grown cultures of the H23M and H23Y strains at about 10–25% the levels found in the WT strains (data not shown). The levels of PsbE were also reduced in these mutants to 10–25% of WT (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that the heme ligand, His23, is not absolutely required for assembly of functional PSII complexes, although its replacement does reduce the accumulation of PSII within the membrane. For the H23Q mutant, no oxygen evolution was detected, and the steady-state levels of D1 and D2 were 1–10% of WT levels (data not shown). PsbE could not be detected immunochemically in the mutant (less than 10% of WT levels). To investigate the possibility that the reduced level of PSII in the His23 mutants was due to the effect of the light on accumulation of PSII, cultures grown in the dark were also examined, and similar results to those grown in the light, described above, were obtained (data not shown).Table IGrowth properties and PSII activities in cells from the wild type and mutant strainsStrainHours per doublingF v/F m1-cFv is variable chlorophyll fluorescence, and F m is maximum chlorophyll fluorescence.Oxygen evolution1-dLight-saturated rates of oxygen evolution in the presence of DCBQ/ferricyanide.

Open table in a new tab Preliminary attempts to characterize Cytb 559 in WT and in particular in the mutant thylakoids by optical spectroscopy proved difficult because of contaminating cytochrome signals. Hence, a method was developed to isolate PSII complexes from C. reinhardtii free of contaminating cytochromes. The procedure was based upon the method developed by Eshaghi and co-workers for the isolation of PSII supercomplexes from spinach thylakoids (23Eshaghi S. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Solubilization of WT C. reinhardtii thylakoid membranes followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation allowed the partial resolution of three pigment bands similar to the results obtained for spinach (23Eshaghi S. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). On the basis of absorbance spectra (Fig. 2 B), SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting, the lowest band (of greatest molecular mass) could be assigned to a PSII·LHCII supercomplex, the middle band to a PSI·LHCI supercomplex (PSI), and the upper band to LHCII. TheC. reinhardtii PSII supercomplex gave a similar room temperature absorbance spectrum to the spinach PSII supercomplex with a red peak at 676 nm (Fig. 2 B) and also contained a similar Chl a/b ratio of 3.1:1 (23Eshaghi S. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Further work is required to confirm whether the PSII supercomplex isolated here is structurally analogous to previous described supercomplexes (22Nield J. Kruse O. Ruprecht J. da Fonseca P. Buchel C.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting experiments using specific antisera allowed many of the protein components to be identified in this preparation (Fig.2 C). The level of contamination by PSI in this preparation was estimated by quantitative immunoblotting, using an anti-PsaA serum, to be ∼10% on a chlorophyll basis. The rate of oxygen evolution from the PSII supercomplex using 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone and ferricyanide as electron acceptors was ∼1090 ± 30 µmol of O2·mg of Chl−1·h−1. PSII supercomplexes could be isolated from the H23Y and H23M mutants, with yields consistent with the reduced amount of oxygen evolution activity and levels of D1/D2 subunits in whole cells of these strains. Absorbance spectra are shown in Fig.3A. The oxygen-evolution rates for both types of preparation were determined to be ∼740 ± 40 µmol of O2·mg Chl−1·h−1. Because these preparations were contaminated by more PSI than the WT sample (estimated in PsaA blots to be at about 30% on a chlorophyll basis for the mutants compared with 10% for the WT control), the oxygen-evolving activity per mutant PSII center was estimated to be similar to the WT. Increased contamination by the PSI·LHCI supercomplex was also detected by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Immunoblots confirmed the presence of the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbP, and PsbQ in PSII supercomplexes isolated from"

A recombinant Escherichia colistrain expressing hybrid Dox that had replaced BphA1 with TodC1 (α subunit of toluene dioxygenase (TolDox) of Pseudomonas putida) exhibited high activity toward trichloroethylene (TCE) (Furukawa, K., Hirose, J., Hayashida, S., and Nakamura, K. (1994)J. Bacteriol. 176, 2121–2123). In this study, ISP, FD, and FDR were purified and characterized. Reconstitution of the dioxygenase components consisting of purified ISPTodC1BphA2, FDBphA3, and FDRBphA4 exhibited oxygenation activities toward biphenyl, toluene, and TCE. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by the Ferguson plot analyses demonstrated that ISPTodC1BphA2 and ISPBphA1A2 were present as heterohexamers, whereas ISPTodC1C2 was present as a heterotetramer. The molecular activity (k 0) of the hybrid Dox for TCE was 4.1 min−1, which is comparable to that of TolDox. TheK m value of the hybrid Dox for TCE was 130 µm, which was lower than 250 µm for TolDox. These results suggest that the α subunit of ISP is crucial for the determination of substrate specificity and that the change in the α subunit conformation of ISP from α2β2 to α3β3 results in the acquisition of higher affinity to TCE, which may lead to high TCE degradation activity.

BphDox is a multicomponent enzyme encoded by the four genes, bphA1A2A3A4, wherebphA1 encodes an α subunit (BphA1) of the terminal dioxygenase (an iron–sulfur protein, ISPBph),bphA2 encodes the β subunit (BphA2) of ISPBph, bphA3 encodes ferredoxin (BphA3, FDBphA3), and bphA4 encodes ferredoxin reductase (BphA4, FDRBphA4) (1Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4844-4853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ISP requires mononuclear iron (Fe2+), which is likely to be an active center for catalysis and contains a Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster for electron transfer. Recently a classification has been proposed for these types of ISP as a family of Rieske non-heme iron oxygenases (2Gibson D.T. Parales R.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). FD and FDR act as an electron transfer system from NADH to reduce ISP. Recent studies provided evidence that the α subunit of ISPBph plays a primary role in the determination of the substrate specificity for PCB (3Furukawa K. Hirose J. Suyama A. Zaiki T. Hayashida S. J.

Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is also true that some BphDox from various bacteria share structural similarities to those of KF707, however, their substrate specificities toward PCB are different (10Gibson D.T. Cruden D.L. Haddock J.D. Zylstra G.J. Brand J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4561-4564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Toluene dioxygenase (TolDox) in Pseudomonas putida F1 catalyzes the conversion of toluene to cis-toluene dihydrodiol (11Wackett L.P. Gibson D.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides toluene, TolDox exhibits catalytic activity toward benzene, biphenyl, naphthalene, and trichloroethylene (TCE). The toluene catabolic tod operon is similar to the KF707bph gene cluster in terms of gene organization and the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding genes (1Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4844-4853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zylstra G.J. Gibson D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14940-14946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TolDox is a multicomponent enzyme consisting of α (TodC1) and β (TodC2) subunits of ISPTod, FD (TodB), and FDR (TodA). The identities of the amino acid sequences between the corresponding components of BphDox and TolDox are in the range of 53 to 65% (1Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4844-4853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Zylstra G.J. Gibson D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14940-14946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the course of identifying the component responsible for the substrate specificity of BphDox and TolDox, hybrid bph-todgene clusters were constructed by replacing genes encoding the dioxygenase components from BphDox and TolDox. Among them, the recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the hybridtodC1-bphA2A3A4 genes exhibited substrate specificity similar to that of the original TolDox, but 3-fold higher activity toward TCE than TolDox (13Furukawa K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Nakamura K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2121-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chloroethylenes such as TCE have been recognized to be significant environmental pollutants in the soil, groundwater, and atmosphere (14U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (1985) Document NPL-U3-6-3. US.Google Scholar). These compounds have been shown to persist over time in the environment and are suspected to be carcinogenic (15Infante P.F. Tsongas T.A. Environ. Sci. Res. 1982; 25: 301-327Google Scholar). In the recent past, it has been shown that TCE can be degraded with a variety of oxygenases such as methane monooxygenase (16Little C.D. Palumbo A.V. Herbes S.E. Lidstrom M.E. Tyndall R.L. Gilmer P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 951-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), toluene monooxygenase (17Shields M.S. Montgomery S.O. Cuskey S.M. Chapman P.J. Pritchard P.H. Appl. Environ.

The mechanism of TCE oxygenation by TolDox has been proposed by Li and Wackett (20Li S. Wackett L.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). TCE is converted to an iron-bound dioxygenated intermediate on the enzyme surface, and the intermediate compound is rearranged to form formate and HCl using H2O. We now report the purification of the TodC1-BphA2 hybrid Dox and the kinetic analyses toward chloroethylenes. E. coli JM109 was used for the general propagation of the plasmids and for the expression of ISP. E. coliBL21(DE3) was used for the expression of bphA3 andbphA4. For the expression of bphA1A2 andtodC1BphA2, E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C for 12 h in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and a concentration, 50 µg/ml, of the appropriate antibiotics. For expressions oftodC1C2, bphA3, and bphA4, E. coli cells were grown at 30 °C for 24 h in the same medium described above. pUC-A1A2 for the expression of ISPbphA1A2 was constructed by inserting the XhoI DNA fragment containing the bphA1A2 genes from pKTF18ΔORF3 (1Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4844-4853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into anSalI site of pUC119. pUC-C1A2, for the expression of the hybrid ISPTodC1BphA2, was constructed by removing thePstI DNA fragment containing the bphA3A4BC from pJHF10 (3Furukawa K. Hirose J. Suyama A. Zaiki T. Hayashida S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5224-5232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pHSG-C1C2, for the expression of the ISPTodC1C2, was constructed as follows: ThetodC2 gene without the original Shine-Dalgarno sequence was amplified by PCR using pJHF-C1C2 (21Hirose J. Suyama A. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. Gene. 1994; 138: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as the template DNA. An oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5′ sequence of thetodC2 gene, 5′-AAGAATTCAACATGATGATTCAGCCAACA-3′ (primer #1), was used as a forward primer, where the EcoRI site is underlined. An oligonucleotide corresponding to the 3′ sequence of the todC2 gene, 5′-AAAGGTACCCTAGAAGAAGAAACTGAGG-3′ (primer #2), was used as the reverse primer, where the KpnI site is underlined. The amplified DNA, which had been digested with EcoRI andKpnI, was inserted into the corresponding sites of pBluescriptII SK+ (Stratagene) to generate pBlue-C2. ABamHI/EcoRI DNA fragment containing thetodC1 and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of thebphA2 gene from pUC-C1A2 was inserted into the corresponding sites of pBlue-C2 to construct pBlue-C1C2. pHSG-C1C2 was finally constructed by replacing the pBluescriptII region of pBlue-C1C2 by pHSG396 (Toyobo, Kyoto, Japan) at the BamHI andKpnI sites. To express FDBphA3, the bphA3 gene was amplified by PCR using pJHF10 as the template DNA. An oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5′ sequence of the bphA3 gene, 5′-ATATCCATGGTTATGAAATTTACCAGAGTTTGTGAT-3′ (primer #3), was used as the forward primer, where the NcoI site is underlined. An oligonucleotide corresponding to the 3′ sequence of thebphA3 gene, 5′-TTTCTCGAGTGGCGCCAGATACCCGGC-3′ (primer #4), was used as the reverse primer, where the XhoI site is underlined. The amplified DNA fragment, which had been digested with NcoI and XhoI, was inserted downstream of the thioredoxin gene (TRX), the six-histidine tag (His-tag), and upstream of the His-tag of pET32b (Novagen), yielding pET32-A3 (see Table I below). To construct pUC-A4 for the expression of FDRBphA4, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to introduce an NcoI site around the start codon of thebphA4 gene. An oligonucleotide, 5′-GCGATGGTGTCGACCATGGCGCCAG-3′, where the mutated nucleotide is indicated in boldface letters and the site newly introduced NcoI is underlined, was used as the mutagenic primer. As a template DNA for site-directed mutagenesis, pUC-A3A4 was constructed by digesting pJHFA3A4BC (21Hirose J. Suyama A. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. Gene. 1994; 138: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with PpuMI and subsequent self-ligation. The mutagenized plasmid, pUC-A3A4N, was digested with NcoI and EcoRI, and thebphA4 fragment was inserted downstream of the TRX and His-tag of pET32b, generating pET32-A4. An XbaI/EcoRI DNA fragment containing the bphA4 gene from pET32-A4 was inserted into the corresponding site of pUC119 to generate pUC-A4. A plasmid, pKY206, expressing the groELS gene (22Ashiuchi M.

Open table in a new tab PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 µl that contained the PCR buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), 100 µm dNTPs, 1 µm forward and reverse primers, 0.5 unit ofTaq DNA polymerase (Promega), and 50 ng of a template DNA. PCR was carried out for 25 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation, 94 °C for 1 min; primer annealing, 55 °C for 1.5 min; and primer extension, 72 °C for 1 min. ISP purification was carried out according to the method described by Haddock and Gibson (23Haddock J.D. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5834-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. All the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Harvested recombinantE. coli cells were suspended in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5% ethanol and 5% glycerol (MEG). Cells were disrupted by a French pressure cell (Ohtake Seisakusho, Tokyo) prior to centrifugation at 17,400 × g for 10 min. The resultant viscous liquid was treated with 3% streptomycin sulfate for 30 min and centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was used as a crude enzyme. The crude enzyme was applied to a Q-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with MEG. The hybrid ISPTodC1BphA2 as well as the parental ISPBphA1A2 and ISPTodC1C2 were purified as follows. Proteins were eluted in stepwise fashions with 0.1 m KCl and 0.2 m KCl in MEG. A fraction showing ISP activity was eluted with 0.2 m KCl. The active fraction that had added 2.0 m ammonium sulfate was applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (Tohsho, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 2.0 m ammonium sulfate in MEG, and the proteins were stepwise eluted with 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5 mammonium sulfate in MEG. The fraction showing the ISP activity was eluted with 0.5 m ammonium sulfate and was dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (KP). The dialysate was applied to a column of hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with KP, and the proteins were eluted in stepwise fashions with 0.01, 0.1, and 0.25 m KP. ISPBphA1A2 was eluted with 0.25 m KP. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.4 m KCl in MEG. The fraction showing ISP activity was eluted with 0.3 m KCl. The fraction in the added 1.0 m ammonium sulfate was applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column equilibrated with 1.0 mammonium sulfate in MEG, and the proteins were stepwise eluted with 1.0, 0.75, and 0.5 m ammonium sulfate in MEG. The fraction showing ISP activity was eluted with 0.5 m ammonium sulfate. The subsequent procedure for purification of the ISPTodC1C2 was the same as described above for ISPBphA1A2. Proteins were eluted in stepwise fashions with 0.2 and 0.4 m KCl in MEG. A fraction showing ISP activity was eluted with 0.4 m KCl. The subsequent procedure for purification of the ISPTodC1BphA2 was the same as described for ISPBphA1A2. The crude enzyme was prepared by extracting with 50 mm KP containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, instead of that with MEG. The crude enzyme was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mm KP containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. The agarose gel was washed with 50 mm KP containing 50 mm imidazole and 0.3m NaCl (washing buffer). The FDBphA3 fusion protein was eluted with 50 mm KP containing 0.2m imidazole and 0.3 m NaCl. Purification of the FDRBphA4 fusion protein was done using the same method for FDBphA3 but changing the washing buffer to 50 mm KP containing 20 mm imidazole, 0.3m NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100. An assay for dioxygenase activity was spectrophotometrically done. A total test volume of 250 µl contained 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 0.4 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate, 0.4 mm NADH, 5 mm biphenyl, 1 mg of cell-free extracts containing dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase, and enzyme components. Incubation was done with shaking at 30 °C for the appropriate time. The product catalyzed by dioxygenase from biphenyl was further converted to a yellow compound, 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid by the sequential actions of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase. The yellow compound formed was quantified by measuring itsA 434 value. Enzymatic reactions were also detected and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. The reaction mixture (800-µl total volume) contained 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm NADH, 0.4 mm FeSO4, 1 mm biphenyl or 3 mm toluene as the substrates, and 40–840 µg of each enzyme component. The reaction was initiated by adding the substrate, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C. At appropriate intervals, 150 µl of the reaction mixture was removed, then added to 300 µl of methanol in a microtube. After centrifugation for 10 min, 40 µl of the supernatant was injected into an Ultrasphere ODS column (Beckman) that had been equilibrated with water:methanol:acetonitrile (40:30:30, v/v). The column was eluted for 6 min at 0.75 ml/min with the same solvent system, followed by elution with methanol:acetonitrile (45:55, v/v) for 20 min. The activity was evaluated from the substrate disappearance measurement by detection at 254 nm for biphenyl and at 260 nm for toluene. Steady-state kinetic parameters for TCE, cis-DCE,trans-DCE, and 1,1-DCE were determined with purified ISP, FDBphA3, and FDRBphA4. Two milliliters of the reaction mixture containing 2.2∼3.2 µm ISP, 26∼38 µm FDBphA3, 2.2∼3.2 µmFDRBphA4, 20 µm ferrous ammonium sulfate, and 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) was added to a glass vial (20 ml), which was sealed with a rubber septum and an aluminum crimp seal. Chloroethylenes dissolved inN,N-dimethylformamide were added to the vial and preincubated at 30 °C for 30 min to allow equilibration of the chloroethylene between the gas and liquid phases. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.8 mm NADH, and incubation was carried out with shaking at 30 °C for 10 min. The amounts of the chloroethylenes in the gas phase were measured by gas chromatographic analysis according to a previously described method (13Furukawa K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Nakamura K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2121-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and those in the aqueous phase were calculated according to Henry's Law constants for the chloroethylenes (24Gossett J.M. Environ. Sci. Technol. 1987; 21: 202-208Crossref Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The values of V maxand K m were determined using the Hanes-Woolf (S/V − S plot) analysis. Purified ISP comprised of α and β subunits was subjected to native PAGE. The mobilities of the ISP on 5%, 7.5%, 10%, and 12.5% acrylamide gels were treated with the Ferguson plot (25Gallagher, S. R. (1995) in Current Protocols in Protein Science (Coligan, J. E., Dunn, B. M., Ploegh, H. L., Speicher, D. W., and Wingfield, P. T., eds) Unit 10.3.5–10.3.11, John Wiley & Sons, New York.Google Scholar) to estimate the molecular mass. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205463) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured by a Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The α and β subunits of ISP were successfully coexpressed in E. coli using pUC-A1A2, pUC-C1A2, and pHSG-C1C2 (Table I). In these expression systems, a lac promoter was applied to induce the ISP and was sufficient to produce soluble ISP. ISPBphA1A2 and ISPTodC1BphA2 were produced as the soluble and active forms in the recombinant E. coli at 37 °C. When ISPTodC1C2 was expressed in E. coli using a recombinant plasmid carrying the originaltodC1C2 genes, the level of expression of the β subunit was extremely low, as compared with that of the α subunit. Therefore, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of todC2 was replaced by that ofbphA1, and the pHSG-C1C2 was finally constructed. The recombinant E. coli cells carrying pHSG-C1C2 produced TodC2 with amounts equivalent to TodC1. However, the proteins were produced as prominent inclusion bodies. A reduction of the cultivation temperature from 37 °C to 30 °C resulted in an elevated yield of the soluble ISP. FDBphA3 and FDRBphA4 were expressed as fusion proteins to facilitate protein purification and solubilization. Recombinant E. coli cells carrying pET32-A3 under the control of a strong T7 promoter produced the soluble FDBphA3 fusion protein with the N-terminal TRX, His-tag, and C-terminal His-tag with a molecular mass of 36 kDa (Fig.1). As in the case of FDBphA3, the bphA4 gene was also expressed as a fusion protein with the N-terminal TRX and His-tag. However, the FDRBphA4 fusion protein with a molecular mass of 63 kDa was produced in E. coli (pET32-A4) as prominent inclusion bodies. Replacement of the T7 promoter by the lac promoter resulted in increased amounts of the soluble FDRBphA4fusion protein. In addition, coexpression of a chaperone, GroELS ofE. coli using pKY206, allowed the FDRBphA4fusion protein to efficiently solubilize. By using this coexpression system, the production of the FDRBphA4 fusion protein was improved to 4.5-fold compared with that without pKY206. The catalytically active components of ISPs, FDBphA3 and FDRBphA4, were purified as shown in Fig. 1. The yields of the purified ISPBphA1A2, ISPTodC1BphA2, ISPTodC1C2, FDBphA3, and FDRBphA4from a 1-liter culture were 11.0, 9.4, 8.6, 22.1, and 20.4 mg, respectively. The Dox activity was observed when all purified components of ISP, FDBphA3, and FDRBphA4 were mixed, indicating that all components were successfully associated with one another in vitro. The maximum activity of the hybrid enzyme was observed when 12-fold excess of FDBphA3 was incubated with ISPTodC1BphA2 and FDRBphA4. Only 17%, 30%, and 70% of the maximum activity was observed when 3-, 6-, and 9-folds excess of FDBphA3were added, respectively (data not shown). The maximum activities of the parental BphDox and TolDox were also observed in the presence of 15- and 12-fold excesses of FDBphA3, respectively. The specific activities of the purified ISP were determined in the presence of excess amounts of FDbphA3 by high performance liquid chromatography analysis and were evaluated from the rate of substrate depletion (TableII). The specific activity of the hybrid Dox toward biphenyl was 5.3 nmol/min/nmol ISP, which was comparable to that of TolDox and was as low as 2.9% of that of BphDox. The specific activity of the hybrid Dox toward toluene was 270.3 nmol/min/nmol ISP, which was 7- and 1.5-fold higher than that of BphDox and TolDox, respectively.Table IISpecific activities of various dioxygenases toward original substratesEnzymesActivity toward biphenylActivity toward toluenenmol/min/nmol ISPBphDox183.3 ± 1538.5 ± 3.5TodC1-BphA2 hybrid Dox5.3 ± 1.3270.3 ± 6.7TolDox4.1 ± 0.6182.7 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab Rieske non-heme iron oxygenase (ISP) systems that are involved in the initial dioxygenation of aromatic compounds and which comprise heteromeric subunits are generally present as heterohexamer (α3β3) or heterotetramer (α2β2) conformations (27Maison J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits of the parental ISPBphA1A2, ISPTodC1C2, and hybrid ISPTodC1BphA2 were copurified by column chromatographies, indicating that these two subunits were tightly associated with each other and formed the catalytically active ISP (Fig. 1). An analysis of the purified ISP on SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the α and β subunits were associated with a 1:1 stoichiometry. To investigate how the purified subunits are organized in ISP, nondenaturing PAGE was carried out with the purified ISP. The hybrid ISPTodC1BphA2 as well as the parental ISPBphA1A2 and ISPTodC1C2 were separated on various concentrations of acrylamide gel, and the relative mobilities were determined with the various concentrations. Based on the Ferguson plot, the molecular masses of ISPBphA1A2, ISPTodC1C2, and ISPTodC1BphA2 were estimated to be 209, 160, and 229 kDa, respectively (Fig.2). Because the theoretical molecular mass of ISPBphA1A2 is 219 kDa for α3β3 and 146 kDa for α2β2, the parental ISPBphA1A2is present as a heterohexamer. The theoretical molecular mass of ISPTodC1C2 is 222 kDa for α3β3and 148 kDa for α2β2, therefore, ISPTodC1C2 is present as a heterotetramer, which is in agreement with the result reported by Subramanian et al. (28Subramanian V. Liu T.N. Yeh W.K. Gibson D.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The ISPTodC1BphA2 hybrid has a similar conformation to ISPBphA1A2, and the estimated molecular mass of 229 kDa is in good agreement with the theoretical 226.5 kDa of α3β3 conformation. Because the parental BphDox is inactive toward chloroethylenes, the steady-state kinetic parameters for TCE, cis-DCE,trans-DCE, and 1,1-DCE were determined with purified TolDox and hybrid Dox (Table III). The apparent molecular activity (k 0) of the hybrid Dox for TCE is comparable to that of TolDox. Because conformation of TolDox and hybrid Dox are α2β2 heterotetramer and α3β3 heterohexamer, respectively, the catalytic center activity (k cat) of the hybrid Dox is calculated to be 1.4 min−1 site−1 and 33% lower than that of TolDox. The K m value for TCE of the hybrid Dox is 130 µm, which is smaller than that of TolDox (250 µm). The resulting catalytic efficiency,k cat /K m value for TCE increased 24% for the hybrid Dox, as compared with that for TolDox. For the other chloroethylenes such as cis-DCE and 1,1-DCE, the k cat values are higher in TolDox and theK m values are smaller in the hybrid Dox. The results indicate that the hybrid Dox acquired higher affinities for a variety of chloroethylenes than the parental TolDox and that the catalytic efficiency is slightly higher in the hybrid Dox. For thetrans-DCE, the hybrid Dox showed only a weak activity, and thus the kinetic parameter with a high regression coefficient could not be determined from the Hanes-Woolf plot.Table IIIKinetic parameters of dioxygenases for various chloroethylensSubstratesCl ClCl ClH ClCl H\ /\ /\ /\ /C = CC = CC = CC = C/ \/ \/ \/ \Cl HH HCl HCl HTCEcis-DCEtrans-DCE1,1-DCEHybrid dioxygenase (TodC1-BphA2)k 0(min−1)4.1 ± 0.16.8 ± 0.2N.D.3-aN.D. indicates not determined.1.1k cat (min−1site−1)1.42.3 ± 0.1N.D.0.4K m(µm)130 ± 5370 ± 30N.D.227k cat/K m (min−1m−1)10,514 ± 2566,088 ± 494N.D.1,659Toluene dioxygenase (TodC1-TodC2)k 0 (min−1)4.2 ± 0.47.4 ± 2.42.1 ± 0.11.3k cat (min−1 site−1)2.1 ± 0.23.7 ± 1.21.1 ± 0.10.7K m (µm)250 ± 33824 ± 236754 ± 32383k cat/K m(m−1 min−1)8,462 ± 1,1174,488 ± 1,4561,422 ± 1291,6993-a N.D. indicates not determined. Open table in a new tab It is known that TolDox is irreversibly inactivated by coupling to TCE oxygenation (20Li S. Wackett L.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The hybrid Dox was also gradually inactivated during TCE oxygenation and was completely inactivated after 7.5 h of incubation (Fig. 3). To identify the components responsible for being inactivated, ISPTodC1BphA2, FDBphA3, or FDBphA4was, respectively, added to the inactivated reaction mixture. The addition of ISPTodC1BphA2 permitted the immediate restoration of the enzymatic activity of the TCE oxygenation (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the addition of FDBphA3 or FDBphA4 failed to restore the activity. These results indicate that the ISPTodC1BphA2 component is susceptible and involved in the inactivation of the hybrid Dox during TCE degradation. It is of great interest to construct microorganisms with enhanced and expanded degradation capabilities for environmental pollutants. Some attempts, including in vitro DNA shuffling, domain exchanges, and subunit exchanges have been achieved for structural remodeling of dioxygenases with minimum prior information about the enzymes (4Erickson B.D.

We previously reported that recombinant bacteria producing hybrid TodC1-BphA2A3A4 dioxygenase constructed by subunit exchanges, exhibited the expanded capability of converting various aromatic compounds (21Hirose J. Suyama A. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. Gene. 1994; 138: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Suyama A. Iwakiri R. Kimura N. Nishi A. Nakamura K. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the enhanced degradation activity toward TCE (13Furukawa K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Nakamura K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2121-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Suyama A. Iwakiri R. Kimura N. Nishi A. Nakamura K. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To reconstitute ISP, we first mixed in vitro α and β subunits of BphDox, TolDox, and TodC1-BphA2 hybrid Dox that had been individually expressed in E. coli but failed to reconstitute ISP with high activity (data not shown). However, the ISP components of BphDox and hybrid Dox were fully active when both subunits were coexpressed in E. coli. This result is different from the previous work by Hurtubise et al. (31Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8152-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). They reported that His-tagged α and β subunits of ISP from Comamonas testosteroni were separately expressed in E. coli and that the mixture of these subunits exhibited high activity. It was found that the reconstituted Dox with purified ISP, FDBphA3, and FDRBphA4 are highly functional, indicating that FDBphA3 and FDRBphA4originating from BphDox interacted with a foreign ISP that originated from TolDox and hybrid Dox, where an electron from NADH is transferred to the Rieske [2Fe-2S] center of the α subunit. The reduced ISP activates molecular oxygen and introduces it to the substrates. The maximum activity of ISP was observed when more than 12-fold equivalents of FDBphA3 were incubated with ISP and FDRBphA4. The recombinant FDBphA3 fusion protein may be less active than the native FD due to the additional fusion tags. It is also likely that relatively low activity of FDBphA3 may be associated with the instability of this protein. The FD of BphDox from C. testosteroni was also reported to be labile (32Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Powlowski J. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6610-6618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate specificities of the purified hybrid Dox were similar to those of TolDox (Table II), indicating the α subunit of ISP is critically responsible for recognition of the substrates and the catalytic activity. This result also implies that, in the hybrid Dox, the structure of the functional domains such as the mononuclear iron-binding residues and substrate binding pocket can be retained even in the subunit conformation of an α3β3. Changing the subunit conformation from α2β2to α3β3 may lead to a small change in the structure around the active site. The K m values of the hybrid Dox for the chloroethylenes ranged from 130 to 370 µm (Table III). Those of the parental TolDox ranged from 250 to 824 µm (Table III). These results suggest that the hybrid Dox gains slightly higher affinity for substrates used in this study than TolDox. A binding pocket around the active center of ISPTodC1BphA2 may be slightly relaxed to accommodate various chloroethylenes. Although the k 0 values of the hybrid Dox are comparable to those of TolDox, thek cat values of the hybrid Dox are slightly lower than those of TolDox. It is likely that the conformation of the catalytic residues involved in the mononuclear iron binding in ISPTodC1BphA2 is slightly changed compared with that in ISPTodC1C2 (33Jiang H. Parales R.E. Lynch N.A. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3133-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As previously reported (13Furukawa K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Nakamura K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2121-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the recombinant resting cells expressing hybrid Dox degraded TCE 3-fold faster than those expressing TolDox. The TCE used in this experiment was as low as 76 µm. Under conditions below theKm value, the hybrid Dox is able to better exert its higher activity than TolDox. Thus, the elevated activity of the recombinant bacteria expressing the hybrid Dox toward TCE reflects the elevated affinity of the hybrid Dox for TCE. There are some reports on the irreversible inactivation of monooxygenases (34Newman L.M. Wackett L.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 90-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dioxygenases (20Li S. Wackett L.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Lee K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2719-2725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lee reported that benzene dioxygenase was inactivated via the Fenton-type reaction that formed hydroxyl radicals from the uncoupled reaction of hydrogen peroxide with ferrous mononuclear iron at the catalytic center (35Lee K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2719-2725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Li and Wackett (20Li S. Wackett L.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) reported that TolDox is inactivatedvia alkylation of the enzyme during TCE degradation. In this study, an irreversibly inactivated component of the hybrid Dox was determined to be ISP not FD or FDR (Fig. 3). Neither cleavage of the peptide bond nor dissociation of the α and β subunits occurred on ISPTodC1BphA2 during TCE oxygenation as judged by the SDS-PAGE and native PAGE (data not shown). Some attempts to understand the mechanism for the TCE inactivation of ISPTodC1BphA2were carried out using chelating agents and catalase, indicating that the hydroxyl radical caused by the Fenton reaction was not implicated in the TCE inactivation of ISPTodC1BphA2 (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that the hybrid ISPTodC1BphA2 is inactivated by a fashion similar to the ISP of TolDox (20Li S. Wackett L.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2156276522,"Arachidonic acid has been implicated to play a role in physiological and pathophysiological processes and is selectively released by the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). The activity of cPLA2 is regulated by calcium, translocating the enzyme to its substrate, and by phosphorylation by a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family member and a MAPK-activated protein kinase. In this study, the signal transduction pathways in growth factor-induced phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK and cPLA2activation were investigated in Her14 fibroblasts. p42/44MAPK in response to epidermal growth factor was not only phosphorylated via the Raf-MEK pathway but mainly through protein kinase C (PKC) or a related or unrelated kinase in which the phosphorylated p42/44MAPK corresponded with cPLA2 activity. Serum-induced phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK also corresponded with cPLA2activity but is predominantly mediated via Raf-MEK and partly through PKC or a related or unrelated kinase. In contrast, activation of PKC by phorbol ester did not result in increased cPLA2 activity, while p42/44MAPK is phosphorylated, mainly via Raf-MEK and through MEK. Moreover, p42/44MAPK phosphorylation is present in quiescent and proliferating cells, and p42/44MAPK is entirely phosphorylated via Raf-MEK, but it only corresponds to cPLA2 activity in the former cells. Collectively, these data show that p42/44MAPK in proliferating, quiescent, and stimulated cells is phosphorylated by various signal transduction pathways, suggesting the activation of different populations of p42/44MAPK and cPLA2."

Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).IL-2Rα binds Lys-35, Arg-38, Phe-42, and Lys-43 residues of IL-2 (8Sauve K. Nachman M. Spence C. Bailon P. Campbell E. Tsien W.H. Kondas J.A. Hakimi J. Ju G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4636-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but there is no evidence as to which amino acids in IL-2 interact with which high mannose-type glycans. A limited degree of sequence homology was identified in the amino-terminal portion of IL-2 compared with the carboxyl-terminal domains of C-type human mannose-binding lectin, MBP(H), and two rat liver mannose-binding proteins, MBP(A) and MBP(C) (13Sherblom A.P. Sathyamoorthy N. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 939-944PubMed Google Scholar). Glu-15, Asn-26, Gly-27, Asn-30, Cys-58, and Glu-67 are the amino acids conserved among MBP(H), MBP(A), MBP(C), and IL-2. His-16 and Leu-19 are common between MBP(H) and IL-2, whereas Leu-21 is conserved among MBP(C), MBP(H), and IL-2. Accordingly, we introduced point mutations at Glu-15, Leu-19, Leu-21, Asn-26, Gly-27, Asn-30, and Glu-67 into IL-2 cDNA by PCR, and we synthesized 35S-IL-2 muteins by in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. Then we investigated the relationship between carbohydrate recognition activities and CTLL-2 cell proliferation activities of these muteins. Furthermore, since IL-2 synthesized in Escherichia coli (rhIL-2) showed heterogeneous molecular forms from various oligomers to the monomer on Superose 12 column chromatography, we investigated the cell proliferation activity of each form, and we discussed the form of the IL-2·IL-2 receptor complex.DISCUSSIONWe reported in a previous paper that the carbohydrate recognition of IL-2 is essential for expression of its physiological function (12Fukushima K. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this study, we prepared several mutant forms of IL-2 based on the homology with three mannose-binding proteins (13Sherblom A.P. Sathyamoorthy N. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 939-944PubMed Google Scholar), and we compared the proliferation activities and carbohydrate recognition activities among them. We clearly demonstrated that the carbohydrate recognition site in IL-2 involves Asn-26. Before accomplishing this study, we needed to characterize the molecular forms of IL-2, which were synthesized by anin vitro translation method. As shown in Fig. 1, rhIL-2 produced in E. coli showed several molecular forms from polymer to monomer on Superose 12 column chromatography, although the dimeric form of IL-2 exclusively has the cell proliferation activity. Since rhIL-2 produced in E. coli is incorporated into inclusion bodies, the denaturing and refolding is necessary. These treatments might cause the oligomerization of IL-2. Freezing and thawing also caused oligomerization (data not shown). In contrast,35S-labeled rhIL-2 prepared by an in vitrotranscription and translation method in the presence of [35S]methionine reproducibly yielded the dimeric form, which has the same cell proliferation activity as the dimeric form of rhIL-2 produced in E. coli and was stable at 37 °C for several hours. Accordingly, 35S-labeled rhIL-2 could be used to analyze precisely the relationship between the carbohydrate recognition activity and IL-2-induced proliferation activity of CTLL-2 cells.To investigate the inhibitory effects of M5 and M6 on the binding to ribonuclease B-coated plates and IL-2-dependent cell proliferation, the 2 h of preincubation of 35S-rhIL-2 with M5 or M6 before addition of the mixture to the cells was critical. As reported previously, since IL-2 recognizes both a high mannose-type glycan and a specific peptide in IL-2Rα (12Fukushima K. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the difference in the conformation between free oligomannosides and the high mannose-type glycan linked to IL-2Rα on the cell surface may require preincubation of IL-2 and hapten. As soon as IL-2 binds to both Man5GlcNAc2 and a specific peptide in IL-2Rα, the tightly bound IL-2·IL-2Rα complex might be formed and not be replaced by the haptenic sugar. Although the N,N′-diacetyl chitobiosyl asparagine structure is not necessary for in vitro binding of IL-2, IL-2 may bind in vivo more strongly a specific glycopeptide portion including Man5GlcNAcGlcNAc linked to Asn-33, Asn-43, or Asn-200N-glycosylation potential sites of IL-2Rα than free glycans.To determine the carbohydrate recognition site of IL-2, we prepared several IL-2 muteins on the basis of the data reported previously (13Sherblom A.P. Sathyamoorthy N. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 939-944PubMed Google Scholar). Since IL-2 is a helical cytokine (26Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), it should hold a helical structure to retain its physiological activity. However, most of the muteins could not conserve the dimeric form which exclusively has the cell proliferation activity. Interestingly, although the muteins at Asn-26 could retain the dimeric form, their carbohydrate binding activities were affected and that of N26Q was increased, whereas that of N26D was decreased. Accordingly, Asn-26 was considered to be involved in the carbohydrate recognition site. When a theoretical model of IL-2 attached to IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ was constructed on the basis of the structural model in the Rutgers University Protein Data base (27Bamborough P. Hedgecock C.J.R. Richards W.G. Structure. 1994; 2: 677-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which was obtained by both x-ray crystallographic and NMR studies, the position of Asn-26 and the positions of the residues involved in binding each of the receptor subunits were found to be close but not to be overlapped (Fig. 5 B). This model also supports the view that IL-2 recognizes both the IL-2 receptor subunits and high mannose-type glycans and that binding to these ligands is necessary for expression of IL-2-induced cellular signal transduction. When the high affinity complex of IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ was formed via the IL-2 carbohydrate recognition site including Asn-26, intracellular signal transduction might be stimulated. IL-2Rα of mouse CTLL-2 cells has three potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn-33, Asn-43, and Asn-200 (28Shimuzu A. Kondo S. Takeda S. Yodoi J. Ishida N. Sabe H. Osawa H. Diamantstein T. Nikaido T.

The question which carbohydrate at Asn-33, Asn-43, and/or Asn-200 in murine IL-2Rα contributes to the binding of IL-2 should be resolved in the near future.We showed in a previous paper (12Fukushima K. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that the formation of IL-2·IL-2Rα complex triggers the formation of a high affinity complex that consists of IL-2, IL-2Rα, -β, -γ, and other tyrosine kinases.

First, growth hormone (31de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) and erythropoietin (32Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2)1has been widely studied as a mediator of cellular signaling in the immune system. The receptor for IL-2 (IL-2R) consists of α-, β-, and γ-subunits (IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ), and the intracellular portions of the β- and γ-subunits are associated with a variety of cytoplasmic proteins including tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3 (1Nelson B.H. Willerford D.M. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Asao H. Tanaka N. Ishii N. Higuchi M. Takeshita T. Nakamura M. Shirasawa T. Sugamura K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of IL-2Rβ especially plays a critical role in attracting downstream signaling molecules including the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5 into the activated receptor complex (1Nelson B.H.

IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ bind to distinct sites of IL-2, and these associations appear to occur in a stepwise manner (4Zurawski S.M. Imler J.L. Zurawski G.

When IL-2Rα, -β, or -γ was independently expressed, IL-2Rα bound IL-2 with low affinity (K d ∼10 nm); IL-2Rβ bound IL-2 with very low affinity (K d ∼100 nm), and IL-2Rγ had no measurable affinity for IL-2, whereas co-expressed IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ bound IL-2 with a very high affinity constant (K d ∼pm) (9Arima N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the difference in the conformation between free oligomannosides and the high mannose-type glycan linked to IL-2Rα on the cell surface may require preincubation of IL-2 and hapten. As soon as IL-2 binds to both Man5GlcNAc2 and a specific peptide in IL-2Rα, the tightly bound IL-2·IL-2Rα complex might be formed and not be replaced by the haptenic sugar. Although the N,N′-diacetyl chitobiosyl asparagine structure is not necessary for in vitro binding of IL-2, IL-2 may bind in vivo more strongly a specific glycopeptide portion including Man5GlcNAcGlcNAc linked to Asn-33, Asn-43, or Asn-200N-glycosylation potential sites of IL-2Rα than free glycans. To determine the carbohydrate recognition site of IL-2, we prepared several IL-2 muteins on the basis of the data reported previously (13Sherblom A.P. Sathyamoorthy N. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 939-944PubMed Google Scholar). Since IL-2 is a helical cytokine (26Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), it should hold a helical structure to retain its physiological activity. However, most of the muteins could not conserve the dimeric form which exclusively has the cell proliferation activity. Interestingly, although the muteins at Asn-26 could retain the dimeric form, their carbohydrate binding activities were affected and that of N26Q was increased, whereas that of N26D was decreased. Accordingly, Asn-26 was considered to be involved in the carbohydrate recognition site. When a theoretical model of IL-2 attached to IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ was constructed on the basis of the structural model in the Rutgers University Protein Data base (27Bamborough P. Hedgecock C.J.R. Richards W.G. Structure. 1994; 2: 677-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which was obtained by both x-ray crystallographic and NMR studies, the position of Asn-26 and the positions of the residues involved in binding each of the receptor subunits were found to be close but not to be overlapped (Fig. 5 B). This model also supports the view that IL-2 recognizes both the IL-2 receptor subunits and high mannose-type glycans and that binding to these ligands is necessary for expression of IL-2-induced cellular signal transduction. When the high affinity complex of IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ was formed via the IL-2 carbohydrate recognition site including Asn-26, intracellular signal transduction might be stimulated. IL-2Rα of mouse CTLL-2 cells has three potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn-33, Asn-43, and Asn-200 (28Shimuzu A. Kondo S. Takeda S. Yodoi J. Ishida N. Sabe H. Osawa H. Diamantstein T. Nikaido T. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1505-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and human IL-2Rα has two potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn-70 and Asn-89 (29Leonard W.J. Depper J.M. Crabtree G.R. Rudikoff S. Pumphrey J. Robb R.J. Kronke M. Svetlik P.B. Peffer N.J. Waldmann T.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), where high mannose-type glycan also binds. 2K. Fukushima, Y. Kanaya, and K. Yamashita, manuscript in preparation. The question which carbohydrate at Asn-33, Asn-43, and/or Asn-200 in murine IL-2Rα contributes to the binding of IL-2 should be resolved in the near future. We showed in a previous paper (12Fukushima K. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that the formation of IL-2·IL-2Rα complex triggers the formation of a high affinity complex that consists of IL-2, IL-2Rα, -β, -γ, and other tyrosine kinases. The cell proliferation activity and carbohydrate recognition activity of IL-2 could be seen mostly in the dimeric form, which was separated on Superose 12 column chromatography. Since co-crystallized IL-2 and IL-2Rα were constructed by a ratio of 1:1 by x-ray crystallography (30Lambert G. Stura E.A. Wilson I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12730-12736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was considered that as soon as the hetero-octamer consisting of (IL-2·IL-2Rα, -β, -γ)2is tightly formed, all the tyrosine kinases linked to the cytoplasmic domains of IL-2Rβ and -γ are immediately phosphorylated, and cellular signaling might be effectively intensified. Several types of the binding mechanisms for cytokines and their receptors have been reported. First, growth hormone (31de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) and erythropoietin (32Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J.

It should be further confirmed by x-ray crystallography or NMR analysis whether IL-2 and IL-2Rα, -β, and -γ form a 2:2:2:2 hetero-octamer complex as suggested in this study."

The subunits combine non-covalently early in the secretory pathway, and formation of the heterodimer is crucial for binding to the gonadal and thyroid receptors. Although it is well established that both subunits contain residues critical for bioactivity, recent evidence indicates that the quaternary interactions between the two subunits are essential for intracellular behavior but not for in vitro bioactivity (1Sato A. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Kudo M. Pixley M.R. Furuhashi M. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the single chain gonadotropin model where the amino end of the common α subunit was genetically fused to the carboxyl end of CGβ subunit (designated CGβα; Fig.1) (4Sugahara R. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This analog was secreted efficiently and was active in in vitro and in vivo bioassays. The CGβα orientation was chosen to keep the carboxyl end of the α subunit unmodified because this region is critical for high affinity receptor binding (5Charlesworth M.C. McCormick D.J. Madden B. Ryan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chen F. Wang Y. Puett D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 914-919PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ji T. Grossman M. Ji I.

Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear whether the orientation of the tethered subunit domains affects the heterodimeric alignment between the two subunits, resulting in functional determinants for secretion and bioactivity, or if the two domains can swivel with respect to each other producing heterodimer-like contacts regardless of their position. To examine this issue, we constructed a single chain hCG in which the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit was genetically fused to the amino end of CGβ subunit (αCGβ; Fig. 1). This design reverses the relative position of the linked subunit domains compared with the first generation of single chain analog described above. Several parameters were examined for determining the function of the reverse-oriented constructs as follows: 1) the secretion rate and recovery from the media, 2) the ability of the tethered α/β domains to combine and form heterodimeric-specific epitopes with co-transfected monomeric subunits, and 3) formation of receptor binding determinants. Here we show that the relative position of the α and CGβ tethered domains in the single chain is critical for bioactivity but not for secretion. In addition, αCGβ/α and αCGβ/CGβ complexes were observed when the single chain was co-expressed with individual subunits. Dimer-specific conformational epitopes were detected in both complexes, but only αCGβ/α was bioactive. This implies that formation of heterodimeric interactions does not ensure bioactivity. The results support the hypothesis that epitopes for gonadotropin assembly and bioactivity are distinct and can be uncoupled from each other. Engineering of the single chain CGβα was described previously (4Sugahara R. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To construct αCGβ, theCGβ gene was inserted in frame at the carboxyl end of the α subunit gene using overlapping polymerase chain reaction. The following primers were used in the construction: 1) 5′-CTACAGGAAAACCCATT-3′; 2) 5′-GCGGCTCCTTGGAAGATTTGTGATAAT-3′; 3) 5′-ATTATCACAAATCTTCCAAGGAGCCGC-3′; 4) 5′-TGAGTCGACATGATAATTCAGTGATTGAAT-3′. From the α minigene, product A was generated using primers 1 and 2. Primer 1 encodes residues 12–17 at the α subunit amino terminus. Primer 2 contains the first 4 codons of the CGβ subunit and the last 5 codons of the α subunit. In another reaction, primers 3 and 4 were used with CGβα as template. Primer 3 encodes the first 4 amino acids of the CGβ subunit (residues 1–4) and the last 5 amino acids of the α subunit (residues 88–92). Primer 4 contains some of the intron sequence between CGβ exons 2 and 3 and also includes a newly created SalI site. The fragment derived from this reaction is product B. In a second reaction, fragments A and B were used as overlapping templates with primers 1 and 4 to generate product C. product C was sequenced to ensure no errors were introduced during the polymerase chain reaction. Following NsiI and SalI digestion, the fragment was cloned into pBS containing the α minigene including its signal sequence (pBSαCG exon 2). The CGβ exon 3 flanked by SalI site was isolated from pM2HACGβ (4Sugahara R. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). CGβ exon 3 was ligated to SalI-digested pBSαCGβ in the correct orientation with αCGβ exon 2 resulting in pBSαCGβ. This was then cloned into BamHI-digested pM2HA. The final product contains NH2-α (with signal peptide)-CGβ (without signal peptide) COOH. To construct the αcCGβΔT single chain, a carboxyl-terminal peptide (CTP) was deleted from the CGβ subunit and inserted between the α and CGβΔT domains. To facilitate construction of αcCGβΔT, the CTP-derived sequence linked to the carboxyl-terminal of the α subunit was truncated at amino acid residue 117 (instead of residue 114) and included 28 residues rather than 31 amino acids. This analog bearing the 28-amino acid linker exhibited the same intracellular and extracellular characteristics (data not shown) as reported previously for single chains containing a 31-amino acid linker (4Sugahara R. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All variants were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pM2HA (4Sugahara R. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stable clones were selected ∼11 days after transfection by using the neomycin analog G418 (250 µg/ml). The clones were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), and 2 mm glutamine) containing 5% fetal bovine serum and G418 (125 µg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air, as described previously (12Furuhashi M.

Pulse-chase experiments were performed as described previously (4Sugahara R. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Aliquots of cell lysate and medium were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antisera directed against either the common α or the CGβ subunit, and the proteins were resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4Sugahara R.

The secretion half-time (t 12) and recovery efficiency of the single chains were estimated by determining the time (min) when half of the maximal secreted variant was detected in the medium; the recovery of the secreted variants is expressed as a fraction (%) of the total (intracellular + secreted) (4Sugahara R. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I.

Media samples were resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels without heating and under nonreduced conditions to prevent dissociation of the hCG heterodimer and were blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with antisera or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as described in the figure legends. Purified hCG (CR 127) was kindly supplied by Dr. A. Parlow (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, Torrence, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antisera against the human α or CGβ subunits were raised in our laboratory. The hCG conformational sensitive mAbs that recognize primarily the heterodimer, but not the monomeric CGβ subunit, were provided by Dr. Steven Birken (Columbia University Medical School, New York). The blots were visualized with the Western Light Detection System (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Western blot analysis was performed 3–5 times using 3 independent collection media. Conditioned media were concentrated using either a Centricon concentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) or an ultra-free concentrator (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Subsequently, the samples were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and quantitated using a double polyclonal based radioimmunoassay kit (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA), containing antiserum that recognizes the CGβ subunit. Receptor binding and cAMP production were determined using a transfected CHO cell line, expressing the human LH/CG receptor (14Kanda M. Jablonka-Shariff A. Sato A. Pixley M.R. Bos E. Hiro'oka T. Ben-Menahem D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1873-1881PubMed Google Scholar). Total binding was 15%, and nonspecific binding (in the presence of 5 µg of hCG) was 1.5% of total counts. The cAMP accumulation was determined using the Adenyl Cyclase Activation Flash Plate kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 × 104 stably transfected CHO cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with ligands;125I-cAMP was then added, and the cells were incubated for 17 h at room temperature. The flash plate was then read in a Packard Top Counter. Each experiment was performed at least 3 times, and the data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of 3 independent culture collections. To compare the secretion of CGβα and αCGβ from stably transfected CHO cells, pulse-chase experiments were performed. Cells were labeled with35S-Promix, chased with unlabeled amino acids, and aliquots of lysate and medium immunoprecipitated with polyclonal α antiserum (Fig. 2). Although recovery of both variants from the media was similar, αCGβ was secreted slower (t 12 = 155 min) than CGβα (t 12 = 90 min). To examine if the two subunit domains in αCGβ could form intrachain heterodimeric-like interactions, media samples were electrophoresed under nonreduced conditions without heating, and the blots were probed with polyclonal α antiserum and a panel of CG dimer-specific mAbs (Fig. 3). The α antiserum recognizes both native CG heterodimer and the non-combined α subunit (Fig. 3,panel A, lane 1) and the two single chain variants (lanes 2 and 3) that migrate with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa. Larger forms were also observed, and although their composition is unclear, aggregates have been observed in the synthesis of a variety of single chain mutants (1Sato A. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Lustbader J. Birken S. Pollak S. Levinson L. Bernstine E. Hsiung N. Canfield R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14204-14212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aggregation is more extensive for αCGβ, implying that its structure differs from that of CGβα. When the blots were probed with a CG dimer-specific mAb (panel B), the native dimer (lane 1) and CGβα were seen (lane 2). No signal corresponding to the 50 kDa of αCGβ protein was observed (lane 3). Similar results were obtained with six additional dimer-specific mAbs (not shown). These data suggest that compared with CGβα, the two tethered domains in αCGβ cannot form intrachain heterodimeric determinants recognizable by these conformational sensitive antibodies. If absence of αCGβ immunoreactivity to mAbs is due to inhibition of the native dimeric interactions between the subunit domains, αCGβ should be in a more open configuration than CGβα. To test this prediction, both variants were probed with mAb 68 that primarily reacts with the monomeric form of the CGβ subunit rather than the heterodimer (panel C). As expected, the non-combined CGβ subunit control secreted from transfected cells was immunoreactive (lane 4), and the heterodimer was not detected (lane 1). Whereas CGβα was poorly recognized by the CGβ-specific mAb (lane 2), αCGβ was much more immunoreactive (lane 3). These data imply that the conformation of one or both subunit domains in αCGβ is altered, which inhibits an intrachain heterodimeric-like interaction. A major difference between the two single chain variants is the presence of the native CTP in the CGβ subunit (17Birken S. Canfield R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5386-5392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) between the subunit domains in CGβα. As discussed previously, the CTP sequence lacks extensive secondary structure and serves as a natural linker (18Ben-Menahem D. Boime I. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 100-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The αCGβ analog was constructed without a linker to maintain consistency with the subunit structure of CGβα. To assess if the intracellular effects of αCGβ are related to the absence of a linker sequence, a different chimera was constructed where the CTP was deleted from the carboxyl end of the CGβ subunit and inserted between the α and CGβ subunits (αcCGβΔT) (Fig. 1). When examined by pulse-chase kinetics (Fig. 4,panel A), the secretion rate was 3-fold greater (t 12 = 50 min), and the recovery was higher (80%) than αCGβ (t 12 = 155 min; recovery = 70%). To examine the ability of αcCGβΔT to generate heterodimer-like determinants, blots containing this variant were screened with the mAbs described above (Fig. 4, panels B andC). In contrast to the results seen with αCGβ, αcCGβΔT is recognized by dimer-specific mAb (panel B, lanes 3 and 4), although its immunoreactivity to CGβ or α monomer-specific mAbs is reduced considerably (panel C, lanes 1–4). Thus, the presence of the linker sequence in αcCGβΔT increases the heterodimeric alignment of the α and β domains. The receptor binding affinity of the variants was determined using CHO cells stably expressing the human LH/CG receptor. CGβα displayed high affinity binding, displacing the iodinated tracer similar to that of native hCG (Fig. 5 A; TableI). In contrast, no binding was observed with αCGβ. However, αcCGβΔT does bind to receptor, although its affinity is reduced about 100- and 70-fold when compared with CGβα and the heterodimer, respectively. Signal transduction of the chimeras was assessed by quantitating adenylate cyclase activation (Fig. 5 B; Table I). Native hCG, CGβα, and αcCGβΔT caused a concentration-dependent increase in cAMP accumulation. Although, the stimulation of αcCGβΔT was 25–30-fold less than the controls, the induced levels of cAMP were greater than expected based on the receptor binding data (see “Discussion”). The results show that for the variant in the αβ configuration (αcCGβΔT), the linker can rescue a significant portion of the receptor binding activity, but the lack of a free carboxyl end in the α subunit nevertheless reduces the binding affinity. These observations are similar to data seen with the heterodimer containing an α subunit with a CTP unit at its carboxyl end (10Furuhashi M. Shikone T. Fares F. Sugahara T. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 54-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In that study it was shown that the receptor binding affinity of this analog was reduced over 100-fold.Table ILH/CG receptor binding and cAMP stimulation by the hCG single chain chimerasLigandIC50EC50hCG dimer9.8 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.1CGβα6.7 ± 0.71.2 ± 0.3αCGβNDNDαCGβ/CGβNDNDαCGβ/CGβΔTNDNDαCGβ/α135.7 ± 3.016.0 ± 1.4αcCGβΔT712.0 ± 31.536.2 ± 2.8αcCGβΔT/CGβ612.5 ± 34.918.7 ± 0.7αcCGβΔT/α104.4 ± 9.19.7 ± 0.9Results are expressed as ± S.E.

It is evident that compared with CGβα, αCGβ is biologically inactive, indicating that reversing the positions of the subunits dramatically alters the overall structure of the single chain. A key question is whether or not the reduction in receptor binding is related to modifications of one or both of the α/β domains. To address this point, we co-transfected αCGβ with either the α orCGβ subunit gene. We reasoned that if the intrachain domains were substantially misfolded, this would be reflected in their inability to form heterodimeric-like contacts with either of the co-transfected monomeric subunits. For example, co-transfecting the single chain gene with the monomeric CGβ subunit gene will assess the assembly determinants in the α domain of the single chain. Because αCGβ and the free subunits do not bind to the LH/CG receptor (Fig. 5 A) (11Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 19Parsons T.F. Pierce J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6010-6015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Keene J.L.

We first examined the integrity of the tethered CGβ domain by co-expressing the monomeric α subunit with αCGβ (Fig.6). The secreted proteins were analyzed in Western blots using polyclonal α antiserum (panel A) and a CG dimer-specific mAb 40 (panel B). The α antiserum recognized heterodimer and uncombined α subunit (panel A, lane 3) and αCGβ (lane 2 and 3). In addition, a 70-kDa band corresponding to αCGβ/α was detected in cells co-expressing both the single chain and the monomeric subunit (lane 3). The interaction between the incoming α subunit and the tethered CGβ subunit domain formed heterodimeric-like epitopes because the complex was recognized by a dimer-specific mAb (panel B, lane 3). The integrity of the intrachain α domain was examined with cells co-expressing αCGβ and the monomeric CGβ subunit (Fig.7). The dimer-specific mAb 53 recognizes CGβα (lane 1) but not αCGβ (lane 2). However, the αCGβ/CGβ complex is immunoreactive (lane 3, asterisk). Six other conformational sensitive mAbs also detected both the αCGβ/CGβ and the αCGβ/α complexes (data not shown). Thus, the intrachain α subunit can form a heterodimer-like interaction with a co-expressed monomeric CGβ subunit. Both αCGβ/α and αCGβ/CGβ complexes and the heterodimer dissociate after heating (3 min, 95 °C) in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol (data not shown). This result indicates that the association of the monomeric subunit with the tethered domain is non-covalent, comparable to subunit interactions seen in the native heterodimer. These experiments show that both the α and the CGβ subunit domains in αCGβ retain the ability to assemble with a monomeric subunit despite their inability to exhibit an intrachain heterodimeric configuration. The αCGβ/α complex binds to the human LH/CG receptor although with reduced affinity compared with the heterodimer (Fig.8 A; Table I). The observed dose-dependent binding could only result from synthesis of a αCGβ/α complex since neither αCGβ nor the monomeric α subunit alone exhibits significant receptor binding. In contrast, αCGβ/CGβ did not displace the tracer (Fig. 8 A) despite the formation of immunoreactive dimer-specific epitopes (see Fig. 7,lane 3). Because both αCGβ and the monomeric β subunit contain the CTP at their carboxyl termini, which are glycosylated and sialylated, the absence of αCGβ/CGβ receptor binding could be related to charge interference of two CTPs. To examine this point αCGβ was co-transfected with a CGβ monomeric variant lacking the CTP (CGβΔT). Although αCGβ/CGβΔΤ complex exhibited heterodimeric-like interactions (see Fig. 7, lane 4), it nevertheless did not bind to the receptor (Fig. 8 A; TableI). The data imply that lack of bioactivity in the αCGβ/CGβ complex is not due to the additional CTP. The cAMP levels induced by the complexes paralleled receptor binding (Fig. 8 B; TableI). Thus, although the monomeric subunits in both αCGβ/α and αCGβ/CGβ form heterodimeric contacts, only the αCGβ/α complex is bioactive. These results indicate that determinants for receptor binding/signal transduction are preserved in the intrachain β subunit of αCGβ but not in the α domain. The data described above demonstrated that the presence of the CTP as a linker in αcCGβΔT partially restores activity of the αCGβ. We examined if this linker would reconstitute binding determinants in the tethered subunit domains and enhance the binding affinity when co-transfected with the monomeric α, CGβ, or CGβΔT subunits (Fig. 9). (As expected, αcCGβΔT/α was immunoreactive with dimer-specific mAbs (data not shown).) The affinity of the αcCGβΔT/CGβ complex was the same as αcCGβΔT (panel A). Although there was a significant increase in binding of αcCGβΔT/α compared with αcCGβΔT, it was similar to αCGβ/α. In addition, insertion of the linker sequence does not restore the bioactivity to the levels seen for the heterodimer or CGβα. These data imply that not only the lack of a free carboxyl end in the α subunit but also modifying the amino end in the CGβ subunit reduces receptor binding. Similar to the αCGβ complexes, the analog-induced cAMP levels paralleled receptor binding (panel B). The results of the immuno- and bioactivities of the analogs are summarized in TableII.Table IISummary of the Western blot analyses and bioactivity of hCG single chain chimerasLigandDimeric epitopesMonomeric epitopesBioactivityhCG dimer++−+++CGβα+++−+++αCGβ−++−αCGβ/CGβ+NT−αCGβ/CGβΔT++NT−αCGβ/α++NT++αcCGβΔT+++−+αcCGβΔT/CGβ+++−+αcCGβΔT/α+++−++The immunoreactivity of chimeras in Western blots are indicated as follows: +++, or ++, very strong; +, strong; +−, weak; −, negative; NT, not tested.

In such chimeras,e.g. CGβα, the β subunit occupies the amino-terminal end of the molecule linked to the α subunit. This orientation was chosen to preserve the free carboxyl end in the α subunit due to its importance for maximal receptor binding efficiency (5Charlesworth M.C. McCormick D.J. Madden B. Ryan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chen F. Wang Y. Puett D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 914-919PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ji T. Grossman M. Ji I. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). To examine if the relative position of the two subunit domains is critical for generating a functional single chain gonadotropin, we engineered a tethered hCG in which the position of the two domains was reversed (αCGβ) relative to the CGβα orientation. In both αβ and βα configurations, the variants were secreted efficiently which shows that the relative position of the linked subunits was not critical for secretion. However, in contrast to CGβα, the intra-chain subunits in αCGβ exhibited no detectable reactivity to hCG dimer-specific mAbs, although each domain was capable of forming a heterodimeric-like complex with its complementary monomeric subunit. This suggests that the structural constraints generated at the α-β linkage do not favor a heterodimeric alignment for the two domains. We also observed that αCGβ did not bind to the receptor compared with CGβα, which implies that accessibility of receptor binding determinants is dependent on the position of the αβ subunits in the single chain. A major structural difference between CGβα and αCGβ is the presence of a CTP sequence between the two tethered domains in CGβα. As reported previously (18Ben-Menahem D. Boime I. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 100-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we considered this sequence a natural linker since it is serine/proline-rich and thus lacks significant secondary structure. In the case of αCGβ, the CTP is at the carboxyl end of the single chain, and thus it does not serve as a linker. When the CTP was deleted from the carboxyl end of the CGβ subunit and inserted between the α and β subunits, the resulting αcCGβΔT was rapidly and efficiently secreted and exhibited strong immunoreactivity to dimer- but not monomer-specific mAbs. The αcCGβΔT variant was bioactive, but the binding affinity was reduced compared with CGβα. These data suggest that in the absence of linker the alignment of the α/β domains is perturbed especially at the carboxyl end of the α subunit. Our results are consistent with a recent report that a single chain hCG constructed in the αβ configuration and a CTP between the subunits is biologically active (25Narayan P. Gray J. Puett D. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In that work the binding affinity of the chimera was reduced 25–30-fold, whereas signal transduction was decreased only 10-fold. Similarly, we find that whereas the binding affinity of αcCGβΔΤ is reduced 70–100-fold, adenylate cyclase activation is reduced about 20-fold. Thus, there is an apparent uncoupling of binding/signal transduction when the subunit domains in the single chain are in the α/β orientation. This hypothesis is supported by data that show if the hCG heterodimer contains an α subunit with a deleted 59–87 disulfide bond, this analog stimulated cAMP synthesis to a greater extent than expected based on its low binding affinity (12Furuhashi M. Ando H. Bielinska M. Pixley M.R. Shikone T. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25543-25548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because cysteine residue 87 is at the carboxyl end of the subunit, the data imply that the conformational changes in this region expose determinants that are more efficient in stimulating downstream intracellular signaling reactions compared with the wild type heterodimer. That these α-carboxyl-terminal mutants exhibited signal transduction is not in agreement with a previous study (26Yoo J. Zeng H. Ji I. Murdoch W.J. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13034-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that mutating or deleting carboxyl-terminal amino acids 88–92 of the α subunit abolished adenylate cyclase activation for the hCG heterodimer. One explanation to account for these variances is the use of a different bioassay for assessing signal transduction in that work (26Yoo J. Zeng H. Ji I. Murdoch W.J. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13034-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Gupta and Dighe (27Gupta C.S Dighe R.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) constructed a chimera composed of the α subunit attached to the amino terminus of the β subunit through a single glycine residue linker. The receptor binding of this analog was reduced only 10-fold. Thus, it is apparent from the above studies that the binding affinity of αCGβ is reduced, but there are quantitative differences in the reported binding affinities. The disparity between our αCGβ data and that of Gupta and Sighe (27Gupta C.S Dighe R.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is due to the presence of the glycine linker in their construct, which may have increased the binding affinity. This is analogous to the results seen with αcCGβΔT. Previously, we compared the secretion and biological activity of the CGβα lacking the CTP sequence and FSHβα single chains constructed devoid of a linker (28Sugahara T. Sato A. Kudo M. Ben-Menahem D. Pixley M.R. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10445-10448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We observed that for these variants the secretion rate was substantially reduced, but receptor binding/signal transduction was unaffected. Although absence of the linker sequence in the αCGβ tether lowered the secretion rate, no biological activity was detected. One explanation that could account for these differences is the interference between the adjacent disulfide bonds at the junction between the subunits since the 26–110 disulfide bond in the CGβ subunit (conserved position 20–104 in the FSHβ subunit) is critical for secretion (13Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on chemical modification and mutagenesis studies, it appears that the CGβ carboxyl and α subunit amino-terminal regions do not contain key receptor contact sites (10Furuhashi M. Shikone T. Fares F. Sugahara T. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 54-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fares F.A. Suganuma N. Nishimori K. LaPolt P.S. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Presumably, this accounts for high affinity receptor binding of CGβα devoid of CTP and FSHβα without linker despite their altered secretion kinetics. In the αCGβ single chain, however, there could be a significant perturbation of the last disulfide bridge, i.e. Cys-59–87 in the α subunit and the adjacent amino-terminally located disulfide bond in the β subunit. It is well documented that the 87–92-amino acid sequence in the α subunit is crucial for high affinity receptor binding by the heterodimers (5Charlesworth M.C. McCormick D.J. Madden B. Ryan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chen F. Wang Y. Puett D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 914-919PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ji T. Grossman M. Ji I. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). That the Cys-59–87 bond does not impair secretion or assembly of the wild type heterodimer (12Furuhashi M. Ando H. Bielinska M. Pixley M.R. Shikone T. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25543-25548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) might explain why the monomeric CGβ subunit can form a heterodimer-like complex with αCGβ, yet αCGβ/CGβ is biologically inactive. In the case of the αCGβ/α complex, the carboxyl terminus of the bound monomeric α subunit is free, and thus αCGβ/α binds to the LH/CG receptor and activates adenyl cyclase. Despite the absence of the linker sequence in αCGβ, it is evident that much of the native α subunit structure is intact since it has the capacity to form heterodimeric contacts with the co-transfected CGβ subunit (Table II). The absence of heterodimer-like interactions in αCGβ per se implies that the two domains cannot swivel with respect to each other. The data support the hypothesis that flexibility at the carboxyl end of the α subunit is a critical component for receptor recognition by the single chain variants and by native heterodimers but not for the intracellular behavior of the subunit. The data presented in Fig. 9 suggest that altering the amino end of the CGβ subunit affects the binding affinity. This is consistent with a previous study of Xia et al. (30Xia R. Huang J. Chen T.M. Puett D. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which examined the role of the lysine residue at position 2 in the CGβ subunit. They suggested that the conformation of the amino end might be associated with receptor binding. In another investigation (31Salesse R. Bidart J.M. Troalen F. Bellet D. Garnier J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 68: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1–16 of the CGβ subunit was shown to inhibit binding of 125I-hCG to porcine Leydig cells. Our results also show that the presence of heterodimeric determinants does not necessarily result in a biologically active molecule (TableII), which is in agreement with the report of a naturally occurring mutation in the LHβ gene (32Weiss J. Axelrod L. Whitcomb R.W. Harris P.E. Crowley W.F. Jameson J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). A single amino acid substitution in the LHβ subunit (glutamine to arginine at residue 54) was associated with hypogonadism. It was shown that the mutated subunit formed a heterodimer that did not bind to the receptor in vitro. The uncoupling of a quaternary event and target binding are also supported by recent mutation studies of the Escherichia coli lactose repressor protein (LacI), where it was demonstrated that although assembly and folding of the two functional domains were not significantly affected, their affinity for the DNA target sequence was reduced dramatically (33Falcon C.M. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30849-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with our earlier studies that gonadotropin variants composed of more than 2 subunit domains bind and activate the receptor (21Ben-Menahem D. Hyde R. Pixley M.R. Berger P. Boime I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15070-15077Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). That such variants with bulky constituents relative to the native heterodimer are bioactive implies flexibility in the ligand-receptor interaction. The data show that the relative position of the α- and CGβ-tethered domains in single chain CG is critical for bioactivity but not for secretion. Moreover, since no amino acid mutations were created in the αCGβ molecule, the data imply that receptor binding determinants in this variant are not accessible to the receptor due to an altered conformation or by interference created from the other intrachain β subunit. Thus, quaternary interactions are essential for the intracellular trafficking of the heterodimers but not for receptor recognition and signal activation. In the latter case, the role of the heterodimeric structure is to ensure that the appropriate epitopes in each subunit are brought in contact with the receptor triggering the biological response.

A nucleosome core particle consists of 146 bp1 of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. This octamer is composed of two units each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6988) Google Scholar). Where the DNA exits and enters the nucleosome core particle, one molecule of histone H1 binds to and stabilizes the nucleosome (2Zhou Y.B. Gerchman S.E. Ramakrishnan V. Travers A. Muyldermans S. Nature. 1998; 395: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Actively transcribed genes retain their nucleosomal packaging (see Refs. 3Foe V.E. Wilkinson L.E. Laird C.D.

The nature of this nucleosomal barrier to transcription has been the subject of intense investigation. In vivo the rate of transcription of nucleosome-covered genes by RNA polymerase II is comparable with that of histone-free DNAin vitro (7Ucker D.S. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7416-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8O'Brien T. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3456-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The rate of transcription of nucleosomal templates in vitro, however, is much slower, suggesting that there must be mechanisms in vivo to allow the polymerase to overcome the nucleosomal barrier (9Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been known for many years now that the rate of transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase as well as RNA polymerases I and II on chromatin templates in vitro increases at elevated ionic strength (10Mathis D.J.

Biol. 1979; 128: 411-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) demonstrate that even at 0.5 mNaCl nucleosomes still remain associated with the DNA during transcription. There is no accumulation of nucleosomes in front of the polymerase, indicating that the polymerase does not just push the octamer forward (13Wasylyk B. Thevenin G. Oudet P. Chambon P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 128: 411-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the nucleosomes seem to move relative to their initial positions on the DNA during transcription (14Wasylyk B. Chambon P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here we analyze the mechanism mediating this nucleosome mobility. Previously, we have shown that transcription of mononucleosomal templates by SP6 RNA polymerase results in the transfer of the histone octamer from the promoter-distal end of the template to the promoter-proximal end by the “spooling” mechanism (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Transfer occurs directly, without even transient release of the histone octamer into solution, via the formation of an intranucleosomal loop (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This loop is formed and broken several times during transcription through the nucleosome, and the intermediates formed in the process constitute the barrier to transcription (16Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1995; 83: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Bednar J. Studitsky V.M. Grigoryev S.A. Felsenfeld G. Woodcock C.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have also established that this same mechanism is employed by the eukaryotic yeast RNA polymerase III (18Studitsky V.M. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Felsenfeld G. Science. 1997; 278: 1960-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mechanistic studies of transcription through the nucleosome can be accomplished using the bacteriophage polymerase. In this study, we used SP6 RNA polymerase to transcribe mononucleosomal templates at lower and higher ionic strength in order to determine whether or not the spooling model still applies under conditions where the nucleosome becomes virtually invisible to the RNA polymerase. The relative rates of transcription were analyzed in reactions containing increasing concentrations of salt for both DNA and nucleosomal templates, and transcribed nucleosomal templates were analyzed for nucleosome displacement at both higher and lower ionic strength. We found that the amount of nucleosomal pausing decreases as the salt concentration is increased. As a result, there was an increased rate of transcription through the nucleosome with the increase in ionic strength. Furthermore, efficient histone octamer transfer was observed, even at higher ionic strength. The data indicate that the mechanism of transcription through the nucleosome is still the same under conditions where the nucleosome does not constitute as strong of a barrier to the polymerase. pB22 was digested withSacI and NcoI, and the 227-bp fragment was gel-purified by electroelution from an agarose gel as described (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This fragment was then end-labeled at the NcoI site using Klenow fragment. The plasmid DNA used as competitor was pBS1100 (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). H2A/H2B dimers and H3/H4 tetramers of core chicken erythrocytes histones were purified as described (see Fig.1 B; Ref. 19Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Nucleosomal cores were formed on end-labeled pB22–227-bp fragments using purified chicken erythrocyte core histones at a ratio of ∼0.8:1 (weight to weight) of histones to DNA in a slightly modified version of the protocol used by the Bradbury laboratory (20Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 21Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10275-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, the histones and DNA (8 µg and 10 µg, respectively) were mixed in a final volume of 200 µl in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL, and 2 m NaCl. Dialysis was performed in 1-h steps against the same buffer but containing decreasing amounts of NaCl (2, 1.5, 1, 0.75, and 0.5 m). A final overnight dialysis step was done against the same buffer with only 10 mm NaCl and without IGEPAL. The reconstitute was digested withHaeII, and properly positioned nucleosomes were resolved by preparative native gel electrophoresis and purified as previously described (16Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1995; 83: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). SP6 RNA polymerase was purified as described (22Jorgensen E.D. Durbin R.K. Risman S.S. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final enzyme preparation had a specific activity of 6 × 106 units/mg of protein and was >95% pure as judged by protein electrophoresis (Fig. 1 C). Stalled -C elongation complexes were formed by incubation of 5–20 ng of templates (cores or histone-free DNA isolated from the same native gel) in 10–60 µl of transcription buffer (45 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm spermidine; the ionic strength of the transcription buffer was experimentally determined to be equivalent to 30 mm NaCl based on conductivity) containing 0.5 mm ATP, GTP, UTP (in the case of experiments analyzing the labeled template) or 0.5 mmATP and GTP and 5 µm UTP plus 10 µCi of [α-32P]UTP at 3000 Ci/mmol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (in the case of experiments analyzing the labeled transcripts), 1–5 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 5–40 units of SP6 RNA polymerase for 10 min at room temperature. In control reactions, SP6 RNA polymerase was omitted or terminating nucleotide (3′-dATP; “mock” reactions, final concentration 0.5 mm) were present, as described under “Results.” Then samples were transferred to an ice bath for at least 10 min. For multiple reactions, -C stalled complexes were formed in a single tube and then separated into aliquots (20 µl). After formation of the -C stalled complexes, ice-cold competitor DNA (final concentration 0.05 mg/ml) or NaCl (final concentration 300 mm, added dropwise from 1.5 m stock solution with immediate mixing) were added to some reactions, as described under “Results.” To complete transcription of the templates, the reactions were supplemented with all four NTPs (final concentration 0.5 mm) and incubated on ice for 10 min or other time points indicated in the figures. In the case where labeled transcripts were analyzed, transcription was terminated by the addition of EDTA (to a final concentration of 10 mm). Samples were precipitated and analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In experiments where the labeled template was analyzed, transcription was terminated by adding 3′-dATP to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Reactions were diluted so that the higher ionic strength would not interfere with restriction enzyme digestion, and samples were incubated at 20 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of HaeII restriction enzyme. Digestions were terminated with EDTA (final concentration 10 mm), and samples were analyzed in a native gel as described (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and quantitated using Cyclone (Packard). Kinetic analysis of transcription through the nucleosome by SP6 RNA polymerase at lower (30 mm NaCl), moderate (130 mm NaCl), and higher (330 mmNaCl) ionic strengths was performed using the 227-bp template that was characterized previously (Fig.1 A; (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 16Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1995; 83: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). This template contains an SP6 promoter and a C-less cassette corresponding to the first 14 nucleotides in the transcript. Transcription was initiated at 30 mm ionic strength at room temperature with an NTP mixture consisting of 0.5 mm ATP and GTP and 5 µm [α-32P]UTP. The polymerase stalls at the position where it needs to incorporate CTP (nucleotide 14), and transcription is synchronized on all of the templates. Transcription is resumed at 0 °C by the addition of all four unlabeled NTPs at a final concentration of 0.5 mm each in buffer containing the appropriate salt concentration. Thus, the RNA is labeled only in the first 14 nucleotides, and all of the transcripts in the reaction mix are comparable quantitatively, regardless of their length. Transcription was conducted at 0 °C because the rate of transcription at higher temperatures is too fast to allow reliable analysis of the time course (16Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1995; 83: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The time courses of transcription on the DNA and nucleosomal template at different ionic strengths are shown in Fig.2. As described previously (16Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1995; 83: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), at lower (30 mm NaCl) ionic strength the nucleosome is a strong barrier to the transcribing polymerase. The rates of transcription on the nucleosomal template are much (about five times) slower than those of the naked DNA templates (Fig. 2, A and B; see (16Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1995; 83: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). At the 25-s time point, transcription on the DNA template is complete (with run-off transcripts 194 nucleotides in length), whereas the same time interval for the nucleosomal template yields relatively few run-off transcripts. Most of the polymerase is still paused within the nucleosome. The pausing by polymerase is so severe that many of the transcripts were not completed even at the longest point in the time course (10 min). Experiments with the detergent Sarcosyl, which removes the histones from the DNA but leaves elongation complexes intact and able to complete nascent transcripts, reveal that the polymerase is indeed paused and not in an arrested state or dissociated from the template. After removal of the histones during early time points, the polymerase is able to resume transcription, and the majority of the shorter transcripts are converted to the full-length run-off (Ref. 16Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1995; 83: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholarand data not shown). The rate of transcription of the free DNA slows down with the increasing salt concentration (Fig. 2 C). This effect is minimal as the ionic strength is increased from 30 mm NaCl to 130 mm NaCl but becomes increasingly evident when the salt concentration is raised to 330 mm. This result is especially obvious in the 10-s time points. At 10 s in 30 mm NaCl, some of the transcripts are full-length, whereas at 130 mm NaCl, the longest transcripts are not quite full-length. At 330 mm NaCl, the transcripts are only about half their run-off length. Despite the decrease in the rate of transcription on the DNA templates as the salt concentration increases, the rate of transcription on the nucleosomal templates increases with the increase in ionic strength. Although this effect is weak from 30 to 130 mm NaCl (Fig.2, A and B), the amount of run-off transcript generated from the nucleosomal templates at 330 mm NaCl in 1 min (Fig. 2 C) is much higher than that of the corresponding 30 and 130 mm NaCl points. The nucleosomal pausing at 330 mm NaCl is dramatically decreased, allowing the conversion into run-off transcript. In fact, at 330 mmNaCl, the rates of transcription on the nucleosomal and free DNA templates are very similar. However the residual nucleosome-specific pausing pattern at this ionic strength is very similar to the pausing pattern seen for transcription at lower concentrations of salt. This suggests that the mechanism for transcription through the nucleosome at all of the ionic strengths tested may essentially be the same. We have shown previously that the polymerase pausing is due to difficulty in transcribing the DNA in the “pausing intermediates,” and once the octamer has been transferred, there is no additional barrier for the polymerase (16Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1995; 83: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Bednar J. Studitsky V.M. Grigoryev S.A. Felsenfeld G. Woodcock C.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The increase in ionic strength during transcription led to a decrease in the amount of pausing by the polymerase, suggesting that the intermediates were destabilized or the octamer did not remain associated with the template. We tested whether the nucleosome survived transcription at 330 mm NaCl and whether transfer of the octamer still occurred under these conditions that caused the polymerase to pause less in the nucleosome. The addition of salt to the transcription reaction weakens the electrostatic interactions between the histones and the DNA. Thus, there are a few possible explanations for why the polymerase can more readily transcribe the nucleosomal template at higher ionic strength. First, the nucleosome could be destabilized so much that the passage of the polymerase could cause the octamer to dissociate from the template. Second, the increase in ionic strength could destabilize histone-histone as well as histone-DNA interactions in the nucleosome. The passage of the polymerase could result in formation of a sub-nucleosomal structure (for example, histone hexamer) giving polymerase greater access to the DNA. Alternatively, the histone-DNA electrostatic interactions in the paused intermediates (intermediate2, see Fig. 5) could be weakened enough to allow polymerase to transcribe at much higher rate, but the DNA-histone interactions in the histone octamer transfer intermediate (intranucleosomal DNA loop; intermediate 3, Fig. 5) are still strong enough to allow efficient octamer transfer. Therefore, the nucleosomal barrier would be effectively removed, and the nucleosome-specific pausing by the polymerase would be strongly diminished. To discriminate between these possibilities, the fate of the nucleosome during transcription at lower and higher ionic strength was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the nucleosome remains bound to the template even at higher ionic strength. The nucleosomal templates were labeled at the promoter distal end and analyzed in a nucleoprotein gel before or after transcription. All transcription reactions were initiated at 30 mm NaCl at room temperature with ATP, GTP, and UTP. The polymerase transcribes to the end of the C-less cassette and becomes stalled at nucleotide 14. Transcription was resumed at 0 °C at 30 or 330 mm NaCl in the presence or absence of saturating levels of competitor DNA with the addition of all NTPs. Transcription initiation cannot occur at 0 °C, so only those templates that have active elongation complexes formed on them will be transcribed. In this single-round assay, about 30–50% of the templates are transcribed (17Bednar J. Studitsky V.M. Grigoryev S.A. Felsenfeld G. Woodcock C.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The controls without polymerase and with polymerase but no CTP as well as mock transcription in the presence of a terminating analog of ATP (3′-ATP) show the mobility of the nontranscribed nucleosomal template in a native gel. These nontranscribed controls also reveal the amount of free DNA present in the nucleosome preparation before transcription (25–30% free DNA). The mock transcription controls were performed in the presence of competitor DNA, demonstrating that incubation with competitor DNA does not deplete the nucleosomes from the template, even at the higher ionic strength. When the nucleosomal templates were transcribed at both 30 and 330 mm salt in the absence of competitor DNA, the nucleosomes remained bound to the template, and the mobilities of the nucleosomes in the native gel before and after transcription were very similar. This indicates that the nucleosome has either not moved or that the octamer has been transferred in cis to the promoter distal end, a symmetrical position on the template. The octamer itself has not been disrupted by transcription at the increased salt concentration because a histone hexamer or tetramer would have a different mobility in the native gel (16Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1995; 83: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). There is a slight increase in the amount of free DNA present after transcription at 330 mm salt, indicating that a very small amount of dissociation has occurred. However, this slight increase in free DNA is also seen in the mock control, suggesting that this is probably not a transcription-dependent phenomenon but rather the effect of incubation in the presence of higher salt. The small amount of histone dissociation might occur due to a temporary increase of ionic strength during mixing of the high salt stock solution into the sample. Transcription in the presence of excess unlabeled competitor DNA gives rise to more free DNA at both lower and higher ionic strengths. This increase in the amount of histone-free DNA is entirely transcription-dependent, indicating that the histone octamer has been transferred to unlabeled competitor DNA (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The release of labeled free DNA indicates that nucleosomal templates were efficiently transcribed. Moreover, the amount of labeled DNA released as a result of transcription also allows for an approximate estimation of the fraction of templates that were transcribed. In the presence of excess competitor DNA, ∼70% of the octamers are transferred to the competitor DNA (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the experiments shown in Fig. 3, 30 and 40% of the templates were utilized in the single-round transcription assay at 330 and 30 mm ionic strengths, respectively. Slightly lower nucleosomal template utilization at 330 mm is probably related with partial transcription-independent DNA dissociation from the histone octamer occurring at the higher salt concentration. In summary, the data indicate that nucleosomes almost quantitatively survive transcription at the higher ionic strength. The position of a nucleosome on a template can be determined based on its mobility in the native gel (20Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, this method cannot distinguish between two symmetrically equivalent nucleosome positions, such as those on the promoter-proximal end versus the promoter-distal end of the template. The way to distinguish between the two symmetrical positions is to employ the restriction enzyme sensitivity assay (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). If a nucleosome is positioned over a restriction enzyme site, the enzyme cannot cleave the DNA. We have shown previously that when this 227-bp template is transcribed by SP6 polymerase or RNA polymerase III at physiological ionic strength or lower, the octamer is transferred from the promoter-distal end of the template to the promoter-proximal end over a distance of about 80 bp (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 16Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1995; 83: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Bednar J. Studitsky V.M. Grigoryev S.A. Felsenfeld G. Woodcock C.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Studitsky V.M. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Felsenfeld G. Science. 1997; 278: 1960-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Our 227-bp template is labeled at the promoter-distal end and has a uniquely positioned nucleosome also located at this end. The nucleosome covers a HaeII site (Fig. 1 A). The mobility of the nucleosomal template in a native gel is the same after transcription in 30 mm NaCl as it is without transcription (Fig. 3 B). Before transcription, the template is resistant to cleavage by HaeII (as seen by the retention of label in the nucleosomal band rather than the HaeII fragment band on the native gel). After transcription, the octamer is transferred to the promoter end of the template, making the HaeII site accessible (as seen by the appearance of the label in theHaeII fragment band and the decrease in the amount of label in the nucleosomal band). Note that in Fig. 3 B, transcription and restriction enzyme digestion are performed at 20 °C. Therefore, initiation can occur at any time, leading to a higher efficiency of template utilization as compared with reactions performed at 0 °C. A major fraction of the templates have been transcribed in this experiment. This level of template utilization cannot be achieved during transcription at 330 mm NaCl because the polymerase cannot initiate at this concentration of salt (data not shown). To determine whether the octamer is transferred at higher ionic strength and to be able to directly compare the amount of transfer that occurs (if any) with that at lower ionic strength, transcription was limited to a single round of initiation (Fig.4). Transcription of NcoI end-labeled nucleosomal templates was initiated at room temperature in lower salt in reactions lacking CTP and then resumed at 0 °C in the presence of 30 or 330 mm NaCl with the addition of all NTPs. Initiation cannot occur at 0 °C (data not shown), so the number of transcribed templates should be approximately equal at both high and low salt concentrations. Transcription was terminated with the addition 3′-dATP so that further initiation could not occur in the low salt reaction during incubation with restriction enzyme, and the samples were incubated in the presence or absence of HaeII at 20 °C for 30 min at room temperature. Controls without polymerase and without extension after the formation of early elongation complexes (-C) at 30 mm NaCl show how much free DNA is in the original nucleosome preparation. Mock transcription controls were performed at both 30 and 330 mm NaCl by incubation in the presence of 3′-dATP after the formation of early elongation complexes to prevent further transcription. In these controls, there is 25–30% free DNA. The slight increase in the amount of free DNA at the higher salt concentration is not transcription-dependent. TheHaeII digest of the sample before transcription reveals that the amount of label in the HaeII fragment band is equal to the amount of label in the free DNA band, demonstrating that the nucleosome is at the NcoI end of the template and resistant to cleavage by HaeII. As shown in Fig. 4, transcription at both 30 and 330 mmNaCl yields nucleosomes that have the same mobility after transcription as before transcription. This indicates that the nucleosomes are located on the end of the template. The histone octamer is not disrupted during transcription at higher ionic strength because sub-nucleosomal structures would have a different mobility in the native gel (15Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). There is very little or no free DNA released as a result of transcription, so the histone octamers remain bound to the template during transcription. Digestion with HaeII reveals that some of the octamers have been transferred to the promoter end of the template. The amount of label in the HaeII band after transcription is greater than the amount of label in the free DNA band after transcription, indicating that the nucleosomes have been translocated away from the HaeII site, making this site accessible to the enzyme. The amount of transfer that occurs at 330 mm NaCl and 30 mm NaCl is similar, indicating that transfer can still occur very efficiently when the polymerase transcribes at a more rapid pace through the nucleosome. Since octamer transfer still occurs during transcription at higher ionic strength but polymerase pausing through the nucleosome is diminished, it is likely that the pausing intermediates are destabilized during transcription at higher ionic strength. The mechanism of octamer transfer is just as efficient when the intermediates that cause polymerase to pause during transcription are destabilized and the nucleosome is almost invisible to the polymerase. In summary, we have shown that an increase in ionic strength progressively weakens the nucleosomal barrier to transcription (Fig.2). Although the pausing through the nucleosome is greatly diminished at 330 mm NaCl, the residual pausing pattern at higher ionic strength is very similar to the pattern seen at physiological or lower ionic strength. Thus, the fine structure of the barrier (nucleosome-specific patterns of pausing) remains principally unchanged, even when the barrier is almost undetectable. Since the polymerase pausing pattern reflects the pathway of nucleosome transfer during transcription (16Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1995; 83: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Bednar J. Studitsky V.M. Grigoryev S.A. Felsenfeld G. Woodcock C.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), this suggests that the overall mechanism of nucleosome transfer remains unchanged. Moreover, direct analysis of the fate of the nucleosome during transcription (Figs. 3 and 4) indicates that at lower (30 mm NaCl) and higher (330 mm NaCl) ionic strengths the intact histone octamer is transferred over very similar distances to the promoter-proximal end of the DNA with equal efficiency. Therefore, an increase in ionic strength results in very efficient transcription through the nucleosome accompanied by transfer of the histone octamer. Since the overall mechanism of transcription through the nucleosome is preserved at higher ionic strength, similar intermediates must be formed there. It has been shown previously that the nucleosomal barrier to transcription is formed by the intermediates that are produced when the intranucleosomal loop breaks behind the polymerase before transfer of the octamer is completed (Fig. 5 and see Ref.). They are formed when the DNA, which was partially displaced, is rewrapped along with the polymerase onto the surface of the octamer. The loop collapses in such a way that there are a limited number histone-DNA interactions surrounding the polymerase (40–60 bp in front of and behind the polymerase; Fig. 5, intermediate 2) and presumably interfering with polymerase movement along the DNA. One of these interactions has to be broken to allow further progression of the polymerase. Before histone octamer transfer is completed, the interactions behind the polymerase are preferentially broken (17Bednar J. Studitsky V.M. Grigoryev S.A. Felsenfeld G. Woodcock C.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The amount of DNA-histone contacts behind the polymerase in the intermediates (∼40 bp; intermediate 2) is much less than in the complete nucleosome core (∼150 bp DNA; Ref. 1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6988) Google Scholar). This may explain why a moderate increase in the salt concentration preferentially destabilizes these intermediates but not the complete nucleosome core, which remains intact even at the highest ionic strength used in this work (23Bashkin J. Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1895-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After DNA-histone interactions behind the polymerase are broken, the polymerase escapes from the pause, and transfer intermediates (intermediate 3) are formed again. The diminished pausing of polymerase through the nucleosome at 330 mm NaCl suggests that pausing intermediates which interfere with polymerase progression (intermediate 2) are destabilized to allow for more efficient transcription. These intermediates may be weakened enough to allow the polymerase to more easily escape, or the intranucleosomal loop itself might not collapse as readily under these conditions. Surprisingly, the higher ionic strength does not seem to affect the stability of the transfer intermediates, despite the fact that they consist of a relatively small number of DNA-histone interactions (as compared with the complete nucleosome core). Our results demonstrate that the transfer intermediates are stable enough at higher ionic strength to support efficient translocation of the nucleosome. This suggests that the number of DNA-histone contacts involved in intranucleosomal loop formation could be greater than the number of contacts in the pausing intermediates, thus allowing the transfer intermediate to be more stable at higher ionic strength than the pausing intermediates. Alternatively, the small number of DNA-histone contacts remaining in the transfer intermediate at higher ionic strength could be sufficient for efficient nucleosome translocation. After polymerase transcribes ∼60 bp into the nucleosome, DNA-histone interactions in front of the enzyme are preferentially broken, completing nucleosome translocation (Fig. 5, intermediate 4). In the cell, RNA polymerases must remain processive in the context of chromatin. RNA polymerase II can transcribe chromatin in the cell at a rate of 25 nucleotides/s (7Ucker D.S. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7416-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8O'Brien T. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3456-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but the nucleosome and even the H3/H4 tetramer are absolute blocks to polymerase II transcription in highly purified in vitro systems (9Izban M.G.

Only naked DNA can be transcribed at a physiological elongation rate in vitro, and this only occurs if the reaction is supplemented with elongation factors (reviewed in Refs. 25Shilatifard A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem.

The same elongation factors have no effect on the rate of transcription through nucleosomes, indicating that there are other mechanisms in vivo that help the polymerases transcribe through chromatin (reviewed in Refs. 25Shilatifard A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem.

By increasing the salt concentration of the transcription reactions, we have demonstrated that mononucleosomes can be transcribed at about the same rate as the histone-free DNA templates. Thus, the nucleosome is no longer a strong barrier to the transcribing polymerase under these conditions. Even at a higher rate of transcription, the entire octamer is transferred, suggesting that our model for the mechanism of transcription through the nucleosome is still likely to be accurate at physiological elongation rates. This raises a possibility that thein vivo mechanism for transcription through a nucleosome involves factors that can destabilize the electrostatic interactions between the histones and the DNA, allowing polymerase to overcome the barrier. Destabilization of the arrested intermediates in vivo can be accomplished through several possible means. One mechanism is through the neutralization of the positively charged N-terminal tails of the histones via acetylation, a mechanism that is probably equivalent to the addition of salt to transcription reactions in vitro. The histone-DNA interactions are weakened by such modifications and should presumably have a positive effect on the rate of elongation through the nucleosome. Histone acetyltransferases are known to be associated with elongating RNA polymerases (28Cho H. Orphanides G. Sun X. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 29Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument- Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), indicating that acetylation can play an important role in elongation. Recently, Widom and co-workers (30Protacio R.U. Li G. Lowary P.T. Widom J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8866-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have shown that acetylation of the histone tails increases the rate of transcription on a mononucleosomal template with T7 RNA polymerase. Although this group did not directly determine whether the acetylated octamer was transferred, our results strongly suggest that transfer would occur under these conditions. The facilitation of polymerase progression on these templates is likely due to disruption of the intermediates during transcription through the nucleosome, similar to our results with increased ionic strength. Another possible mechanism for overcoming the nucleosomal barrierin vivo is through protein factors that destabilize the nucleosome itself or the intermediates formed during transcription through the nucleosome. Recently, an elongation factor called FACT has been shown to stimulate transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II on chromatin templates (31Orphanides G. LeRoy G. Chang C.H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 32LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Science. 1998; 282: 1900-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The chromatin remodeling complex, SWI/SNF, is also able to facilitate elongation through nucleosomes (33Brown S.A. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). SWI/SNF promotes nucleosome mobility through the disruption of DNA-histone contacts (34Bazett-Jones D.P. Cote J. Landel C.C. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 35Whitehouse I. Flaus A. Cairns B.R. White M.F. Workman J.L. Owen-Hughes T. Nature. 1999; 400: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and this unwrapping of the DNA from the octamer could help RNA polymerases overcome the nucleosomal barrier. RSC, a related remodeling factor, has been shown to mediate octamer transfer (36Lorch Y. Zhang M. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1999; 96: 389-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and could also facilitate progression of RNA polymerase through nucleosomes. Similarly, the HMG14 protein has been shown to stimulate transcription through chromatin (37Ding H.F. Rimsky S. Batson S.C. Bustin M. Hansen U. Science. 1994; 265: 796-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 proteins may also play a role in the destabilization of transcription intermediates in chromatin. Both genetic studies and biochemical analysis have shown that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 effect elongation (38Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 39Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Recent localization of these factors in association with elongation-competent, phosphorylated RNA polymerase II and throughout the entire genes in transcriptionally active sites on Drosophila polytene chromosomes also supports the idea that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 play roles in elongation through chromatin (40Andrulis E.D. Guzman E. Doring P. Werner J. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2635-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 41Kaplan C.D. Morris J.R. Wu C. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2623-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that higher ionic strength destabilizes the intermediates that cause RNA polymerases to pause and preserves the pathway that leads to octamer transfer. The polymerase is able to transcribe the nucleosome and free DNA templates at nearly equivalent rates, thus recapitulating the highly efficient transcription of chromatin in vivo. Modifications that moderately destabilize the histone-DNA interactions can dramatically stimulate transcription through the nucleosome and allow for efficient octamer transfer. Such destabilization of the intermediates can be accomplished in vivo by a number of possible candidates. We thank Drs. D. Clark, M. Kashlev, M. Kireeva, and L. Lutter for valuable discussions and comments on the manuscript."

The functional significance of the (I/Y)XGG motif, highly conserved among eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases, was analyzed in Ad pol by site-directed mutagenesis of four conserved amino acids. All mutant polymerases could bind primer-template DNA efficiently but were impaired in binding duplex DNA. Three mutant polymerases required higher nucleotide concentrations for effective polymerization and showed higher exonuclease activity on double-stranded DNA. These observations suggest a local destabilization of DNA substrate at the polymerase active site. In agreement with this, the mutant polymerases showed reduced initiation activity and increasedK m(app) for the initiating nucleotide, dCMP. Interestingly, one mutant polymerase, while capable of elongating on the primer-template DNA, failed to elongate after protein priming. Further investigation of this mutant polymerase showed that polymerization activity decreased after each polymerization step and ceased completely after formation of the precursor terminal protein-trinucleotide (pTP-CAT) initiation intermediate. Our results suggest that residues in the conserved motif (I/Y)XGG in Ad pol are involved in binding the template strand in the polymerase active site and play an important role in the transition from initiation to elongation.

At each 5′-end of the adenovirus genome, a terminal protein (TP)1 is covalently linked. Replication initiates via a protein-priming mechanism (1Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 39-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) involving the Ad pol and precursor terminal protein (pTP). Ad pol and pTP form a tight heterodimer of which the pTP acts as a primer and is covalently linked to the initiating nucleotide dCMP. Initiation of replication is catalyzed by Ad pol and can be stimulated by the two cellular transcription factors NFI and Oct-1, which function to recruit and position the pTP-pol complex on the origin of replication (Ref. 2de Jong R.N. van der Vliet P.C. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and references therein). Ad pol initiates replication opposite the fourth base of the template strand and synthesizes a pTP-CAT intermediate. For elongation to occur, this intermediate jumps back to be paired with template residues 1–3, after which pTP dissociates from Ad pol and elongation starts (3King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4King A.J. Teertstra W.R. van der Vliet P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24617-24623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Elongation occurs via a strand displacement mechanism that requires the viral DNA-binding protein (reviewed in Refs. 5Hay R.T. Adenovirus DNA Replication.in: DePamphilis M.L.

Immunol. 1995; 199: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). Late in infection, pTP is cleaved by a virus-encoded protease into TP and the precursor part (reviewed in Refs. 5Hay R.T. Adenovirus DNA Replication.in: DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996Google Scholar and 6van der Vliet P.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). The actual role of pTP processing is at present unclear. Initiation and elongation are performed by the same polymerase, but the two processes differ in sensitivity to inhibitors (7Nagata K. Guggenheimer R.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Sussenbach J.S. van der Vliet P.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1984; 109: 53-73PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that a conformational change occurs upon transition from initiation to elongation, most likely after the formation of pTP-CAT. In agreement with this notion, kinetic studies revealed that the K m for dCTP is lower for initiation than for elongation (9Mul Y.M. van der Vliet P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition to its synthetic activities, Ad pol also possesses a distributive 3′–5′-exonuclease activity, shown to be involved in proofreading (10King A.J. Teertstra W.R. Blanco L. Salas M. van der Vliet P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Many DNA polymerases have been characterized and were generally found to have a polymerase and a 3′–5′-exonuclease activity. Sequence comparisons of DNA polymerases from bacterial, viral, and cellular origin led to a classification into four groups, A, B (also known as α-like), C, and D, based on amino acid similarities withEscherichia coli pol I, II, and III, and human DNA pol β (11Braithwaite D.K. Ito J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 12Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P.

Based on their extent of similarity, six highly conserved motifs (I–VI), which were proposed to lie in the polymerase active site, were identified in human pol α (14Wong S.W. Wahl A.F. Yuan P.M. Arai N. Pearson B.E. Arai K. Korn D. Hunkapiller M.W. Wang T.S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). DNA polymerases containing these six motifs (see Fig. 1) were designated α-like DNA polymerases (12Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Further alignments showed that motifs I–III are conserved in all groups of DNA polymerases (12Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), while a seventh conserved motif was identified in the α-like DNA polymerases (15Hwang C.B. Ruffner K.L.

Besides conserved motifs located in the C-terminal part of DNA polymerases, three sequence motifs (Exo I–III) were shown to form an evolutionary conserved 3′–5′-exonuclease site (17Blanco L.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), has shown that residues located in conserved motifs of these different DNA polymerases play similar roles in dNTP or DNA binding or in catalysis of polymerase or 3′–5′-exonuclease activity. Analysis of a number of DNA polymerases suggests that the polymerase active site is structurally and functionally conserved for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA polymerases (24Wang J. Sattar A.K.

They are all proposed to utilize an identical two-metal ion-catalyzed polymerase mechanism but differ extensively in many of their structural features (29Steitz T.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 299: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) are topologically similar to this DNA polymerase. Ad pol is an α-like DNA polymerase belonging to the subclass of protein-priming DNA polymerases. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified motif I as a motif important for initiation and elongation activity of Ad pol (32Joung I. Horwitz M.S. Engler J.A. Virology. 1991; 184: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two putative zinc finger domains were identified (33Joung I. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5788-5796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and linker mutagenesis studies have shown that multiple regions, including motifs IV and V, in Ad pol are essential for Ad DNA replication (34Roovers D.J. Overman P.F. Chen X.Q. Sussenbach J.S. Virology. 1991; 180: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 35Roovers D.J. van der Lee F.M. van der Wees J. Sussenbach J.S. J.

Recently, a set of 22 alanine substitutions of conserved residues in the C-terminal part of Ad pol suggests an arrangement of conserved motifs in Ad pol similar to RB69 DNA polymerase (37Liu H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11681-11689Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An additional motif, YXG(G/A), located N-terminal of motif II (12Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 18Blanco L. Bernad A. Blasco M.A. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) of the polymerase active site, was shown to be highly conserved among α-like DNA polymerases (38Truniger V. Lazaro J.M. Salas M. Blanco L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3430-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of this motif in φ29 DNA polymerase, which starts replication by protein-priming, led to the proposal that it is involved in the binding stability of the DNA template at the polymerization active site (38Truniger V. Lazaro J.M. Salas M. Blanco L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3430-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was shown to be important for the formation of a stable complex between TP and DNA polymerase, resulting in transition defects from TP priming to DNA priming during replication of φ29 TP-DNA (39Truniger V. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A multiple alignment of the YXG(G/A) motif in eukaryotic-type DNA-dependent DNA polymerases has been shown previously by Truniger et al. (38Truniger V. Lazaro J.M. Salas M. Blanco L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3430-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic-type DNA polymerases, the motif has the consensus sequence YXG(G/A), but for the subclass of protein-primed DNA polymerases, the motif could be restricted to the consensus YXGG. For these DNA polymerases, including Ad pol, the highly conserved tyrosine residue is often an isoleucine. This led us to define the motif as (I/Y)XGG. Here, we report the detailed characterization of the (I/Y)XGG motif in Ad pol, which has been subjected to site-directed mutational analysis. We propose that the motif is involved in the stabilization of the template strand at the polymerase active site. During pTP-primed initiation, this indirectly affects the binding of the initiating nucleotide, as well as the transition of the initiation intermediate pTP-CAT from initiation to elongation, thereby leading to abortive replication. Based on the crystal structure of RB69, modeled with primer-template and dNTP, we propose a hydrophobic interaction between the conserved isoleucine and the ribose moiety of the nucleotide preceding the template base. All oligonucleotides, unlabeled nucleotides, [α-32P]dNTPs (3000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. T30 (5′-AATCCAAAATAAGGTATATTATTGATGATG) represents the first 30 nucleotides of the bottom strand of the adenovirus 5 genome, and T20 represents the first 20. D20 (5′-CATCATCAATAATATACCTT) is the complementary strand of T20. Labeling of D20 was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [γ-32P]ATP. D20 was used for the 3′–5′-exonuclease assay on ssDNA. For the polymerase/exonuclease coupled assay, gel retardation, and 3′–5′-exonuclease assay on dsDNA, 5′-labeled D20 was hybridized to T30 or to T20. The hybrid molecules D20/T30 and T20/D20 were obtained by boiling oligonucleotides in 60 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. D20/T30 and D20/T20 were purified by 10% polyacrylamide-1× TBE gel electrophoresis. Ad 5 TP-DNA was isolated as described (40Coenjaerts F.E. van der Vliet P.C.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange method from Stratagene. The oligonucleotides for the polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis were as follows: for R661A, 5′-ATGCTGGCGGCCACGTAATCG and 5′-CGATTACGTGGCCGCCAGCAT; for I664S, 5′-TCTTCCACCGCGGGAGCTGGCG and 5′- CGCCAGCTCCCGCGGTGGAAGA; for I664Y, 5′-TCTTCCACCGCGGTAGCTGGCG and 5′-CGCCAGCTACCGCGGTGGAAGA; for G666A/G667A, 5′-GTAGCATCTTGCAGCGCGGATGCTC and 5′-GAGCATCCGCGCTGCAAGATGCTAC, with changes marked boldface type. The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed by complete sequencing of each mutant gene. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac competent cells, which contain the bacmid with a mini-attTn7 target site and a helper plasmid. The mini-Tn7 element on the pFastBac plasmid can transpose to the mini-attTn7 target site on the bacmid in the presence of transposition proteins provided by the helper plasmid. Colonies containing recombinant bacmids were identified by disruption of thelacZα gene. Bacmid DNA was isolated by means of a high molecular weight minipreparation. This DNA was then used to transfect insect cells with Lipofectin (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's manual. After 72 h of transfection, the recombinant baculoviruses were harvested and amplified for several rounds. Insect cells (Sf-9) were grown as monolayers on 167.5-cm2 plates in SF900 II medium (Life Technologies) at 27 °C. Plates were infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing the wild-type or mutant Ad pol when ∼80% confluence was reached. After 56 h of infection, cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in a hypotonic lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 µg/ml leupeptin and placed on ice. After 10 min, cells were disrupted by 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (B pestle), and NaCl was added to a final concentration of 200 mm. The lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm in a SW28 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. For purification to near homogeneity, the lysate was loaded on a SP-Sepharose column, equilibrated with buffer A (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT) containing 200 mm NaCl. The column was washed extensively with buffer A, 200 mm NaCl and eluted with buffer A, 450 mm NaCl. Fractions were collected and analyzed on a 7.5% polyacrylamide, SDS gel followed by silver staining. Peak fractions were collected; dialyzed against buffer A, 100 mm NaCl; and loaded on a ssDNA-cellulose column (Sigma). After washing with buffer A, 150 mm NaCl, protein was eluted at 600 mmNaCl. Peak fractions were dialyzed against buffer B (25 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT) containing 100 mm NaCl and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing with buffer B, 100 mm NaCl, protein was eluted in a gradient of buffer B, 100–500 mm NaCl. Peak fractions were collected, and the purity of the protein was estimated to be >95% by gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. pTP was a gift from Panagiotis N. Kanellopoulos. ΔN-DNA-binding protein was purified as described (42Dekker J. Kanellopoulos P.N. Loonstra A.K. van Oosterhout J.A. Leonard K. Tucker P.A. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The buffer used for dilution of the replication proteins contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 120 mm NaCl, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). Partial duplex D20/T30 containing a stretch of 10 nucleotides protruding from the 5′-end was used as primer-template to study DNA-dependent DNA polymerization and 3′–5′-exonuclease activity. The reaction mixture (12.5 µl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.05 ng of 5′-labeled D20/T30, 12.5 ng of wild-type or mutant DNA polymerase, and the indicated amounts of dNTPs. Reactions were stopped after 10 min at 37 °C by the addition of sequencing loading buffer (10 mm EDTA, 98% formamide, and 0.025% bromphenol blue). Samples were analyzed on 8 m urea-20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Polymerization or 3′–5′- exonuclease activity were detected as an increase or decrease in size, respectively, of the 5′-labeled D20 primer. Exonucleolytic breakdown of ssDNA and dsDNA was tested using 5′-labeled D20 and 5′-labeled D20/T30, respectively. The reaction mixture (25 µl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 ng of ssDNA or dsDNA, and the reaction was started by the addition of 25 ng of wild-type polymerase or mutant polymerases. Incubation was at 37 °C, allowing conditions to be linear both in time and enzyme concentration. Reactions were stopped by the addition of sequencing loading buffer. After analysis by 8 m urea-20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the 3′–5′-exonuclease activity is measured as a decrease in size of the DNA by densitometry. From these data, the catalytic efficiency of the mutants (indicated in Table II) was calculated relative to wild-type Ad pol.Table IIProtein-primed activities of Ad wild-type and mutant polymerasesPolymeraseInitiation activity2-aData taken from initiation reactions on T30 and TP-DNA (the natural viral template) under standard conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Numbers in parentheses indicate the percentage of activity in the presence of 10 µm unlabeled dCTP.

Open table in a new tab The assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Gel retardation was performed using 5′-labeled D20/T30 and 5′-labeled D20/T20. The binding reaction (20 µl) contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 4% Ficoll, 1 mm EDTA, 55 mm NaCl, 4 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 ng of either 5′-labeled D20/T30 or 5′-labeled D20/T20, and the indicated amounts of Ad pol or the corresponding mutants. After incubation for 5 min at 4 °C, samples were loaded and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide-1× TBE gel at 4 °C. Gels were dried, autoradiographed, and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Initiation of replication was performed in a standard incubation mixture of 25 µl in the presence of 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 µg of BSA, 50 nm [α-32P]dCTP, and the indicated amounts of Ad pol and pTP. As template, either 0.6 µg of origin-containing T30 or 60 ng of TP-DNA were used. When TP-DNA was used, 250 ng of ΔN-DNA-binding protein was added per reaction. Initiation coupled to partial/truncated elongation was performed under similar conditions as initiation in the presence of the indicated concentrations of dCTP, dATP, and dTTP. No dGTP was added in the reaction mixture. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 45 min and were stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 80 mm. The samples were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid on ice. Precipitates were washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in sample buffer, analyzed on an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel, and autoradiographed. Replication products were quantified by densitometric analysis following exposure on a PhosphorImager. The K m(app) for pTP deoxynucleotidylation was determined by performing initiation assays with [α-32P]dCTP with wild-type and mutant polymerases using increasing concentrations of unlabeled dCTP (1–1000 µm). The K m(app) was calculated from three experiments. The standard incubation mixture (200 µl) for glycerol gradient analysis contained 2 µg of Ad pol, 1.2 µg of pTP, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, and NaCl to a final concentration of 55 mm. After incubation for 30 min on ice, the mixture was layered on top of a 4.8-ml linear 10–30% (v/v) glycerol gradient containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, and 100 µg of BSA as an internal control. Gradients were centrifuged for 24 h at 50,000 rpm in a SW50 rotor at 4 °C. A control gradient with 1.2 µg of pTP was run under similar conditions. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed on an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel. BSA was visualized by silver staining, and pTP, Ad pol, and the pTP-pol complex were visualized by immunoblotting using an anti-pol and anti-pTP-pol antiserum (43Coenjaerts F.E. van Oosterhout J.A. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5401-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) Quantitation of the relative amounts of pTP and pol present in each fraction was carried out by densitometry. In order to understand the role of the (I/Y)XGG motif in Ad pol, individual residues of this region were mutated (Fig.1) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The isoleucine was changed into tyrosine (I664Y) as present in RB69, φ29, and most other cellular, bacterial, and viral DNA polymerases (39Truniger V. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and also into serine (I664S) to study the effect of another nonconservative change. The two glycines are invariantly conserved among protein-primed DNA polymerases but the second glycine is often an alanine among bacterial, viral, and many cellular DNA polymerases (39Truniger V. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both glycines were changed into alanines, giving mutant polymerase G666A/G667A. A positive charge preceding the (I/Y)XGG motif (Arg661) appears to be specifically conserved among protein-primed and cellular DNA polymerases (38Truniger V. Lazaro J.M. Salas M. Blanco L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3430-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and was changed into alanine (R661A). Construction of baculoviruses and expression and purification of the recombinant proteins was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” During purification, all mutant polymerases behaved essentially as wild-type Ad pol. A polymerase/exonuclease coupled assay was performed to study the coordination of both degradative and polymerization activities with the mutant polymerases. The functional coupling between synthesis and degradation on primer-template D20/T30 was assayed as a function of the dNTP concentration. As shown in Fig.2, 3′–5′-exonucleolytic digestion of the primer strand occurred in the absence of nucleotides. By the addition of increasing amounts of dNTPs, the equilibrium was shifted toward synthesis, exonucleolysis being competed by DNA polymerization. In the presence of 25 nm dNTPs, the wild-type Ad pol was able to extend D20/T30 until 27–28 nucleotides, and from 125 nmdNTPs full extension of the primer-template was accomplished (D30/T30). Whereas mutant polymerase R661A allowed full polymerization at approximately similar nucleotide concentrations as the wild-type enzyme (125 nm, Fig. 2), mutant polymerases I664S and I664Y required a 5-fold higher amount (Fig. 2 and TableI). On the other hand, mutant polymerase G666A/G667A required a 200-fold higher dNTP concentration compared with the wild-type enzyme for full polymerization (Fig. 2 and Table I). Furthermore, an increased exonuclease activity was observed for mutant polymerases I664S, I664Y, and G666A/G667A upon comparison of their degradation activities (Fig. 2, 0 nm lanes) with that of the wild-type polymerase, as can be seen by the higher intensity of the faster moving bands. The higher amount of dNTPs, required to fully elongate the primer-template for these three mutant polymerases, might be explained, at least partially, by their higher exonuclease activity. The 3′–5′-exonuclease activity was therefore determined on both ssDNA and dsDNA, and the results are quantified in Table I. Indeed, the exonuclease activity on primer-template DNA was increased for mutant polymerases I664S, I664Y, and G666A/G667A (TableI). Degradation of ssDNA by all mutant polymerases was slightly lower than that by the wild-type polymerase and proceeded in a distributive manner. An increased exonuclease activity on primer-template DNA might be the result of a lower DNA binding stability o"

In this study we asked whether ligand-stimulated PDGF β-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, to some extent, also involved reduced susceptibility to tyrosine dephosphorylation. To investigate this possibility we compared the sensitivity of ligand-stimulated and non-stimulated forms of tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF β-receptors to dephosphorylation using various preparations containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. Ligand-stimulated or unstimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors were obtained after incubation of cells with pervanadate only or pervanadate, together with PDGF-BB, respectively. Dephosphorylation of receptors immobilized on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, as well as of receptors in intact cell membranes, was investigated under conditions when rephosphorylation did not occur. As compared with unstimulated receptors the ligand-stimulated PDGF β-receptors showed about 10-fold reduced sensitivity to dephosphorylation by cell membranes, a recombinant form of the catalytic domain of density-enhanced phosphatase-1, or recombinant protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B.

Ligand binding of RTKs often leads to dimerization and subsequent increases in autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular portion of the receptors (reviewed in Refs. 1Heldin C.-H.

The mechanism whereby ligand-induced dimerization stimulates these phosphorylation events is incompletely understood but may involve a conformational change of the receptor or a proximity effect. RTK net tyrosine phosphorylation is not only controlled by the receptor kinase activity but is also determined by the action of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Accumulating evidence suggest that PTPs are regulatory components of RTK signaling pathways.

In this study we set out to investigate the possibility that reduced susceptibility to PTP action contributes to ligand-induced increases in net tyrosine phosphorylation of RTKs. The well characterized PDGF β-receptor was chosen as a prototype dimerization-activated receptor tyrosine kinase. The autophosphorylation sites of the PDGF β-receptor have been extensively studied and include a regulatory site, Tyr857, as well as numerous sites, which in their phosphorylated form act as binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins including c-Src, phospholipase C-γ, and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-kinase) (reviewed in Ref. 13Heldin C.-H. Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). To study the effects of ligand stimulation on PTP sensitivity, preparations of tyrosine-phosphorylated ligand-stimulated and unstimulated PDGF β-receptors were obtained. Using these preparations we demonstrate that ligand-stimulated forms of the PDGF β-receptor display a reduced susceptibility to dephosphorylation, as compared with unstimulated forms. Parental PAE cells and PAE cells stably transfected with PDGF β-receptor (14Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Morén A. Severinsson L. Ek B. Östman A. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.-H. Mol. Cell.

After overnight incubation in serum-free Ham's F-12, supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA, PAE/PDGFβR cells were left unstimulated or treated with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 60 min on ice, with 100 µm pervanadate for 30 min at 37 °C and 60 min on ice, or with pervanadate for 30 min at 37 °C and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB, in the presence of pervanadate, for 60 min on ice. After stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS. Ligand-receptor complexes were cross-linked by incubation in 1 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate for 1 h on ice. After incubation with 70 mm methylammonium chloride for 10 min, cell lysates were prepared by lysis in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.15 mNaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Trasylol (Bayer), and 100 µm Na3VO4 for 15 min at 4 °C. After elution with 0.3 m N-acetylglucosamine, PDGF β-receptors were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the rabbit antiserum PDGFR-3 (14Claesson-Welsh L.

Biol. 1988; 8: 3476-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and the phosphotyrosine antibody PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For detection of PDGF β-receptor associating proteins, cells were lysed as described above and immunoprecipitated with the PDGF receptor antiserum CED raised against a peptide corresponding to the five carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the PDGF β-receptor. Immunoprecipitated PDGF β-receptor was detected with P-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Coprecipitating tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the phosphotyrosine antibody PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and coprecipitating p85 was detected by a rabbit antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology). Cells were stimulated, and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Lysates were incubated with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose (EC Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 4 °C overnight and then incubated in 15 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The pellets were washed five times with lysis buffer without Na3VO4 and once in a buffer containing 25 mm imidazol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The samples were incubated at 37 °C with vigorous agitation for 15 min with a recombinant form of DEP-1, composed of an amino-terminal glutathioneS-transferase domain, a DEP-1 portion encompassing human DEP-1 amino acids 997–1337, and a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin tag or with recombinant PTP1B. To stop the dephosphorylation reaction, the samples were washed once with lysis buffer containing 100 µm Na3VO4and then eluted with overnight incubation at 4 °C in 0.3m N-acetylglucosamine (Sigma) in the presence of 3 µm PDGF receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1296 (16Kovalenko M. Gazit A. Böhmer A. Rorsman C. Rönnstrand L. Heldin C.-H. Waltenberger J. Böhmer F-D. Levitzki A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6106-6114PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with a rabbit antiserum against the PDGF β-receptor for 2 h at 4 °C and then with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with lysis buffer and once with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, the precipitates were heated for 3 min at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the rabbit antiserum PDGFR-3 or the phosphotyrosine antibody PY99. After overnight incubation in serum-free Ham's F-12, supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA, PAE/PDGFβR cells were treated with pervanadate for 30 min at 37 °C and 60 min on ice or with pervanadate for 30 min at 37 °C and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB, in the presence of pervanadate, for 60 min on ice and washed with ice-cold PBS and collected in 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. The cells were pelleted and incubated in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1% Trasylol) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were homogenized with 80 strokes in a Dounce homogenizor, and the nuclei were pelleted at 3000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 25 min. The membranous sediments were resolved in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm DTT and 3 µm AG1296 using a syringe with a 0.6 × 26-mm needle and incubated with 15 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. Preparations were kept at −80 °C until use. To obtain PTP activity containing membranes to be used in dephosphorylation reactions, membranous sediments from unstimulated parental PAE cells were prepared by hypotonic lysis and centrifugation, as described above. After centrifugation, membranes were resuspended in a buffer containing 25 mm imidazol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 10 mm DTT. For the dephosphorylation assay, PAE/PDGFβR membranes containing 10 mg of protein were mixed with membranes from parental PAE cells for 10 min at 37 °C during vigorous agitation or incubated with recombinant DEP-1 for 15 min at 4 °C. The dephosphorylation was stopped by addition of 100 µmNa3VO4 and an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, the PDGF β-receptor was immunoprecipitated with PDGFR-3 antiserum, followed by immunoblotting with the PDGF β-receptor antibody P-20 or the phosphotyrosine antibody PY99. [32P]Orthophosphate peptide mapping was performed essentially as described (17Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To obtain tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of ligand-stimulated and unstimulated PDGF β-receptors, PAE cells stably transfected with the human PDGF β-receptor (PAE/PDGFβR cells) were treated with pervanadate with or without PDGF-BB. To investigate whether receptors occurred as monomers or dimers after stimulation with PDGF-BB alone, pervanadate alone, or pervanadate, together with PDGF-BB, cross-linking of cell-surface proteins was performed, and WGA-Sepharose fractions were isolated. After elution with N-acetylglucosamine, PDGF β-receptors were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1,lower panel, dimeric receptors were recovered from cells stimulated with PDGF-BB, or pervanadate and PDGF-BB, but not from cells stimulated with pervanadate only. Furthermore, treatment with pervanadate only and pervanadate combined with PDGF-BB yielded receptors that were tyrosine-phosphorylated to the same extent, as determined by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 1, upper panel). To determine the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation of the ligand-stimulated and unstimulated receptor preparations, in vivo 32P-labeled receptors were isolated by immunoprecipitations and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 2A). No major differences were seen in the autophosphorylation patterns after the different stimulations. To characterize the pattern of association of SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules with the PDGF β-receptor after stimulation with pervanadate alone, or pervanadate and PDGF-BB, PDGF β-receptor was immunoprecipitated and subjected to immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine antibody, PDGF β-receptor antiserum, and p85 antiserum (Fig.2 B). With the exception of a component of 120 kDa, found exclusively coprecipitating with the ligand-stimulated receptor, both stimulations induced a similar pattern of PDGF β-receptor-coprecipitating tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig.2 B, top panel). The tyrosine-phosphorylated component with an apparent molecular mass of about 200 kDa was recognized by an antibody to the PDGF β-receptor (Fig. 2 B,second panel from the top). Furthermore, equal amounts of p85 subunit of PI3-kinase coprecipitated with the PDGF β-receptor after incubation with pervanadate alone and pervanadate and PDGF-BB (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). In conclusion, stimulation with pervanadate only, or pervanadate and PDGF-BB, yields PDGF receptors that display similar patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation and substrate association but differ with regard to occurrence as receptor dimers. To compare the susceptibility of unstimulated and ligand-stimulated PDGF β-receptors to dephosphorylation, WGA-Sepharose fractions from cells stimulated with pervanadate alone or pervanadate, together with PDGF-BB, were isolated. To avoid dephosphorylation mediated by PTPs present in the WGA-Sepharose fractions, these were inactivated by incubation with the alkylating agent iodoacetamide. After washes in vanadate-free buffers, the WGA-Sepharose fractions were subsequently mixed with the recombinant catalytic domain of DEP-1, a receptor-like PTP (Fig.3A), or recombinant PTP1B (Fig. 3 C). The dephosphorylation reaction was stopped by addition of vanadate. After elution of receptors withN-acetylglucosamine, receptors were immunoprecipitated and subjected to phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3, incubation of WGA-Sepharose-immobilized PDGF β-receptors with either PTP1B or DEP-1 led to a dose-dependent dephosphorylation. However, both when PTP1B and when DEP-1 were used as the source of PTP activity, 10–100-fold larger amounts were required for dephosphorylation of ligand-stimulated receptors as compared with unstimulated receptors. It is unlikely that the more abundant phosphorylation of ligand-stimulated receptors is because of rephosphorylation in trans by the kinases in the ligand-induced receptor dimer, because the analysis was done in the absence of ATP. Moreover, the same difference in susceptibility to dephosphorylation of ligand-stimulated receptors as compared with monomers was seen when the dephosphorylation was performed in the presence of the PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor AG1296 (data not shown). Together, these experiments demonstrate that ligand-stimulated forms of PDGF β-receptors, when immobilized on WGA-Sepharose, display a reduced susceptibility to tyrosine dephosphorylation as compared with unstimulated forms. To investigate the sensitivity of unstimulated and ligand-stimulated PDGF β-receptors to the action of PTPs in a more physiological setting, their dephosphorylation in intact cell membranes was investigated. After stimulation of PAE/PDGFβR cells with pervanadate only or pervanadate, together with PDGF-BB, membrane fractions were isolated and incubated with iodoacetamide to irreversibly block PTP activity in the membrane preparations. Membranes containing unstimulated and ligand-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF β-receptors were then incubated with either membrane preparations from untransfected PAE cells or with recombinant DEP-1 (Fig. 4). Dephosphorylation was stopped by addition of vanadate, and the tyrosine phosphorylation status of PDGF β-receptors was determined by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of receptors immunoprecipitated from membrane lysates (Fig. 4, A and B). Ligand-stimulated PDGF β-receptors displayed a reduced susceptibility to dephosphorylation as compared with the unstimulated form. Whereas 100 µg of PAE membranes was required for 50% dephosphorylation of ligand-stimulated receptors, 10 µg of PAE membranes led to more than 50% dephosphorylation of unstimulated receptors (Fig. 4 A). A similar tendency was observed when recombinant DEP-1 was used as source of PTP-activity (Fig. 4 B). We thus conclude also that in intact cell membranes ligand-stimulated PDGF β-receptors are more resistant to PTP-mediated dephosphorylation as compared with unstimulated PDGF β-receptors. Our results clearly demonstrate that ligand-stimulated forms of the PDGF β-receptor display a reduced susceptibility to dephosphorylation by PTPs in vitro and suggest a novel mechanism contributing to the increased receptor tyrosine phosphorylation occurring after ligand stimulation. The mechanism(s) underlying the difference between ligand-stimulated and unstimulated receptors with regard to dephosphorylation susceptibility remains to be clarified. The characterization of the receptors with regard to tyrosine phosphorylation pattern did not reveal any major differences (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, analysis by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of receptors after dephosphorylation indicated that dephosphorylation occurred of most sites (data not shown). This argues against the possibility of the difference being because of the presence of particular ligand-induced phosphatase-resistant sites in ligand-stimulated receptors. In contrast, a clear difference between the two receptor preparations was detected when they were analyzed with regard to occurrence as cross-linkable receptor dimers (Fig. 1). This suggests that dimerization might underlie differences in dephosphorylation sensitivity. At least two principally different mechanisms whereby dimerization can affect sensitivity to PTPs can be envisioned; dimeric forms of the receptors can be intrinsically poorer substrates for PTPs, or alternatively, the difference between monomeric and dimeric forms could be caused by modulation of PTP activity. The latter possibility could involve an association with dimeric receptors of a PTP inhibitor or an association with monomeric receptors of a PTP activator. Earlier studies have demonstrated H2O2 production and subsequent inhibition of PTP activity, following stimulation with PDGF or EGF (18Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar, 19Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). The PDGF-stimulated H2O2production was recently shown to be dependent upon PI3-kinase activation (20Bae Y.S. Sung J.-Y. Kim O.-S. Kim Y.J. Hur K.C. Kazlauskas A. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10527-10531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Although similar amounts of PI3-kinase were found associated with the monomeric and dimeric forms of the receptor in our study, the possibility that the difference in dephosphorylation between monomeric and dimeric receptors is caused by trans-inhibition of PTPs should be further studied. In this context, identification of the 120-kDa component, which was exclusively detected in immunoprecipitates of ligand-stimulated receptors (Fig. 2 B), appears as an important goal for future studies. Accumulating evidence suggests that PTPs act as negative regulators of ligand-activated tyrosine kinase receptors (15Östman A. Böhmer F.-D. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 258-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). There are also some indications suggesting that modulation of PTP activity is involved in ligand-independent activation of tyrosine kinase receptors. For example, UV-induced increase in EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation is caused by reduced receptor-directed PTP activity, rather than increased tyrosine kinase activity (21Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In agreement with this notion, a direct inhibitory effect by UV light on the specific activities of PTP-α, PTP-ς, DEP-1, and SHP-1 have recently been demonstrated (22Gross S. Knebel A. Tenev T. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Herrlich P. Böhmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26378-26386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the findings of the present paper, thus suggest important functions for PTPs in controlling activation, as well as inactivation, of both unoccupied and ligand-occupied tyrosine kinase receptors.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GutR is a 95-kDa protein (829 amino acids) with several putative motifs including an N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding, Walker motifs A and B for a nucleotide-binding site, and several C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats for possible intra- and intermolecular interactions (5Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of any ligand, purified GutR in the concentration range of 0.5 to 5 µm exists in the monomeric form. It binds specifically to a single 29-base pair imperfect inverted repeat located upstream (−78 to −50 with +1 as the transcription start site) of the gut promoter both in vitro and in vivo (6Ye R. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Poon K.K.H. Chen C.-L. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9620-9625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The half-life of the GutR·DNA complex is in the range of 6.8 min at 25 °C in the absence of glucitol (7Poon K.K.H. Chen C.-L. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9620-9625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In considering B. subtilis as a soil microorganism living in an environment with limited nutrients available most of the time, a generation time of 380 min or longer is not uncommon for this organism under such growth conditions. Consequently, a half-life of 6.8 min of the complex is considered insignificant relative to the generation time of this organism. In sharp contrast, GutR binds to its target site with a half-life of longer than 19 h in the presence of glucitol (7Poon K.K.H. Chen C.-L. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9620-9625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This effect is glucitol specific and affects only the off-rate but not the on-rate of the binding reaction. It is interesting to know why such tight binding is necessary? Can GutR in the presence of glucitol be able to release from its binding site? In this study, glucitol is found to induce GutR to have a conformational change which allows the subsequent binding of ATP to GutR. The tight binding of glucitol·GutR to DNA allows this complex to have plenty of time to bind ATP. Binding of ATP triggers GutR to have another conformational change and GutR is now able to dissociate from its target site with a half-life of 274 min. If ATP is replaced by ADP, GutR can dissociate from its target site at an even faster rate and the half-life of the GutR·DNA complex under this condition is 82 min. AMP seems unable to bind to the glucitol·GutR complex. A working model describing the initial steps that lead to the GutR mediated transcription activation is presented. This procedure is modified from Zhong and Tai (8Zhong X. Tai P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified GutR (1 µg), [γ-32P]ATP (1µCi, 3,000Ci/mmol) with or without glucitol (or other sugars/sugar alcohols) were added to a binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) in a final volume of 20 µl in a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. A series of binding reactions was set up and the final concentrations of glucitol in these tubes ranged from 0 to 2%. ATP molecules bound to GutR were UV cross-linked to GutR by short-wave length UV using a handheld UV lamp (model UVGL-25, UVP, Inc., Upland, CA) positioned 2 cm above the microcentrifuge tubes with the lips open for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by termination of the UV irradiation and the addition of an equal volume of sample loading buffer for SDS-PAGE.1 Samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The radioactivity of the dried gel was monitored using the Fuji MacBas 1000 phosphorimaging system. Trypsin digestion was done at room temperature in a total volume of 200 µl. Trypsin (type II-S from Sigma, Canada) was prepared in 0.1 nm HCl at 1 mg/ml and divided into 10 µl/microcentrifuge tube. The enzyme was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C until use. Four µg of GutR and 0.1 µg of trypsin were used in the reaction. The conditions for each digestion reaction were identical with respect to time, buffer components, and GutR concentration. The variable manipulated was the ligand added. These ligands included glucitol, xylitol, mannitol, glucose, ATP, ADP, and AMP. The final concentrations of sugar/sugar alcohols and nucleotides were 2% and 1 mm, respectively. In a digestion mixture, 20 µl of sample was removed at each time point (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 40, and 60 min) after the addition of trypsin and placed in a new microcentrifuge tube containing 1 mmPefabloc (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Quebec, Canada), a serine protease inhibitor. After a 2-min reaction to stop the trypsin digestion, each sample was mixed with the sample loading buffer and boiled for 3 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For regular Western blot analyses, proteins were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane as previously described (9Wu X.-C. Nathoo S. Pang A.S.H. Carne T. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6845-6850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GutR was probed with GutR-specific polyclonal antibodies (diluted 1,000-fold) prepared from mice using purified GutR as the antigen. The bound GutR antibodies were detected by anti-mouse antibodies that have been conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Ontario, Canada). For N-terminal sequence determination of the trypsin-digested GutR fragments, the digestion mixtures were applied to a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The resolved protein bands were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Ltd., Ontario, Canada) as described previously (9Wu X.-C. Nathoo S. Pang A.S.H. Carne T. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6845-6850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of particular tryptic fragments was determined using a gas phase sequencer at the Protein Microchemistry Center of the University of Victoria. The sequence of the first five residues from each fragment was determined. To change Asp-288 in GutR to alanine, a 1.4-kilobase KpnI-NdeI fragment containing the 5′ end region of gutR was isolated from pUB18P43GUTR (7Poon K.K.H. Chen C.-L. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9620-9625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and subcloned to the E. coli bluescript vector pBS to generate pBSGUTRN. This step was necessary to make theSalI site in this fragment to be a unique site. Plasmid pBSGUTRN was used as the template and inverse polymerase chain reaction (10Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) was performed using a pair of primers, MDB (5′-CAGTATCAATGCTGGCAACGATCAG-3′) and GUTRBF (5′-GTCTTGCACTGTAAGTACTTAAA-3′) to change Asp-288 (GAC) to alanine (GCC). One of the resulting mutated vectors was selected for further characterization and was designated pGutRM. Since SalI andPstI sites are the unique restriction enzyme sites that are flanking the mutagenic site, sequence between these two sites was determined to confirm that the mutation was introduced at the proper position and no unexpected mutation was introduced to this sequence. The SalI-PstI fragment carrying the mutation was isolated from pGutRM and was applied to replace the equivalent fragment from pBSGUTRN to generate pGUTRM2. By this approach, the 1.4-kilobaseKpnI-NdeI fragment in pGUTRM2 carried only the expected mutation. This 1.4-kilobase fragment from pGUTRM2 was isolated to replace the equivalent fragment from pUB18P43GUTR to generate the final construct pUB18P43GUTR(D288A). GutR was overproduced and purified fromB. subtilis WB600[pUB18P43GutR] as described (7Poon K.K.H. Chen C.-L. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9620-9625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For polymerase chain reactions, plasmid isolation from bothEscherichia coli and B. subtilis, transformation and bacterial cultivation, conditions as previously described (9Wu X.-C. Nathoo S. Pang A.S.H. Carne T. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6845-6850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were followed. Sample preparation for the β-galactosidase assays was prepared by the method described by Ye and Wong (5Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were performed in three independent trials. Gel mobility shift analysis and determination of kinetic parameters for GutR to bind to its target DNA in the presence of various ligands using the BIAcore X biosensor (BIACore Inc.) were determined as described previously (7Poon K.K.H. Chen C.-L. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9620-9625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar,11O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GutR has a putative nucleotide-binding domain (5Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether GutR can bind nucleotide, this possibility was examined via a UV cross-linking study with [γ-32P]ATP under various conditions. As shown in Fig.1, in the absence of glucitol, GutR showed a weak cross-linking with [γ-32P]ATP at the basal level (lane 5). In contrast, higher levels of cross-linking of [γ-32P]ATP to GutR could be observed in the presence of glucitol. The degree of cross-linking depended on the concentration of glucitol and reached the peak level in the presence of 0.5–1% glucitol. This peak level (lanes 7–9) was about 10 times higher than the basal cross-linking level (lanes 4 and 5). Three independent binding studies were performed and a consistent 6–10-fold increase in cross-linking could be observed in the presence of glucitol at a concentration of 0.5% or higher. To further determine the specificity of the glucitol-mediated ATP binding to GutR, the effects of xylitol, mannitol, and glucose were examined. The effect mediated by 2% xylitol, a 5-carbon sugar alcohol, was minimal (lane 2). A more obvious effect was observed in the presence of mannitol, a 6-carbon epimer of glucitol at the C-2 position. However, even at a final concentration of 2%, the stimulated ATP binding to GutR (lane 3) was weaker than that mediated by 0.05% glucitol. In the presence of 2% glucose (lane 4), the degree of cross-linking was comparable to the basal level. All these data indicate that GutR can bind ATP in a glucitol-dependent manner and this effect is relatively glucitol specific. To gain information concerning the specificity of the nucleotide-GutR interaction, UV cross-linking of [γ-32P]ATP to GutR was performed in the presence of excess cold competing nucleotide (1 mm). As shown in Fig. 1, ATP (lane 10) and GTP (lane 13) were the most effective competitors while CTP (lane 12) showed some degree of competition. In contrast, UTP was not an effective competitor even at such a high final concentration (lane 11). Since GutR can bind ATP to a significant level only in the presence of glucitol, it is logical to predict that binding of glucitol to GutR can induce GutR to have a conformational change. To examine this possibility, limited trypsin digestion of GutR in the presence or absence of various ligands was studied. The first step in this study was to establish an optimal trypsin-to-GutR weight ratio to generate tryptic fragments that could be monitored in a reasonable time frame. This ratio was established to be 1:40. In the absence of ligands, GutR was cleaved by trypsin to a 75-kDa fragment in 18–24 min (Fig.2 A). This species was resistant to further digestion. In contrast, GutR became highly susceptible to protease digestion in the presence of glucitol. Several clusters of bands were generated with time. After a 60-min digestion, two clusters of bands remained to be dominant (Fig. 2 B). A doublet designated “a” and a triplet designated “b” with the apparent molecular masses around 55 and 45 kDa, respectively, were observed. These two clusters could be observed more obviously by the Western blot analysis as shown in Fig. 2 C. The difference in the digestion profiles of GutR in the presence or absence of glucitol indicates that GutR can bind glucitol and there is a conformational change in GutR after glucitol binding. This conformational change was relatively glucitol specific. Addition of glucose, galactose, mannitol, or xylitol to GutR at a final concentration of 2% failed to show any significant changes in both the pattern and the kinetics of the GutR digestion profiles relative to those observed for GutR in the absence of any ligand. A typical digestion profile for GutR in the presence of glucose is shown in Fig. 2 D. In the presence of ATP, the tryptic digestion pattern of GutR was similar to that observed for GutR in the absence of any ligand (data not shown). This suggests that, in the absence of glucitol, ATP cannot bind to GutR and thus does not affect the GutR conformation. This observation was consistent with the observation of the UV cross-linking study which indicated that ATP could bind to GutR only when glucitol was present. To determine whether ATP can induce the glucitol·GutR complex to have a conformational change, different concentrations (1 nm, 1 µm, 10 µm, 100 µm, and 1 mm) of ATP were added to glucitol·GutR. At low concentration (1 nm) of ATP, both the pattern and kinetics of digestion profile of GutR were the same as those for GutR in the presence of glucitol. However, different digestion patterns were observed with the ATP concentration ranging from 1 µm to 1 mm. Since the microbial physiological cellular concentration of ATP ranges from 1 to 5 mm (12Chapman A.G. Atkinson D.E. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1977; 15: 253-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the tryptic digestion profile of the gluctiol·GutR complex in the presence of 1 mm ATP is presented in Fig.3 A. Under this condition, two sets of bands were observed. The first set was a doublet with the intact 95-kDa GutR protein as the major band. The second set was a 75-kDa GutR fragment. Even with a 60-min tryptic digestion, the intact form (95 kDa) of GutR still represented the dominant band. These data indicate that ATP indeed can bind to the glucitol·GutR complex to trigger GutR to have another conformational change. In this case, GutR adopts a more compact conformation so that it is more resistant to trypsin digestion. Consistent with the UV cross-linking experiments, GTP at a final concentration of 1 mm could also induce glucitol·GutR to adopt the trypsin resistant conformation almost as well as ATP (Fig. 3 B) while CTP could offer only some degree of protection (Fig. 3 C). In the presence of glucitol, addition of AMP (1 mm) to GutR did not protect GutR from trypsin digestion (data not shown). Both the kinetics and digestion profiles were similar to those observed for GutR in the presence of glucitol (i.e. with 55- and 45-kDa fragments as the major bands) suggesting that AMP either cannot bind to GutR even in the presence of glucitol or that it binds but fails to trigger a conformational change in GutR. Fig. 3 D shows the digestion profile of GutR in the presence of both glucitol and ADP, wherein a major band of a 75-kDa fragment and a minor band of a 95-kDa GutR were seen. This indicated ADP could bind to glucitol·GutR. Since the major band is a 75-kDa fragment which is similar to that observed for GutR in the absence of glucitol, it is tempting to speculate that binding of ADP to GutR may cause the dissociation of glucitol from the ADP·glucitol·GutR complex. Three major GutR fragments were isolated for N-terminal sequence determination. They were the 75-kDa fragment generated by digestion of GutR in the absence of any ligand and one of the doublet (55 kDa) and one of the triplet (45 kDa) fragments generated by the tryptic digestion of GutR in the presence of glucitol. The first 5 amino acids from each of these fragments were determined (Fig.4 A). The 75-kDa fragment was found to miss the first 145 amino acids from the N-terminal region which contained the putative helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding. If this is the only exposed tryptic cleavage site in GutR under this condition, the C-terminal GutR fragment (amino acid residues 146–829) that shows resistance to trypsin should have a theoretical molecular mass of 79 kDa. It is not sure whether this 75-kDa fragment has an apparent molecular mass less than the actual one or there is at least one extra cleavage at the C-terminal region. The 55- and 45-kDa fragments were missing both the putative DNA- and ATP-binding sites (Fig. 4 A). If there are no extra exposed trypsin cleavage sites at the C-terminal end of GutR, the theoretical molecular masses of these two fragments should be 59 and 50 kDa, respectively. Both the 75- and 45-kDa fragments were generated by trypsin digestion. However, the 55-kDa fragment was likely to be generated by chymotrypsin contaminated in the trypsin preparation since the cutting site was between Tyr-322 and Arg-323. We have previously demonstrated that GutR can bind to its target site in the absence of glucitol (7Poon K.K.H. Chen C.-L. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9620-9625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of glucitol, the glucitol·GutR complex binds to its target sequence so tight that the off-rate is not measurable using the BIAcoreX biosensor. The on-rate for the binding reaction is not changed significantly whether glucitol is present or not. It would be interesting to examine whether nucleotides would have any effect on the GutR-DNA interaction. As shown in Table I, both the on-rate and off-rate of GutR to its target sequence in the presence of 1 mm ATP without any glucitol were comparable to those observed for GutR in the absence of glucitol. Once again, these data strengthen the idea that ATP cannot bind to GutR in the absence of glucitol. In contrast, in the presence of 2% glucitol and 1 mm ATP, GutR was able not only to bind to but also to dissociate from its target DNA. Although the on-rate was not changed significantly in comparison with other conditions, the off-rate of the ATP·glucitol·GutR ternary complex from its target site became measurable. In comparison with the off-rate of the GutR·DNA complex in the absence of any ligand, it was about 40 times lower. Replacement of ATP with GTP got comparable results (TableI). All these data indicate that GutR can bind ATP and GTP in the presence of glucitol. If ATP was replaced by ADP, dissociation of the ADP·glucitol·GutR ternary complex from the GutR-binding site was even faster than that of the ATP·glucitol·GutR·DNA complex.

To determine whether ATP plays a role in the GutR-mediated transcription activation, the conserved aspartic residue in the putative motif B (5Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar) of the ATP-binding site in GutR (Fig. 4) was changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The expression vector pUB18P43GUTR(D288A) for the production of GutR(D288A) was transformed into B. subtilis WB1104. This strain is a derivative of WB1101 which has the chromosomal gutR inactivated (5Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WB1104 carries a gut-lacZ cassette (6Ye R. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) integrated in theamyE locus in the genome. This gut-lacZ cassette has the regulatory region of the gut operon including thegut promoter fused to the promoterless lacZreporter gene. WB1104 carrying a plasmid vector (pUB18-P43) without any gutR insert served as a negative control. When cultivated in a defined medium in the presence of 2% glucitol (5Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its β-galactosidase activity was 0.963 ± 0.086 Miller units. WB1104[pUB18P43GUTR] which overproduced GutR from the expression vector showed a high β-galactosidase activity (452 ± 12 Miller units). In contrast, WB1101[pUB18P43GUTR(D288A)] showed an 83% reduction in β-galactosidase activity (79 ± 8 Miller units) in reference to that of WB1104[pUB18P43GUTR]. Since SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the cellular levels of GutR and GutR(D288A) from WB1104[pUB18P43GUTR] and WB1104[pUB18P43GUTR(D288A)], respectively, were comparable (data not shown), the observed low β-galactosidase activity was not because of the low-level production of GutR(D288A). This result suggests that ATP is required for the GutR mediated transcription activation. Induction of the glucitol operon in B. subtilisrequires both GutR, the transcription activator, and glucitol. Our previous studies demonstrate that one of the functional roles of glucitol is to induce GutR to bind tightly to its target site upstream of the gut operon with a half-life of 19 h or longer. In this study, another important functional role of glucitol is identified. GutR is shown to be a nucleotide-binding protein. It binds ATP and GTP more efficiently than CTP and has low or poor binding capability to UTP. This nucleotide binding capability is dependent on the presence of glucitol. GutR has to bind glucitol first. Subsequently, the glucitol·GutR complex has the capability to bind ATP as illustrated by the UV cross-linking experiments. The idea for sequential binding is further supported by both the limited trypsin digestion experiments and the biosensor studies. The ATP induced changes in both the GutR conformation and the off-rate of GutR·DNA complex can be observed only in the presence of glucitol. There are two possible models to explain the observed glucitol-dependent ATP binding in GutR. In the first model, the ATP-binding site in GutR is not preformed. The binding of glucitol to GutR is required to induce GutR to have a conformational change so that critical residues involved in ATP binding can be positioned in proper locations. A similar mechanism has been observed for a transcription regulator, BirA, in E. coli. BirA, a bifunctional protein, serves as a repressor for the biotin biosynthetic operon as well as an enzyme for protein biotinylation with both biotin and ATP as the substrates (14Barker D.F. Campbell A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 451-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Buoncristiani M.R. Howard P.K. Otsuka A.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography studies show that the ATP-binding site in BirA is not preformed in the absence of biotin (16Wilson K.P. Shewchuk L.M. Brennan R.G. Otsuka A.J. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). After the binding of biotin to BirA, key residues involved in ATP binding are repositioned and BirA gains the ATP binding capability. In the second model, the ATP-binding site in GutR is preformed. However, this site is not accessible for nucleotide binding because of the physical blockage by other domains in GutR. Binding of glucitol to GutR induces GutR to have a conformational change so that the ATP-binding site is now exposed and becomes accessible for ATP binding. This situation is similar to that observed in XylR, a transcription activator that mediates the expression of genes involved in toluene biodegradation in Pseudomonas putida (17Marques S. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this case, binding of the inducer, m-xylene, to the N-terminal reception domain in XylR exposes the ATP-binding site at the central domain and allows XylR to bind and hydrolyze ATP. Deletion of this N-terminal domain results in the constitutive expression of the toluene biodegradation operon (18Pérez-Martı́n J. De Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Pérez-Martı́n J. De Lorenzo V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9392-9396Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A combination of these two models (i.e. physical blockage of a non-preformed ATP-binding site by other domains from GutR in the absence of glucitol) can also be possible (Fig. 4 B). To differentiate these models, x-ray crystallographic studies of GutR in the presence and absence of glucitol may provide insightful information. Besides BirA and XylR, GutR is another transcription regulator that binds the inducer/substrate and ATP in a sequential manner. Although GutR shares similarities to transcription activators such as MalT (20Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Boos W. Bohm A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and AcoK (22Peng H.L. Yang Y.H. Deng W.L. Chang H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1497-1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the 100-kDa transcription activator family in terms of their size, ATP binding capability, and the ability to activate transcription from the major RNA polymerase rather than the ς54 containing RNA polymerase, none of the members in this family has been shown to bind the inducer and ATP in a sequential order. In fact, MalT binds ATP even in the absence of maltotriose (23Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). GutR contains 100 sites that can potentially be cleaved by trypsin if all these sites are exposed. In the absence of glucitol, cleavage mainly occurs in site A (Fig. 4 A). The expected cleavage products are the 16-kDa fragment corresponding to the first 145 amino acids from the N-terminal region of GutR and the 79-kDa C-terminal fragment. The observation of the 79-kDa GutR fragment indicates most, if not all, of the sequence between residue 146 and residue 829 forms a tightly folded structure. This includes the putative ATP-binding site with the Walker motif A (residues 200–207) and Walker motif B (residues 283–291). In contrast, in the presence of glucitol, tryptic cleavages occur in many sites with sites B and C as two of the dominant cleavage sites (Fig. 4 A). It is particularly interesting to note that cleavage site B (between residues 322 and 323) is only 31 residues downstream from the putative motif B of the ATP-binding site. This provides appealing evidence to suggest that glucitol induces GutR to have a conformational change and the ATP-binding site in GutR is now more accessible. In combination with the UV cross-linking experiments, the tryptic digestion experiments provide a mechanistic basis to explain the observed glucitol dependence for GutR to bind ATP. These data also provide insights to explain the properties of thegutR1 mutant (2Gay P. Chalumeau H. Steinmetz M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). gutR1 contains a single point mutation (Cys to Ala) that results in a substitution of serine 289 to arginine (5Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation is located within the putative motif B region of the ATP-binding site. This gutR1 mutant can constitutively turn on the gut operon even in the absence of glucitol (2Gay P. Chalumeau H. Steinmetz M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that this mutation induces a conformational change in GutR1 and allows this protein to bind ATP in the absence of glucitol. Binding of ATP to glucitol·GutR induces the complex to have another conformational change. The entire ATP·glucitol·GutR ternary complex forms a compact structure which is resistant to trypsin digestion as illustrated in Fig. 3 A. Unlike the glucitol·GutR·DNA complex, the ATP·glucitol·GutR·DNA complex at least can dissociate from the gutR-binding site (t 12 = ∼274 min). For the case of the ADP·glucitol·GutR complex, it can dissociate from thegutR-binding site even faster (t 12 = 82 min). This suggests that different forms of nucleotide can play a role in modulating the affinity of the GutR·DNA complex. A weak ATPase activity was observed from our purified GutR preparation. However, the possibility for this activity to be derived from other contaminated ATPases cannot be eliminated. In all these binding reactions, the on-rates were not significantly changed and only the off-rates were affected (Table I). Since GutR adopts a different conformation under each condition, the degree of interaction between GutR and its target site via hydrogen bonding and other noncovalent interactions can be different. This can provide a possible explanation for the observation changes in off-rate under each situation. To illustrate that ATP really plays a role in the GutR mediated transcription activation, the conserved aspartic acid residue (Asp-288) in the putative motif B of GutR (5Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was mutated. A typical motif B sequence in a nucleotide-binding protein contains four hydrophobic residues followed by a conserved aspartate residue (13Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). Structural studies of several nucleotide-binding proteins (24Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 25Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 26Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) suggest that this conserved aspartate and a serine or threonine residue in the Walker motif A are the two key residues to stabilize Mg2+in the Mg2+·ATP or Mg2+·GTP complex. This Mg2+ ion is essential for hydrolysis of ATP or GTP (27Schweins T. Scheffzek K. Assheuer R. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,28Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17439-17444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, mutation of this conserved aspartate in the nucleotide binding pocket of E. coli DnaA (29Mizushima T. Takaki T. Kubota T. Tsuchiya T. Miki T. Katayama T. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20847-20851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Salmonella typhimurium NtrC (30Rombel I. Peters-Wendisch P. Mesecar A. Thorgeirsson T. Shin Y.K. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to abolish the nucleotide binding capability of DnaA and the ATPase activity of NtrC, respectively. In the cases of the high affinity ATP-binding sites in both B. subtilis and E. coli SecA (28Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17439-17444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), equivalent mutations reduce both the ATP binding affinity and the ATPase activity. Because of the important role of this residue in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, aspartate 288 in GutR was changed to alanine. GutR(D288A) was produced at a high level from a high-copy number plasmid and its production level was comparable to that of the wild type GutR. However, the low transcription activation capability of GutR(D288A) in vivo suggests that ATP plays an important role in the GutR mediated transcription activation. In the case ofE. coli MalT (23Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), only ATP binding but not hydrolysis is required for the formation of open complex. Transcription activation mediated by Rhodobacter capsulatus NtrC also requires only ATP binding but not hydrolysis (31Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1884-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, NtrC from enteric bacteria requires both ATP binding and hydrolysis for transcription activation (32Wedel A. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2042-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since the gut promoter has an unusually short spacer (15 base pairs rather than 17 base pairs) between the −35 and −10 hexameric sequences (6Ye R. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that GutR may use the energy from ATP to realign the −35 and −10 elements in the proper relative orientation so that this promoter can be recognized by RNA polymerase. Further characterization of different ATP-binding site mutants would provide insights to understand this transcription activation process. A working model that shows the early steps in the GutR mediated transcription activation is summarized in Fig. 4 B. In this process, glucitol, the inducer, plays a vital role. It binds to GutR and induces GutR to change its conformation and adopt a more open structure. This leads to two significant consequences. First, GutR binds tightly its target site. This provides plenty of time for GutR to bind the second ligand, ATP. Second, under this condition, GutR is in the appropriate conformation to bind ATP. ATP binding, hydrolysis, or a combination of both can turn GutR to the active state to function as the transcription activator. We thank Chyi-Liang Chen for the preparation of figures."
