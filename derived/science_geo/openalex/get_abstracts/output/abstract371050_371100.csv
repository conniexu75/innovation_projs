https://openalex.org/W2047360542,"Salis et al. design precisely tuned ribosome binding sites that allow rational control over the rate of protein translation. This technology should facilitate the design of synthetic genetic circuits and metabolic pathways. Microbial engineering often requires fine control over protein expression—for example, to connect genetic circuits1,2,3,4,5,6,7 or control flux through a metabolic pathway8,9,10,11,12,13. To circumvent the need for trial and error optimization, we developed a predictive method for designing synthetic ribosome binding sites, enabling a rational control over the protein expression level. Experimental validation of >100 predictions in Escherichia coli showed that the method is accurate to within a factor of 2.3 over a range of 100,000-fold. The design method also correctly predicted that reusing identical ribosome binding site sequences in different genetic contexts can result in different protein expression levels. We demonstrate the method's utility by rationally optimizing protein expression to connect a genetic sensor to a synthetic circuit. The proposed forward engineering approach should accelerate the construction and systematic optimization of large genetic systems."

Spermidine prevents early oxidative stress and necrotic cell death and increases the expression of autophagy genes by inhibiting histone acetyltransferases action on histone H3. Ageing results from complex genetically and epigenetically programmed processes that are elicited in part by noxious or stressful events that cause programmed cell death. Here, we report that administration of spermidine, a natural polyamine whose intracellular concentration declines during human ageing, markedly extended the lifespan of yeast, flies and worms, and human immune cells. In addition, spermidine administration potently inhibited oxidative stress in ageing mice. In ageing yeast, spermidine treatment triggered epigenetic deacetylation of histone H3 through inhibition of histone acetyltransferases (HAT), suppressing oxidative stress and necrosis. Conversely, depletion of endogenous polyamines led to hyperacetylation, generation of reactive oxygen species, early necrotic death and decreased lifespan. The altered acetylation status of the chromatin led to significant upregulation of various autophagy-related transcripts, triggering autophagy in yeast, flies, worms and human cells. Finally, we found that enhanced autophagy is crucial for polyamine-induced suppression of necrosis and enhanced longevity."
https://openalex.org/W2150170782,"Matthew Meyerson and colleagues report that SOX2, which encodes a transcription factor necessary for normal esophageal development, is an amplified lineage survival oncogene in lung and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Lineage-survival oncogenes are activated by somatic DNA alterations in cancers arising from the cell lineages in which these genes play a role in normal development1,2. Here we show that a peak of genomic amplification on chromosome 3q26.33 found in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the lung and esophagus contains the transcription factor gene SOX2, which is mutated in hereditary human esophageal malformations3, is necessary for normal esophageal squamous development4, promotes differentiation and proliferation of basal tracheal cells5 and cooperates in induction of pluripotent stem cells6,7,8. SOX2 expression is required for proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of lung and esophageal cell lines, as shown by RNA interference experiments. Furthermore, ectopic expression of SOX2 here cooperated with FOXE1 or FGFR2 to transform immortalized tracheobronchial epithelial cells. SOX2-driven tumors show expression of markers of both squamous differentiation and pluripotency. These characteristics identify SOX2 as a lineage-survival oncogene in lung and esophageal SCC."
https://openalex.org/W2100064861,"The nucleus basalis is thought to regulate arousal and attention via release of acetylcholine in the cortex. Here the authors report that nucleus basalis stimulation in rats results in a decorrelation between visual cortical neurons as a result of activation of cortical muscarinic receptors and an increase in the reliability of responses to natural scenes as a result of more distributed changes along the visual pathway. The nucleus basalis of the basal forebrain is an essential component of the neuromodulatory system controlling the behavioral state of an animal and it is thought to be important in regulating arousal and attention. However, the effect of nucleus basalis activation on sensory processing remains poorly understood. Using polytrode recording in rat visual cortex, we found that nucleus basalis stimulation caused prominent decorrelation between neurons and marked improvement in the reliability of neuronal responses to natural scenes. The decorrelation depended on local activation of cortical muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, whereas the increased reliability involved distributed neural circuits, as evidenced by nucleus basalis–induced changes in thalamic responses. Further analysis showed that the decorrelation and increased reliability improved cortical representation of natural stimuli in a complementary manner. Thus, the basal forebrain neuromodulatory circuit, which is known to be activated during aroused and attentive states, acts through both local and distributed mechanisms to improve sensory coding."

https://openalex.org/W1993145412,"The development of the brain requires the exquisite coordination of progenitor proliferation and differentiation to achieve complex circuit assembly. It has been suggested that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) acts as an integrating molecule for multiple proliferation and differentiation signals because of its essential role in the RTK, Wnt and Shh signaling pathways. We created conditional mutations that deleted both the alpha and beta forms of GSK-3 in mouse neural progenitors. GSK-3 deletion resulted in massive hyperproliferation of neural progenitors along the entire neuraxis. Generation of both intermediate neural progenitors and postmitotic neurons was markedly suppressed. These effects were associated with the dysregulation of beta-catenin, Sonic Hedgehog, Notch and fibroblast growth factor signaling. Our results indicate that GSK-3 signaling is an essential mediator of homeostatic controls that regulate neural progenitors during mammalian brain development."

https://openalex.org/W2135783707,"Synthetic gene circuits are often engineered by considering the host cell as an invariable 'chassis'. Circuit activation, however, may modulate host physiology, which in turn can substantially impact circuit behavior. We illustrate this point by a simple circuit consisting of mutant T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP*) that activates its own expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli. Although activation by the T7 RNAP* is noncooperative, the circuit caused bistable gene expression. This counterintuitive observation can be explained by growth retardation caused by circuit activation, which resulted in nonlinear dilution of T7 RNAP* in individual bacteria. Predictions made by models accounting for such effects were verified by further experimental measurements. Our results reveal a new mechanism of generating bistability and underscore the need to account for host physiology modulation when engineering gene circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2065105749,"Dilys Parry and colleagues show that duplications of the T gene confer susceptibility to familial chordoma, a cancer of presumed notochordal origin. The T gene product, known as brachyury, is a transcription factor that plays an important role in notochord development. Using high-resolution array-CGH, we identified unique duplications of a region on 6q27 in four multiplex families with at least three cases of chordoma, a cancer of presumed notochordal origin. The duplicated region contains only the T (brachyury) gene, which is important in notochord development and is expressed in most sporadic chordomas. Our findings highlight the value of screening for complex genomic rearrangements in searches for cancer-susceptibility genes."
https://openalex.org/W1990048226,"Mutations of the ubiquitin ligase parkin account for most autosomal recessive forms of juvenile Parkinson's disease (AR-JP). Several studies have suggested that parkin possesses DNA-binding and transcriptional activity. We report here that parkin is a p53 transcriptional repressor. First, parkin prevented 6-hydroxydopamine-induced caspase-3 activation in a p53-dependent manner. Concomitantly, parkin reduced p53 expression and activity, an effect abrogated by familial parkin mutations known to either abolish or preserve its ligase activity. ChIP experiments indicate that overexpressed and endogenous parkin interact physically with the p53 promoter and that pathogenic mutations abolish DNA binding to and promoter transactivation of p53. Parkin lowered p53 mRNA levels and repressed p53 promoter transactivation through its Ring1 domain. Conversely, parkin depletion enhanced p53 expression and mRNA levels in fibroblasts and mouse brains, and increased cellular p53 activity and promoter transactivation in cells. Finally, familial parkin missense and deletion mutations enhanced p53 expression in human brains affected by AR-JP. This study reveals a ubiquitin ligase-independent function of parkin in the control of transcription and a functional link between parkin and p53 that is altered by AR-JP mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2077060638,"Tyrosine kinase receptors represent targets of great interest for cancer therapy. Here we show, for the first time, the importance of the orphan tyrosine kinase receptor, ROR2, in melanoma progression. Using melanoma tissue microarrays, we show that ROR2 is expressed predominantly in metastatic melanoma. As ROR2 has been shown to specifically interact with the non-canonical Wnt ligand, Wnt5A, this corroborates our earlier data implicating Wnt5A as a mediator of melanoma metastasis. We show here that increases in Wnt5A cause increases in ROR2 expression, as well as the PKC-dependent, clathrin-mediated internalization of ROR2. WNT5A knockdown by siRNA decreases ROR2 expression, but silencing of ROR2 has no effect on WNT5A levels. ROR2 knockdown does, however, result in a decrease in signaling downstream of Wnt5A. Using in vitro and in vivo metastasis assays, we show that ROR2 is necessary for the Wnt5A-mediated metastasis of melanoma cells. These data imply that ROR2 may represent a novel target for melanoma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2064165635,"A screen for suppressors of breast to lung metastasis leads to the identification of KLF17 (Krüppel-like transcription factor 17), which is shown to be downregulated in breast cancer biopsies. KLF17 inhibits epithelial–mesenchymal transition and invasion by inhibiting the transcription of the metastasis factor Id1. Metastasis is a complex multistep process, which requires the concerted action of many genes and is the primary cause of cancer death. Both pathways that regulate metastasis enhancement and those that regulate its suppression contribute to the tumour dissemination process. To identify new metastasis suppressors, we set up a forward genetic screen in a mouse model. We transduced a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) library into the non-metastatic 168FARN breast cancer cell line and orthotopically transplanted the cells into mouse mammary fat pads. We then selected cells that could metastasize to the lung and identified an RNAi for the KLF17 gene. Conversely, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of KLF17 in a highly metastatic 4T1 breast cancer cell line inhibits the ability of cells to metastasize from the mammary fat pad to the lung. We also show that suppression of KLF17 expression promotes breast cancer cell invasion and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and that KLF17 protein functions by directly binding to the promoter region of Id1 (which encodes a key metastasis regulator in breast cancer) to inhibit its transcription. Finally, we demonstrate that KLF17 expression is significantly downregulated in primary human breast cancer samples and that the combined expression pattern of KLF17 and Id1 can serve as a potential biomarker for lymph node metastasis in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2004088511,"Lewis lung carcinoma-derived high metastatic A11 cells constitutively overexpress hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha mRNA compared with low metastatic P29 cells. Because A11 cells exclusively possess a G13997A mutation in the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) gene, we addressed here a causal relationship between the ND6 mutation and the activation of HIF-1alpha transcription, and we investigated the potential mechanism. Using trans-mitochondrial cybrids between A11 and P29 cells, we found that the ND6 mutation was directly involved in HIF-1alpha mRNA overexpression. Stimulation of HIF-1alpha transcription by the ND6 mutation was mediated by overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways. The up-regulation of HIF-1alpha transcription was abolished by mithramycin A, an Sp1 inhibitor, but luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that Sp1 was necessary but not sufficient for HIF-1alpha mRNA overexpression in A11 cells. On the other hand, trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, markedly suppressed HIF-1alpha transcription in A11 cells. In accordance with this, HDAC activity was high in A11 cells but low in P29 cells and in A11 cells treated with the ROS scavenger ebselene, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and the PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220. These results suggest that the ROS-generating ND6 mutation increases HIF-1alpha transcription via the PI3K-Akt/PKC/HDAC pathway, leading to HIF-1alpha protein accumulation in hypoxic tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2102514367,"Background The lack of a suitable animal model to study viral and immunological mechanisms of human dengue disease has been a deterrent to dengue research. Methodology/Principal Findings We sought to establish an animal model for dengue virus (DENV) infection and immunity using non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency interleukin-2 receptor γ-chain knockout (NOD-scid IL2rγnull) mice engrafted with human hematopoietic stem cells. Human CD45+ cells in the bone marrow of engrafted mice were susceptible to in vitro infection using low passage clinical and established strains of DENV. Engrafted mice were infected with DENV type 2 by different routes and at multiple time points post infection, we detected DENV antigen and RNA in the sera, bone marrow, spleen and liver of infected engrafted mice. Anti-dengue IgM antibodies directed against the envelope protein of DENV peaked in the sera of mice at 1 week post infection. Human T cells that developed following engraftment of HLA-A2 transgenic NOD-scid IL2rγnull mice with HLA-A2+ human cord blood hematopoietic stem cells, were able to secrete IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α in response to stimulation with three previously identified A2 restricted dengue peptides NS4b 2353(111–119), NS4b 2423(181–189), and NS4a 2148(56–64). Conclusions/Significance This is the first study to demonstrate infection of human cells and functional DENV-specific T cell responses in DENV-infected humanized mice. Overall, these mice should be a valuable tool to study the role of prior immunity on subsequent DENV infections."
https://openalex.org/W2031235464,"Background Carbonyl derivatives are mainly formed by direct metal-catalysed oxidation (MCO) attacks on the amino-acid side chains of proline, arginine, lysine and threonine residues. For reasons unknown, only some proteins are prone to carbonylation. Methodology/Principal Findings We used mass spectrometry analysis to identify carbonylated sites in: BSA that had undergone in vitro MCO, and 23 carbonylated proteins in Escherichia coli. The presence of a carbonylated site rendered the neighbouring carbonylatable site more prone to carbonylation. Most carbonylated sites were present within hot spots of carbonylation. These observations led us to suggest rules for identifying sites more prone to carbonylation. We used these rules to design an in silico model (available at http://www.lcb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CSPD/), allowing an effective and accurate prediction of sites and of proteins more prone to carbonylation in the E. coli proteome. Conclusions/Significance We observed that proteins evolve to either selectively maintain or lose predicted hot spots of carbonylation depending on their biological function. As our predictive model also allows efficient detection of carbonylated proteins in Bacillus subtilis, we believe that our model may be extended to direct MCO attacks in all organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2015843104,"There are few successful therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recently, CRPC has been thought to result from augmented androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway, for most of which AR overexpression has been observed. In this study, Twist1, a member of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors as well as AR was upregulated in response to hydrogen peroxide, and the response to which was abolished by an addition of N-acetyl-L-cysteine and Twist1 knockdown. In addition, castration-resistant LNCaP derivatives and hydrogen peroxide-resistant LNCaP derivatives exhibited a similar phenotype to each other. Then, both castration and AR knockdown increased intracellular reactive oxygen species level. Moreover, Twist1 was shown to regulate AR expression through binding to E-boxes in AR promoter region. Silencing of Twist1 suppressed cell growth of AR-expressing LNCaP cells as well as castration-resistant LNCaP derivatives by inducing cell-cycle arrest at G1 phase and cellular apoptosis. These findings indicated that castration-induced oxidative stress may promote AR overexpression through Twist1 overexpression, which could result in a gain of castration resistance. Modulation of castration-induced oxidative stress or Twist1/AR signaling might be a useful strategy for developing a novel therapeutics in prostate cancer, even in CRPC, which remains dependent on AR signaling by overexpressing AR."
https://openalex.org/W2049499974,"Although Akt is a determinant of cisplatin (cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (CDDP)) resistance in ovarian cancer cells, which is related in part to its inhibitory action on p53 activation, precisely how Akt confers CDDP resistance is unclear. In this study, we show that CDDP induced p53-dependent Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE)-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) degradation in chemosensitive ovarian cancer cells but not their resistant counterparts. CDDP induced FLIP–p53–Itch interaction, colocalization and FLIP ubiquitination in chemosensitive but not chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, although activated Akt inhibited CDDP-induced FLIP degradation and apoptosis in sensitive cells, these responses were facilitated by dominant-negative Akt expression in chemoresistant cells. Inhibition of Akt function also facilitated p53–FLIP interaction and FLIP ubiquitination, which were attenuated by p53 silencing. These results suggest that Akt confers resistance, in part, by modulating CDDP-induced, p53-dependent FLIP ubiquitination. Understanding the precise etiology of chemoresistance may improve treatment for ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2038553122,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that are directly involved in the regulation of gene expression by either translational repression or degradation of target mRNAs. Because of the high level of conservation of the target motifs, known as seed sequences, within the 3′-untranslated regions, a single microRNA can regulate numerous target genes simultaneously, making this class of RNAs a powerful regulator of gene expression. The miR200 family of microRNAs has recently been shown to regulate the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition during tumor progression and metastasis. Here, we report that the expression of WAVE3, an actin cytoskeleton remodeling and metastasis promoter protein, is regulated by miR200 microRNAs. We show a clear inverse correlation between expression levels of WAVE3 and miR200 microRNAs in invasive versus non-invasive cancer cells. miR200 directly targets the 3′-untranslated regions of the WAVE3 mRNA and inhibits its expression. The miR200-mediated down-regulation of WAVE3 results in a significant reduction in the invasive phenotype of cancer cells, which is specific to the loss of WAVE3 expression. Re-expression of a miR200-resistant WAVE3 reverses miR200-mediated inhibition of cancer cell invasion. Loss of WAVE3 expression downstream of miR200 also results in a dramatic change in cell morphology resembling that of a mesenchymal to epithelial transition. In conclusion, a novel mechanism for the regulation of WAVE3 expression in cancer cells has been identified, which controls the invasive properties and morphology of cancer cells associated with their metastatic potential.

We also reported a very significant correlation between the expression levels of WAVE3 and advanced stages of breast cancer (35.Sossey-Alaoui K. Safina A. Li X. Vaughan M.M. Hicks D.G. Bakin A.V.

The mechanisms of regulation of WAVE3 expression levels during tumor progression have, however, remained unsolved. In the present report, we demonstrate an inverse correlation between WAVE3 and miR200 microRNA expression levels in invasive versus non-invasive cancer cells, prompting us to hypothesize that WAVE3 expression might be regulated by miR200 microRNAs in cancer cell invasion. We show that miR200 microRNAs, the expression of which is lost during EMT and therefore cancer metastasis, directly target the 3′-UTR of the WAVE3 mRNA and inhibit its expression. We also show that the miR200-mediated inhibition of WAVE3 expression is specific for WAVE3 because it does not affect the expression levels of the other members of the WAVE family. Concordant with the phenotypic consequences of WAVE3 inhibition (33.Sossey-Alaoui K. Li X. Ranalli T.A. Cowell J.K. J. Biol.

We finally show that ZEB1/ZEB2/E-cadherin, which are critical players in the EMT process, and WAVE3 are independently regulated by miR200 microRNAs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the identification and characterization of a novel mechanism by which WAVE3 is regulated during cancer progression. The antibodies used in this study were as follows: rabbit anti-WAVE3 from New England Peptide, Inc. (Gardner, MA); mouse anti-E-cadherin and mouse anti-vimentin from BD Biosciences; rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein from Clontech; goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG from Calbiochem; and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG from Invitrogen. Alexa 568-conjugated phalloidin was from Invitrogen. Vecta-shield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Gel electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. We used the On-Targetplus SMARTpool (Thermo Scientific) siRNA L-012141-00-0010 and L-1012301-00-0010 to knock down the expression of WAVE2 and WAVE3, respectively. Pre-miRNA miR200b precursor and anti-miR200b miRNA inhibitor were from Invitrogen and were used as per the manufacturer's instructions. The green fluorescent protein-WAVE3 fusion expression vector construction was described previously (36.Sossey-Alaoui K. Li X. Cowell J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26257-26265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of WAVE3 was PCR-amplified using WAVE3 cDNA IMAGE clone 4838122 as a template and subcloned into pmirGlo vector downstream of the firefly luciferase expression cassette (Promega, Madison, WI). The correct sequence and orientation were verified by sequencing. We used the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions, to generate the WAVE3 3′-UTR variants where seed sequences that are recognized by miR200 microRNA were deleted. pmirGlo reporter plasmids (1 μg total plasmid amount) were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into the specified cancer cells, seeded in 12-well plates (3 × 104 cells/well). Cells were collected after 48 h for assay using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). For co-transfection experiments, synthetic microRNA mimics or miR negative control (5 nm) or anti-miR200b microRNA inhibitor or anti-miR negative control (20 nm) were added to the transfection mix. All experiments were performed in triplicate with data averaged from at least three independent experiments. Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells, prostate cancer LNCaP and PC3 cells, colon cancer HT29 cells, and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mmol/liter glutamine, and antibiotics. Transient transfections were performed as described previously (33.Sossey-Alaoui K. Li X. Ranalli T.A. Cowell J.K. J. Biol.

Briefly, ∼2.5 × 105 cells were plated in either 60-mm dishes or 6-well plates in DMEM without antibiotics 24 h before transfection. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) medium as directed by the manufacturer. Approximately 4–5 h after transfection, medium was supplemented with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics, and cells were incubated for an additional 16 h, after which they were harvested and used as specified. Cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and 1 μg of RNA was used to generate cDNA with the SuperScript III RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the cDNA generated was used as a template for semiquantitative RT-PCR as previously described (34.Sossey-Alaoui K.

The invasive potential of the parental cells and the WAVE3 knockdown cells was assessed using the Matrigel invasion chambers from BD Biosciences. Cells were cultured for 48 h in complete medium, harvested by trypsinization, and then counted, and 5 × 104 cells were placed onto the top insert. One chamber consists of a cell insert and a well. The bottom of the cell insert is covered with a filter containing multiple 8-μm pores and is coated with a basement membrane matrix (Matrigel). Cells in 500 μl of serum-free DMEM were seeded in the cell insert and placed in the well, which was filled with 750 μl of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the non-invasive cells present on the upper surface of the filter were removed using a sterile cotton swab. The cells that migrated through the Matrigel onto the lower surface of the filter were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick (American Scientific Products, McGraw Park, IL). The lower surface of the filter was photographed using an inverted Leica DM IRB microscope fitted with a charge-coupled device camera (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), and migrating cells were counted from four fields at ×200 magnification. Cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature and then washed with PBS. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, washed again with PBS, and incubated in the blocking solution containing 4% horse serum (Invitrogen) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Primary as well as secondary antibodies were diluted at the recommended concentration in 4% horse serum in PBS. Coverslips were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and coverslips were then incubated with an Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody (as indicated) for 1 h at room temperature. Actin filaments (F-actin) were stained with Alexa 568-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) in PBS. The coverslips were mounted on object slides using Vectashield. Confocal images were collected using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser-scanning microscope. Laser intensities were adjusted so that the excitation of the fluorochromes did not allow any cross-talk between the channels. Cells were grown in 10-cm diameter culture dishes and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Immediately, ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) was added. The cells were rapidly scraped off the plates, and the crude lysates were transferred to prechilled Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cleared cell lysates containing equivalent amounts of total protein (50 μg) were treated with SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 10% acrylamide gel in SDS, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA) membranes using Bio-Rad gel and transfer apparatus. Membranes were incubated in 5% whole milk (or bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, followed by incubation with the primary antibody (as specified) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed and incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, and the signals were developed using the Western Lights chemiluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used for genomic PCR, RT-PCR, to amplify the entire WAVE3 3′-UTR or the individual seed sequences as well as the primers used for mutagenesis were from IDT (San Diego, CA) and are listed in supplemental Table S1. We used the three most commonly utilized algorithms (miRanda, TargetScan, and PITA) to predict target sites for microRNA in the 3′-UTR of the WAVE3 cDNA sequence (37.Farh K.K. Grimson A. Jan C.

A total of 200 microRNAs were predicted to target WAVE3, most of which were found to have conserved seed sequences in the 3′-UTR of WAVE3. Among the 200 predicted microRNAs, only 10 were predicted by all three algorithms (supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, three members of the microRNA-200 family, miR200b, miR200c, and miR429, were predicted to have the highest scores (supplemental Fig. S1). The seed sequence, which is identical within these microRNAs, is perfectly conserved in three different locations in the 3′-UTR of the WAVE3 gene, the proximal, central, and distal regions (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Our subsequent analyses identified an additional seed sequence for miR200a and miR141 in the 3′-UTR of WAVE3 (Fig. 1A). We therefore hypothesized that WAVE3 expression may be regulated by members of the miR200 microRNA family. The five members of this family are transcribed from two separate clusters. The first cluster encodes for miR200b, -200a, and -429 on human chromosome 4 (Fig. 1B), and the second cluster, on chromosome 6, encodes for miR200c and -141. We decided to focus our study on the microRNA cluster 200a, 200b, and 429, since they have the largest number (three) of predicted seed sequences in the 3′-UTR of WAVE3. Members of the microRNA200 family have recently been identified as powerful regulators of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process (6.Park S.M. Gaur A.B. Lengyel E. Peter M.E.

On the other hand, we have shown that WAVE3 also plays a critical role in cell motility, cell migration, and cancer cell invasion, which are all integral components of the EMT process (33.Sossey-Alaoui K.

We therefore sought to investigate whether the activity of WAVE3 in cell invasion is regulated by members of the miR200 family. We first determined whether there is a correlation between the expression levels of WAVE3 and miR200 microRNAs. We used miR200b as a representative of the miR200 family. We used two sets of cell types based on the expression levels of miR200 microRNAs. The first set contains MDA-MB-231, LNCaP, and PC3, which are considered to be mesenchymal cell types because they do not express miR200 (6.Park S.M. Gaur A.B. Lengyel E. Peter M.E. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). The second set contains MCF7 and HT29, which are considered to be epithelial cell types and which express high levels of miR200 (6.Park S.M. Gaur A.B. Lengyel E. Peter M.E. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). We also included the HEK293 cell line, which is of embryonic origin and could be considered to be a mesenchymal cell type. Bracken et al. (16.Bracken C.P. Gregory P.A. Kolesnikoff N. Bert A.G. Wang J. Shannon M.F. Goodall G.J. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the miR200b-miR200a-miR429 cluster is transcribed from a single 7445-bp intronless transcript on human chromosome 4 (Fig. 1B). Based on those findings, we designed a set of amplicons to investigate the expression levels of these three microRNAs in the cell lines described above. Amplicons were designed from the regions upstream (A) and downstream (F) of the transcribed region, respectively, and four amplicons were designed from inside of the transcribed region (B–E) (Fig. 1B). All six amplicons were successfully amplified from the genomic DNA of all six cell lines (Fig. 1C), indicating that the genomic structure of this microRNA cluster is preserved in all six cell lines. When we used cDNAs generated from each cell line as a template, no RT-PCR product could be detected in any of the six cell lines with amplicons A and F, consistent with a complete absence of genomic DNA contamination in these cDNAs (Fig. 1D). A relatively strong RT-PCR product was generated in HT29 and MCF7 using amplicons B, C, D, and E, compared with the other four cell lines. The opposite scenario was obtained with WAVE3, where a strong WAVE3-specific RT-PCR product was generated in MDA-MB-231, LNCaP, PC3, and HEK293 cells, whereas no detectable WAVE3 transcript could be generated in HT29 or MCF7 cells. Comparable levels of WAVE2, a close relative of WAVE3, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were amplified from all six cell lines. These results clearly show an inverse correlation between the expression levels of miR200 microRNAs and WAVE3; the epithelial type cells, HT29 and MCF7, express more miR200 microRNAs and less WAVE3, whereas the mesenchymal type cells, MDA-MB-231, LNCaP, and PC3, show the opposite relationship. These data also suggest that the expression of WAVE3 is repressed in the cell types where high levels of miR200 microRNAs are expressed, a fact supported by the presence"

Antidote control remains the most direct means to counteract acute side effects of drugs, but, unfortunately, it has been challenging and cost prohibitive to generate antidotes for most therapeutic agents. Here we describe the development of a set of antidote molecules that are capable of counteracting the effects of an entire class of therapeutic agents based upon aptamers. These universal antidotes exploit the fact that, when systemically administered, aptamers are the only free extracellular oligonucleotides found in circulation. We show that protein- and polymer-based molecules that capture oligonucleotides can reverse the activity of several aptamers in vitro and counteract aptamer activity in vivo. The availability of universal antidotes to control the activity of any aptamer suggests that aptamers may be a particularly safe class of therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W2009703979,"Cellular senescence guards against cancer and modulates aging; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that genotoxic drugs capable of inducing premature senescence in normal and cancer cells, such as 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU), distamycin A (DMA), aphidicolin and hydroxyurea, persistently activate Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling and expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as MX1, OAS, ISG15, STAT1, PML, IRF1 and IRF7, in several human cancer cell lines. JAK1/STAT-activating ligands, interleukin 10 (IL10), IL20, IL24, interferon γ (IFNγ), IFNβ and IL6, were also expressed by senescent cells, supporting autocrine/paracrine activation of JAK1/STAT. Furthermore, cytokine genes, including proinflammatory IL1, tumor necrosis factor and transforming growth factor families, were highly expressed. The strongest inducer of JAK/STAT signaling, cytokine production and senescence was BrdU combined with DMA. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of JAK1 abolished expression of ISGs, but not DNA damage signaling or senescence. Thus, although DNA damage signaling, p53 and RB activation, and the cytokine/chemokine secretory phenotype are apparently shared by all types of senescence, our data reveal so far unprecedented activation of the IFNβ–STAT1–ISGs axis, and indicate a less prominent causative role of IL6-JAK/STAT signaling in genotoxic drug-induced senescence compared with reports on oncogene-induced or replicative senescence. These results highlight shared and unique features of drug-induced cellular senescence, and implicate induction of cancer secretory phenotype in chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2073027025,"Kevin Jacobs and colleagues report a new test statistic for detection of membership of an individual within a genome-wide association study, based on reporting of study genotype frequencies. Aggregate results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS)1,2,3, such as genotype frequencies for cases and controls, were until recently often made available on public websites4,5 because they were thought to disclose negligible information concerning an individual's participation in a study. Homer et al.6 recently suggested that a method for forensic detection of an individual's contribution to an admixed DNA sample could be applied to aggregate GWAS data. Using a likelihood-based statistical framework, we developed an improved statistic that uses genotype frequencies and individual genotypes to infer whether a specific individual or any close relatives participated in the GWAS and, if so, what the participant's phenotype status is. Our statistic compares the logarithm of genotype frequencies, in contrast to that of Homer et al.6, which is based on differences in either SNP probe intensity or allele frequencies. We derive the theoretical power of our test statistics and explore the empirical performance in scenarios with varying numbers of randomly chosen or top-associated SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2012085287,"Constitutive activation of one or more kinase signaling pathways is a hallmark of many cancers. Here we extend the previously described mass spectrometry-based KAYAK approach by monitoring kinase activities from multiple signaling pathways simultaneously. This improved single-reaction strategy, which quantifies the phosphorylation of 90 synthetic peptides in a single mass spectrometry run, is compatible with nanogram to microgram amounts of cell lysate. Furthermore, the approach enhances kinase monospecificity through substrate competition effects, faithfully reporting the signatures of many signaling pathways after mitogen stimulation or of basal pathway activation differences across a panel of well-studied cancer cell lines. Hierarchical clustering of activities from related experiments groups peptides phosphorylated by similar kinases together and, when combined with pathway alteration using pharmacological inhibitors, distinguishes underlying differences in potency, off-target effects and genetic backgrounds. Finally, we introduce a strategy to identify the kinase, and even associated protein complex members, responsible for phosphorylation events of interest."
https://openalex.org/W1980639002,"We discovered that renal injury releases 2',3'-cAMP (positional isomer of 3',5'-cAMP) into the interstitium. This finding motivated a novel hypothesis: renal injury leads to activation of an extracellular 2',3'-cAMP-adenosine pathway (i.e. metabolism of extracellular 2',3'-cAMP to 3'-AMP and 2'-AMP, which are metabolized to adenosine, a retaliatory metabolite). In isolated rat kidneys, arterial infusions of 2',3'-cAMP (30 mumol/liter) increased the mean venous secretion of 3'-AMP (3,400-fold), 2'-AMP (26,000-fold), adenosine (53-fold), and inosine (adenosine metabolite, 30-fold). Renal injury with metabolic inhibitors increased the mean secretion of 2',3'-cAMP (29-fold), 3'-AMP (16-fold), 2'-AMP (10-fold), adenosine (4.2-fold), and inosine (6.1-fold) while slightly increasing 5'-AMP (2.4-fold). Arterial infusions of 2'-AMP and 3'-AMP increased secretion of adenosine and inosine similar to that achieved by 5'-AMP. Renal artery infusions of 2',3'-cAMP in vivo increased urinary excretion of 2'-AMP, 3'-AMP and adenosine, and infusions of 2'-AMP and 3'-AMP increased urinary excretion of adenosine as efficiently as 5'-AMP. The implications are that 1) in intact organs, 2'-AMP and 3'-AMP are converted to adenosine as efficiently as 5'-AMP (previously considered the most important adenosine precursor) and 2) because 2',3'-cAMP opens mitochondrial permeability transition pores, a pro-apoptotic/pro-necrotic process, conversion of 2',3'-cAMP to adenosine by the extracellular 2',3'-cAMP-adenosine pathway would protect tissues by reducing a pro-death factor (2',3'-cAMP) while increasing a retaliatory metabolite (adenosine)."

https://openalex.org/W1982273978,"Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is both a candidate oncogene and a candidate tumour suppressor gene. It not only encodes the heregulins and other mitogenic ligands for the ERBB family, but also causes apoptosis in NRG1-expressing cells. We found that most breast cancer cell lines had reduced or undetectable expression of NRG1. This included cell lines that had translocation breaks in the gene. Similarly, expression in cancers was generally comparable to or less than that in various normal breast samples. Many non-expressing cell lines had extensive methylation of the CpG island at the principal transcription start site at exon 2 of NRG1. Expression was reactivated by demethylation. Many tumours also showed methylation, whereas normal mammary epithelial fragments had none. Lower NRG1 expression correlated with higher methylation. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of NRG1 increased net proliferation in a normal breast cell line and a breast cancer cell line that expressed NRG1. The short arm of chromosome 8 is frequently lost in epithelial cancers, and NRG1 is the most centromeric gene that is always affected. NRG1 may therefore be the major tumour suppressor gene postulated to be on 8p: it is in the correct location, is antiproliferative and is silenced in many breast cancers."

We have previously reported a tubulin-mediated translocation of syndecan-1 to the nucleus. The transport route and functional significance of nuclear syndecan-1 is still incompletely understood. Here we investigate the sub-cellular distribution of syndecan-1, FGF-2, FGFR-1 and heparanase in malignant mesenchymal tumor cells, and explore the possibility of their coordinated translocation to the nucleus. To elucidate a structural requirement for this nuclear transport, we have transfected cells with a syndecan-1/EGFP construct or with a short truncated version containing only the tubulin binding RMKKK sequence. The sub-cellular distribution of the EGFP fusion proteins was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Our data indicate that syndecan-1, FGF-2 and heparanase co-localize in the nucleus, whereas FGFR-1 is enriched mainly in the perinuclear area. Overexpression of syndecan-1 results in increased nuclear accumulation of FGF-2, demonstrating the functional importance of syndecan-1 for this nuclear transport. Interestingly, exogenously added FGF-2 does not follow the route taken by endogenous FGF-2. Furthermore, we prove that the RMKKK sequence of syndecan-1 is necessary and sufficient for nuclear translocation, acting as a nuclear localization signal, and the Arginine residue is vital for this localization. We conclude that syndecan-1 and FGF-2, but not FGFR-1 share a common transport route and co-localize with heparanase in the nucleus, and this transport is mediated by the RMKKK motif in syndecan-1. Our study opens a new perspective in the proteoglycan field and provides more evidence of nuclear interactions of syndecan-1."
https://openalex.org/W2073643307,"SNAI1, ZEB1, E-cadherin (CDH1), and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes regulate the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) that initiates the invasion process of many tumor cells. We hypothesized that this process could also affect the behavior of normal cells adjacent to the tumor. To verify this hypothesis, the expression level of these genes was determined by quantitative RT–PCR in tumor, normal adjacent, and normal distant tissues from 32 colorectal cancer (CC) patients. In addition, we extended the study to human HaCaT normal keratinocytes and SW480-ADH colon cancer cells co-cultured with SW480-ADH cells overexpressing the mouse Snai1 gene. Of 18 CC cases with SNAI1 expression in tumor tissue, five also had SNAI1 in normal adjacent tissue (NAT). Expression of SNAI1 in tumor tissue correlated with downregulation of CDH1 and VDR genes in both tumor (P=0.047 and P=0.014, respectively) and NAT lacking SNAI1 expression (P=0.054 and P=0.003). ZEB1 expression was directly related to VDR expression in tumor tissue (r=0.39; P=0.027) and inversely to CDH1 in NAT (r=−0.46; P=0.010). CDH1 and VDR were also downregulated in SW480-ADH and MaCaT cells, respectively, when they were co-cultured with Snai1-expressing cells. Furthermore, cytokine analysis showed differences in the conditioned media obtained from the two cell types. These results indicate that histologically normal tissue adjacent to tumor tissue expressing the EMT-inducing gene SNAI1 shows alterations in the expression of epithelial differentiation genes such as CDH1 and VDR."
https://openalex.org/W2133958055,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is considered one of the most aggressive malignancies, having a poor prognosis and being refractory to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Alteration in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity has been reported in cancer, thus encouraging the development of HDAC inhibitors, whose antitumor action has been shown in both solid and hematological malignancies. However, the molecular basis for their tumor selectivity is unknown. To find an innovative therapy for the treatment of ATCs, we studied the effects of deacetylase inhibitors on thyroid tumorigenesis models. We show that HDACs 1 and 2 are overexpressed in ATCs compared with normal cells or benign tumors and that HDAC inhibitors induce apoptosis selectively in the fully transformed thyroid cells. Our results indicate that these phenomena are mediated by a novel action of HDAC inhibitors that reduces tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand protein degradation by affecting the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. Indeed, the combined treatment with HDAC and proteasome inhibitors results in synergistic apoptosis. These results strongly encourage the preclinical application of the combination deacetylase-proteasome inhibitors for the treatment of ATC."
https://openalex.org/W1996583326,"Cofilin is a major regulator of actin dynamics involved in the regulation of cell spreading and migration through its actin depolymerizing and severing activities. v-Src is an activated Src tyrosine kinase and a potent oncogene known to phosphorylate a variety of cellular proteins in cell transformation process including altered cell adhesion, spreading and migration. Recently, it has been suggested that cofilin is a potential substrate of v-Src (Rush et al., 2005). Here, we show direct tyrosine phosphorylation of cofilin by v-Src and identify Y68 as the major phosphorylation site. Cofilin phosphorylation at Y68 did not change its activity per se, but induced increased ubiquitination of cofilin and its degradation through the proteosome pathway. Furthermore, the negative effect of cofilin on cellular F-actin contents was inhibited by coexpression of v-Src, whereas that of cofilin mutant Y68F (Y68 mutated to F) was not affected, suggesting that v-Src-mediated cofilin phosphorylation at Y68 is required for the degradation of cofilin in vivo. Lastly, inhibition of cell spreading by v-Src was rescued partially by coexpression of cofilin, and to a greater extent by the Y68F mutant, which is not subjected to v-Src-induced degradation through phosphorylation, suggesting that v-Src-mediated changes in cell spreading is, at least in part, through inhibiting the function of cofilin through phosphorylating it at Y68. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism by which cofilin is regulated by v-Src through tyrosine phosphorylation at Y68 that triggers the degradation of cofilin through ubiquitination-proteosome pathway and consequently inhibits cofilin activity in reducing cellular F-actin contents and cell spreading."
https://openalex.org/W2023172271,"During the maintenance of visuospatial information, neural activity in the frontal eye field (FEF) persists and is thought to be an important neural mechanism for visual working memory. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine whether human FEF activity persists when maintaining auditory space and whether it is selective for retinal versus extra-retinal space. Subjects performed an audiospatial working-memory task using sounds recorded from microphones placed in each subject's ear canals, which preserved the interaural time and level differences that are critical for sound localization. Putative FEF activity persisted when maintaining auditory-cued space, even for locations behind the head to which it is impossible to make saccades. Therefore, human FEF activity represents both retinal and extra-retinal space."
https://openalex.org/W2071354670,"The Copper Metabolism MURR1 Domain containing 1 protein COMMD1 has been associated with copper homeostasis, NF-kappaB signaling, and sodium transport. Recently, we identified COMMD1 as a novel protein in HIF-1 signaling. Mouse embryos deficient for Commd1 have increased expression of hypoxia/HIF-regulated genes i.e. VEGF, PGK and Bnip3. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are master regulators of oxygen homeostasis, which control angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, glycolysis and cell survival/proliferation under normal and pathologic conditions. Although HIF activity is mainly controlled by ubiquitination and protein degradation by the von Hippel Lindau (pVHL) tumor suppressor gene other mechanisms have recently been identified that regulate HIF signaling independently of pVHL.Here we characterized the mechanism by which COMMD1 regulates HIF-1alpha protein degradation. We show that COMMD1 competes with the chaperone heat shock protein HSP90beta for binding to the NH(2)-terminal DNA-binding and heterodimerization domain of HIF-1alpha to regulate HIF-1alpha stability together with HSP70. Inhibition of HSP90 activity with 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) increased COMMD1-mediated HIF-1alpha degradation independent of ubiquitin and pVHL.These data reveal a novel role for COMMD1 in conjunction with HSP90beta/HSP70 in the ubiquitin and O(2)-independent regulation of HIF-1alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2156473621,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes human epidemics across Eurasia. Clinical manifestations range from inapparent infections and fevers to fatal encephalitis but the factors that determine disease severity are currently undefined. TBEV is characteristically a hemagglutinating (HA) virus; the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes tentatively reflects virion receptor/fusion activity. However, for the past few years many atypical HA-deficient strains have been isolated from patients and also from the natural European host tick, Ixodes persulcatus. By analysing the sequences of HA-deficient strains we have identified 3 unique amino acid substitutions (D67G, E122G or D277A) in the envelope protein, each of which increases the net charge and hydrophobicity of the virion surface. Therefore, we genetically engineered virus mutants each containing one of these 3 substitutions; they all exhibited HA-deficiency. Unexpectedly, each genetically modified non-HA virus demonstrated increased TBEV reproduction in feeding Ixodes ricinus, not the recognised tick host for these strains. Moreover, virus transmission efficiency between infected and uninfected ticks co-feeding on mice was also intensified by each substitution. Retrospectively, the mutation D67G was identified in viruses isolated from patients with encephalitis. We propose that the emergence of atypical Siberian HA-deficient TBEV strains in Europe is linked to their molecular adaptation to local ticks. This process appears to be driven by the selection of single mutations that change the virion surface thus enhancing receptor/fusion function essential for TBEV entry into the unfamiliar tick species. As the consequence of this adaptive mutagenesis, some of these mutations also appear to enhance the ability of TBEV to cross the human blood-brain barrier, a likely explanation for fatal encephalitis. Future research will reveal if these emerging Siberian TBEV strains continue to disperse westwards across Europe by adaptation to the indigenous tick species and if they are associated with severe forms of TBE."
https://openalex.org/W2087030095,"Since the recent spread of highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 subtypes, avian influenza virus (AIV) dispersal has become an increasing focus of research. As for any other bird-borne pathogen, dispersal of these viruses is related to local and migratory movements of their hosts. In this study, we investigated potential AIV spread by Common Teal (Anas crecca) from the Camargue area, in the South of France, across Europe. Based on bird-ring recoveries, local duck population sizes and prevalence of infection with these viruses, we built an individual-based spatially explicit model describing bird movements, both locally (between wintering areas) and at the flyway scale. We investigated the effects of viral excretion duration and inactivation rate in water by simulating AIV spread with varying values for these two parameters. The results indicate that an efficient AIV dispersal in space is possible only for excretion durations longer than 7 days. Virus inactivation rate in the environment appears as a key parameter in the model because it allows local persistence of AIV over several months, the interval between two migratory periods. Virus persistence in water thus represents an important component of contamination risk as ducks migrate along their flyway. Based on the present modelling exercise, we also argue that HP H5N1 AIV is unlikely to be efficiently spread by Common Teal dispersal only."
https://openalex.org/W1982267520,"Background This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of the antimalarial artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) artesunate +sulfamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine (As+SMP), administered in doses used for malaria, to treat Schistosoma haematobium in school aged children. Methodology/Principal Findings The study was conducted in Djalakorodji, a peri-urban area of Bamako, Mali, using a double blind setup in which As+SMP was compared with praziquantel (PZQ). Urine samples were examined for Schistosoma haematobium on days −1, 0, 28 and 29. Detection of haematuria, and haematological and biochemical exams were conducted on day 0 and day 28. Clinical exams were performed on days 0, 1, 2, and 28. A total of 800 children were included in the trial. The cure rate obtained without viability testing was 43.9% in the As+SMP group versus 53% in the PZQ group (Chi2 = 6.44, p = 0.011). Egg reduction rates were 95.6% with PZQ in comparison with 92.8% with As+SMP, p = 0.096. The proportion of participants who experienced adverse events related to the medication was 0.5% (2/400) in As+SMP treated children compared to 2.3% (9/399) in the PZQ group (p = 0.033). Abdominal pain and vomiting were the most frequent adverse events in both treatment arms. All adverse events were categorized as mild. Conclusions/Significance The study demonstrates that PZQ was more effective than As+SMP for treating Schistosoma haematobium. However, the safety and tolerability profile of As+SMP was similar to that seen with PZQ. Our findings suggest that further investigations seem justifiable to determine the dose/efficacy/safety pattern of As+SMP in the treatment of Schistosoma infections.

https://openalex.org/W2027651772,"Earlier studies indicated that density-arrested cancer cells released an unidentified growth inhibitor whose secretion was prevented by overexpression of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D (cath D). In this study, this growth inhibitor was purified by affinity chromatography and identified as the heat shock cognate 70 protein (hsc70) based on its peptide microsequencing and specific antibody recognition. Among intracellular proteins, including other heat shock proteins, only constitutive hsc70 was secreted in response to the high-cell density. Moreover, hsc70 secretion from cancer cells was generated by serum deprivation, whereas its cellular concentration did not change. Prevention of Hsc70 secretion by cath D overexpression was associated with the formation of multilayer cell cultures, thus indicating a loss of contact inhibition. In addition, we showed that supplementing the culture medium with purified hsc70 inhibited cell proliferation in the nanomolar range. Conversely, removal of this extracellular hsc70 from the medium by either retention on ADP-agarose or competition at the Hsc70 binding site restored cell proliferation. Hsc70 appears active in human breast cancer cells and hypersecreted by direct cath D inhibition. These results suggest a new role of this secreted hsc70 chaperone in cell proliferation that might account for the higher tumor growth of cancer cells overexpressing cath D."
https://openalex.org/W2150097145,"Wnt-signal transduction is critical for development and tissue homeostasis in a wide range of animal species and is frequently deregulated in human cancers. Members of the Frat/GBP family of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (Gsk3b)-binding oncoproteins are recognized as potent activators of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in vertebrates. Here, we reveal a novel, Gsk3b-independent function of Frat converging on the activation of JNK and AP-1. Both these have been used as readouts for the noncanonical Frizzled/PCP pathway, which controls polarized cell movements and the establishment of tissue polarity. We find that Frat synergizes with Diversin, the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila PCP protein diego, in the activation of JNK/AP-1 signaling. Importantly, Frat mutants deficient for binding to Gsk3b retain oncogenic activity in vivo, suggesting that Wnt/beta-catenin-independent events contribute to Frat-induced malignant transformation. The observed activities of Frat are reminiscent of the dual function of Dishevelled in the Wnt/beta-catenin and Frizzled/PCP pathways and suggest that Frat may also function to bridge canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways."

When either growth factors or phorbol esters are added in G2 phase they can induce a G2 phase cell cycle delay (11.Barth H. Kinzel V. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12.Barth H. Kinzel V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); however, the exact mechanism of the delay is poorly understood. Activation of the MAPK pathway by growth factors and phorbol esters has been implicated in the G2 phase delay (13.Dangi S. Chen F.M. Shapiro P. Cell Prolif. 2006; 39: 261-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with the ERK-dependent up-regulation of the cdk inhibitor p21WAF1 identified as a key component of the delay (13.Dangi S. Chen F.M. Shapiro P. Cell Prolif. 2006; 39: 261-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms, including increased protein phosphatase 2A activity, have also been proposed (14.Klingler-Hoffmann M. Barth H. Richards J. König N. Kinzel V. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 84: 719-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Cells respond to a variety of stresses by imposing a G2 phase delay through the action of cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms. The checkpoint mechanisms impose the arrest by blocking activation of cyclin B/cdk1, the driver of mitosis. Major checkpoint mechanisms demonstrated to impose a G2 phase arrest in response to DNA damage are the ATM and related ATR-dependent pathways. ATM and ATR are the apical components of pathways that signal through Chk1 and Chk2 to block cdc25-dependent activation of the mitotic cyclin/cdks (15.O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The p38MAPK-MAPKAPK2 pathway is involved in a separate G2 arrest pathway (16.Bulavin D.V.

Cell. 2005; 17: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).These pathways all target the key G2/M transitional regulators, the cdc25 family of dual specificity phosphatases. The cdc25s activate the mitotic cdk complexes by dephosphorylating the inhibitory Thr14 and Tyr15 residues on cdk1 and cdk2. All three cdc25 isoforms appear to have roles in G2/M progression, although only depletion of cdc25A and cdc25B delays entry into mitosis (18.Lindqvist A. Källström H. Lundgren A. Barsoum E. Rosenthal C.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Both cdc25A and cdc25B are unstable proteins, and their activity is in part regulated by their stability, which is increased in G2/M and decreased in response to stresses (19.Gabrielli B.G.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3386-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All three cdc25 isoforms are targets for checkpoint kinase inactivation (22.Boutros R. Dozier C. Ducommun B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Cdc25A is destabilized by Chk1 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage (23.Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuâsen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Cdc25B is specifically required for exit from the G2 phase checkpoint arrest (24.van Vugt M.A. Brás A. Medema R.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and its stability has also been linked to responses to damage (25.Bansal P. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3356-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The possibility that MAPK signaling induces a G2 delay via the ATM/ATR, Chk1/2, or p38MAPK checkpoint pathways has not been reported. Here, we demonstrate that the MAPK signaling-induced G2 phase delay is independent of usual G2 checkpoint mechanisms, but instead is a consequence of MEK1-dependent destabilization of the critical G2/M regulator cdc25B.DISCUSSIONIn this report we have demonstrated that activation of MAPK pathway signaling induces a G2 phase delay via a MEK1-dependent mechanism culminating in the rapid destabilization of the critical G2/M regulator cdc25B. Depletion and inhibition of cdc25B have previously been demonstrated to delay entry into mitosis (18.Lindqvist A. Källström H. Lundgren A. Barsoum E. Rosenthal C.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 39.Goldstone S. Pavey S. Forrest A. Sinnamon J. Gabrielli B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cdc25B cooperates with cdc25A in promoting normal G2/M progression and hence induces only relatively short delay. However, cdc25B is specifically required for exit from a G2 phase checkpoint arrest, and its depletion in this case causes a more significant delay in entry into mitosis (24.van Vugt M.A. Brás A. Medema R.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The relatively transient delay induced with EGF or TPA in normal cycling cells and more robust delay observed in the G2 phase checkpoint-arrested cells driven into mitosis with caffeine exactly mirror the effects reported with siRNA-mediated depletion of cdc25B in these identical systems (18.Lindqvist A. Källström H. Lundgren A. Barsoum E. Rosenthal C.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24.van Vugt M.A. Brás A. Medema R.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The lack of involvement of established pathways that promote a G2 phase delay, ATM/ATR, Chk1/2, and p38MAPK checkpoint signaling is not surprising because these pathways impose a G2 phase delay by regulating cdc25B activity (17.Manke I.A.

Cancer. 2007; 7: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar).The contribution of upstream signaling through the MAPK pathway to the G2 phase delay is demonstrated by the ability of both TPA and EGF to impose the delay, and the relatively short lived effect EGF compared with TPA reflects the relative duration of MAPK signaling generated by each stimulus. The discovery that MEK1 but not MEK2 depletion blocked the EGF- and TPA-induced destabilization of cdc25B and G2 phase delay clearly demonstrates the involvement of MEK1 in this mechanism. In Xenopus extracts, MAPK activation causes a G2 phase delay, attributed to ERK phosphorylation of Wee1, and phosphorylation of cdc25C by p90RSK, a downstream effector of ERK activity (42.Walter S.A. Guadagno S.N. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 43.Chun J. Chau A.S. Maingat F.G. Edmonds S.D. Ostergaard H.L. Shibuya E.K.

Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which MEK1 destabilizes cdc25B appears to be through phosphorylation of Ser249. Cdc25B stability is regulated in part by the Skp1/Cullin1/F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP, which recognizes a DDG motif in the N-terminal half of the protein (38.Kanemori Y. Uto K. Sagata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cdc25A, which is also regulated by β-TrCP, is the target for ERK-dependent phosphorylation, which accelerates its degradation in a manner similar to cdk1- and Chk1- dependent phosphorylation (47.Isoda M. Kanemori Y. Nakajo N. Uchida S. Yamashita K. Ueno H. Sagata N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2186-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the Ser249 site to the MEK inhibitor U0126 and the fact that it was originally identified as a p38MAPK-dependent site implicate ERK as being responsible for the Ser249 phosphorylation. p38MAPK and ERK have similar phosphorylation site determinants with their in vivo specificity determined by specific docking site interactions (48.Mayor Jr., F. Jurado-Pueyo M. Campos P.M. Murga C. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additionally, TPA treatment rapidly inactivated p38MAPK, indicating that p38MAPK or MK2 was unlikely to be responsible for the phosphorylation observed (data not shown). Interestingly, Cdc25A destabilization in response to MAPK pathway activation was not detected in the current study. The reason for this is unclear. The inability of the MEK inhibitor U0126 to rescue the TPA/EGF-stimulated G2 phase delay and cdc25B destabilization completely may point to mechanisms in addition to decreased stability of cdc25B being involved in the delay. The ability of MEK1 depletion to block the loss of cdc25B completely indicates that the effect is MEK1-dependent, with the Ser249 phosphorylation and resultant destabilization likely to depend on ERK activation. However, cdc25B is an unstable protein with a half-life of less than 30 min in G2 phase cells (38.Kanemori Y. Uto K. Sagata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is possible that in addition to the ERK-dependent Ser249 phosphorylation and destabilization of cdc25B, MEK1 also blocks de novo synthesis of cdc25B. This would also effectively deplete cdc25B levels and could act in cooperation with the destabilization of the preexisting pool of cdc25B to maintain the G2 phase delay. The failure of the MEK inhibitor to rescue cdc25B levels completely suggests that the proposed block in de novo synthesis is independent of MEK1 catalytic activity.Although there appears to be significant functional redundancy between MEK1 and MEK2, a MEK1-specific function has recently been reported. Knock-out of MEK1, but not MEK2, reduced tumor formation in a chemically induced mouse skin cancer model (49.Scholl F.A. Dumesic P.A. Barragan D.I. Harada K. Charron J. Khavari P.A. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 3772-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting a specific role for MEK1 in response to DNA-damaging agents. Our finding that the MEK1-dependent signaling, by targeting cdc25B stability, was capable of influencing the timing of exit from a G2 phase DNA damage checkpoint arrest may contribute directly to this MEK1-specific effect on tumor formation.The nature of the signal that stimulates the MEK1-dependent G2 delay mechanism we have defined is at present unknown. We have demonstrated that it responds to external signals such as growth factors and other factors that stimulate MAPK signaling. Recently, hepatocyte growth factor used at physiological levels was shown to produce a similar G2 phase delay (50.Nam H.J. Kim S. Lee M.W. Lee B.S. Hara T. Saya H. Cho H. Lee J.H. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Other stresses affecting the cell microenvironment or its interactions with neighboring cells that generate MAPK-dependent signaling (51.McKay M.M. Morrison D.K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) would influence checkpoint exit though this MEK1-dependent mechanism. Thus, in response to stresses that produce both intracellular damage that triggers a G2 phase checkpoint response through ATM/ATR signaling, and extracellular stress such as tissue damage triggering MAPK pathway activation, entry into mitosis would be delayed until both intracellular and extracellular stresses are resolved. This coordination between responses to intracellular and extracellular stress signals ensures that entry into mitosis only proceeds in optimal conditions to ensure the integrity of mitosis and proliferation of tissue following damage.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that activation of MAPK signaling in G2 phase cells induces a G2 phase delay through a MEK1-dependent pathway. This pathway destabilizes cdc25B protein by increased phosphorylation of Ser249, and it is the degradation of cdc25B that is responsible for the G2 phase delay observed in normally cycling cells, and the sensitivity of cells attempting to exit a G2 phase checkpoint arrest to MAPK signaling. Signaling through the MAPK pathway is critical for many biological activities, and upstream components of this pathway, notably Ras and Raf, are common targets for activating mutations in cancer. The demonstration that MEK1 can regulate normal G2/M cell cycle and perhaps, more importantly, checkpoint mechanisms, suggests a novel mechanism by which these mutations can promote neoplastic transformation.

ERK-dependent phosphorylation of a broad range of substrates is the primary signaling output of the pathway (2.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2248) Google Scholar). The ability of the MAPK pathway to influence entry into the cell cycle has been well established (3.Edelmann H.M. Kühne C.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Growth factors activate the canonical MAPK pathway through specific receptors, whereas the tumor-promoting phorbol esters activate this pathway via PKC (10.El-Shemerly M.Y. Besser D. Nagasawa M. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30599-30602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). When either growth factors or phorbol esters are added in G2 phase they can induce a G2 phase cell cycle delay (11.Barth H. Kinzel V. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12.Barth H. Kinzel V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); however, the exact mechanism of the delay is poorly understood. Activation of the MAPK pathway by growth factors and phorbol esters has been implicated in the G2 phase delay (13.Dangi S. Chen F.M. Shapiro P. Cell Prolif. 2006; 39: 261-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with the ERK-dependent up-regulation of the cdk inhibitor p21WAF1 identified as a key component of the delay (13.Dangi S. Chen F.M. Shapiro P. Cell Prolif. 2006; 39: 261-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms, including increased protein phosphatase 2A activity, have also been proposed (14.Klingler-Hoffmann M. Barth H. Richards J. König N. Kinzel V. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 84: 719-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Cells respond to a variety of stresses by imposing a G2 phase delay through the action of cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms. The checkpoint mechanisms impose the arrest by blocking activation of cyclin B/cdk1, the driver of mitosis. Major checkpoint mechanisms demonstrated to impose a G2 phase arrest in response to DNA damage are the ATM and related ATR-dependent pathways. ATM and ATR are the apical components of pathways that signal through Chk1 and Chk2 to block cdc25-dependent activation of the mitotic cyclin/cdks (15.O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The p38MAPK-MAPKAPK2 pathway is involved in a separate G2 arrest pathway (16.Bulavin D.V. Amundson S.A. Fornace A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 17.Manke I.A. Nguyen A. Lim D. Stewart M.Q. Elia A.E. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).These pathways all target the key G2/M transitional regulators, the cdc25 family of dual specificity phosphatases. The cdc25s activate the mitotic cdk complexes by dephosphorylating the inhibitory Thr14 and Tyr15 residues on cdk1 and cdk2. All three cdc25 isoforms appear to have roles in G2/M progression, although only depletion of cdc25A and cdc25B delays entry into mitosis (18.Lindqvist A. Källström H. Lundgren A. Barsoum E. Rosenthal C.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Both cdc25A and cdc25B are unstable proteins, and their activity is in part regulated by their stability, which is increased in G2/M and decreased in response to stresses (19.Gabrielli B.G.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3386-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All three cdc25 isoforms are targets for checkpoint kinase inactivation (22.Boutros R. Dozier C. Ducommun B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Cdc25A is destabilized by Chk1 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage (23.Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuâsen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Cdc25B is specifically required for exit from the G2 phase checkpoint arrest (24.van Vugt M.A. Brás A. Medema R.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and its stability has also been linked to responses to damage (25.Bansal P. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3356-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The possibility that MAPK signaling induces a G2 delay via the ATM/ATR, Chk1/2, or p38MAPK checkpoint pathways has not been reported. Here, we demonstrate that the MAPK signaling-induced G2 phase delay is independent of usual G2 checkpoint mechanisms, but instead is a consequence of MEK1-dependent destabilization of the critical G2/M regulator cdc25B.

https://openalex.org/W2170627569,"The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) is the largest Neotropical bird of prey and is threatened by human persecution and habitat loss and fragmentation. Current conservation strategies include local education, captive rearing and reintroduction, and protection or creation of trans-national habitat blocks and corridors. Baseline genetic data prior to reintroduction of captive-bred stock is essential for guiding such efforts but has not been gathered previously.We assessed levels of genetic diversity, population structure and demographic history for harpy eagles using samples collected throughout a large portion of their geographic distribution in Central America (n = 32) and South America (n = 31). Based on 417 bp of mitochondrial control region sequence data, relatively high levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity were estimated for both Central and South America, although haplotype diversity was significantly higher for South America. Historical restriction of gene flow across the Andes (i.e. between our Central and South American subgroups) is supported by coalescent analyses, the haplotype network and significant F(ST) values, however reciprocally monophyletic lineages do not correspond to geographical locations in maximum likelihood analyses. A sudden population expansion for South America is indicated by a mismatch distribution analysis, and further supported by significant (p<0.05) negative values of Fu and Li's D(F) and F, and Fu's F(S). This expansion, estimated at approximately 60 000 years BP (99 000-36 000 years BP 95% CI), encompasses a transition from a warm and dry time period prior to 50 000 years BP to an interval of maximum precipitation (50 000-36 000 years BP). Notably, this time period precedes the climatic and habitat changes associated with the last glacial maximum. In contrast, a multimodal distribution of haplotypes was observed for Central America suggesting either population equilibrium or a recent decline.High levels of mitochondrial genetic diversity in combination with genetic differentiation among subgroups within regions and between regions highlight the importance of local population conservation in order to preserve maximal levels of genetic diversity in this species. Evidence of historically restricted female-mediated gene flow is an important consideration for captive-breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2011071946,"Glycosylation is a highly complex process to produce a diverse repertoire of cellular glycans that are attached to proteins and lipids. Glycans are involved in fundamental biological processes, including protein folding and clearance, cell proliferation and apoptosis, development, immune responses, and pathogenesis. One of the major types of glycans, N-linked glycans, is formed by sequential attachments of monosaccharides to proteins by a limited number of enzymes. Many of these enzymes can accept multiple N-linked glycans as substrates, thereby generating a large number of glycan intermediates and their intermingled pathways. Motivated by the quantitative methods developed in complex network research, we investigated the large-scale organization of such N-linked glycosylation pathways in mammalian cells. The N-linked glycosylation pathways are extremely modular, and are composed of cohesive topological modules that directly branch from a common upstream pathway of glycan synthesis. This unique structural property allows the glycan production between modules to be controlled by the upstream region. Although the enzymes act on multiple glycan substrates, indicating cross-talk between modules, the impact of the cross-talk on the module-specific enhancement of glycan synthesis may be confined within a moderate range by transcription-level control. The findings of the present study provide experimentally-testable predictions for glycosylation processes, and may be applicable to therapeutic glycoprotein engineering."

https://openalex.org/W2032610060,"The hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif 1 (HEY1) is a member of the basic-helix-loop-helix-Orange (bHLH-O) family of transcriptional repressors that mediate Notch signaling. Several cancer-related pathways also regulate HEY1 expression, and HEY1 itself acts as an indirect positive regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein and a negative regulator of androgen receptor activity. In this study we show how a naturally occurring non-synonymous polymorphism at codon 94 of HEY1, which results in a substitution of leucine by methionine (Leu94Met), converts HEY1 from an androgen receptor corepressor to an androgen receptor co-activator without affecting its intrinsic transcriptional repressive domains. The polymorphism Leu94Met also abolishes HEY1-mediated activation of p53 and suppresses the ability of HEY1 to induce p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and aberrant cell differentiation in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Moreover, expression of HEY1, but not of the variant Leu94Met, confers sensitivity to p53-activating chemotherapeutic drugs on U2OS cells. In addition, we have identified motifs in HEY1 that are critical for the regulation of its subcellular localization and analysed how mutations in those motifs affect both HEY1 and HEY1-Leu94Met functions. These findings suggest that the polymorphism Leu94Met in HEY1 radically alters its biological activities and may affect oncogenic processes."

Small molecule inhibitors of Kinesin-5, developed as potential anti-cancer drugs, arrest cell in mitosis and promote apoptosis of cancer cells. We performed a genome-wide siRNA screen for enhancers and suppressors of a Kinesin-5 inhibitor in human cells to elucidate cellular responses, and thus identify factors that might predict drug sensitivity in cancers. Because the drug's actions play out over several days, we developed an intermittent imaging screen. Live HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B were imaged at 0, 24 and 48 hours after drug addition, and images were analyzed using open-source software that incorporates machine learning. This screen effectively identified siRNAs that caused increased mitotic arrest at low drug concentrations (enhancers), and vice versa (suppressors), and we report siRNAs that caused both effects. We then classified the effect of siRNAs for 15 genes where 3 or 4 out of 4 siRNA oligos tested were suppressors as assessed by time lapse imaging, and by testing for suppression of mitotic arrest in taxol and nocodazole. This identified 4 phenotypic classes of drug suppressors, which included known and novel genes. Our methodology should be applicable to other screens, and the suppressor and enhancer genes we identified may open new lines of research into mitosis and checkpoint biology."
https://openalex.org/W2064212866,"Ras proteins activate Raf and PI-3 kinases, as well as exchange factors for RalA and RalB GTPases. Many previous studies have reported that the Ral-signaling cascade contributes positively to Ras-mediated oncogenesis. Here, using a bioengineered tissue model of early steps in Ras-induced human squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, we found the opposite. Conversion of Ras-expressing keratinocytes from a premalignant to malignant state induced by decreasing E-cadherin function was associated with and required an approximately two to threefold decrease in RalA expression. Moreover, direct knockdown of RalA to a similar degree by shRNA expression in these cells reduced E-cadherin levels and also induced progression to a malignant phenotype. Knockdown of the Ral effector, Exo84, mimicked the effects of decreasing RalA levels in these engineered tissues. These phenomena can be explained by our finding that the stability of E-cadherin in Ras-expressing keratinocytes depends upon this RalA signaling cascade. These results imply that an important component of the early stages in squamous carcinoma progression may be a modest decrease in RalA gene expression that magnifies the effects of decreased E-cadherin expression by promoting its degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1983940047,"Background In co-cultures of pachytene spermatocytes with Sertoli cells, β-NGF regulates the second meiotic division by blocking secondary spermatocytes in metaphase (metaphase II), and thereby lowers round spermatid formation. In vertebrates, mature oocytes are arrested at metaphase II until fertilization, because of the presence of cytostatic factor (CSF) in their cytoplasm. By analogy, we hypothesized the presence of CSF in male germ cells. Methodology/Principal Findings We show here, that Mos, Emi2, cyclin E and Cdk2, the four proteins of CSF, and their respective mRNAs, are present in male rat meiotic cells; this was assessed by using Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and reverse transcriptase PCR. We measured the relative cellular levels of Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2 in the meiotic cells by flow cytometry and found that the four proteins increased throughout the first meiotic prophase, reaching their highest levels in middle to late pachytene spermatocytes, then decreased following the meiotic divisions. In co-cultures of pachytene spermatocytes with Sertoli cells, β-NGF increased the number of metaphases II, while enhancing Mos and Emi2 levels in middle to late pachytene spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes in division and secondary spermatocytes. Conclusion/Significance Our results suggest that CSF is not restricted to the oocyte. In addition, they reinforce the view that NGF, by enhancing Mos in late spermatocytes, is one of the intra-testicular factors which adjusts the number of round spermatids that can be supported by Sertoli cells."
https://openalex.org/W2070230826,"The Pastorex® (BioRad) rapid agglutination test is one of the main rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for meningococcal disease currently in use in the “meningitis belt”. Earlier evaluations, performed after heating and centrifugation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, under good laboratory conditions, showed high sensitivity and specificity. However, during an epidemic, the test may be used without prior sample preparation. Recently a new, easy-to-use dipstick RDT for meningococcal disease detection on CSF was developed by the Centre de Recherche Médicale et Sanitaire in Niger and the Pasteur Institute in France. We estimate diagnostic accuracy in the field during the 2006 outbreak of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A in Maradi, Niger, for the dipstick RDT and Pastorex® on unprepared CSF, (a) by comparing each test's sensitivity and specificity with previously reported values; and (b) by comparing results for each test on paired samples, using McNemar's test. We also (c) estimate diagnostic accuracy of the dipstick RDT on diluted whole blood. We tested unprepared CSF and diluted whole blood from 126 patients with suspected meningococcal disease presenting at four health posts. (a) Pastorex® sensitivity (69%; 95%CI 57–79) was significantly lower than found previously for prepared CSF samples [87% (81–91); or 88% (85–91)], as was specificity [81% (95%CI 68–91) vs 93% (90–95); or 93% (87–96)]. Sensitivity of the dipstick RDT [89% (95%CI 80–95)] was similar to previously reported values for ideal laboratory conditions [89% (84–93) and 94% (90–96)]. Specificity, at 62% (95%CI 48–75), was significantly lower than found previously [94% (92–96) and 97% (94–99)]. (b) McNemar's test for the dipstick RDT vs Pastorex® was statistically significant (p<0.001). (c) The dipstick RDT did not perform satisfactorily on diluted whole blood (sensitivity 73%; specificity 57%). Sensitivity and specificity of Pastorex® without prior CSF preparation were poorer than previously reported results from prepared samples; therefore we caution against using this test during an epidemic if sample preparation is not possible. For the dipstick RDT, sensitivity was similar to, while specificity was not as high as previously reported during a more stable context. Further studies are needed to evaluate its field performance, especially for different populations and other serogroups."

https://openalex.org/W2066321182,"HslVU is a bacterial ATP-dependent protease distantly related to eukaryotic proteasomes consisting of hexameric HslU ATPase and dodecameric HslV protease. As a homolog of the 20 S proteasome beta-subunits, HslV also uses the N-terminal threonine as the active site residue. However, unlike the proteasome that has only 6 active sites among the 14 beta-subunits, HslV has 12 active sites that could potentially contribute to proteolytic activity. Here, by using a series of HslV dodecamers containing different numbers of active sites, we demonstrate that like the proteasome, HslV with only approximately 6 active sites is sufficient to support full catalytic activity. However, a further reduction of the number of active sites leads to a proportional decrease in activity. Using proteasome inhibitors, we also demonstrate that substrate-mediated stabilization of the HslV-HslU interaction remains unchanged until the number of the active sites is decreased to approximately 6 but is gradually compromised upon further reduction. These results with a mathematical model suggest HslVU utilizes no more than 6 active sites at any given time, presumably because of the action of HslU. These results also suggest that each ATP-bound HslU subunit activates one HslV subunit and that substrate bound to the HslV active site stimulates the HslU ATPase activity by stabilizing the HslV-HslU interaction. We propose this mechanism plays an important role in supporting complete degradation of substrates while preventing wasteful ATP hydrolysis in the resting state by controlling the interaction between HslV and HslU through the catalytic engagement of the proteolytic active sites."
