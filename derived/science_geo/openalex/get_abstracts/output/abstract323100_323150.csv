https://openalex.org/W2059369909,"In the primitive angiosperms, closed carpels are believed to have evolved as protection for ovules, which would otherwise be injured by animal pollinators. The hypothesis is presented that, whatever the origin and other functions of angiosperms, insect pollination and closed carpels may, in combination, reduce the influence of random variation on pollen tube competition, thus enhancing the ability of natural selection to act on the gametophytic phase of the life cycle. The microgametophytic phase represented by vast numbers of haploid individuals can then serve, by insect pollination and closed carpels, as a screen against any genome not functioning with a high degree of metabolic vigor. Poorly balanced genomes could thus be eliminated at relatively little cost. Insect-pollinated angiosperms would therefore benefit from positive aspects of sexual recombination. Such a system may have allowed the angiosperms to undergo their rise to dominance."
https://openalex.org/W3208467871,"Superacids, although first referred to as early as 1927, were only extensively studied in the last decade. Acidities up to 10(12) times that of sulfuric acid have now been obtained. The extremely low nucleophilicity of the counterions in superacidic systems is especially useful for the preparation of stable, electron-deficient cations, particularly carbocations. Many of these cations, which were formerly detectable only in the gas phase, can now be studied in solution. Novel organic syntheses that are not possible in ordinary acidic media can also be achieved in superacids, including syntheses of economically important hydrocarbons. The unique ability of superacids to bring about hydrocarbon transformations, even to activate methane to undergo electrophilic oligocondensation, can open up new fields in chemistry."

The detector exhibits low gamma background and reproducible detection efficiency, and it requires minimum sample preparation. Counting efficiencies were determined for aqueous solutions of P(32), Na(22), and C(14) and for C(14)O(2) gas."

Performance depends sensitively on a ""symbiotic"" interaction between agronomy and technology. The conditions for obtaining net productivity and costs are explored for U.S. grain alcohol as a reference point. Currently practiced technology consumes more high-grade fuel than it generates. Some potentials and constraints for future systems, including use of other plant species and conversion systems, are explored."
https://openalex.org/W2086502046,"New technologies for separating alcohol from water solutions soon may lower significantly the cost of producing ethyl alcohol by fermenting grain, sugar crops, or cellulose. This is possible because the new processes use less energy in recovering the alcohol than does the traditional method distillation. If laboratory estimates of the energy savings are borne out on an industrial scale, alcohol may become competitive with gasoline. Some fermentation products other than alcohol also can be concentrated efficiently, and show promise as alternative liquid fuels. The following energy-efficient alternatives to distillation were discussed: different solvent extraction techniques, membranes for alcohol purification, membranes permeable to alcohol but not water, and zeolites. A number of commercial modifications have been developed that improve the energy efficiency of distillation. In the end, choices may be made on the basis of fringe benefits or capital investment costs that affect the economics of the whole process, rather than on the basis of energy efficiency of the purification step alone.

https://openalex.org/W2087582364,"Two studies of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 as related to the future development of nuclear power (particularly breeder reactors) both in the US and other countries are reviewed. Both the Rowen-Wohlstetter study commissioned by the Department of Energy, the National Security Council, and the Council on Environmental Quality and the Ford Foundation sponsored report reinforce the opposing sides of the debate. The Rowen-Wohlstetter report argues strongly against the apparent relaxation of the US position on nonproliferation, while the Ford Foundation report maintains that a policy of denial of nulcear technology is mistaken and counter-productive. It is pointed out that the basic energy needs of any country will probably finally decide its stand on the use of breeder reactors if the technology is available to all people and that there is no real assurance that breeder technology for power cannot be diverted to weapon technology, i.e. India produced a bomb in 1974.

Inasmuch as the material for its study in the rat is in the hands of a student for further investigation, I shall confine myself in this paper to a descrip tion of the two accessory chromosomes as found in man, together with other features of human spermatogenesis. For my studies on man I have been fortunate in being able to obtain exceptionally good material through the courtesy of"

https://openalex.org/W2061188418,"The news aspects of the apparent loss of 20lbs of fuel-grade U at the Erin, TN Nulcear Fuel Services plant are reviewed. It is pointed out that the plant has continually had problems with inventory control. Some reasons for this inbalance in U inventory - other than theft of the material - are cited. These reasons are that there are many places the U could be at the moment of sampling, such as caught in pipes or tanks, lost in scrap, floating around in the air, or a figment of a prior miscalculation. Bias of measurements is also cited as a possible source of error. These possible sources of error, as well as insufficient security, are used as a basis for a recommendation that perhaps all handling of fuel-grade material be removed from NRC supervision and placed under the supervision of the Department of Energy who is more used to dealing with this type of problem. The problem of material accountability is seen as a serious problem if breeder reactors are used for commercial power and if fuel reprocessing is done by commercial firms. (BLM)"
