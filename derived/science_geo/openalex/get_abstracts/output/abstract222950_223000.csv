https://openalex.org/W1986178107,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the basic signaling receptors of the innate immune system. They are activated by molecules associated with pathogens or injured host cells and tissue. TLR3 has been shown to respond to double stranded (ds) RNA, a replication intermediary for many viruses. Here we present evidence that heterologous RNA released from or associated with necrotic cells or generated by in vitro transcription also stimulates TLR3 and induces immune activation. To assess RNA-mediated TLR3 activation, human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing TLR3 and containing a nuclear factor-κB-dependent luciferase reporter were generated. Exposing these cells to in vitro transcribed RNA resulted in a TLR3-dependent induction of luciferase activity and interleukin-8 secretion. Treatment with in vitro transcribed mRNA activated nuclear factor-κB via TLR3 through a process that was dose-dependent and involved tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, in vitro transcribed natural or 2′-fluoro-substituted mRNA induced the expression of TLR3, interferon regulatory factor-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-M mRNA in human dendritic cells (DCs). DCs responded to mRNA treatment by expressing activation markers, and this maturation was inhibited by antagonistic TLR3-specific antibody. Endogenous RNA released from or associated with necrotic cells also stimulated DCs, leading to interferon-α secretion, which could be abolished by pretreatment of necrotic cells with RNase. These results demonstrate that RNA, likely through secondary structure, is a potent host-derived activator of TLR3. This finding has potential physiologic relevance because RNA escaping from damaged tissue or contained within endocytosed cells could serve as an endogenous ligand for TLR3 that induces or otherwise modulates immune responses.

TLRs belong to a family of receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (for review, see Refs. 1Armant M.A. Fenton M.J.

DCs are the primary antigen-presenting cells and the only antigen-presenting cells capable of sensitizing naive T cells. TLRs expressed by immature DCs, upon binding their respective ligands, deliver activation and maturation signals that cause the DCs to migrate to lymphoid tissue and switch from antigen acquisition to antigen presentation. Ligands for most of the TLRs have been identified and consist of bacterial and viral constituents such as unmethylated CpG DNA, dsRNA, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and flagellin (2Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 3Gordon S.

Host-derived ligands for the TLRs have also been identified, and these include heat shock proteins, extracellular matrix breakdown products, chromatin-IgG complexes, pulmonary surfactant, and necrotic cells (for review, see Refs. 3Gordon S.

Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 509-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar).Upon binding of ligand, TLRs have been shown to activate a variety of signaling pathways, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, NF-κB, extracellular signal-related kinase, and interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), each leading to the induction of numerous target genes involved in inflammation, cellular differentiation, and direct antimicrobial activity (8Yamamoto M.

Fukuhara Y. Amano F. Fujita T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A TLR3/4-specific antiviral gene program mediated by the adaptor protein TRIF and involving the activation of IRF-3 has recently been identified (8Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), with TLR3 being the more potent mediator (10Doyle S.E. O'Connell R. Vaidya S.A. Chow E.K. Yee K. Cheng G. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3565-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). IRF-3 transactivates a set of primary genes including IFN-β. Secreted IFN-β then participates in an autocrine/paracrine loop leading to the production of a set of secondary genes that are involved in antiviral and antimicrobial responses (10Doyle S.E. O'Connell R. Vaidya S.A. Chow E.K. Yee K. Cheng G. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3565-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, TLRs are capable of recognizing both pathogen-associated molecular patterns, as well as certain endogenous stimuli, which may function as danger signals (11Matzinger P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 991-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (3935) Google Scholar, 12Matzinger P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 961: 341-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify free and cell-associated RNA as a new host-derived ligand of TLR3 and demonstrate its importance in modulating the phenotype of activated DCs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Reagents—NF-κB-dependent ELAM-1-luciferase reporter plasmid (pELAM-luc) (Jesse Chow, Eisai Research Institute, Andover, MA) and pTEVluc (Daniel Gallie, University of California at Riverside) were used. Generation of pTEVgag (p55 core protein of HIV-1) was described previously (13Weissman D. Ni H. Scales D. Dude A. Capodici J. McGibney K. Abdool A. Isaacs S.N. Cannon G. Karikó K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4710-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). pUNO-TLR3 and pSFV1 were purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA) and Invitrogen, respectively. Expression plasmid pEF-BOS-TRIFΔNΔC for dominant negative TRIF was a gift of S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Plasmid containing Renilla luciferase-encoding sequences (pSVren) were generated from p2luc (John Atkins, University of Utah) (14Grentzmann G. Ingram J.A. Kelly P.J. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) following the removal of the firefly luciferase coding sequence with BamHI and NotI digestions, end-filling, and religation. Cells were treated with the following reagents: 1 ng/ml TNF-α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); 0.1–1 μg/ml LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5) (Sigma); CD40L trimer (a kind gift from Elaine Thomas, Immunex, Seattle, WA); poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(U) single strand (ss) RNA and poly(I)·poly(C) dsRNA (Sigma); 2 μg/ml lipoteichoic acid, 5 μm CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, and 1 μg/ml R-848 (InvivoGen).Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Ogden, UT) (complete medium). A cell line, TLR3-293, derived from HEK293 cells, which was first stably transformed with pELAM-luc and then with pCMV6-XL5 containing human TLR3 cDNA (Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD) was generated. TLR3-293 cells were grown in complete medium with 125 μg/ml Zeocin and 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Leukophoresis samples were obtained from HIV-uninfected volunteers through an IRB-approved protocol. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient purification. DCs were produced as described previously (13Weissman D. Ni H. Scales D. Dude A. Capodici J. McGibney K. Abdool A. Isaacs S.N. Cannon G. Karikó K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4710-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The resulting immature DCs were used between 6 and 9 days after the initial culture of monocytes.Treatment of TLR3-293 Cells—TLR3-293 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) 1 day prior to stimulation and cultured without antibiotics. The following day, the cells were exposed to RNA without or with prior complexing to Lipofectin (Invitrogen) as described previously (15Karikó K. Kuo A. Barnathan E.S. Langer D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1369: 320-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When the treatment was performed in the absence of Lipofectin, cells were exposed to 50 μg/ml mRNA (F-mRNA1 and F-mRNA2) containing 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-substituted nucleotides or mRNA1, or poly(I)·poly(C) that was added to complete medium and incubated for 8 or 16 h. When Lipofectin-complexed RNA was used, cells were exposed to 5 μg/ml poly(C), poly(A), poly(U), poly(G), poly(I)·poly(C), or in vitro transcribed mRNA with or without a cap structure or poly(A) tail, for 1 h. The RNA was then removed, and the cells were incubated further in complete medium for 7 or 15 h. Where noted, cells were pretreated with 3 nm staurosporine, 0.5 μm genistein, 5 mm 2-aminopurine (Sigma), or 40 μm TIRAP peptide (Novagen, Madison, WI) for 30 min prior to stimulation with RNA. Supernatants were collected for IL-8 measurement, and cells were lysed with luciferase lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and analyzed using luciferase assay system (Promega) in a Dynatech MLX luminometer (Chantilly, VA).Transient Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells in 96-well plates at 60–80% confluence were transiently transfected with pUNO-TLR3 and with either pEF-BOS-TRIFΔNΔC (8Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) or pEF-BOS control plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) per the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h later, cells were stimulated with Lipofectin-complexed mRNA1 as described above for TLR3-293 cells, and supernatants were collected 24 h later for IFN-β measurement.In Vitro RNA Transcription—Messenger RNAs encoding gag, firefly luciferase, Renilla luciferase, and the nonstructural polyprotein of Semliki Forest virus were obtained from corresponding plasmids (NdeI, NdeI, SspI, and SpeI-linearized pTEVluc, pTEVgag, pSVren, and pSFV1, respectively) using in vitro transcription assays (MessageMachine and MegaScript kits; Ambion, Austin, TX) as described previously (15Karikó K. Kuo A. Barnathan E.S. Langer D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1369: 320-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The transcripts (TEVluc, TEVgag, Renilla) were designated mRNA1, mRNA2, and mRNA3, respectively. In certain instances, the Dura-Script kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI) was used to generate nuclease-resistant, 2′-F-deoxycytidine and 2′-F-deoxyuridine nucleotide-containing mRNAs (TEVluc and SFV1, designated as F-mRNA1 and F-mRNA2) as described by the manufacturer. All mRNA contained a cap structure and poly(A) tail unless otherwise noted. Assays for LPS in RNA preparations using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate gel clot assay were negative with a sensitivity of 3 pg/ml (Department of Genetics, Cell Center Service Facility, University of Pennsylvania). Transcribed mRNA was treated with DNase I and then precipitated with LiCl to remove any trace amount of DNA. The transcripts were also analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm that the mRNAs were intact, migrate with the expected size, and were free of DNA contaminants.Secondary Structure Analysis of the RNA—RNA secondary structures for mRNA1, mRNA2, and mRNA3 were predicted using mFOLD 3.1 (www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold), which utilizes a free energy minimization algorithm established by Zuker and Stiegler (16Zuker M. Stiegler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar, 17Zuker M. Stiegler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10097) Google Scholar). The longest uninterrupted self-complementary sequences in F-mRNA2 were determined by DotPlot analysis using MegAlign 5.5 (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). 20 μg of in vitro transcript was digested with S1 nuclease (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. S1 nuclease-resistant RNA products were recovered by ethanol (2.5 v/v) precipitation performed in the presence of glycogen carrier and 0.75 m LiCl at -20 °C for 20 h. Precipitate was washed with 75% ethanol and reconstituted in water. Using agarose gel electrophoresis only very low molecular weight cleavage products were detected as a diffuse band capable of retaining ethidium bromide.Analysis of DC Maturation—DCs were treated with the indicated ligands for 24 h. Supernatants were collected for cytokine quantitation, and cells were harvested for flow cytometry. Isotype control or anti-TLR3 antagonistic mAbs (40 μg/ml) (3.7) (eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA) were added 30 min prior to stimulation, when indicated. Necrotic cells were prepared by freeze-thawing HEK293 cells four times. Then, necrotic cells were incubated with or without 1–10 units/106 cells of Benzonase (Novagen) at 4 °C for 6–24 h and added to DCs at a ratio of 2:1. DCs were stained with CD83-phycoerythrin mAb (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) and HLA-DR-fluorescein isothiocyanate mAb and analyzed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays for Cytokines—Supernatants of activated DCs, and HEK293 and TLR3-293 cells were collected at the indicated times for cytokine measurement. The levels of IL-12 (p70) (Pharmingen), IFN-α, IFN-β, and IL-8 (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) were measured in supernatants by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cultures were performed in duplicate to quadruplicate and measured in duplicate.Northern Blot Analysis—DCs plated in 48-well plates (3.3 × 105 cells/well) were treated for 8 or 16 h, as indicated, with the exception of samples containing Lipofectin, which either alone or within an RNA complex was left on the cells for 1 h followed by replacement with fresh medium. Where noted, cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) 30 min prior to the stimulation and throughout the entire length of incubation. At the end of the 8- or 16-h incubation, cells were lysed in 100 μl of guanidinium thiocyanate (Master Blaster, Bio-Rad), and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer. To enhance the RNA yield, 70 μg of glycogen (Roche Diagnostics) was added as carrier, and the precipitation was performed in siliconized tubes at -20 °C overnight. The RNA pellet was reconstituted in 4 μl of nuclease-free water (Promega) and stored at -20 °C. 2-μl RNA samples (∼1 μg) were denatured then separated in denaturing, 1.4% agarose, 0.22 m formaldehyde gel submerged into MESA buffer (Sigma) supplemented with 0.22 m formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to NYTRAN SuperCharge filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and UV cross-linked. The filters were prehybridized at 68 °C for 1 h in MiracleHyb (Stratagene). To probe the Northern blots, 50 ng of DNA was labeled using Redivue [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) with a random prime labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The filters were hybridized at 68 °C for 20 h with MiracleHyb containing the labeled and denatured probe. The filters were washed and exposed to Kodak MS film using an MS intensifier screen at -70 °C for 2–72 h.Probes—Templates for human TNF-α and GAPDH probes were excised and gel purified from plasmids (pE4 and pHcGAP, respectively) obtained from ATCC. Coding sequences for human IRF-1 were excised from a plasmid (accession number BC009483) purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Probes for human TLR3 and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-M were purified cDNAs derived from plasmids generated by TOPO TA cloning (Invitrogen). The TLR3- and IRAK-M-specific PCR products were generated from RNA of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated U937 cells. For TLR3, the 5′ primer (5′-AAGGAAAGGCTAGCAGTC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-TCGGAGCATCAGTCGT-3′) of the coding sequence of human TLR3 were used (Accession: U88879). This probe detected two transcripts (∼3 and 5 kb) in RNA samples. The IRAK-M-specific 5′-primer (5′-TTTCAACCCAAACTAACTGAT-3′) and 3′-primer (5′-CAAGAATGCCCTGGAGCTTC-3′) of human IRAK-M CDS were used (accession number AF113136). This probe detected a 2.5-kb RNA species and two additional spurious transcripts (8 and 9 kb) in the RNA samples. The specificity of all probes was confirmed by sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, University of Pennsylvania).RESULTSIn Vitro Transcribed mRNA Activates the NF-κB Signaling Pathway through TLR3 in TLR3-293 Cells—We demonstrated previously that mRNA containing a poly(A) tail signaled and activated DCs. Two mechanisms were described. The first acted through a P2Y nucleotide receptor and was mediated by the poly(A) tail. The second induced TNF-α and was independent of the poly(A) tail (18Ni H. Capodici J. Cannon G. Communi D. Boeynaems J.M. Karikó K. Weissman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12689-12696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). TLR3 has been demonstrated to signal in response to poly(I)·poly(C) dsRNA but not ssRNA (poly(C) homopolymer) (5Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4849) Google Scholar). Although mRNA is a single strand, it differs from synthetic poly(C) homopolymer in that it contains considerable secondary structure, including double stranded regions. This led us to test whether mRNA signaled through TLR3 and might be the TNF-α-inducing activity observed in our earlier experiments (18Ni H. Capodici J. Cannon G. Communi D. Boeynaems J.M. Karikó K. Weissman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12689-12696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). mRNA is intrinsically unstable in tissue culture because of the presence of RNases, so different formulations of ssRNA and dsRNA were complexed to Lipofectin, which provides protection against RNase-mediated degradation. These Lipofectin-complexed RNAs were added to HEK293 cells stably transfected with human TLR3 and the ELAM-luc reporter plasmid, which responds to NF-κB activation by production of luciferase. Neither Lipofectin alone nor poly(C) nor poly(U) homopolymer complexed to Lipofectin activated TLR3. However, HIV gag-encoding mRNA complexed to Lipofectin induced luciferase activity, demonstrating signaling through TLR3. The presence of a poly(A) tail or cap structure on the mRNA was not required for TLR3 signaling (Fig. 1A). The addition of mRNA to HEK293 cells that contained only the ELAM-luc reporter plasmid demonstrated no signaling, but the addition of poly(I)·poly(C) dsRNA yielded low level luciferase production (data not shown). A subsequent Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of a small amount of endogenous TLR3 mRNA in the parental HEK293 cells (data not shown).The instability of mRNA in tissue culture systems required the use of Lipofectin as a stabilization reagent to be able to measure mRNA signaling. Lipofectin did not seem to affect TLR3 signaling because similar induction was seen with both Lipofectin-complexed and free poly(I)·poly(C) dsRNA (Fig. 1, A and B). However, it is conceivable that Lipofectin complexing might lead to structural alteration of mRNA, causing it to signal through TLR3. To exclude this possibility, we generated RNase-resistant mRNA containing 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-substituted nucleotides (2′-F-deoxycytidine and 2′-F-deoxyuridine). Two mRNAs, encoding luciferase and the Semliki Forest virus nonstructural genes, were made with fluoro-substituted nucleosides. We found that neither of these mRNAs was translated in HEK293 cells. 2K. Karikó, unpublished observation. These RNAs, delivered without complexing to Lipofectin and in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, signaled TLR3-293 cells with about half the efficiency of poly(I)·poly(C) (Fig. 1B).We were also concerned about the use of a synthetic promoter reporter system. Transcriptional regulation, even of the same promoter, can differ considerably between a stably integrated promoter versus the endogenous locus because of differences in chromatin structure and other variables in the promoter environment (19Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Weinmann A.S. Mitchell D.M. Sanjabi S. Bradley M.N. Hoffmann A. Liou H.C. Smale S.T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Additionally, the luciferase transcription unit has been reported to confer ambiguous promoter-independent responsiveness in certain cell lines (21Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to demonstrate that stimulation of TLR3 by mRNA could induce transcription of an endogenous locus. It was reported previously that HEK293 cells transfected with TLR4 produced IL-8 in response to specific ligand (22Yang H. Young D.W. Gusovsky F. Chow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20861-20866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed supernatants from TLR3-expressing HEK293 cells for IL-8 production after stimulation with RNA. Interestingly, in the absence of Lipofectin, these cells exhibited a high base-line secretion of IL-8 (typically 100–400 pg/ml) with a significant increase in IL-8 after poly(I)·poly(C) or mRNA stimulation. In the presence of Lipofectin, endogenous IL-8 secretion was greatly reduced (less than 10 pg/ml), although ligand-induced secretion remained intact. We found that mRNAs encoding HIV gag or Renilla luciferase induced the secretion of IL-8 at levels comparable with that observed for poly(I)·poly(C) (Fig. 1C). Using IL-8 as a readout of TLR3 signaling allowed us to observe more easily concentration-dependent induction by mRNA (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that mRNAs can efficiently signal through TLR3 and are functionally different from synthetic ssRNA homopolymers, which cannot signal through TLR3.mRNA Treatment Induces IRF-1, IRAK-M, TNF-α, and TLR3 mRNAs in Human DCs—To confirm the role of extracellular mRNA as a TLR3 ligand in primary cells, we treated DCs with various RNA constructs and used Northern blot analysis to monitor changes in the expression of genes known to be involved in dsRNA-mediated signaling. First, we examined IRF-1, a transcription factor whose mRNA accumulates in response to stimulation by various cytokines, including type I IFN and dsRNA (for review, see Refs. 23Kroger A. Koster M. Schroeder K. Hauser H. Mueller P.P. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 24Sato M. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from IRF-1 knock-out mice exhibit defective production of type I IFN after poly(I)·poly(C) treatment, suggesting the involvement of IRF-1 in type I IFN induction by dsRNA (26Matsuyama T. Kimura T. Kitagawa M. Pfeffer K. Kawakami T. Watanabe N. Kündig T.M. Amakawa R. Kishihara K. Wakeham A. Potter J. Furlonger C.L. Narendran A. Suzuki H. Ohashi P.S. Paige C.J. Taniguchi T. Mak T.W. Cell. 1993; 75: 83-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). To test whether TLR3 stimulation with different RNA constructs would lead to the transcriptional up-regulation of IRF-1, Northern blot analysis was performed on DCs that were treated for 8 h with RNA. These RNAs included in vitro transcribed conventional and 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-substituted mRNA, poly(C) homopolymer, and poly(I)·poly(C). We observed that IRF-1 mRNA was induced in response to both mRNA and poly(I)·poly(C), but not to RNA homopolymer (Fig. 2A). IFN-α is known to induce IRF-1, but we found that addition of cycloheximide did not block IRF-1 induction (Fig. 2A), suggesting that IRF-1 induction by mRNA does not require new protein synthesis and is therefore a direct result of primary signal transduction.Fig. 2Up-regulation of IRF-1, IRAK-M, TNF-α, and TLR3 mRNAs in DCs stimulated with mRNA. Monocyte-derived DCs were stimulated with the indicated ligands for 8 or 16 h, after which total cellular RNA was analyzed for expression of IRF-1, IRAK-M, TNF-α, TLR3, and GAPDH genes by Northern blotting. A, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml Lipofectin-complexed RNA (mRNA1) or 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-substituted mRNA (F-mRNA1), poly(C), or poly(I)·poly(C); or Lipofectin alone (none). The experiment was performed in the presence or absence of 2.5 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RNA was harvested after an 8-h incubation and analyzed for IRF-1 expression. B, DCs were exposed to several TLR ligands: 0.1 μg/ml LPS, 50 μg/ml poly(I)·poly(C), 1 μg/ml R-848, 5 μm CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), and 2 μg/ml lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or to 2 ng/ml TNF-α for 16 h. Expression of IRAK-M, TNF-α, IRF-1, and GAPDH mRNAs was analyzed by Northern blotting. C, cells were exposed to 50 μg/ml conventional RNA (mRNA1) or fluoro-substituted RNA (F-mRNA1), or poly(I)·poly(C) without Lipofectin complexing in the presence or absence of 2.5 μg/ml cycloheximide for 8 h. Cellular RNA was analyzed for expression of IRAK-M, TNF-α, and GAPDH genes. D, DCs were exposed to Lipofectin alone (none), RNA complexed to Lipofectin (5 μg/ml mRNA1 or poly(C)), or to uncomplexed RNA (50 μg/ml poly(I)·poly(C), poly(C), poly(U), or poly(A)) added directly to the medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In addition, cells were unstimulated or exposed to 2 ng/ml TNF-α or 1 μg/ml CD40L, 10% serum with 1 μg/ml LPS, or serum alone. Cellular RNA, harvested 16 h after initiation of the treatments, was tested for expression of TLR3 and GAPDH mRNAs.

https://openalex.org/W2084172300,"Before ovulation in mammals, a cascade of events resembling an inflammatory and/or tissue remodeling process is triggered by luteinizing hormone (LH) in the ovarian follicle. Many LH effects, however, are thought to be indirect because of the restricted expression of its receptor. Here, we demonstrate that LH stimulation induces the transient and sequential expression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family members amphiregulin, epiregulin, and beta-cellulin. Incubation of follicles with these growth factors recapitulates the morphological and biochemical events triggered by LH, including cumulus expansion and oocyte maturation. Thus, these EGF-related growth factors are paracrine mediators that propagate the LH signal throughout the follicle."

Air-sea interaction over sea surface temperature fronts throughout the world ocean is evident in both the curl and divergence fields, as are the influences of islands and coastal mountains. Ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream generate distinctive patterns in the curl field. These previously unresolved features have important implications for oceanographic and air-sea interaction research."

These structures behave like mesoscopic amphiphiles and form a series of single-layer superstructures consisting of bundles, tubes, and sheets depending upon the compositional periodicity. Unlike molecular systems, the template used to initially synthesize them plays a critical role in the assembly process by prealigning them in a manner that facilitates their assembly by optimizing the correct collisional orientation upon dissolution of the template. Tubular structures with tailorable diameters can be assembled in a predictable manner on the basis of an estimate of the hybrid rod packing parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2125686513,"Several human and animal Ebola outbreaks have occurred over the past 4 years in Gabon and the Republic of Congo. The human outbreaks consisted of multiple simultaneous epidemics caused by different viral strains, and each epidemic resulted from the handling of a distinct gorilla, chimpanzee, or duiker carcass. These animal populations declined markedly during human Ebola outbreaks, apparently as a result of Ebola infection. Recovered carcasses were infected by a variety of Ebola strains, suggesting that Ebola outbreaks in great apes result from multiple virus introductions from the natural host. Surveillance of animal mortality may help to predict and prevent human Ebola outbreaks."

Here, I use the chronological arrangement of the Hawaiian Islands to visualize snapshots of evolutionary history and stages of community assembly. Analysis of an adaptive radiation of habitat-associated, polychromatic spiders shows that (i) species assembly is not random; (ii) within any community, similar sets of ecomorphs arise through both dispersal and evolution; and (iii) species assembly is dynamic with maximum species numbers in communities of intermediate age.

The 2.05 angstrom structure of a complex of the NG GTPase domains of Ffh and FtsY reveals a remarkably symmetric heterodimer sequestering a composite active site that contains two bound nucleotides. The structure explains the coordinate activation of the two GTPases. Conformational changes coupled to formation of their extensive interface may function allosterically to signal formation of the targeting complex to the signal-sequence binding site and the translocon. We propose that the complex represents a molecular ""latch"" and that its disengagement is regulated by completion of assembly of the GTPase active site."

Only a small fraction of mitochondrial copper is associated with these cuproproteins. The bulk of the remainder is localized within the matrix as a soluble, anionic, low molecular weight complex.

However, in the absence of CCS within the matrix, the activation of human Sod1 can be achieved by the addition of copper salts to the growth medium. Copper is an essential cell nutrient acting as a cofactor in nearly 20 enzymes (1Linder M.C. Hazegh-Azam M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63: 797S-811SGoogle Scholar). However, excess accumulation of copper ions results in toxicity. Evidence for the effectiveness of copper ions as a toxin comes from its historic use as a fungicide, molluscide, and algicide. Homeostatic mechanisms exist in cells to regulate the cellular concentration of copper ions, thus maintaining copper balance and minimizing deleterious effects. Cells appear to maintain a quota for essential metal ions; this quota is primarily the quantity necessary to metallate the various copper proteins (2Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Google Scholar, 3Finney L.A. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2003; 300: 931-936Google Scholar). Copper ions are required for at least three key enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cuproenzymes include the cytosolic superoxide dismutase Sod1, 1The abbreviations used are: Sod, superoxide dismutase; CcO, cytochrome c oxidase; IMS, mitochondrial intermembrane space; IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane; h-, human; y-, yeast; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MS, mass spectroscopy; ICP-OES, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. the plasma membrane ferroxidase Fet3, and the mitochondrial inner membrane enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). The copper quota of the yeast S. cerevisiae is about 5 × 105 atoms per cell (3Finney L.A. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2003; 300: 931-936Google Scholar, 4Rae R.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-807Google Scholar). It is unclear what fraction of the 5 × 105 copper atoms per cell is from copper in Sod1, Fet3, and CcO. Expression of these copper-binding proteins varies with growth conditions, suggesting that the copper may be distributed differently depending on growth conditions. Clearly, a significant fraction of the cellular copper is associated with Sod1; however, not all Sod1 molecules are metallated (4Rae R.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-807Google Scholar, 5Culotta V.C. Joh H.D. Lin S.J. Slekar K.H. Strain J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29991-29997Google Scholar). Fet3 requires four copper ions for activity, but levels of this protein are dependent on iron status of the medium (6Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Google Scholar). CcO levels vary depending on whether the cells are grown by fermentation or respiration. In addition, a varying quantity of cellular copper exists bound to two metallothioneins, Cup1 and Crs5 (7Karin M. Najarian R. Haslinger A. Valenzuela P. Welch J. Fogel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 337-341Google Scholar, 8Jensen L.T. Howard W.R. Strain J.J. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18514-18519Google Scholar). Expression of CUP1 and CRS5 is regulated by copper levels through the copper-responsive transcription factor Ace1 (9Furst P. Hu S. Hackett R. Hamer D. Cell. 1988; 55: 705-717Google Scholar, 10Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2745-2752Google Scholar). An increase in the free Cu(I) ion pool activates Ace1 through formation of a polycopper cluster (11Dameron C.T. Winge D.R. George G.N. Sansone M. Hu S. Hamer D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6127-6131Google Scholar). Activated Ace1 induces transcription of CUP1, CRS5, and SOD1. Each protein is capable of buffering the copper ion concentration in the cytoplasm. Copper buffering regulated by Ace1 must be highly efficient because yeast cells are predicted to lack a pool of free copper ions in the cytoplasm (4Rae R.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-807Google Scholar). Cells concentrate copper by several orders of magnitude from the culture medium to achieve the copper quota (2Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Google Scholar). This gradient is generated by multiple metal ion permeases on the plasma membrane. Copper ion uptake is mediated by high affinity Ctr1 and Ctr3 and low affinity Smf1 and Fet4 permeases (12Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Google Scholar). Within the cell other transporters are necessary for transmembrane movement of copper ions. Translocation of copper ions into the lumen of trans-Golgi vesicles is achieved by P-type ATPase transporters (Ccc2 in yeast, ATP7A and ATP7B in animal cells) (13Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar). Translocation of copper ions across the vacuolar membrane is mediated by Ctr2 (14Portnoy M.E. Schmidt P.J. Rogers R.S. Culotta V.C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 873-882Google Scholar). Copper ions are shuttled to sites of utilization by protein-mediated transfer (15Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 677-701Google Scholar, 16Field L.S. Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 373-379Google Scholar). Metallochaperones facilitate the transport of copper ions to specific sites through a chelating environment and prevent the inappropriate interaction of copper ions with other molecules. Copper insertion into Sod1 in yeast requires the function of the Lys7 (CCS) metallochaperone (4Rae R.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-807Google Scholar, 17Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Google Scholar, 18Gamonet F. Lauquin G.J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 716-723Google Scholar, 19Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Google Scholar). In the absence of CCS copper ions are not inserted into yeast Sod1 unless cells are incubated in medium containing high levels of copper salts, and this requirement is attenuated by a decrease in levels of the metallothioneins by a deletion of ACE1 (4Rae R.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-807Google Scholar). This is an indication of the cytosolic copper-buffering capacity of Cup1. Copper insertion into Fet3 occurs within post-Golgi vesicles. The copper is translocated across the vesicular membrane by the Ccc2 P-type ATPase (13Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar). Cu(I) ions are shuttled to the Ccc2 translocase by the Atx1 metallochaperone (20Lin S.-J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V.O. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Google Scholar, 21Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Google Scholar). Deletion of either Ccc2 or Atx1 results in apo-Fet3 and an inability to grow on iron-deficient medium (20Lin S.-J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V.O. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Google Scholar). Cu(I) ions translocated by the Ccc2 pump can also be used to metallate heterologous molecules within trans-Golgi vesicles (22El Meskini R. Culotta V.C. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12278-12284Google Scholar). The mechanism of copper ion routing to the mitochondrion for assembly of cytochrome c oxidase is unknown. Because copper ion delivery to Sod1 and Ccc2 is protein-mediated, the prediction is that copper shuttling to the mitochondrion will also be protein-mediated. Two proteins implicated in copper ion translocation to the mitochondrion are Cox17 and Cox19 (23Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar, 24Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Google Scholar, 25Nobrega M.P. Bandeira S.C.B. Beers J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40206-40211Google Scholar). Both proteins are conserved in eukaryotic cells and exhibit a dual localization in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) (24Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Google Scholar, 25Nobrega M.P. Bandeira S.C.B. Beers J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40206-40211Google Scholar). The IMS is an aqueous space between the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) and outer membrane (OM) and is interrupted by junction points in which the IM and OM are in contact (26Reichert A.S. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 41-49Google Scholar). Cox17 has been implicated in copper ion delivery to the mitochondria based on its dual localization and the fact that the respiratory defect of cox17-1 cells is suppressed by high levels of copper in the growth medium (23Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar). A copper transport function for Cox17 is plausible because it binds Cu(I) through three critical cysteinyl residues in a Cys-Cys-Xaa-Cys sequence motif (27Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Google Scholar). Cox19 shows weak sequence similarity to Cox17 in the conservation of three C-terminal Cys residues (25Nobrega M.P. Bandeira S.C.B. Beers J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40206-40211Google Scholar); however, these Cys residues in Cox17 are not part of the Cu(I) binding motif (27Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking Cox17 or Cox19 are respiratory-deficient and devoid of cytochrome c oxidase activity. Suppression of these phenotypes by the addition of exogenous copper is observed only in cox17 cells. Within the mitochondrion two additional inner membrane proteins, Sco1 and Cox11, are implicated in copper ion insertion into cytochrome c oxidase (28Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 492-498Google Scholar, 29Krummeck G. Rödel G. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 13-15Google Scholar, 30Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Google Scholar, 31Rentzsch N. Krummeck-WeiB G. Hofer A. Bartuschka A. Ostermann K. Rodel G. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 103-108Google Scholar, 32Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Google Scholar, 33Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Google Scholar). Sco1 and Cox11 are important in reactions of direct copper transfer to the CuA site and CuB site, respectively. The two copper centers exist within mitochondrially encoded subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, so copper ions must be shuttled to the mitochondrion for insertion into nascent chains within the inner membrane. Cox17 may deliver Cu(I) to both Sco1 and Cox11 for subsequent donation to the CuA and CuB sites. Alternatively, separate shuttle proteins may exist for Sco1 and Cox11. If Cox17 functions in the delivery of Cu(I) ions to the mitochondrion, it may deliver Cu(I) ions to a mitochondrial OM transporter, in analogy to the Atx1 routing of Cu(I) ions to the Ccc2 trans-Golgi translocase. Alternatively, Cox17 may ferry Cu(I) ions across the semiporous mitochondrial OM. Many proteins are imported across the OM through the translocase of the outer membrane import complex, but these proteins are imported as unfolded proteins (34Gaume B. Klaus C. Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6497-6507Google Scholar, 35Pfanner N. Wiedemann N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 400-411Google Scholar). Import of Cu(I) across the OM by Cox17 would necessitate import of the folded conformer to retain its copper cargo. The only other known mitochondrial copper protein is Sod1, which exhibits a dual localization within the cytosol and the IMS (36Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Google Scholar). Approximately 1-5% of total Sod1 is localized within the IMS (36Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Google Scholar). The fraction of IMS Sod1 is partially dependent on the CCS metallochaperone (37Field L.S. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28052-28059Google Scholar). Directed import of CCS to the IMS compartment using a heterologous mitochondrial import sequence enhances accumulation of Sod1 within the IMS, although Sod1 can still localize to the IMS in the absence of CCS (36Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Google Scholar, 37Field L.S. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28052-28059Google Scholar). Copper ion metallation of Sod1 likely occurs within the IMS because mitochondrial Sod1 import is dependent on the apo conformer (37Field L.S. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28052-28059Google Scholar). The source of copper ions for the CCS-mediated metallation of Sod1 in the IMS is unknown, but Cox17 does not appear to influence formation of active Sod1 within the IMS (36Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Google Scholar). Likewise, CCS does not affect CcO function (17Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Google Scholar). We show that neither Cox17 nor Cox19 is required for the import or accumulation of copper in the mitochondrion, suggesting that neither acts as metallo shuttles for the bulk of mitochondrial copper. We show for the first time that a significant pool of copper exists within the mitochondrion that is not associated with either CcO or Sod1. This pool fractionates with matrix markers and does not appear to be proteinaceous. This pool of copper can be utilized to metallate a heterologous molecule, human Sod1, targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. Yeast Strains—A W303 based cox17 strain (W303: MAT a, ade2-1, his3-1,15, leu2,3,112, trp1-1, ura3-1, Δcox17::TRP1), obtained from Dr. Alexander Tzagoloff, and its isogenic wild-type strain were used for all Cox17 experiments. BY4741 strains deleted for ACE1, SOD2, LYS7, and CCC2 were purchased from Research Genetics. Cells lacking Vps33 were obtained from Dr. Jerry Kaplan. Cells lacking Cox2 were provided by Drs. R. Poyton and T. Fox. The cox17/cox19 double null mutant was isolated by deleting COX19 in a W303 cox17Δ strain using KanMX. Expression Vector—Human SOD1 obtained from Dr. P. J. Hart was inserted into YCpRS316 and fused to the 5′ 27 codons of the yeast SOD2 ORF that encode the mitochondrial target sequence. The fusion gene, designated SOD2/hSOD1, was under the control of the SOD2 promoter with the hSOD1 terminator. A variant of this fusion gene was constructed in which only the promoter of SOD2 was fused to hSOD1. This fusion, designated hSod1(c), lacked the mitochondrial target sequence of Sod2 and gave cytosolic expression. These constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. CCS-encoding plasmids pLS114 and pLS117 were generously provided by Dr. Val Culotta. Both contain CCS (LYS7) fused to segments of CYB2 in pRS313. Plasmid pLS117 encodes a fusion of the CYB2 IMS-targeting sequence to LYS7 (37Field L.S. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28052-28059Google Scholar), whereas pLS114 encodes a chimera of 80 codons of CYB2 fused to LYS7 that targets CCS to the matrix. 2V. Culotta, personal communication. Plasmids were transformed into yeast by the lithium acetate protocol. Preparation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (38Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Google Scholar). Briefly, lyticase was used to create spheroplasts that were gently ruptured in a glass Dounce homogenizer. After the spheroplasts were lysed crude mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation in the presence of 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell debris was pelleted at 1,500 × g, mitochondria and microsomes were pelleted at 12,000 × g; the supernatant represented the post-mitochondrial fraction. The crude mitochondria were then loaded onto a discontinuous Nycodenz gradient (16% on 22%) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The intact mitochondria recovered from the gradient interface were washed in isotonic buffer and pelleted at 12,000 × g before analysis. Mitochondria were quantified using standard Bradford protein reagents. For hypotonic lysis, the intact mitochondria were diluted 20-fold into 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g to isolate the soluble IMS. The pellet was retained as mitoplasts and later fractionated into soluble and membrane fractions by sonication or carbonate treatment in 100 mm NaCO3, pH 11. Western Blots—10-25 μg of total protein from the mitochondrial or post-mitochondrial fraction were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel system and electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 1× PBS (50 mm Na3PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), 0.01% Tween 20, and 10% milk solution before protein detection. Antisera to porin (Por1), phosphoglycerol kinase (Pgk1), the vacuolar H-ATPase subunit Vma2, and dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (Dpm1) were obtained from Molecular Probes. Antiserum to cytochrome b2 (Cyb2) was kindly provided by Dr. R. Stuart. Antisera to ySod1 and ySod2 were provided by Dr. V. C. Culotta and to hSod1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Blots were reprobed after stripping in 5 washes of 25 mm glycine, pH 2.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween20. Loading controls were performed using porin (mitochondria) and phosphoglycerol kinase (cytosol). ICP-OES Analysis—Three concentrations (1, 3, and 5 mg/ml) of intact mitochondria were digested in sealed, acid-washed tubes at 95 ° in 150 μl of metal-free 40% nitric acid (Optima). The samples were then diluted to 1 ml into double-distilled water for analysis. Serial dilutions of commercially available mixed metal standards were used to construct a standard curve. Blanks of nitric acid or buffer samples were also digested in the acid-washed tubes for comparison, and spiked controls were analyzed to ensure reproducibility. Cytochrome c Oxidase Assays—CcO oxidase activity in isolated mitochondria was quantified by monitoring the reduction of 32 μm bovine cytochrome c at 550 nm by 5-10 μg of isolated mitochondria (40 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.7, 0.5% Tween 20). Mitochondrial Fractionation—Purified mitochondria were lysed by three 30-s pulses of sonication at 50% output of a microtip. The soluble fraction was isolated from the insoluble fraction by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. The soluble fraction was diluted into buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) and filtered with a 0.45 μm syringe filter. The sample was the loaded onto a HR10/10 Mono Q column equilibrated in 10 column volumes of buffer A. The unbound protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer A. A 25-column-volume gradient of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 m NaCl) was then initiated. Fractions were collected and analyzed by ICP-OES after dilution in 10% nitric acid. The remainder of the metal-containing fractions was then loaded onto a size exclusion column (HR10/30 Superdex200 or Superdex 75) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl. Fractions were collected throughout the run and analyzed by ICP-OES after dilution into 10% nitric acid. The remainder of the sample was used for SDS-PAGE analysis or further desalted for mass spectrometry. Copper Delivery to the Mitochondria—Cox17 and Cox19 have been implicated as mitochondrial copper ion shuttles for assembly of cytochrome c oxidase based on their dual localization in both the cytoplasm and the IMS of mitochondria (24Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Google Scholar). In addition, both proteins are capable of binding copper ions. We demonstrated previously that Cox17 binds Cu(I) within a polycopper-thiolate cluster (39Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochem. 2001; 40: 743-751Google Scholar). Recombinant Cox19 is also a copper-binding protein. 3K. Rigby, unpublished observation. If Cox17 and/or Cox19 are dominant copper ion shuttles for assembly of CcO, the prediction is that cells lacking Cox17 or Cox19 would have depressed mitochondrial copper levels. The copper levels were measured in Nycodenz-purified mitochondria from a variety of cells lacking one of the CcO assembly factors. The amount of copper within the mitochondrion was independent of the presence of Cox17 or Cox19 (Fig. 1A). Although Cox17 and Cox19 cannot complement each other, a potential redundant role was investigated by testing a double cox17,cox19 null strain. As shown in Fig. 1A, the mitochondrial copper was not affected by this double deletion. In fact, the mitochondrial copper concentration was not markedly diminished in yeast lacking Cox2, which is the mitochondrially encoded subunit of CcO that forms the CuA site, or in rho- cells, which are devoid of mitochondrially encoded proteins. The level of mitochondrial copper was independent of the carbon source used for culturing yeast (data not shown). The lack of an appreciable diminution in mitochondrial copper in cells lacking a functional CcO complex suggests that mitochondria contain a pool of copper not associated with CcO or CcO assembly proteins. Non-respiratory Pool of Mitochondrial Copper—To measure the fraction of mitochondrial copper associated with the CcO complex, we quantified the heme A pool within mitochondria. CcO is the only protein to use heme A, and all heme A is associated with the active, oligomeric CcO complex. Yeast mutants exhibiting defects in assembly of CcO (e.g. cox11, cox17, cox19, and sco1) are devoid of heme A within the mitochondrion (23Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar, 30Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Google Scholar, 40Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Google Scholar). Using an established extinction coefficient for heme A+A3, the amount of CcO can be quantified from the difference absorption spectrum of oxidized versus reduced cytochromes (41Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarion K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Google Scholar). Because the active CcO binds three copper ions per complex, the fraction of mitochondrial copper associated with CcO can be determined. This analysis revealed that ∼10% of the mitochondrial copper was associated with CcO (Fig. 1B). This calculation is based on the assumption that all CcO molecules are copper-loaded. This assumption is reasonable because it is known that mutants that fail to insert copper into CcO result in an unstable complex that does not contain heme A (23Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar, 30Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Google Scholar). The ratio of copper to total protein or heme A was unaffected by growth in a non-fermentable carbon source. This is consistent with the deletion mutant data in Fig. 1A showing that removal of a CcO subunit or several assembly factors has no significant effect on the copper levels. The known assembly factors involved in copper ion metallation of CcO are not likely to contribute to the mitochondrial copper pool because they are low abundance proteins. A recent mitochondrion proteomic study showed Sco1 to be a low abundant protein comparable in levels of the CcO subunit Cox6 (42Ohlmeier S. Kastaniotis A.J. Hiltunen J.K. Bergmann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3956-3979Google Scholar). The copper pool is associated with the mitochondrion and not a copurifying organelle. Gradient-purified mitochondrial may contain limited vacuolar and ER contamination (38Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Google Scholar). Western analyses were conducted on crude and gradient-purified mitochondria to address contamination. Vacuolar and ER markers were readily apparent in the crude mitochondrial fraction, but the marker proteins were significantly reduced in the purified mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 2A). Despite a marked diminution in vacuolar and ER markers in gradient-purified mitochondria, the copper content (nmol of copper/mg of protein) did not appreciably change. The variance observed in 10 independent gradient purifications was less than 30%, with multiple isolates having a greater copper content in the purified relative to the crude fraction. To confirm that vacuolar contamination is not the source of the mitochondrial copper, mitochondria were purified from vps33 mutant cells that have abnormally small vacuoles (43Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Google Scholar). The mitochondrial copper content was unchanged as was the ratio of copper to heme A, confirming that the copper did not arise from vacuolar contamination (Fig. 2B). To confirm that ER/Golgi vesicle contamination was not a concern, mitochondria isolated from ccc2 null cells were analyzed. Ccc2 is the P-type ATPase copper transporter that is responsible for translocation of Cu(I) into post-Golgi vesicles. The mitochondrial copper content in ccc2 cells was similar to that of wild-type cells (Fig. 2B). The Mitochondrial Copper Pool Is Not Associated with Known Yeast Copper Proteins—The only two known copper enzymes within mitochondria are CcO and Sod1. A fraction of the cytosolic Cu,Zn Sod1 partitions in the mitochondrial IMS (36Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Google Scholar). The CCS metallochaperone responsible for copper insertion into Sod1 is involved in the recruitment of Sod1 to the IMS (36Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Google Scholar). Cells lacking CCS have diminished levels of Sod1 within the IMS. We observed that deletion of LYS7 encoding CCS does not significantly diminish the mitochondrial copper pool (Fig. 3). Two other cytosolic copper-binding proteins include the Cup1 and Crs5 metallothioneins. Both proteins bind multiple Cu(I) ions within polycopper clusters (8Jensen L.T. Howard W.R. Strain J.J. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18514-18519Google Scholar). Distribution of these molecules within the mitochondrion may contribute a significant quantity of mitochondrial copper. Expression of CUP1 and CRS5 is regulated by the copper-responsive transcriptional activator Ace1. Deletion of ACE1 results in a marked decrease in basal CUP1 and CRS5 expression in yeast (44Culotta V.C. Howard W.R. Liu X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-8Google Scholar). Cup1 and Crs5 do not contribute to the mitochondrial copper pool because ace1Δ cells have wild-type levels of mitochondrial copper (Fig. 3). Similarly, crs5Δ cells have at least wild-type levels of mitochondrial copper. The only other known cuproenzymes in yeast are the plasma membrane Fet3 and vacuolar Fet5 ferrooxidases (45Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Google Scholar, 46Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Google Scholar). Neither of these is expected to contaminate the copper pool in gradient-purified mitochondria. In addition, the mitochondrial copper pool is unperturbed in cells cultured in high iron-containing medium in which Fet3 and Fet5 are lowly expressed. The mitochondrial copper pool is not attenuated by overexpressi"
https://openalex.org/W2037999193,"We applied global waveform tomography to model radial anisotropy in the whole mantle. We found that in the last few hundred kilometers near the core-mantle boundary, horizontally polarized S-wave velocities (VSH) are, on average, faster (by approximately 1%) than vertically polarized S-wave velocities (VSV), suggesting a large-scale predominance of horizontal shear. This confirms that the D"" region at the base of the mantle is also a mechanical boundary layer for mantle convection. A notable exception to this average signature can be found at the base of the two broad low-velocity regions under the Pacific Ocean and under Africa, often referred to as ""superplumes,"" where the anisotropic pattern indicates the onset of vertical flow."
https://openalex.org/W1996789239,"During apoptosis, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria into the cytosol, where it participates in caspase activation. Various and often conflicting mechanisms have been proposed to account for the increased permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane that is responsible for this process. The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is the major permeability pathway for metabolites in the mitochondrial outer membrane and therefore is a very attractive candidate for cytochrome c translocation. Here, we report that properties of VDAC channels reconstituted into planar phospholipid membranes are unaffected by addition of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax under a variety of conditions. Contrary to other reports (Shimizu, S., Narita, M., and Tsujimoto, Y. (1999) Nature 399, 483-487; Shimizu, S., Ide, T., Yanagida, T., and Tsujimoto, Y. (2000) J. Biol.

We conclude that Bax does not induce cytochrome c release by acting on VDAC. In contrast to Bax, another pro-apoptotic protein (Bid) proteolytically cleaved with caspase-8 affected the voltage gating of VDAC by inducing channel closure.

The crucial role of mitochondria in the initiation of apoptosis is well established. Triggered by a number of different stimuli, the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) 1The abbreviations used are: MOM, mitochondrial outer membrane; BH, Bcl-2 homology domain; tBid, truncated Bid; BaxFL, full-length Bax; tcBid, 15.5-kDa C-terminal fragment of caspase-8-cleaved Bid; DPhPC, diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine; nS, nanosiemens; PTP, permeability transition pore. becomes permeable to apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO (4Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Google Scholar, 5Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 45-53Google Scholar). The release of these factors leads to caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and other characteristic changes associated with apoptotic cell death. So far, it remains unclear exactly how MOM permeabilization occurs, and published results are often contradictory (for reviews, see Refs. 6Desagher S. Martinou J.-C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Google Scholar, 7Martinou J.-C. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Google Scholar, 8Waterhouse N.J. Ricci J.-E. Green D.R. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 113-121Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates the permeabilization of MOM. Pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bid induce the release of apoptogenic factors, whereas anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent their release. There are two prevailing theories for the permeabilization of the outer membrane. One is that MOM is nonspecifically ruptured; the other proposes the formation of channels that allow cytochrome c release (6Desagher S. Martinou J.-C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Google Scholar, 7Martinou J.-C. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Google Scholar). One of the channel models is based on the ability of Bax to form channels when incorporated into lipid membranes (9Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A.M. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.-J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.-C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Google Scholar, 10Schlesinger P.H. Gross A. Yin X.M. Yamamoto K. Saito M. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11357-11362Google Scholar). It has been reported that Bax can form oligomers of multiple sizes that have features of ion channels large enough to release cytochrome c (11Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.-C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Google Scholar). Soluble monomeric Bax is not capable of forming channels in lipid membranes and does not trigger the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria (11Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.-C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Google Scholar). Thus, channel formation is associated with the formation of oligomers. Bax oligomerization has been proposed to be triggered by the BH3 domain-only protein Bid after cleavage by caspase-8 into the truncated form, tBid (12Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Google Scholar, 13Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Google Scholar). However, the situation has been complicated by a recent report that tBid itself homopolymerizes, and this process, without the participation of Bax, results in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (14Grinberg M. Sarig R. Zaltsman Y. Frumkin D. Grammatikakis N. Reuveny E. Gross A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12237-12245Google Scholar). In addition, it has been observed that tBid promotes leakage in planar lipid membranes and liposomes in the absence of other proteins (15Schendel S.L. Azimov R. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Kagan B.L. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21932-21936Google Scholar, 16Zhai D. Huang X. Han X. Yang F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 293-296Google Scholar, 17Kudla G. Montessuit S. Eskes R. Berrier C. Martinou J.-C. Ghazi A. Antonsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22713-22718Google Scholar). In all these studies, the channel/pore-forming ability was attributed to Bax and Bid; however, it is still an open question whether such channels are formed in vivo. There are two other channel models that associate the Bcl-2 family proteins with the existing major channel in MOM, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). This channel is known to be responsible for most of the metabolite flux across this membrane (18Colombini M. Curr. Top. Membr. 1994; 42: 73-101Google Scholar, 19Rostovtseva T. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28006-28008Google Scholar, 20Rostovtseva T. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1954-1962Google Scholar, 21Hodge T. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 271-279Google Scholar). Thus, VDAC is a very attractive candidate for a pathway for cytochrome c release. When reconstituted into planar membranes, the 30-kDa VDAC monomer forms an aqueous pore 2.5-3 nm in diameter (18Colombini M. Curr. Top. Membr. 1994; 42: 73-101Google Scholar, 22Mannella C.A. Guo X.W. Cognon B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 231-234Google Scholar, 23Song J. Midson C. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24406-24413Google Scholar) that allows uncharged polymers (such as inulin, dextran, and polyethylene glycol with a molecular mass of ∼5000 Da) to cross membranes (24Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 53: 79-84Google Scholar, 25Zalman L.S. Nikaido H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1771-1774Google Scholar). However, the apparent size of the channel is very different for charged molecules. The channel even discriminates between different molecules based on their three-dimensional structure (26Rostovtseva T.K. Komarov A. Bezrukov S.M. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 184: 147-156Google Scholar). Negatively charged anions such as ATP are favored due to the net positive charge within the channel. VDAC is permeable to anionic metabolites in the open state, but is essentially impermeable to anions such as ATP and phosphocreatine when the channel adopts a closed configuration, and the channel selectivity is reversed from favoring anions to favoring cations (19Rostovtseva T. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28006-28008Google Scholar, 20Rostovtseva T. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1954-1962Google Scholar, 27Vander Heiden M.G. Li X.X. Gottleib E. Hill R.B. Thompson C.B. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19414-19419Google Scholar). Certainly, the positively charged cytochrome c molecules (12 kDa) cannot permeate through this channel under normal conditions. If they did, cytochrome c would not be localized within the intermembrane space. Vander Heiden et al. (27Vander Heiden M.G. Li X.X. Gottleib E. Hill R.B. Thompson C.B. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19414-19419Google Scholar, 28Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Google Scholar) proposed a model of MOM permeabilization that involves regulation of VDAC channels. In this model, VDAC channel closure prevents the efficient exchange of ATP and ADP between the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Loss of outer membrane permeability due to VDAC closure might result in the accumulation of the products of mitochondrial activity within the intermembrane space, generation of an osmotic gradient, and matrix swelling, followed by the rupture of the outer membrane. The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL restores the ATP/ADP exchange. Experiments with VDAC channels reconstituted into planar phospholipid membranes demonstrated that Bcl-xL promotes the open configuration of mammalian VDAC channels (27Vander Heiden M.G. Li X.X. Gottleib E. Hill R.B. Thompson C.B. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19414-19419Google Scholar). Another channel model postulates that the pro-apoptotic protein Bax directly interacts with VDAC, resulting in cytochrome c permeation through membranes (1Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Google Scholar, 2Shimizu S. Ide T. Yanagida T. Tsujimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12321-12325Google Scholar, 3Shimizu S. Konishi A. Kodama T. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3100-3105Google Scholar). It has been reported that experiments with liposomes and planar phospholipid membranes show that Bax induces a novel VDAC-containing channel that is larger than the channels observed when the proteins are used alone. It was concluded that, although the channels formed by Bax and VDAC alone are unable to allow cytochrome c translocation, the new larger pores are permeable to cytochrome c (2Shimizu S. Ide T. Yanagida T. Tsujimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12321-12325Google Scholar). In both models, the ability of Bcl-2 proteins to regulate the state and integrity of VDAC could thus account for their ability to be either anti- or pro-apoptotic. However, the mechanisms of VDAC channel regulation by Bcl-2 proteins proposed in these models are diametrically opposite. In the first model, the closure of VDAC channels leads to MOM rupture, and anti-apoptotic protein helps to maintain VDAC channels in their normal, functional open state. In the second model, the pro-apoptotic protein induces opening of the large VDAC-based channels permeable to cytochrome c. The mechanism of MOM permeabilization is undoubtedly very complex and most likely involves more than one protein to form the passages for cytochrome c release. Ceramides have also been proposed to form this permeability pathway (29Siskind L.J. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Google Scholar). The role of VDAC in this process is rather controversial; but considering that both BH1-3 proteins such as Bax and BH3 domain-only proteins such as Bid are most likely required for MOM permeabilization, it is important to test the effect of both pro-apoptotic proteins on VDAC channels. To address this question, we studied the effect of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bid on the properties of VDAC channels reconstituted into planar phospholipid membranes. We used the full-length Bax protein in the soluble monomeric and oligomeric forms and Bid cut with caspase-8 (referred to as cut Bid). Here, we show that the properties of VDAC channels isolated from mammalian mitochondria are unaffected by addition of Bax. We conclude that Bax does not induce cytochrome c release by acting on VDAC. In contrast, we demonstrate that cut Bid induces the closure of VDAC channels. By reducing the permeability of VDAC channels, the pro-apoptotic protein Bid might interfere with metabolite exchange between mitochondria and the cytosol, with the subsequent loss of outer membrane integrity. Protein Purification—VDAC from rat liver mitochondria was isolated and purified as described previously (30Parsons D.F. Williams G.R. Chance B. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The first sample of monomeric Bax was purified by a previously described procedure (34Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Google Scholar); Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pTYB1-Bax were cultured in LB medium; recombinant proteins were isolated from the cytosol by chitin affinity chromatography according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs Inc.) and further purified by ionexchange chromatography on a mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The second BaxFL sample with a tag of six histidines at the N-terminus was expressed in the pBAD plasmid in E. coli (36Montessuit S. Mazzei G. Magnenat E. Antonsson B. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 202-206Google Scholar). Monomeric Bax was recovered in the soluble bacterial fraction and purified by chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, followed by Q-Sepharose. The protein was stored in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 30% (v/v) glycerol (pH 7.5) at -80 °C. Oligomeric BaxFL with an N-terminal His tag was expressed in and purified from E. coli (11Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.-C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Google Scholar). The protein was recovered in the soluble fraction in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, followed by anion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column. The purified protein was dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (w/v) octyl glucoside, and 30% glycerol (pH 7.5) and stored at -80 °C. Other samples of oligomeric BaxFL were obtained by incubation of monomeric BaxFL with 1% octyl glucoside on ice for 30 min. Mouse full-length Bid was expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag in E. coli. Caspase-8-cleaved mouse wild-type Bid (cut Bid) was obtained from purified full-length Bid by cleavage with caspase-8 (37Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Google Scholar, 38McDonnel J.M. Fushman D. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cowburn D. Cell. 1999; 96: 625-634Google Scholar). Cut Bid was purified on a nickel affinity column to remove caspase-8 (39Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Google Scholar). No caspase-8 activity was detected in the purified cut Bid sample. The resulting 15.5-kDa C-terminal fragment (tcBid, amino acids 60-195) was expressed as an N-terminal His6-tagged protein in E. coli (17Kudla G. Montessuit S. Eskes R. Berrier C. Martinou J.-C. Ghazi A. Antonsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22713-22718Google Scholar). Electrophysiological Recordings—Planar lipid membranes were formed from monolayers made from 1% (w/v) lipids in hexane on 70-80-μm diameter orifices in the 15-μm-thick Teflon partition that separated two chambers (modified after (40Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Google Scholar)). The lipid-forming solutions contained diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (DPhPC); 90% asolectin (soybean phospholipids) and 10% cholesterol; or 42% asolectin, 42% DPhPC, 8% cardiolipin, and 8% cholesterol. DPhPC, asolectin, and cardiolipin were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and cholesterol was purchased from Sigma. The membrane potential was maintained using Ag/AgCl electrodes with 3 m KCl and 15% (w/v) agarose bridges (41Bezrukov S.M. Vodyanoy I. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 16-25Google Scholar). VDAC channels insertion was achieved by adding 0.1-1.5 μl of a 1% Triton X-100 solution of purified VDAC to the 1.5-ml aqueous phase in the cis-compartment while stirring. Potential is defined as positive when it is greater at the side of VDAC addition (cis). The effect of the pro-apoptotic proteins on the VDAC properties was determined as follows. After VDAC channels were inserted and their parameters were monitored for at least 20-25 min, the pro-apoptotic protein was added to both sides of the membrane (if not indicated otherwise) under constant stirring for 2 min. The currents were recorded for at least 25 min, followed by a series of additions of the protein until a rise in conductance induced by the pro-apoptotic protein was obtained. Conductance measurements were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) in the voltage clamp mode. Data were filtered by a low-pass 8-pole Butterworth filter (Model 9002, Frequency Devices Inc., Haverhill, MA) at 15 kHz, recorded on a chart recorder, and directly saved into the computer memory with a sampling frequency of 50 kHz. The membrane chamber and headstage were isolated from external noise sources with a double metal screen (Amuneal Manufacturing Corp., Philadelphia, PA). The voltage-dependent properties of the VDAC-containing membrane were assessed by applying a symmetrical 5-mHz triangular voltage wave from a Hewlett-Packard 33120A function waveform generator and recording the current using a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Data were acquired at a sampling frequency of 1 Hz and analyzed using pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). VDAC and Bax—One of the characteristic properties of VDAC is its voltage gating. The channels are in the high conductance open state at low voltages (<30 mV) and move to low conductance states (“closed” states) at high voltages (Fig. 1A, inset). The application of 50 mV causes the conductance of the single channel to drop by two-thirds of its open state level. A short exposure to 0 mV reopens the channel. After the conductance and voltage gating properties of the channel were measured, monomeric Bax was added to the membrane-bathing aqueous solutions on one or both sides of the membrane. In most experiments (7 of 10), we observed that monomeric Bax addition caused a 4-6-fold increase in membrane conductance. However, further analysis showed that this increase in membrane conductance was due to the insertion of additional VDAC channels and not to the formation of a novel larger channel. Fig. 1B illustrates the stepwise conductance decrease as individual channels closed in the presence of monomeric Bax. The individual steps (Fig. 1B, inset) are of the same size as in control records (Fig. 1A, inset). After 0 mV was applied, the channels reopened and closed again under a 50 mV applied potential. All this is normal VDAC behavior. These channels were still sensitive to König polyanion that induced their closure (42Colombini M. Yeung C.L. Tung J. König T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 279-286Google Scholar) (data not shown). Sizing with polyethylene glycols (43Rostovtseva T.K. Nestorovich E.M. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 160-169Google Scholar) gave similar results as for single VDAC channels. The conclusion that the observed increase in conductance was indeed the result of new insertion and not formation of larger channels (as previously reported (2Shimizu S. Ide T. Yanagida T. Tsujimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12321-12325Google Scholar)) is supported by the observation that perfusion of the chamber to remove excess VDAC prior to Bax addition resulted in the absence of the Bax-dependent conductance increment. Other characteristic properties of VDAC such as single channel conductance and selectivity were probed in the presence of monomeric Bax. No significant changes in these properties were observed (Table I). In principle, many additional factors may also influence Bax-VDAC interaction. The possibility that membrane lipids (44Basañez G. Sharpe J.C. Galanis J. Brandt T.B. Hardwick J.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49360-49365Google Scholar), especially charged lipids, might affect the observations was assessed using both the neutral DPhPC and a negatively charged natural mixture, asolectin. No effect of Bax on VDAC was observed with either of these lipids (Table I). The possibility that acidic pH might render the terminal α-helix of Bax accessible for interaction with VDAC was tested by performing the experiments at both neutral and acidic pH values. Ionic strength was also varied, as was the presence of either Ca2+ or Mg2+; and no influence of Bax on the properties of VDAC was observed under any of these conditions (Table I).Table ISummary of the experiments with VDAC channels and BaxBax sampleLipidMediumpHMe2+ (1 mm)Single channel conductanceSelectivityVoltage gatingMonomeric 16—3000 nmDPhPC1 m NaCl (12)aThe number of experiments is indicated in parentheses or 0.1 m7.0 (7), 5.0 (6)Ca2+ (13)NEbNE, no effect (13)KCl (1) 20—130 nmAsolectin1 m NaCl (6) or 0.1 m5.5 (8)Ca2+ (8)NE (1)NE (1)NE (7)NaCl (2)Oligomericwith 1% OGcOligomeric Bax was obtained by treating monomeric Bax with 1% octyl glucoside (OG) 30—60 nmAsolectin0.25 m NaCl (2), 0.25 m5.5 (7)Mg2+ (7)NE (3)NE (3)NE (4) [∼90 nmdThe concentration at which Bax addition resulted in membrane rupture]KCl (4), or 0.1 m KCl (1)OligomericeOligomeric Bax was obtained by isolating Bax in the presence of detergents 2—10 nmAsolectin0.25/0.05 m NaCl (2),5.5 (4), 7.0 (1)Mg2+ (5)NE (2)NE (2)NE (4) [15—20dThe concentration at which Bax addition resulted in membrane rupture nm]0.25 m NaCl (1), or0.25 m KCl (2)a The number of experiments is indicated in parenthesesb NE, no effectc Oligomeric Bax was obtained by treating monomeric Bax with 1% octyl glucoside (OG)d The concentration at which Bax addition resulted in membrane rupturee Oligomeric Bax was obtained by isolating Bax in the presence of detergents Open table in a new tab The possibility that the physical state of Bax (monomeric or oligomeric) is important for interaction with VDAC has been tested using both forms. As reported previously (11Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.-C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Google Scholar), we observed that only Bax oligomers formed channel-like conductances. Examples of the representative current traces induced by oligomeric Bax are presented in Fig. 2 (b and c). Monomeric Bax itself was inactive (up to 3 μm) at neutral pH (Fig. 2a). Oligomeric Bax was obtained either by isolating Bax in the presence of detergents or by treating monomeric Bax with 1% octyl glucoside (see “Experimental Procedures”). Oligomeric Bax samples from both preparations formed channels in bilayer membranes, but at different concentration ranges (Fig. 3). The former increased membrane conductance at lower concentrations (5-20 nm). The latter required 30-80 nm to increase membrane conductance. The distributions of individual conductance steps produced by oligomeric Bax were very broad, with conductances from hundreds of picosiemens to tens of nanosiemens (nS). In a typical experiment, oligomeric Bax produced channels with a gradual increase in conductance during the experiment (45Roucou X. Rostovtseva T. Montessuit S. Martinou J.-C. Antonsson B. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 547-552Google Scholar). Often, after reaching the high total conductance level of 10-20 nS, the membrane ruptured. The decrease in the lifetime of the membranes in the presence of Bax proteins has been described previously (46Basañez G. Nechushtan A. Drozhinin O. Chanturiya A. Choe E. Tutt S. Wood K.A. Hsu Y.-T. Zimmerberg J. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5492-5497Google Scholar).Fig. 3Pro-apoptotic proteins increase membrane conductance at different concentrations. The symbols represent the average conductance values obtained in individual experiments 10-20 min after protein addition. The inset shows, at a finer scale, the concentration dependence for oligomeric Bax from two different preparations. Oligomeric Bax obtained by isolation in the presence of detergent (▴) increased membrane conductance at 5-20 nm, whereas oligomeric Bax obtained by treatment of monomeric Bax with 1% octyl glucoside (shaded boxes) increased conductance at 30-80 nm. Cut Bid (•) induced membrane conductance at concentrations that were higher than those of tcBid (○). Monomeric Bax (⋄) was inactive at all concentrations. The other experimental conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The lines were drawn to guide the eye through the experimental points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To discriminate between VDAC- and Bax-induced conductances, both oligomeric Bax preparations were used at concentrations below or at the threshold at which they increased the membrane conductance. The concentrations at which oligomeric Bax formed channels were variable (Fig. 3, inset). Therefore, in a typical experiment, after the VDAC channel(s) was reconstituted into the membrane and its properties were recorded, oligomeric Bax was added in a series starting with concentrations below those at which Bax was found to form channels until a visible increase in the conductance, due to the formation of Bax channels, was observed. The Bax channels were distinctly different from VDAC channels (compare the noisy current traces produced by Bax in Fig. 2 (b and c) with the well defined stable currents through VDAC channels in Figs. 1 and 4A), which helped to avoid a confusing situation when a total current was actually a sum of two different conductances with different properties. Our task was to find the Bax-induced changes in VDAC properties under the conditions in which Bax did not form channels by itself. Fig. 4A shows an example in which the selectivity of VDAC channel was assessed before and after oligomeric Bax addition. The reversal potential (measured in a 5-fold NaCl salt gradient) was +17 mV before and after Bax addition. The single channel conductance also remained the same with and without Bax. Fig. 4A shows no effect of oligomeric Bax on either selectivity or single channel conductance. The probability of VDAC channels to be open or closed at different potentials in the presence of Bax was estimated by obtaining G/V plots as shown in Fig. 4B. The data were collected as follows. Slow triangular voltage waves (5 mHz) were applied to a multichannel membrane, and the current was recorded. Because VDAC channels have rapid opening rates (inverse submilliseconds) and slow closing rates (inverse seconds), a near-equilibrium G/V plot could be obtained by collecting data when the applied voltage opened the channels, changing from ±60 to 0 mV. In the membranes containing many VDAC channels there was always a possibility that a portion of the conductance was due to Bax channels. The number of VDAC channels could also vary during the recording. To take these effects into account, the G/V plot is expressed as a normalized conductance with the voltage-independent portion subtracted (this would include any Bax conductance). This plot is essentially an expression of the voltage dependence of the open probability. Fig. 4B shows the results of a typical experiment. There was no effect of Bax on VDAC voltage dependence. It should be mentioned that, in the experiment shown in Fig. 4A, oligomeric Bax was obtained by preincubation of monomeric Bax with 1% o"

(Chen, Y., Lu, J., Pan, H., Zhang, Y., Wu, H., Xu, K., Liu, X., Jiang, Y., Bao, X., Yao, Z., Ding, K., Lo, W. H., Qiang, B., Chan, P., Shen, Y., and Wu, X. (2003) Ann. Neurol. 54, 239–243) 12 missense mutations were identified in the CACNA1H (Cav3.2) gene in 14 of 118 patients with CAE but not in 230 control individuals. We have functionally characterized five of these mutations (F161L, E282K, C456S, V831M, and D1463N) using rat Cav3.2 and whole-cell patch clamp recordings in transfected HEK293 cells. Two of the mutations, F161L and E282K, mediated an ∼10-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the half-activation potential. Mutation V831M caused a ∼50% slowing of inactivation relative to control and shifted half-inactivation potential ∼10 mV toward more depolarized potentials. Mean time to peak was significantly increased by mutation V831M but was unchanged for all others. No resolvable changes in the parameters of the IV relation or current kinetics were observed with the remaining mutations. The findings suggest that several of the Cav3.2 mutants allow for greater calcium influx during physiological activation and in the case of F161L and E282K can result in channel openings at more hyperpolarized (close to resting) potentials. This may underlie the propensity for seizures in patients with CAE. Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a type of generalized epilepsy observed in 2–10% of epileptic children.

This may underlie the propensity for seizures in patients with CAE. Generalized epileptic disorders involve both brain hemispheres and are characterized by abnormal synchronous electrical (electroencephalographic) activity, recorded bilaterally at seizure onset (1Adams R.D. Victor M. Ropper A.H. Principles of Neurology.Sixth Ed. McGraw-Hill Health Professions Division, New York1998Google Scholar). Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) 1The abbreviations used are: CAE, childhood absence epilepsy; SWD, spike-and-wave discharge; ANOVA, analysis of variance. is a type of idiopathic generalized epilepsy and is typified by sudden brief impairment of consciousness followed by ∼3-Hz spike- and-wave discharges (SWDs) over both brain hemispheres (2Goetz C.G. Pappert E.J. Textbook of Clinical Neurology. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1999Google Scholar). A typical absence seizure is without convulsions and there are no reported neuropathological changes associated with this disorder (3Crunelli V. Leresche N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Spike-wave discharges in absence epilepsy involve interactions between cortical and thalamic structures (4Avoli M. Rogawski M.A. Avanzini G. Epilepsia. 2001; 42: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The classical view of SWD-based seizures, including absence epilepsy, implicates the thalamus as the site of seizure generation (5Jasper H.H. Droogleever-Fortuyn J. Res. Publ. Assoc. Nerv. Ment. Dis. 1947; 26: 272-298Google Scholar, 6Pollen D.A. Perot P. Reid K.H. Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1963; 15: 1017-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, an increasing body of evidence suggests that spike-wave seizures are initiated in the neocortex and then rapidly progress to involve thalamic structures (7Steriade M. Contreras D. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 1439-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 8Steriade M. Contreras D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 623-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Meeren H.K. Pijn J.P. Van Luijtelaar E.L. Coenen A.M. Lopes da Silva F.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1480-1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The thalamus and cortex then engage in complex interplay that underlies SWD generation and is dependent on the activation of low voltage-activated (T-type) calcium channels (4Avoli M. Rogawski M.A. Avanzini G. Epilepsia. 2001; 42: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Indeed, reticular thalamic neurons are endowed with large T-type currents that mediate bursting behavior associated with SWDs. The critical role of T-type channels in SWD epilepsies is also supported by treatment of absence seizures using ethosuximide, an inhibitor of T-type Ca2+ currents (10Coulter D.A. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Ann. Neurol. 1989; 25: 582-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 11Kostyuk P.G. Molokanova E.A. Pronchuk N.F. Savchenko A.N. Verkhratsky A.N. Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and by the observation that expression of these channels is increased in thalamic neurons in a genetic rat absence model (12Talley E.M. Solorzano G. Depaulis A. Perez-Reyes E. Bayliss D.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We now know of three genes (subtypes) encoding different types of T-type channels (Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3), all of which are subject to alternative splicing resulting in a range of different isoforms with distinct biophysical, modulatory, and pharmacological properties (13Perez-Reyes E.

It was recently shown that Cav3.1 knock-out mice display reduced burst mode firing activity, and that the Cav3.1-deficient thalamus is specifically resilient to SWD generation (24Kim D. Song I. Keum S. Lee T. Jeong M.J. Kim S.S. McEnery M.W. Shin H.S. Neuron. 2001; 31: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In a complimentary study, although P/Q-type Ca2+ channel knock-out mice experienced absence seizures with 4–5 Hz SWDs, an additional knock-out of T-type channels rescued the animals such that SWDs were abolished (25Song, I., Kim, D., Jun, K., and Shin, H. S. (2001) Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, November 10–15, San Diego, CA (abstracts)Google Scholar). In addition, a functional study has demonstrated that different splice isoforms of human Cav3.1 channels, when exogenously expressed, can display radically different electrophysiological properties, resulting in differential ability to maintain T-type channel activity during stimulation with rapid spike trains (23Chemin J. Monteil A. Bourinet E. Nargeot J. Lory P. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1238-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A recent study by Chen et al. (26Chen Y. Lu J. Pan H. Zhang Y. Wu H. Xu K. Liu X. Jiang Y. Bao X. Yao Z. Ding K. Lo W.H. Qiang B. Chan P. Shen Y. Wu X. Ann.

We have generated five of these mutations in the rat Cav3.2 T-type channel homologue and functionally characterized them in HEK293 cells. We find that three of the missense mutations mediate significant gain of function effects on T-type channel activity. Given that T-type channels are expressed in both thalamus and neocortex (27Talley E.M. Cribbs L.L. Lee J.-H. Daud A. Perez-Reyes E. Bayliss D.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1895-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their association with SWD generation, this increase in activity may perhaps play a role in altering seizure threshold in patients with CAE. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the rat Cav3.2 calcium channel α1 subunit in pCDNA-3 (22McRory J.E. Santi C.M. Hamming K.S. Mezeyova J. Sutton K.G. Baillie D.L. Stea A.

For each of the five mutations, the entire Cav3.2-pCDNA-3 plasmid was used as the mutagenesis template, and then the entire coding sequence of the channel was sequenced to rule out the presence of errors associated with the mutagenesis (DNA Sequencing Facility, University of Calgary) before transfection into HEK293 (tsA-201) cells for electrophysiological characterization. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Tissue culture and transfection of tsA-201 cells was described by us previously in detail (20Beedle A.M. Hamid J. Zamponi G.W. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 187: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK cells were grown to 85% confluence at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (+10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin, Invitrogen). Cells were dissociated with trypsin (0.25%)-EDTA before and plated on glass coverslips. Mutant and wild type Cav3.2 channel α1 subunits (8 μg) and green fluorescent protein marker (1 μg) DNA were transfected into cells by the calcium phosphate method. Cells were transferred to 28 °C 24 h after transfection, and recordings were conducted 2 days later. Electrophysiology and Data Analysis—Prior to recordings, cells were transferred into an external bath solution of 5 mm barium (in mm: 5 BaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 40 tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl), 10 glucose, 88 CsCl, pH 7.2 adjusted with TEA-OH). Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled and polished to 2–4-MΩ resistance and filled with internal solution (in mm: 108 CsCH3SO4, 4 MgCl2, 9 EGTA, 9 HEPES, pH 7.2 adjusted with Cs-OH). Data were acquired at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 9.0 software (Axon Instruments), low pass-filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. Series resistance was compensated to 80%. Data analysis and offline leak subtraction was carried out in Clamp-fit 9.0 (Axon Instruments), and all curves were fitted using Origin analysis software (OriginLab). Current-voltage (IV) plots were fitted using the Boltzmann equation, I=(V-Erev)×G×(1/(1+exp(-(V-V0.5a)/S))) where Erev is the reversal potential, G is the maximum slope conductance, V0.5a is the half-maximal activation potential, and S is the slope factor. Individual inactivation curves were fitted with the Boltzmann equation, I(normalized)=X+(1-X)/(1+exp(-z×(V0.5i-V)/25.6)) where I(normalized) is the fraction of available channels, X is the non-inactivating fraction of current, z is the slope factor, and V0.5i and V are the half-inactivating potential. Time constants for inactivation, τinact, were obtained from monoexponetial fits to the raw current data. Time constants for recovery from inactivation, τr, were obtained by monexoponetial fits to the time course of recovery from inactivation. These data were obtained by applying an inactivating conditioning pulse followed by a variable recovery period preceding the test pulse. All averaged data are plotted as mean ± S.E., and numbers in parentheses reflect the number of cells. Statistical analysis was carried out using one way analysis of variance, where p < 0.05 was considered as significant. We used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce five of the recently identified CAE-associated missense mutations (26Chen Y. Lu J. Pan H. Zhang Y. Wu H. Xu K. Liu X. Jiang Y. Bao X. Yao Z. Ding K. Lo W.H. Qiang B. Chan P. Shen Y. Wu X. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 54: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) into the rat Cav3.2 sequence (22McRory J.E. Santi C.M. Hamming K.S. Mezeyova J. Sutton K.G. Baillie D.L. Stea A. Snutch T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3999-4011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, these mutations are distributed throughout the Cav3.2 channel protein, including the domain IS2-S3 linker (F161L), the domain I S5-S6 region (E282K), the domain I-II linker (C465S), the domain II S2 segment (V831M), and the domain III S5-S6 region (D1463N) and include two substitutions of negatively charged amino acids. Each of the mutant channels expressed well in HEK cells, had current densities similar to those obtained with the wild type channels (not shown), and produced typical current waveforms expected from T-type calcium channels (Fig. 1B). Two of the mutations, F161L and E282K, resulted in statistically significant hyperpolarizing shifts in the half-activation potential of the channel by ∼10 mV (Fig. 1, C and D), without affecting the reversal potential. Hence, mutations F161L and E282K, due to a shift in their activation potentials, can open in response to smaller membrane voltage fluctuations and therefore allow for greater Ca2+ influx as compared with wild type. In neurons, this behavior could result in enhanced bursting activity and might facilitate intracellular changes associated with elevated [Ca2+]i during epochs of intense neuronal activity. The voltage dependence of activation of the remaining mutants did not differ significantly from that observed with the wild type channel (Fig. 1D). The time course of activation was significantly slowed in the V831M mutant at potentials more positive than –30 mV (Fig. 1E), suggesting that this channel might conduct less inward current during brief membrane depolarizations. However, the V831M mutant also exhibited significantly altered inactivation characteristics. At moderate depolarizations (i.e. –20 mV), the time constant for inactivation was significantly slowed in the V831M mutant (Fig. 2A), whereas the remaining mutants behaved roughly similar to wild type channels. In addition, the position of the steady state inactivation curve of the V831M mutant was shifted toward more depolarized potentials by ∼10 mV, whereas that of the other mutants did not differ significantly from that of the wild type channel (Fig. 2B). This suggests that V831M channels, although slower to activate, are more readily available for opening and when conducting remain open for longer durations relative to wild type. The observation that V831M activation was slowed only at depolarized potentials might suggest that in this mutant, one or more of the gating transitions during channel opening become rate-limiting at positive voltages but not at more negative potentials at which activation is generally slower. Recovery from inactivation was not significantly affected by any of the mutations (Fig. 2C). Taken together, three of the five mutants examined exhibited statistically significant altered gating behavior, whereas mutant channels C456S and D1463N were indistinguishable from wild type channels. The findings with C456S and D1463N are consistent with a number of reports of calcium channel mutations in various disease states that do not result in detectable effects on channel gating. For example, several mutations in the Cav1.4 L-type calcium channel linked to congenital X-linked stationary night blindness do not affect the biophysical properties of expressed channels (28McRory J.E. Hamid J. Doering C.J. Garcia E. Parker R. Hamming K.S. Chen L. Hildebrand M. Beedle A.M. Feldcamp L. Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutations associated with periodic paralysis mediate only small effects on Cav1.1 L-type channel inactivation (29Dias da Silva M.R. Cerutti J.M. Tengan C.H. Furuzawa G.K. Vieira T.C. Gabbai A.A. Maciel R.M. Clin. Endocrinol. (Oxf.). 2002; 56: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, several of the mutations in Cav2.1 P/Q-type calcium channels that are found in patients with familial hemiplegic migraine do not appear to alter channel function (30Melliti K. Grabner M. Seabrook G.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 546: 337-347Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, a lack of effects on channel biophysics does not equate to lack of functional consequences in a neuronal cellular environment. For example, given the cytoplasmic localization of the residue Cys456, it is conceivable that putative interactions with neuron specific regulatory proteins could result in altered channel function for the C456S mutant. Moreover, it is possible that second messenger modulation could be altered in this channel; the mutation to Ser456 has been suggested as a possible CK2 phosphorylation site (26Chen Y. Lu J. Pan H. Zhang Y. Wu H. Xu K. Liu X. Jiang Y. Bao X. Yao Z. Ding K. Lo W.H. Qiang B. Chan P. Shen Y. Wu X. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 54: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible that the effects of individual point mutations are only observed in certain of the many splice isoforms of Cav3.2 calcium channels (31Chemin J. Monteil A. Perez-Reyes E. Bourinet E. Nargeot J. Lory P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 3-14Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In contrast, the results obtained with the F161L and the E282K mutants are more easily reconciled with the epileptic phenotype of patients carrying this mutation. A shift in the voltage dependence of activation to levels that are closer to resting membrane potentials of most neurons would result in increased calcium influx and thus hyperexcitability of neuronal tissue, thus predicting increased spike and wave discharges in cells that predominantly expressing the F161L or E282K mutations. Similarly, any slowing of voltage-dependent inactivation and shifts of the half-inactivation potential toward more depolarized potentials such as in the V831M mutant would result in increased availability of the channel for opening and thus increased channel activity. It is important to note that we used the rat Cav3.2 calcium channel as the mutagenesis template, however, in the mutations were introduced into regions that are highly conserved (∼99% sequence identity) among rat and human Cav3.2 calcium channels. Hence, it is unlikely that the observed effects would be specific for rat Cav3.2 calcium channels. Overall, the observed biophysical effects of three of the five mutations examined here are consistent with the clinical phenotype of CAE. To date, there have been only limited reports of systematic structure-function studies on cloned T-type calcium channel subtypes. Staes et al. (32Staes M. Talavera K. Klugbauer N. Prenen J. Lacinova L. Droogmans G. Hofmann F. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 530: 35-45Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) implicated the C terminus of the Cav3.1 calcium channel in voltage-dependent inactivation, however, based on our current understanding of inactivation of high voltage-activated calcium channels (33Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 554: 263-273Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and on mutagenesis studies in Cav3.1 channels (34Marksteiner R. Schurr P. Berjukow S. Margreiter E. Perez-Reyes E. Hering S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 27-34Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the S6 segments are also likely to contribute to the inactivation process. Interestingly, the only CAE-associated mutation that affected channel inactivation is localized to a region that had not been previously implicated in the inactivation of any type of calcium channel, i.e. the domain IIS2 segment. The consequences of mutant channel E282K on voltage-dependent activation are somewhat surprising. Intuitively, one might have expected a substitution of an externally located negatively charge residue for a lysine to electrostatically antagonize voltage sensor movement, thus inhibiting rather than facilitating activation. Our results suggest that the effects of this mutation do not arise from an electrostatic interaction with the voltage sensor of the channel but may perhaps be mediated via allosteric coupling to the activation gating machinery. In summary, our data constitute the first report of naturally occurring point mutations with functional consequences on the gating behavior of T-type calcium channels. At least in a subset of mutations reported in children afflicted with CAE, the altered channel gating that arises from the presence of these mutations is qualitatively consistent with the clinical phenotype. The discovery of these mutations in a subset of individuals but not in a larger number of control subjects suggests that their presence is significant, which is further supported by their functional effects. Their effects in the context of CAE may well be brought about by synergistic interactions with other factors such as other ion channels and intracellular modulators, all of which are capable of a spectrum of activity modes in the epileptic brain. Although Cav3.2 mRNA has been detected in several neocortical regions (27Talley E.M. Cribbs L.L. Lee J.-H. Daud A. Perez-Reyes E. Bayliss D.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1895-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the tissue distribution of Cav3.2 protein has not been described. It thus remains to be determined as to whether the physiological effects of Cav3.2 channel mutations are linked directly to altered initiation of spike-wave in the neocortex (7Steriade M. Contreras D. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 1439-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 8Steriade M. Contreras D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 623-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Meeren H.K.

Despite the importance of native disulfide bonds in the folding and function of many proteins, a systematic investigation of the in vivo substrates of E. coli periplasmic disulfide oxidoreductases, including the well characterized oxidase DsbA, has not yet been performed. We combined a modified osmotic shock periplasmic extract and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to identify substrates of the periplasmic oxidoreductases DsbA, DsbC, and DsbG. We found 10 cysteine-containing periplasmic proteins that are substrates of the disulfide oxidase DsbA, including PhoA and FlgI, previously established DsbA substrates. This technique did not detect any in vivo substrates of DsbG, but did identify two substrates of DsbC, RNase I and MepA. We confirmed that RNase I is a substrate of DsbC both in vivo and in vitro. This is the first time that DsbC has been shown to affect the in vivo function of a native E. coli protein, and the results strongly suggest that DsbC acts as a disulfide isomerase in vivo. We also demonstrate that DsbC, but not DsbG, is critical for the in vivo activity of RNase I, indicating that DsbC and DsbG do not function identically in vivo. The absence of substrates for DsbG suggests either that the in vivo substrate specificity of DsbG is more limited than that of DsbC or that DsbG is not active under the growth conditions tested. Our work represents one of the first times the in vivo substrate specificity of a folding catalyst system has been systematically investigated. Because our methodology is based on the simple assumption that the absence of a folding catalyst should cause its substrates to be present at decreased steady-state levels, this technique should be useful in analyzing the substrate specificity of any folding catalyst or chaperone for which mutations are available.

The Escherichia coli periplasm contains a family of disulfide bond-forming (Dsb) proteins that catalyze disulfide bond formation and rearrangement. This family of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases can be divided into two pathways: an oxidation pathway, consisting of the inner membrane protein DsbB and the periplasmic protein DsbA, and an isomerization pathway, composed of the inner membrane protein DsbD and the periplasmic proteins DsbC and DsbG. DsbA interacts with reduced substrates, catalyzing oxidation of their cysteine residues to disulfide bonds (1Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). After oxidizing substrate proteins, DsbA becomes reduced and is returned to the active oxidized form by donating its electrons to DsbB. DsbB shuttles these electrons to membrane-bound quinones, which transfer the electrons to molecular oxygen or anaerobic electron acceptors (2Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). DsbC and DsbG are the periplasmic components of the isomerization pathway. Although the periplasm is a highly oxidizing environment, the active sites of DsbC and DsbG are kept in the reduced form. This is accomplished by the inner membrane protein DsbD, which transfers electrons from the cytoplasmic protein thioredoxin to DsbC and DsbG (3Katzen F. Beckwith J. Cell. 2000; 103: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). DsbA, DsbC, and DsbG share a number of common features. All are members of the thioredoxin superfamily with an active site composed of 2 cysteine residues separated by 2 other amino acids in a CXXC motif, and all reside in the periplasm (4Collet J.-F. Bardwell J.C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). How the oxidase DsbA and the isomerases DsbC and DsbG can function so differently with such similar structural features has been the focus of recent work. This research suggests that the oligomeric state of periplasmic oxidoreductases is an important determinant of function. DsbC and DsbG are dimers, whereas DsbA is a monomer. When DsbC is forced to become a monomer, it is readily oxidized by DsbB and functions as an oxidase (5Bader M.W. Hiniker A. Regeimbal J. Goldstone D. Haebel P.W. Riemer J. Metcalf P. Bardwell J.C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When DsbA is attached to the N-terminal dimerization domain of DsbC, the chimeric protein now functions as an isomerase (6Zhao Z. Peng Y. Hao S.-f. Zeng Z.-h. Wang C.-c. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43292-43298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). That the disulfide oxidation and isomerization pathways can so readily substitute for each other may indicate that substrate binding of these proteins is similar. DsbA is the principal disulfide oxidant in the periplasm. A dsbA- strain exhibits numerous in vivo phenotypes such as loss of motility, attenuated virulence, and sensitivity to benzylpenicillin, all of which can be attributed to loss of disulfide bonds in proteins related to these processes (7Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Watarai M. Tobe T. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4927-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). dsbA null mutants also have a decreased growth rate in minimal medium compared with the wild-type strain and, when plated on minimal medium, show strain-dependent growth defects such as no growth or mucoid colonies (1Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Although overexpression or modification (such as monomerizing DsbC or adding a signal sequence to thioredoxin) of other members of the thioredoxin family can complement the dsbA- phenotype (9Debarbieux L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10751-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), no Dsb protein has been found that, without manipulation, takes on the role of DsbA in its absence. DsbA seems to play a unique and central role in periplasmic protein folding. Despite this, studies of the effect of DsbA on substrate folding and function generally focus on a few well-characterized substrates such as alkaline phosphatase (10Sone M. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10349-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The range of proteins whose in vivo folding is affected by DsbA remains unknown. In vivo substrates of DsbC and DsbG are even less characterized than those of DsbA. In fact, although DsbC and DsbG are both believed to function as disulfide isomerases for E. coli proteins containing more than two disulfide bonds, the evidence for this is largely indirect. Both DsbC and DsbG have active sites that are maintained in reduced form, consistent with an isomerase activity (11Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both have been shown to aid in the folding of eukaryotic proteins with multiple disulfides, and DsbC appears to act as an isomerase during the in vitro folding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, a eukaryotic protein with three disulfides whose folding pathway has been very well studied (13Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, no effect of DsbC or DsbG on the in vivo function of a native E. coli protein has been demonstrated. Rietsch et al. (14Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) showed that the rate of accumulation of correctly folded alkaline phosphatase (two disulfides) is decreased very slightly (by ∼15%) in a dsbC null mutant; however, the activity of alkaline phosphatase is unaffected by null mutations in dsbC. Because in vivo substrates of DsbC and DsbG have not been discovered, it is unclear whether DsbC and DsbG function on the same subset of periplasmic proteins or whether they have distinct substrate specificity. To address these questions, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to compare wild-type and dsb- strains. Comparison of wild-type and null strains by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has been previously utilized to determine the in vivo role of various proteins such as the cysteine transporter CycDC (15Pittman M.S. Corker H. Wu G. Binet M.B. Moir A.J. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49841-49849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the case of dsb- strains, we postulated that Dsb substrates would lack their correct disulfides, causing them to be unstable and aggregate or be degraded. These unstable proteins should therefore be less abundant in periplasmic extracts of the dsb- strain, allowing our two-dimensional gel system to identify those Dsb substrates whose disulfide bonds are important for their folding. This method identified 10 disulfide-containing proteins that are likely substrates of DsbA as well as two in vivo substrates of DsbC: RNase I, a periplasmic RNase that contains four disulfides, and MepA, a periplasmic murein hydrolase that contains three presumptive disulfides. We confirm in vivo and in vitro that DsbC aids in the folding of RNase I, strongly suggesting that DsbC acts as a disulfide isomerase for some E. coli proteins with multiple disulfide bonds. Although we found no substrates for DsbG, we demonstrate that a dsbG null mutation has no effect on the in vivo function of RNase I, illustrating that DsbC and DsbG do not have identical in vivo substrate specificity. Bacterial Strains—Strains containing null mutations in the dsbA, dsbC, and dsbG genes were the gift of Dr. George Georgiou (12Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These mutations were introduced into wild-type MC1000 by P1 transduction to create isogenic strains containing the individual mutants dsbA::kan, dsbC::cm, and dsbG::kan and the double mutant dsbC::cm,dsbG::kan. As a control for periplasmic RNase I activity, the rna- strain D10 was used (16Gesteland R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Culture Conditions and Periplasmic Extracts—Cells (350 ml) were grown aerobically at 37 °C in either Luria broth or M63 minimal medium (17Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972Google Scholar) to A600 = 0.5 or 1.0. Periplasmic extraction was performed using a modified version of the cold osmotic shock method of Neu and Heppel (18Neu H.C. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3685-3692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (100 ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was gently resuspended in 1 ml of TSE buffer (0.2 m Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 m sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA) using a wire loop. Cells were incubated in TSE buffer on ice for 30 min, transferred to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed to a new microcentrifuge tube; this supernatant constituted the periplasmic extract. Trichloroacetic Acid Precipitation and Two-dimensional Gel Sample Preparation—Trichloroacetic acid (100%) was added to these periplasmic extracts to a final concentration of 10%, followed by incubation on ice for 15 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed with 1.5 ml of ice-cold acetone, incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C to remove residual trichloroacetic acid. This wash step was repeated; acetone was removed; and samples were air-dried. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—First dimension sample buffer (550 μl; containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 1% (w/v) Serdolit MB-1, 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 4% (w/v) Chaps, 1The abbreviations used are: Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. and 0.5% (v/v) Pharmalyte 3-10) was added to each sample, and the sample was shaken at 1000 rpm at 30 °C until fully dissolved (at least 2 h). Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C; 525 μl of supernatant was transferred to a new tube; and samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. For the isoelectric focusing first dimension, 450 μl of each sample was applied to a 24-cm IPG strip (Amersham Biosciences) containing an immobilized pH gradient (pH 3-10, nonlinear). Rehydration and first dimension separation were carried out on an IPGphor (Amersham Biosciences). IPG strips were equilibrated for second dimension using the standard protocol of Amersham Biosciences and then transferred to the second dimension, consisting of SDS-polyacrylamide (13% acrylamide) gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained with 10% acetic acid. Two-dimensional Gel Analysis—Gels were scanned for analysis using an Epson TwainPro scanner. Gel scans were analyzed using the programs Delta 2D (Decodon) and PDQuest (Bio-Rad) according to the program instructions. Each analysis set consisted of at least three replicate gels for each mutant or wild-type strain. Each gel was run from a sample that was handled separately in all steps from cell growth to lysis in sample buffer to ensure reproducibility of results. If a protein spot was not present on all gels of the wild-type strain, it was excluded from analysis. Mass Spectrometry—The protein spots of interest were excised from gels and subjected to trypsin digestion, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems) at the University of Michigan Proteomics Core Facility. Proteins were identified using both automated and manual peak identification. A MOWSE score of 104 (MS-Fit) or confidence interval of >95% (Applied Biosystems GPS Explorer), in addition to correct pI and molecular mass on our two-dimensional gels, was taken to be a correct identification. RNase I Extraction—RNase I was isolated from the periplasm using the Tris/EDTA extract technique of Neu and Heppel (18Neu H.C. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3685-3692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in Luria broth to A600 = 1, and 20 OD* ml was pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were gently resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold 0.2 m Tris (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA and rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. This mixture was then centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was retained as the RNase I extract. RNase I Activity Assay—RNase I activity was assayed using a Panvera RNase activity assay kit according to the directions supplied by the manufacturer, except that the RNase assay buffer was modified to contain 1 mm EDTA instead of 5 mm MgSO4. This change allowed us to more specifically measure RNase I activity since it has been demonstrated that RNase I constitutes ∼98% of the RNase activity of a crude cell extract in the presence of 1 mm EDTA (19Zaniewski R. Petkaitis E. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11651-11653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNase I extract (30 μl) was incubated at 37 °C for 15 h in modified RNase assay buffer (final concentrations of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 1 mm EDTA) in the presence or absence of fluorescein-labeled RNA (final concentration of 1 ng/μl) in a final volume of 50 μl. Positive and negative controls were always performed to ensure that no components of the assay were contaminated with exogenous RNases. These incubations were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated by addition of calf thymus DNA (final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml) and trichloroacetic acid (final concentration of 5%), incubation on ice for 10 min, and centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. This supernatant (80 μl) was mixed with 500 μl of Beacon assay buffer (0.2 m Tris (pH 9.0), 0.5% SDS, and 0.02% sodium azide) and measured on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission measured at 530 nm. Reduction and Denaturation of RNase I—Plasmid expressing RNase I was the gift of Drs. Robert and Louis Lim. RNase I was expressed and purified to >95% purity as described (20Padmanabhan S. Zhou K. Chu C.Y. Lim R.W. Lim L.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Reduction and denaturation of RNase I was carried out in 5 m guanidinium chloride, 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), and 5 mm dithiothreitol at 25 °C for 2 h. Buffer was exchanged into 4 m guanidinium chloride, 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), and 1 mm EDTA using a Nap5 column (Amersham Biosciences). Denatured and reduced RNase I was quantified using ϵ280 = 33,480 m -I was quantified using ϵ280 = 33,000 m-1, whereas native RNase 1 (Swiss Protein Database). The thiol content of denatured and reduced RNase I was measured with 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) as described (21Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), and denatured and reduced RNase I was found to be >95% reduced. In Vitro RNase I Refolding—Refolding of denatured and reduced RNase I was initiated by dilution into redox buffer (40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm oxidized glutathione, and 3 mm reduced glutathione) in the presence and absence of DsbC. DsbC was purified as described previously (22Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.A. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Refolding was performed at 25 °C; and at various times, 100-μl aliquots were removed and quenched with 50 μl of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 50% (v/v) formic acid. Samples were centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 10 min to remove aggregates and analyzed at 55 °C by reverse-phase HPLC (Waters 2695 separations module) on a C18 column (250 × 4.60 mm, Phenomenex Primesphere). The native and denatured/reduced forms were separated using a linear aqueous 34.4-36.4% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 25 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis of the E. coli Periplasm—To identify possible substrates of Dsb proteins, we compared the proteome of dsb- strains with wild-type E. coli. The formation of disulfide bonds is vital to the proper folding of most of the proteins in which they are found. Dsb substrates should lack correct disulfide bonds, causing many of them to be unstable and to aggregate or undergo proteolysis. This should decrease the abundance of substrate proteins present in a periplasmic extract, which should be apparent on two-dimensional gels as the decreased amount of a protein spot in the dsb- strain relative to the wild-type strain. Because the Dsb proteins are located in the periplasm and should not catalyze disulfide bond formation in cytoplasmic proteins, we chose to examine the periplasmic cell fraction. Identification of proteins affected by the absence of Dsb proteins required the specific isolation of periplasmic proteins and the exclusion of cytoplasmic proteins. Periplasmic proteins are estimated to constitute ∼10-30% of the total cell protein; thus, only the most abundant periplasmic proteins are apparent on two-dimensional gels of whole cell extracts. To circumvent this problem, we devised a modified periplasmic extract that allowed us to cleanly separate periplasmic proteins from other cellular components. Each experiment was repeated at least three separate times in both Luria broth and minimal medium. Gene chip experiments have made it clear that the precise pattern of genomic expression is rather sensitive to the physiological state of the bacteria, including small batch-to-batch variations in minimal medium composition. We also observed this on our two-dimensional gels. To circumvent this problem, we simply excluded from analysis any proteins that were not present in very similar levels on all wild-type control gels. Mass spectrometry was performed on the most abundant spots and identified 123 spots representing 74 proteins that are confirmed or predicted periplasmic or outer membrane proteins. dsbA- Periplasmic Extracts Lack Many Disulfide-containing Proteins—Consistent with previous observations (1Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), we noted that our dsbA- strain showed a decreased growth rate compared with the wild-type strain when grown in minimal medium, but not in rich medium. A comparison of the periplasmic proteins present on our wild-type and dsbA- gels revealed substantial differences between the two strains grown in minimal medium (Fig. 1A). Of particular interest are proteins with known disulfide bonds. Mass spectrometry analysis allowed us to identify 10 periplasmic proteins containing at least 2 cysteine residues whose abundance was decreased by at least 2-fold on our dsbA- gels (Table I). The structures of five of these proteins (PhoA, DppA, LivJ, HisJ, and RNase I) have been solved and show the presence of at least one disulfide bond (23Kang C.H. Shin W.C. Yamagata Y. Gokcen S.

The effect of a dsbA null mutation on the folding of disulfide-containing proteins, as measured by our two-dimensional gel system, was much more pronounced in minimal medium than in rich medium.

All data presented for the dsbA- strain are therefore from experiments done in minimal medium, except in the case of two proteins, FlgI and MepA, which were not present on our wild-type minimal medium gels. Of the candidate DsbA substrates identified, we found one well-studied DsbA substrate, periplasmic alkaline phosphatase (1Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). This protein contains 4 cysteine residues forming two disulfide bonds between Cys169 and Cys179 and between Cys287 and Cys337. Alkaline phosphatase has been shown to be a substrate of DsbA: in the dsbA- strain, the protein lacks its disulfides and is therefore protease-sensitive (1Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The abundance of alkaline phosphatase was decreased by 25-fold on dsbA- two-dimensional gels compared with wild-type gels. Other cysteine-containing proteins that were decreased by at least 2-fold include proteins involved in the transport of amino acids and peptides (DppA, HisJ, LivJ, and YbeJ), RNA degradation (RNase I), protein degradation (DegP), and murein degradation (MepA); a flagellar motor protein (FlgI); and a hypothetical protein of unknown function (YggN). dsbA- Affects Proteins without Cysteines—In addition to decreasing the quantity of proteins with disulfide bonds, the dsbA- strain also affected the amount of some proteins with no cysteine residues (Table II). In minimal medium, the spot for flagellin (FliC) was decreased by 25-fold. Two outer membrane proteins, OmpF and PhoE, were decreased by ∼10-fold. Two periplasmic proteins, glucans biosynthesis protein G (encoded by mdoG) and molybdate-binding periplasmic protein (encoded by modA), were also decreased in the dsbA- strain (by 3- and 5-fold, respectively). Finally, the periplasmic protein osmotically inducible protein Y (encoded by osmY) was increased by ∼10-fold in the dsbA- strain grown in minimal medium. As described under “Discussion,” these changes are likely due to pleiotropic effects of the dsbA null mutation on the regulation of these genes.Table IIAmounts of certain cysteine-less proteins are changed in the dsbA− strainGene nameSpot volume in dsbA−% of wild-typefliC4 ± 3ompF11 ± 9ompE12 ± 10modA20 ± 3mdoG32 ± 5osmY970 ± 280 Open table in a new tab The dsbC- Strain Exhibits Decreases in Proteins with Multiple Disulfides—The amounts of two periplasmic proteins, an abundant periplasmic RNase, RNase I, and the penicillin-insensitive murein endopeptidase, MepA, were dramatically decreased in the absence of DsbC (Fig. 1B). In the absence of DsbC, the protein spot for RNase I was missing, whereas the spot for MepA was decreased by 4-fold. RNase I and MepA both contain multiple cysteine residues. MepA contains 6 cysteines; all 6 are 100% conserved among the known or putative penicillin-insensitive murein endopeptidases, suggesting their structural importance to the protein. RNase I contains 8 cysteine residues. The crystal structure of this protein has been solved, and the disulfide connectivity is now known. 2L. W. Lim, personal communication. RNase I contains disulfides between Cys80 and Cys136, Cys97 and Cys124, and Cys197 and Cys234, and a fourth disulfide bond between Cys25 and Cys39 is very likely to exist based on sequence homology to other T2 RNases whose crystal structures have been solved (28Tanaka N. Arai J. Inokuchi N. Koyama T. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Neither MepA nor RNase I appears to rely on DsbG for proper folding. The effect of DsbG on MepA folding could not be determined with certainty: an adjacent protein that is increased in the dsbG- strain obscured the effect of DsbG on MepA. The amount of RNase I in the dsbG- strain was unchanged compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 1, B and C), suggesting that RNase I folding relies only on DsbC and not on DsbG. DsbC (but Not DsbG) Is Required for the in Vivo Function of RNase I—Our two-dimensional gels indicated that DsbC, but not DsbG, is required for the folding and function of RNase I. To address the in vivo effects of DsbC and DsbG on RNase I function, we examined RNase I activity in wild-type and dsb- strains (Fig. 2). RNase I is the only known periplasmic RNase and accounts for ∼98% of the E. coli RNase activity in crude extracts in the presence of 1 mm EDTA (19Zaniewski R. Petkaitis E. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11651-11653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used a Tris/EDTA extract technique specific for periplasmic RNase (18Neu H.C. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3685-3692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and performed our assays in the presence of 1 mm EDTA. RNase I activity was determined by the ability of these Tr"

https://openalex.org/W2104911562,"Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are two key molecules involved in pericellular proteolysis and cell proliferation during tumor growth and angiogenesis. Our previous data showed that MT1-MMP overexpression in human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells induced an up-regulation of VEGF expression. This effect was associated in vivo with accelerated tumor growth and angiogenesis. We now provide evidence that MT1-MMP overexpression specifically affected VEGF-A production and failed to influence that of other VEGF family members (VEGF, B, C, D, or PlGF) or their receptors. The up-regulation of VEGF-A by MT1-MMP was related to an increased transcriptional activation rather than to a modification of mRNA stability. It was blocked by synthetic MMP inhibitors, TIMP2, but not TIMP-1 and abolished by a partial deletion of the catalytic domain or the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP. Analysis of the signal transduction mechanisms demonstrated that MT1-MMP acts through a signaling pathway involving Src tyrosine kinases. Thus, our results provide new insight into the mechanisms of action of MT1-MMP during angiogenesis and suggest that the full enzymatic activity of MT1-MMP is required for a specific up-regulation of VEGF-A through an activation of Src tyrosine kinase pathways.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting ones, is a key event in tumor progression controlled by a balance between positive and negative regulators (1Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Google Scholar, 2Liekens S. De Clercq E. Neyts J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 253-270Google Scholar). From this observation has emerged the concept of the “angiogenic switch” in which endothelial activation status is determined by the induction of angiogenic factors and/or the loss of inhibitors (3Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Google Scholar).

An increasing number of negative regulators have been identified such as inhibitors of proteinases, thrombospondins, interferons, chemokines (IP-10 and PF-4), and bioactive fragments of the extracellular matrix (2Liekens S.

Once a tumor has acquired an angiogenic phenotype, tumor cell migration, invasion, and vessel sprouting require the dynamic and coordinated action of many cell surface molecules, including proteinases and integrins mediating cell-matrix interactions. Among the cell-associated proteinases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) anchored to the plasma membrane, called membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs) play a pivotal role in pericellular proteolysis. Of the six MT-MMPs that have been identified to date, four (MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and MT5-MMP) contain a transmembrane domain followed by a cytoplasmic tail and two (MT4- and MT6-MMP) are tethered to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol link (for review, see Refs. 5Egeblad M.

Although, each of the four physiological tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) can non selectively bind to all active MMPs, TIMP1 is unable to inhibit effectively MT1, 2, 3, and 5-MMPs (14Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Google Scholar). TIMP-2 has dual functions, inhibiting the activity of each MT-MMP and participating in the activation of pro-MMP2 through the formation of a ternary complex formed of MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, and pro-MMP2 (for review, see Refs. 7Sounni N.E.

MT1-MMP has been implicated in the neovascularization process, because it can act as a potent collagenase and fibrinolysin promoting tubulogenesis in collagen or fibrin gels (24Hiraoka N. Allen E.

The pro-angiogenic activity of MT1-MMP is further supported by the effects of MT1-MMP overexpression on tumorigenicity, growth, and vascularization of human melanoma (27Sounni N.E. Baramova E.N.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 580-588Google Scholar) cells transfected with MT1-MMP cDNA. We have previously provided evidence that this MT1-MMP pro-angiogenic effect was mediated at least in part by an up-regulation of VEGF at both mRNA and protein levels (28Sounni N.E. Devy L. Hajitou A. Frankenne F. Munaut C. Gilles C. Deroanne C. Thompson E.W. Foidart J.M. Noel A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 555-564Google Scholar). Such a link between the expression of VEGF and MT1-MMP was further confirmed in authentic tumors, by immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analysis of human glioma tissue samples (30Munaut C. Noel A. Hougrand O. Foidart J.M. Boniver J. Deprez M. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 848-855Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this transcriptional regulation of an angiogenic factor by a membrane-type MMP is currently unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine whether MT1-MMP regulates the expression of other angiogenic factors (VEGF-B,-C,-D, PlGF, and ANG-1 and -2) and their receptors (VEGF-R1,-R2, NRP-1, and Tie-1 and -2), as well as to provide mechanistic insights into VEGF regulation by MT1-MMP.

Neutralizing anti-human MT1-MMP monoclonal antibody LEM2/15.8 was generous gift from Dr. Alicia Arroyo (Madrid, Spain). cDNA Constructions—Full-length wild type human MT1-MMP cDNA (huMT1-MMP) without both 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was subcloned between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pCDNA3.1 Zeo+ mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK). Point mutations (E240A, T567A, C574S, and S577A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Cytotail truncated MT1-MMP construct (Δ577) was prepared from full-length MT1-MMP by inserting a stop codon after Arg-576 by site-directed mutagenesis. Oligonucleotides coding for huMT1-MMP signal sequence (amino acids 1–30) were annealed, and the resulting product was cloned upstream of EGFP in the NheI-AgeI sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector to generate the huMT1SSC1 recombinant vector. In the resulting construct the huMT1-MMP signal sequence is linked by the short linker PVAT to EGFP. Residues 283–582 of huMT1-MMP containing the hinge, hemopexin, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic tail were amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-AAAAAAAGATCTTATGGGGGTGAGTCAGGGTTCCCCACC-3′ (called CHR087) and 5′-AAAAGAATTCTCAGACCTTGTCCAGCAGGGA-3′ (called CHR057). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the BglII-EcoRI sites of huMT1SSC1 in-frame with EGFP. All constructs were verified by sequencing using Big Dye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Cell Culture and Treatments—MCF7 clones stably expressing MT1-MMP or control clones were generated by transfection of adenocarcinoma MCF7 with full-length MT1-MMP cDNA or empty vector as previously described (28Sounni N.E. Devy L. Hajitou A. Frankenne F. Munaut C. Gilles C. Deroanne C. Thompson E.W. Foidart J.M. Noel A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 555-564Google Scholar). Two clones overexpressing MT1-MMP (MT clones: MT/1 and MT/3) and two control clones (C10 and C11) were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm Hepes buffer, and G418 (400 μg/ml). For treatments with MMP inhibitors or other reagents, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (Falcon) to a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and incubated in serumcontaining medium for 24 h. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently supplemented with 2 ml of serum-free DMEM (untreated control), BB94, or RO 28-2653 (final concentration 1 μm); rhTIMP-1 (10 μg/ml) or rhTIMP-2 (0.1–10 μg/ml); leupeptin (1 μm), aprotinin (0.3 μm), pepstatin A (1 μm), or Pefabloc SC (1 μm); blocking anti-MT1-MMP LEM2 (10 μg/ml); genistein (5–50 μm), herbimycin A (0.03–1 μm), PD98059 (50 μm), SB 203580 (20 μm), wortmannin (250 nm), or PP2 (1 μm). After 24 h of incubation, the resulting cell monolayers were collected for RNA or proteins extraction. To block transcription, actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) was added after a 12-h incubation in serum-free medium. Cells were harvested before (0 h) or after several time points (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, or 12 h) following the addition of actinomycin D, and RT-PCR analysis was performed for VEGF mRNA and MT1-MMP mRNA expression. Cell Transfection with Wild Type or Mutated MT1-MMP cDNA— Stable transfection of MCF7 cells with the different constructs were performed using the non-liposomal formulation FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two different vectors containing wild type MT1-MMP cDNA were used: pc3MT1800s with neomycin (28Sounni N.E. Devy L. Hajitou A. Frankenne F. Munaut C. Gilles C. Deroanne C. Thompson E.W. Foidart J.M. Noel A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 555-564Google Scholar) or huMT1-MMP with zeocin (see above) as selected markers, respectively. Transfectants were selected with Zeocin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) or G418 (400 μg/ml) according to the vector used. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—After 24 h of treatment in serum-free medium, total RNA was extracted from cells by using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science). RT-PCR amplification was performed using the GeneAmp Thermostable rTth reverse transcriptase RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ), specific pairs of primers (5 pmol each) (see Table I), 10 ng of total RNA and, when available, a known copy number of an internal standard (multiplex synthetic standard RNA, see below) per 25 μl of reaction mixture (final volume). Reverse transcription was performed at 70 °C for 15 min. For 28 S, MT1-MMP, and TIMP-2 transcripts, PCR amplification was run as follows: 15 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 68 °C, and 10 s at 72 °C (number of cycles as indicated in Table I), followed by a final 2-min extension step at 72 °C. Other cycling conditions are the followings: 20 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 66 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for VEGF-A; 20 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for VEGF-B; 15 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C for VEGF-C and VEGF-D. For VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, and neuropilin-1: 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. For PlGF, Tie-2, and ang-1: 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C. RT-PCR products were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed using a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) after staining with Gelstar dye (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). The selected primer pairs for each human mRNA are described in Table I; their selectivity and efficiency were tested by RT-PCR using 10 ng of total RNA extracted from human placenta or human dermal fibroblasts or 50 ng of human DNA as negative control. For RT-PCR quantification of VEGF-B, -C, -D, PlGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, neuropilin, angiopoietin-1, and Tie2, their expression was normalized to 28 S rRNA. For a more precise quantification of MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, VEGF mRNA, and 28 S rRNA, synthetic standard RNAs were generated as previously described (28Sounni N.E. Devy L. Hajitou A. Frankenne F. Munaut C.

First, they can be amplified by primers used for RT-PCR amplification of the endogenous mRNA of interest. Second, the size of their amplification product is different from the size of the RT-PCR product amplified from the mRNA, permitting their discrimination after electrophoresis. The ratio between the signals for a specific mRNA and the standard RNA was shown to increase linearly with the amount of cellular RNA.Table ISequence of primers used for RT-PCR studiesForward primer (5′ → 3′)Reverse primer (5′ → 3′)Expected size bpNo. of cyclessRNAmRNAMT1-MMP5′-GGATACCCAATGCCCATTGGCCA-3′5′-CCATTGGGCATCCAGAAGAGAGC-3′26922125TIMP-25′-CTCGCTGGACGTTGGAGGAAAGAA-3′5′-AGCCCATCTGGTACCTGTGGTTCA-3′26915525VEGF-A5′-CCTGGTGGACATCTTCCAGGAGTA-3′5′-CTCACCGCCTCGGCTTGTCACA-3′311275, 407, and 47929VEGF-R15′-TCCCTTATGATGCCAGCAAGT-3′5′-CCAAAAGCCCCTCTTCCAA-3′7835VEGF-R25′-CTTCGAAGCATCAGCATAAGAAACT-3′5′-TGGTCATCAGCCCACTGGAT-3′15535VEGF-B5′-CAGAGGAAAGTGGTGTCATGGA-3′5′-ACCGGATCATGAGGATCTGCA-3′22335VEGF-C5′-CTCTCAAGGCCCCAAACCA-3′5′-AGGTCTTGTTCGCTGCCTGA-3′15135VEGF-D5′-TCTCGCTCAGCATCCCATC-3′5′-CACCTCCACGCACGTTTCT-3′15233PlGF5′-CCTACGTGGAGCTGACGTTCT-3′5′-TCCTTTCCGGCTTCATCTTCT-3′13235NRP-15′-CACAGTGGAACAGGTGATGACTTC-3′5′-AACCATATGTTGGAAACTCTGATTGT-3′11129Tie-25′-CAAAACGTGAGGGAAGAACCA-3′5′-AAATTGCCCTCCCCAATCA-3′14835Ang-15′-GGAACCGAGCCTATTCACAGTA-3′5′-CAAGCATCAAACCACCATCCT-3′2113528S5′-GTTCACCCACTAATAGGGAACGTGA-3′5′-GATTCTGACTTAGAGGCGTTCAGT-3′26921218 Open table in a new tab Western Blotting Analysis—Total cell extracts were prepared by incubating cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl; 1% Nonidet P40; 1% Triton X-100; 1% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS; 5 mm iodoacetamide; 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, at 4 °C, the supernatant was stored frozen at -20 °C. Protein concentration was determined by using the DC protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and adjusted to 2 mg/ml. Samples of total cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL membrane, Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL). The membranes were exposed to primary mouse monoclonal antibody 2D-7 raised against the hemopexin-like domain of MT1-MMP (kindly provided by M.-C. Rio, Instit de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France) (28Sounni N.E. Devy L. Hajitou A. Frankenne F. Munaut C. Gilles C. Deroanne C. Thompson E.W. Foidart J.M. Noel A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 555-564Google Scholar) or rabbit polyclonal antibody against human VEGF165, -189, and -121 amino acid splice variants at dilution of 1/500 ((A-20):sc-152 Sanver Tech). After extensive washings, the membranes were incubated with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (for MT1-MMP) or mouse anti-rabbit antibody (for VEGF) at 1/1000 (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gelatin Zymography—Conditioned media were prepared by incubating subconfluent cells (2 × 105) in 24 well-plates (Falcon, BD Biosciences) for 24 h, in serum-free DMEM, in the presence of an exogenous source of MMP-2 (medium conditioned by Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with full-length MMP-2 cDNA) (36Maquoi E. Frankenne F. Baramova E. Munaut C. Sounni N.E. Remacle A. Noel A. Murphy G. Foidart J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11368-11378Google Scholar). Conditioned media were harvested, clarified by centrifugation, and stored frozen at -20 °C. Aliquots (5–10 μl) of conditioned media standardized for cell DNA content were mixed with equal volume of non-reducing sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% SDS; 10% glycerol; 0.1% bromphenol blue) and were resolved on 10% gels SDS-PAGE containing 0.1% gelatin (w/v) according to the procedure previously described (27Sounni N.E. Baramova E.N. Munaut C. Maquoi E. Frankenne F. Foidart J.M. Noel A. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 98: 23-28Google Scholar). Densitometric Analysis—Gels were analyzed with Quantity One software (version 4.2.2., Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) after densitometry scanning of the gels using a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). MT1-MMP Overexpression Is Associated with a Specific Upregulation of VEGF-A—We first examined the possibility that several angiogenic factors and their receptors could be a target of the up-regulatory effect of MT1-MMP. We have used human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 clones stably transfected with MT1-MMP cDNA (MT/1 and MT/3 clones, designed “MT clones”) and control MCF7 cells stably transfected with control vector (C10 and C11 clones called “control clones”) (28Sounni N.E. Devy L. Hajitou A. Frankenne F. Munaut C. Gilles C. Deroanne C. Thompson E.W. Foidart J.M. Noel A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 555-564Google Scholar). We examined by RT-PCR analysis the expression of different forms of VEGF (VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D), PlGF, their receptors (VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), angiopoietin-1, its receptor Tie2 and TIMP-2. In accordance with our previous data (28Sounni N.E. Devy L. Hajitou A. Frankenne F. Munaut C. Gilles C. Deroanne C. Thompson E.W. Foidart J.M. Noel A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 555-564Google Scholar), the mRNA levels of three isoforms of VEGF-A (VEGF121, VEGF165 and VEGF189) were 2- to 3-fold increased in MT clones as compared with control clones (Fig. 1). In sharp contrast, no modulation of the expression of VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-R2, NRP-1, Ang-1, Tie2, or TIMP-2 was induced by MT1-MMP expression. In our conditions, PlGF, VEGF-B, and VEGF-R1 were never detected in the clones analyzed. These findings emphasize the specific effect of MT1-MMP on the mRNA expression of the three VEGF-A isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF165, and VEGF189) without affecting the expression of other angiogenic factors. MT1-MMP Overexpression Does Not Affect VEGF mRNA Stability—To determine whether MT1-MMP overexpression affects VEGF mRNA stability, we evaluated the effect of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA transcription, on the evolution of VEGF mRNA levels in the different clones expressing or not MT1-MMP. In the absence of actinomycin D, the VEGF mRNA expression was increased 3-fold in MT clones as compared with control clones (Fig. 2). In the presence of actinomycin D, VEGF mRNA levels decreased progressively with time and in a similar manner in both MT clones. Almost no VEGF mRNA remained after 3 h of actinomycin D treatment, whereas MT1-MMP mRNAs persisted until 8 h and was not anymore detected after 12 h (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that the VEGF up-regulation by MT1-MMP could not result from an enhancement of mRNA stability but to a transcriptional activation. VEGF Up-regulation by MT1-MMP Is Blocked by MMP Inhibitors—To determine whether MT1-MMP activity is required for VEGF regulation, the effect of synthetic (BB94 and RO 28-2653) or recombinant physiological inhibitors (rTIMP-1 and rTIMP-2) on VEGF expression was examined in MT and control clones. Although the treatment of cells with BB-94 or RO 28-2653 (1 μm) inhibitors reduced VEGF mRNA levels in MT clones, it did not affect the basal VEGF mRNA levels in control clones (Fig. 3A). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis using synthetic standard mRNAs revealed that treatment of MT clones with both inhibitors down-regulated VEGF mRNA production to the levels found in control clones (Fig. 3A). The inhibition of VEGF production in cells treated with BB94 was confirmed by measuring VEGF at a protein level by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). To assess the effect of physiological MMP inhibitors on VEGF regulation, cells were incubated for 24 h with rhTIMP-1 (10 μg/ml), which is unable to inhibit MT1-MMP activity or with increasing concentrations of rhTIMP-2 (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/ml), which binds MT1-MMP (Fig. 4B). TIMP-2 decreased significantly the level of VEGF mRNAs in MT clones when used at 10 μg/ml but not at lower concentrations (0.1 and 1 μg/ml). In sharp contrast, TIMP-1 did not affect VEGF expression. These findings suggest the importance of the enzymatic activity of MT1-MMP in the transcriptional regulation of VEGF. The specificity of MT1-MMP as compared with other proteases, was assessed by using different protease inhibitors. Inhibitors of serine proteases (aprotinin and Pefabloc SC), cystein and serine proteases (leupeptin), or cathepsin and aspartic proteases (pepstatin A) failed to modulate the VEGF expression (Fig. 4A). In sharp contrast, specific anti-MT1-MMP blocking antibody (LEM2) reduced VEGF mRNA levels to that observed in control clones (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Effect of protease inhibitors, recombinant TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and blocking anti-MT1-MMP on the VEGF-A expression. A clone overexpressing MT1-MMP (MT/1) and a control clone (C10) were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium supplemented with leupeptin (1 μm), aprotinin (0.3 μm), pepstatin A (1 μm), or Pefabloc SC (1 μm) (A), recombinant TIMP-1 (10 μg/ml), or different concentrations of recombinant TIMP-2 (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/ml) (B), or with blocking anti-MT1-MMP LEM2 (10 μg/ml) (C). The histograms correspond to the quantification (mean ± S.D.) of RT-PCR analysis of VEGF-A performed on two assays (see legend of Fig. 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) VEGF Up-regulation by MT1-MMP Involves Nonreceptor Src Tyrosine Kinases—To provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the up-regulating effect of MT1-MMP on VEGF, cells were cultured in the presence of several inhibitors of different signaling pathways, and the levels of VEGF were examined by RT-PCR analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 5 (A and B), neither the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway inhibitor (wortmannin), the MAPK/ERK kinase pathway inhibitor (PD98059), nor the p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor (SB203580) affected MT1-MMP-mediated VEGF induction. In contrast, herbimycin-A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, strongly inhibited the up-regulating effect of MT1-MMP. Similarly to herbimycin-A, genistein, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor markedly suppressed the VEGF mRNA induction in MT clones without affecting the VEGF expression in control clones (Fig. 5C). The VEGF mRNA expression in MT clones was not significantly affected by herbimycin-A used at doses ranging from 60 to 125 nm, but was reduced to a basal level by herbimycin-A at 250 nm (Fig. 6A). Incubation of MT clones with increasing concentration of genistein (5–50 μm) decreased VEGF expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, MT1-MMP expression levels were not affected by the different concentrations of herbimycin or genistein used (Figs. 6A and 7A). In addition, VEGF expression in control clones was never modulated by herbimycin-A or genistein at the different concentrations used (Figs. 6A and 7A). In accordance to RT-PCR data, the inhibition of VEGF up-regulation in MT clones by herbimycin-A and genistein was confirmed at protein level by Western blotting (Figs. 6B and 7B).Fig. 7Effect of genistein on VEGF up-regulation by MT1-MMP. One MT1-MMP-overexpressing clone (MT clone: MT/1) and one control clone (C10) were incubated with increasing concentrations of genistein (0–50 μm). A, VEG"
https://openalex.org/W1980022034,"Krüppel-like transcription factors have been linked to cell growth regulation and tumorigenesis in a number of systems. In the intestinal epithelium, expression of KLF5 (IKLF/BTEB2) is limited to proliferating crypt cells, indicating a growth-promoting role. Consistent with this role, we demonstrate that expression of KLF5 in non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells (ileal IEC-18 and Immorto-Min Colon Epithelial (IMCE) cells) enhances colony formation, cyclin D1 transcription, and cell growth. However, in contrast to these effects in non-transformed cells, KLF5 reduced colony number, failed to enhance cyclin D1 transcription, and was negatively correlated with cell growth in colon cancer cell lines. The relationship between tumor progression and KLF5 was further investigated using Ras-mediated transformation of IEC-18 and IMCE cells as syngeneic models. Ras-transformation recapitulated differences in the effects of KLF5 on cell growth and cyclin D1 transcription, providing a direct link between intestinal tumor progression and altered function of KLF5. Ras-transformation also markedly down-regulated KLF5; further analysis indicated that reduced expression of KLF5 mRNA and destabilization of KLF5 protein occur in intestinal tumors. Reduced levels of KLF5 mRNA were also detected in APCmin mouse and human familial adenomatous polyposis adenomas compared with normal crypt epithelium, indicating that down-regulation of KLF5 is an early event in intestinal tumorigenesis in vivo. Collectively, these data indicate that intestinal tumor progression is associated with a change in the growth-related functions of KLF5 and that intestinal tumors down-regulate KLF5 expression by multiple mechanisms.

Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) 1The abbreviations used are: KLF, krüppel-like factor; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; BTEB2, basic transcription element binding protein 2; CMV, cytomegalovirus, EZF, epithelial zinc finger protein; FAP, familial adenomatous polyposis; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GKLF, gut krüppel-like factor; IKLF, intestine-enriched krüppel-like factor; IMCE; immorto-min colonic epithelial; LCM, laser capture microdissection; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; siRNA, short interfering RNA; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. constitute a family of Sp1-related transcription factors with over 20 identified members (for review, see Refs. 1Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 2Bieker J.J. J. Biol.

Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Members of this family are characterized by highly conserved C-terminal, three zinc finger DNA-binding domains that bind to GC-rich sequences with overlapping sequence specificities. In contrast to their DNA binding domains, the N-terminal transactivation domains are not conserved in this family; thus, individual family members can have different transcriptional properties. Furthermore, transcriptional effects of KLFs are context-dependent, with individual factors being transcriptional activators or repressors dependent on the promoter and cell type being examined. Consistent with the presence of GC-rich binding sites for KLFs in multiple promoters, increasing evidence indicates that this family plays a central role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (for review, see Ref. 1Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The intestinal epithelium is among the most rapidly renewing tissues in the body (4Burgess A.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Normal homeostasis in the intestine requires tight regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation, and disruption of this regulation leads to a number of pathological changes including colon cancer. Two KLFs, KLF4 (also known as gut krüppel-like factor, GKLF, and epithelial zinc finger protein, EZF) and KLF5 (also known as basic transcription element-binding protein 2, BTEB2, and intestine enriched krüppel-like factor, IKLF), appear to play a central role in the regulation of intestinal epithelial renewal in both the small intestine and colon. KLF4 is expressed mainly in the non-proliferating differentiating/differentiated cells of the upper crypt and villus/surface mucosa (5Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 6Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

A role for this factor in negative growth regulation and differentiation is supported by the expression and actions of KLF4 in intestinal cell lines and other systems (e.g. 1Black A.R. Black J.D.

Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KLF4 has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in the intestine (6Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; : G806-G814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dang D.T. Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In contrast to KLF4, KLF5 is expressed mainly in the proliferating cells of the crypt (11Ohnishi S. Laub F. Matsumoto N. Asaka M. Ramirez F. Yoshida T. Terada M. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Anderson K.P. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays a positive growth regulatory role in this tissue. A growth-promoting role for KLF5 in the intestine is further indicated by the finding that KLF5± mice have shorter crypts and villi (13Shindo T. Manabe I. Fukushima Y. Tobe K. Aizawa K. Miyamoto S. Kawai-Kowase K. Moriyama N. Imai Y. Kawakami H. Nishimatsu H. Ishikawa T. Suzuki T. Morita H. Maemura K. Sata M. Hirata Y. Komukai M. Kagechika H. Kadowaki T. Kurabayashi M. Nagai R. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Findings in other systems also support a positive growth regulatory role for KLF5. For example, KLF5 is expressed in the proliferating cells of the skin and in activated vascular smooth muscle cells (14Watanabe N. Kurabayashi M. Shimomura Y. Kawai-Kowase K. Hoshino Y. Manabe I.

Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6897-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). While these studies point to a growth-promoting role for KLF5 in the intestine, direct examination of the growth properties of KLF5 in normal intestinal (or other epithelial) tissues has not previously been reported. Here we provide the first direct evidence that KLF5 is growth promoting in non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells. We also demonstrate that, in contrast to its effects in non-transformed cells, KLF5 has growth inhibitory properties in colon tumor-derived cells and that intestinal tumorigenesis is associated with down-regulation of KLF5. These differences in the properties of KLF5 could be recapitulated in syngeneic models of oncogenic transformation, indicating that tumor progression in the intestine is associated with a change in the function(s) of KLF5. Thus, KLF5 may have both growth promoting and tumor suppressive properties in this tissue. Plasmids and Antibodies—The cyclin D1 promoter-reporter plasmid (cyclin D1-luciferase), containing the full-length (–1745) cyclin D1 promoter driving expression of firefly luciferase has been described previously (19Watanabe G.

J. B. Lingrel and M. A. Wani, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio (12Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Anderson K.P. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). pBabe-puro and pBabe-puro containing cDNA for activated Ha-Ras V12 (pBabe-Ras) were provided by Dr. A. W. Lin, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY (21Lin A.W. Lowe S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5025-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Anti-KLF5 antibody (anti-BTEB2) and blocking peptide were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—IEC-18 cells (CRL-1589), a nontransformed intestinal crypt cell line derived from rat ileum, were cultured as described (22Frey M.R. Clark J.A. Leontieva O. Uronis J.M. Black A.R. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). IEC-Babe and IEC-Ras cells were generated by transfection of IEC-18 cells with pBabe-puro or pBabe-Ras, respectively. Cells were then selected with puromycin and stable transfectants were pooled. Two independent sets of IEC-Babe and IEC-Ras cells were generated in two separate parallel transfection/selection procedures. Non-transformed Immorto-Min Colon Epithelial (IMCE) cells and IMCE cells transformed by expression of v-Ha-Ras (IMCE-Ras cells) were obtained from Dr. R. Whitehead, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN (23D'Abaco G. Whitehead R. Burgess A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and were maintained in Dulbecco's-modified Eagle's medium containing 5 units/ml γ-interferon, 1 unit/ml insulin, 5 mm l-glutamine, and 5% fetal bovine serum. Ward cells, derived from a dimethylhydrazine-induced rat colonic adenocarcinoma (24Ward J.M. Yamamoto R.S. Weisburger J.H. Benjamin T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1997-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), were maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.2% ITS-A mixture. DLD-1 cells (CCL-221), HCT-116 cells (CCL-247), and HCT-116b cells (25Brattain M.G. Fine W.D. Khaled F.M. Thompson J. Brattain D.E. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1751-1756PubMed Google Scholar), derived from human colorectal adenocarcinomas, were maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 mm l-glutamine. Cells were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C, except IMCE and IMCE-Ras cells, which were grown at 33 °C. Where indicated, PMA (10 μm in ethanol) was added at a final concentration of 100 nm for 8 h or MG132 (20 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to a final concentration of 20 μm for 6–8 h (control cells were treated with vehicle alone). Colony Formation Assays—IEC-18, Ward and DLD-1 cells (0.5–1 × 105) were transfected in 6 well plates with 5 μg of pBKCMV-KLF5 or pBKCMV using 8 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). IMCE and IMCE-Ras cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24–48 h, cells were maintained in medium containing G418 (1.5 mg/ml for IEC-18 and 0.6 mg/ml for Ward and DLD-1, 1 mg/ml for IMCE and IMCE-Ras) prior to staining with 2% methylene blue/70% methanol for quantitation/imaging of colonies. Reporter Gene Assays—Cells (0.5 × 105) were transfected as above with 2 μg of cyclin D1- or p21-luciferase, 1 μg of pRL-TK, and 2 μg of pBKCMV or pBKCMV-KLF5. After 24 h, luciferase activity was assayed using the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Background luminescence (determined using cells transfected without reporter plasmids) was subtracted from observed luminescence values and values were normalized to cell number. Fold change relative to control was calculated by dividing luminescence values for a particular reporter by the average luminescence obtained with that reporter in the presence of pBKCMV. Flow Cytometry—Subconfluent PMA-treated and control cells were stained with propidium iodide and cell cycle distribution was determined as described (22Frey M.R. Clark J.A. Leontieva O. Uronis J.M. Black A.R. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cells were harvested with 1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 20 μg of protein were subjected to Western blot analysis and densitometric quantitation essentially as described (22Frey M.R. Clark J.A. Leontieva O. Uronis J.M. Black A.R. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with 2 μg/ml anti-KLF5 antibody or 2 μg/ml anti-KLF5 and 2 μg/ml blocking peptide. Equal loading in lanes was confirmed by Fast Green staining of membranes. Apparent molecular weights were calculated from the migration of Kaleidoscope Prestained Standards (Bio-Rad). Northern Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy system (Qiagen), separated on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to Nylon membrane as described (26Black A.R. Dolnick B.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 700-705PubMed Google Scholar). Integrity of RNA and equal loading was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining (26Black A.R. Dolnick B.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 700-705PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with randomly primed 32P-labeled KLF5 cDNA probe using Quickhyb solution (Stratagene) and visualized/quantified by phosphorimaging using the Storm 840/ImageQuant system (Amersham Biosciences). Short Interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated KLF5 Down-regulation— HCT116b cells (4 × 104) were transfected with 1.5 μg siRNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's recommendation and medium was changed after 4–6 h. For determination of KLF5 mRNA expression, cells were extracted in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Levels of GAPDH, KLF5 and KLF4 in RNA samples were determined by RT-PCR using the Access RT-PCR system (Promega) as recommended. Reaction products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, visualized using an AlphaImaging System (Alpha Innotech) and quantified with ImageQuant Software (Amersham Biosciences). For determination of effects on cell growth, cells were harvested by trypsinization at 48 and 96 h after transfection, and cell number was determined using a ZM model Coulter Counter. KLF5 siRNA (sense 5′-AAGCUCACCUGAGGACUCAUU-3′; anti-sense 5′-UGAGUCCUCAGGUGAGCUUUU-3′) and was produced using the Silencer™ siRNA Construction kit (Ambion) as described (27Aizawa K. Suzuki T. Kada N. Ishihara A. Kawai-Kowase K. Matsumura T. Sasaki K. Munemasa Y. Manabe I. Kurabayashi M. Collins T. Nagai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 70-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for RT-PCR were as follows: human KLF5 (TGCCATTTTCAGCCACCAGAGTGA, CGGGGGAAAGTAAGTGGCCTGTTG), human GAPDH (CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA, TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC), and human KLF4 (CTGATGGGCAAGTTCGTGCTGAAG, CGGGTGGCATGAGCTCTTGGTAAT). Analysis of mRNA in Normal Intestinal Epithelial Crypt Cells and Adenoma Cells—Human tissue was obtained from the Tissue Procurement Facility at RPCI. Pure cell populations from APCmin mouse or FAP tissues were procured using the Arcturus PIXCell II LCM system. Cells were dissected from hematoxylin- and eosin-stained 10-μm frozen sections using 15-μm diameter laser pulses at 25 Mv; 800–1200 pulses obtained ∼2000–3000 cells. Only histologically intact intestinal crypt epithelial cells or adenoma cells were microdissected, while other components in the sections, including non-crypt epithelium, stromal cells, endothelial cells and inflammatory cells were avoided. Thus, intestinal crypt samples contained only crypt cells while adenoma samples contained close to 100% neoplastic cells. For isolation of proliferating cells from APCmin mouse crypts, cells were dissected from only the lower-to-mid crypt and Paneth cells were avoided. RNA was purified using the RNA Micro Isolation kit (Stratagene) with DNase treatment (absence of contaminating DNA was confirmed by performing reverse transcription-polymerse chain reactions (RT-PCR) without reverse transcriptase). RT-PCR was performed as above, except that reactions contained 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]CTP. Reaction products were separated by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized/quantitated by phosphorimaging with the Storm 840/ImageQuant system (Amersham Biosciences). Amounts of sample in assays were adjusted to be within the linear range of the assay and to contain equivalent amounts of RNA (based on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression). Primers were as above or as follows: mouse KLF5 (CCATTTTCAGCCACCAGAGCGAGT, ACGGGGGAAAATAAGTGGCCTGCT) and mouse GAPDH (GGCAAAGTGGAGATTGTTGC, AGCTCTGGGATGACCTTGC). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis used the two-tailed Student's t test and p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Errors represent S.E. KLF5 Differentially Affects Colony Formation in Non-transformed and Tumor-derived Intestinal Epithelial Cells—The effects of KLF5 on cell growth in intestinal epithelial cells were examined in colony formation efficiency assays using IEC-18, Ward and DLD-1 cells, which represent non-transformed rat intestinal crypt cells (IEC-18) and intestinal tumor-derived cells of rat (Ward) and human (DLD-1) origin. Cells were transfected with either a control vector (pBKCMV), which expresses the neomycin/G418 resistance gene, or the same vector also expressing KLF5 (pBKCMV-KLF5), and their ability to form G418-resistant colonies was assessed. As can be seen from Fig. 1 (A and B), KLF5 expression in the non-transformed IEC-18 cells markedly increased the number of colonies obtained. In addition, colonies formed by KLF5-transfected cells were generally larger than those seen with control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1A), indicating that KLF5 overexpression enhanced the growth of IEC-18 cells. Similar results were obtained with the non-transformed colonic IMCE cell line (see below), indicating that KLF5 positively regulates growth in non-transformed cells of both small intestine and colonic origin. In contrast, KLF5 appeared to inhibit the growth of tumor-derived cells since transfection of Ward or DLD-1 cells with KLF5 led to a reduction in both the size and number of G418-resistant colonies obtained (Fig. 1, A and B). The differences in the effects of transfection with KLF5 expression vectors in normal and tumor-derived cell lines cannot be attributed to differences in plasmid preparations or transfection efficiency of individual cell lines because: (a) data are from experiments in which IEC-18 cells and tumor-derived cells were transfected and selected in parallel, (b) multiple plasmid preparations were used for experiments, and (c) use of an enhanced green fluorescent protein expression vector (pEGFPN1) indicated that the cell lines were transfected to similar extents (∼30% of cells) under the conditions used. To determine if differences in the expression of exogenous KLF5 could account for these differential effects, IEC-18 and DLD-1 cells were transfected with either the pBKCMV control vector or KLF5 expression vector and subjected to Western analysis with an antibody raised against a peptide from the N-terminal half of KLF5. The anti-KLF5 antibody detected two immunoreactive protein bands which were specific for KLF5 based on their increased levels in cells transfected with KLF5 cDNA (Fig. 1C) and the reduced signal obtained in the presence of blocking peptide (see Fig. 2). In IEC-18 cells, the predominant band was ∼65 kDa with a band at ∼60 kDa sometimes detected, whereas in DLD-1 cells, the major band was at ∼60 kDa with a faint band seen at ∼65kDa (KLF5 was also detected at ∼60 kDa in HCT-116 colon cancer cells, see below). The sizes for KLF5 seen here are in agreement with other studies that have detected KLF5 protein at 57–60 kDa in mouse and between 57 kDa and 66 kDa in different human cell lines (13Shindo T. Manabe I. Fukushima Y. Tobe K. Aizawa K. Miyamoto S. Kawai-Kowase K. Moriyama N. Imai Y. Kawakami H. Nishimatsu H. Ishikawa T. Suzuki T. Morita H. Maemura K. Sata M. Hirata Y. Komukai M. Kagechika H.

While control DLD-1 cells express lower levels of KLF5 than IEC-18 cells, the protein is expressed at comparable levels following transfection with KLF5 cDNA (Fig. 1C). This similar level of expression in KLF5-transfected cells likely reflects a balance between differences in KLF5 protein stability (higher in IEC-18 cells; see below) and CMV promoter activity (which is 9.5 ± 0.6-fold higher in DLD-1 cells based on pCMV-TK activity). Transfection efficiency of these cells was estimated at ∼30% using the enhanced green fluorescent protein expressing vector (data not shown); thus, the observed levels of protein represent an ∼3–4-fold higher expression of KLF5 in transfected IEC-18 and DLD-1 cells than in vector control IEC-18 cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that differences in the expression of KLF5 cannot account for the differential growth effects of its overexpression in these cell lines. Thus, KLF5 enhances growth in non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells but inhibits the growth of tumor-derived intestinal cells. KLF5 Up-regulates Cyclin D1 Promoter Activity in IEC-18 Cells but Not in Tumor-derived Cells—To determine the transcriptional effects of KLF5 in non-transformed and tumor-derived intestinal cells, we analyzed its effects on the activity of the promoters for cyclin D1 and p21Waf1/Cip1. These promoters were selected for analysis because (a) previously identified transcriptional targets of KLF5, such as KLF4 (29Dang D.T. Zhao W. Mahatan C.S. Geiman D.E. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2736-2741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are not expressed in proliferating intestinal epithelial cells, (b) cyclin D1 and p21Waf1/Cip1 play a critical role in intestinal epithelial cell growth regulation and are implicated in carcinogenesis (see Refs. 22Frey M.R.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar), and (c) although the effects of KLF5 on these promoters have not been reported, they have been shown to be regulated by other KLFs (see Refs. 1Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar and 10Dang D.T. Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In IEC-18 cells, KLF5 expression enhanced cyclin D1 promoter activity (Fig. 1D). KLF5 also increased p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter activity in these cells, although the data did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1D). In contrast, KLF5 expression did not enhance cyclin D1 or p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter activity in Ward or DLD-1 cells; indeed KLF5 significantly decreased cyclin D1 promoter activity in DLD-1 cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, consistent with its growth inhibitory effects, KLF5 inhibited or was unable to enhance cyclin D1 promoter activity in tumor-derived cell lines. As with colony survival studies, differences in effects of KLF5 on promoter activity cannot be attributed to differences in plasmid preparations, transfection efficiency, or KLF5 expression because IEC-18 cells and tumor-derived cells were transfected in parallel under conditions that gave similar levels of transfection, and multiple plasmid preparations were used for experiments. KLF5 Protein Expression Is Differentially Regulated in IEC-18 and Colon Tumor-derived Cells—We have previously reported that the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), induces a protein kinase C (PKC) α-mediated G1 and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in IEC-18 cells (22Frey M.R.

As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment of DLD-1 cells with PMA similarly decreased the proportion of cells in S-phase and increased the proportion in G2/M. Thus, although the effect in DLD-1 cells was somewhat less marked than that seen in IEC-18 cells (presumably reflecting the relatively low level of PKCα expression in intestinal tumor-derived cells, Refs. 22Frey M.R.

PMA treatment inhibits cell growth in both the non-transformed and tumor-derived intestinal epithelial cells. To test the effects of PMA on expression of KLF5, IEC-18, and DLD-1 cells were treated with 100 nm PMA and subjected to Western blot analysis (Ward cells were not used in these experiments because they did not have detectable levels of KLF5 protein; data not shown). As noted above, proliferating IEC-18 cells had higher levels of KLF5 protein than proliferating DLD-1 cells (it should be noted that, since the levels of KLF5 in the non-transformed cells from which DLD-1 cells were deriv"

We have investigated the roles of the GTPase RhoA and its effector kinases ROCK1/2 in hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation. RhoA, ROCK1, and ROCK2 are expressed throughout chondrogenic differentiation. RhoA overexpression in chondrogenic ATDC5 cells results in increased proliferation and a marked delay of hypertrophic differentiation, as shown by decreased induction of alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization, and expression of the hypertrophic markers collagen X, bone sialoprotein, and matrix metalloproteinase 13. These effects are accompanied by activation of cyclin D1 transcription and repression of the collagen X promoter by RhoA. In contrast, inhibition of Rho/ROCK signaling by the pharmacological inhibitor Y27632 inhibits chondrocyte proliferation and accelerates hypertrophic differentiation. Dominant-negative RhoA also inhibits induction of the cyclin D1 promoter by parathyroid hormone-related peptide. Finally, Y27632 treatment partially rescues the effects of RhoA overexpression. In summary, we identify the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway as a novel and important regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.

The development and growth of endochondral bones (such as ribs, vertebrae, and the long bones of vertebrate limbs) are regulated through the highly controlled rates of proliferation and hypertrophic differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes (1Wagner E.F.

In the growth plate, chondrocytes first undergo a series of cell divisions along the longitudinal axis of the growing bone, thereby forming characteristic columns of clonal cells. Chondrocytes then withdraw from the cell cycle and begin to increase their cell volume until reaching the fully differentiated state of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Transition from a proliferating to a hypertrophic phenotype involves numerous changes in gene expression, for example the induction of the collagen X (4Kielty C.M. Kwan A.P. Holmes D.F. Schor S.L.

The latter two genes are also expressed by osteoblasts, suggesting similar biological properties of hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts. The fate of hypertrophic chondrocytes is still debated, but it appears that the majority of these cells undergo apoptosis and are replaced by bone tissue (11Adams C.S. Shapiro I.M. Crit. Rev.

Longitudinal growth of endochondral bones therefore requires both proliferation and differentiation-associated hypertrophy of growth plate chondrocytes. Disruption of chondrocyte proliferation and/or differentiation by gene mutations commonly results in chondrodysplasias that are characterized by skeletal deformities and reduced growth (12Mundlos S.

However, the intracellular signaling pathways that transduce and integrate all of these signals are largely unknown.

In this study we examined the roles of RhoA/ROCK signaling in chondrocyte differentiation. RhoA and ROCK1/2 are expressed throughout chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells and mouse primary limb bud cells. Overexpression of RhoA in ATDC5 cells results in enhanced cell proliferation and a marked delay in hypertrophic differentiation. In contrast, inhibition of ROCK signaling by a pharmacological inhibitor accelerates differentiation of ATDC5 cells and primary cells and partially rescues the effects of RhoA overexpression. These data suggest a novel and important function of Rho signaling in skeletal growth and development.

Generation of Stable Transfectants—ATDC5 cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/ml in 6-well plates and transfected with pcDNA3.1+ (vector control) or the RhoA expression vector using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection, selection was initiated using G418 (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 400 μg/ml. To avoid clonal artifacts, pools of transfected cells were collected and cultured as the parental ATDC5 cells but in the continued presence of G418. All experiments were performed three times, and representative experiments are shown. Micromass Cultures—Micromass cultures from embryonic mouse limb buds were established and cultured as described previously (52Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently that this culture system allows the reproducible hypertrophic differentiation of primary mouse limb bud cells in vitro (52Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the cultures at the indicated time, using the TriZol reagent RNA extraction protocol according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) with (dT)12-18 and random hexamer primers (Amersham Biosciences). Amplification was performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 1 μl of cDNA reaction and using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primer sequences used for each PCR are outlined below. Initial denaturation was done at 95 °C for 1.5 min, annealing temperatures ranged from 60 to 65 °C for 45-120 s, followed by extension at 72 °C. A final extension at 72 °C for 6 min concluded the reaction. PCR cycles varied from 20 to 37 cycles. PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. β-Actin, collagen II, collagen X, and matrix metalloproteinase 13 primer sequences were as described previously (53Negishi Y.

Real Time PCR—Real time PCRs for collagen X and BSP were performed as described previously (52Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) using the TaqMan one-step master mix kit (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI Prism 7900 HT Sequence Detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 40 cycles and an annealing temperature of 60 °C. Protein Isolation and Western Blotting—For protein extraction, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Cell Lysis Buffer (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assays (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 40 μg of protein/lane was resolved on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were transferred onto BioTrace™ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall), which were incubated in blocking buffer (5% low fat milk power in Tris-buffered saline). Blocked filters were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h and subsequently with a 1:8,000 dilution of secondary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h. Signal was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Alkaline Phosphatase Activity and Mineralization Assays—Alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization were analyzed using staining methods and quantitative assays as described previously (52Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Proliferation Assays—For proliferation assays, ATDC5 cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/ml in 96-well tissue plates for MTT assays and in 24-well plates for counting by hemocytometer. For MTT assay cells were incubated for the times indicated. 10 μl of MTT solution (Roche Applied Science) was added for the last 4 h. After solubilization, the formazan dye was quantitated using a scanning multiwell spectrophotometer at 600 nm. The absorbance (A600 nm-A700 nm) revealed correlates directly with the cell number. Transient Transfections—Primary chondrocytes were isolated from newborn mice as described previously (50Beier F. Lee R.J. Taylor A.C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and transfected with cyclin D1 and collagen X reporter vectors (50Beier F. Lee R.J. Taylor A.C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3852-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), using 1 μg of reporter vector, 0.2 μg of expression plasmid (empty expression vector or RhoA expression vectors), and 0.1 μg of pRLSV40 for standardization. 48 h after transfections, cells were harvested, and firefly activity was determined and standardized to Renilla luciferase activity. For experiments with PTHrP, cells were transfected, serum-starved for 24 h, and stimulated with PTHrP (10-8m) for 12 h before harvesting. Data shown represent the averages ± S.D. from three independent transfections, performed in duplicate each. RhoA and ROCK1/2 Are Expressed throughout Chondrogenic Differentiation—We first analyzed the expression of RhoA and ROCK1/2 mRNAs during chondrogenic differentiation by RT-PCR analyses. All three genes are expressed throughout differentiation of ATDC5 cells (Fig. 1A) and primary mesenchymal limb bud cells in micromass cultures (Fig. 1B). Early chondrogenic differentiation and hypertrophy of ATDC5 cells are demonstrated by the expression of collagens II and X, respectively (Fig. 1A). A similar pattern of collagen gene expression is observed in primary micromass cultures (Fig. 1B). Next we examined the expression of the corresponding proteins in differentiating ATDC5 cells by Western blotting. RhoA, ROCK1, and ROCK2 proteins are detected throughout chondrogenic differentiation (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate the expression of RhoA mRNA and protein in chondrocytes; however, they do not show which proportion of the total RhoA protein is in the active (GTP-bound) form. RhoA Stimulates ATDC5 Cell Proliferation—We generated ATDC5 cells overexpressing RhoA to determine the roles of Rho signaling in chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophic differentiation. Western blot analyses demonstrate that RhoA-transfected cells express higher levels of RhoA protein than untransfected or vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). MTT analyses show that the number of RhoA-overexpressing cells grows faster than the numbers of untransfected or vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, RhoA-overexpressing cells reach a higher cell density; although cell numbers plateau around day 12 in all lines, the values are approximately 25% higher in the RhoA-overexpressing cell lines. These results are confirmed by cell counting experiments that demonstrate a greater than 30% increase in cell number in RhoA-transfected cells (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that RhoA overexpression enhances the proliferation of chondrocytes and delays cell cycle exit. RhoA Overexpression Delays Induction of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity and Mineralization—We next examined the effects of RhoA overexpression on hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation. Alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of hypertrophic differentiation, increases during differentiation of untransfected and vector-transfected ATDC5 cells (Fig. 3A). RhoA overexpression results in a marked delay in this decrease and markedly lower activity at the end of the culture period (30 days). Similarly, mineralization of the extracellular matrix, another marker of late chondrocyte differentiation, is clearly delayed and decreased by overexpression of RhoA (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that RhoA overexpression inhibits the induction of hypertrophic markers in differentiating ATDC5 cells. RhoA Inhibits Hypertrophic Gene Expression—We studied the effects of RhoA overexpression on the expression of several marker genes of hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation. RT-PCR analyses demonstrate that overexpression of RhoA leads to delayed onset of collagen X (Fig. 4A) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Fig. 4B) expression compared with control cells. Reduced expression of collagen X was confirmed by real time PCR analyses of gene expression (Fig. 4C). In addition, expression of the BSP gene, another marker of hypertrophic chondrocytes, is also decreased in RhoA-overexpressing cells, although not as much as for the collagen X gene (Fig. 4D). These findings confirm the inhibition of hypertrophic differentiation by RhoA signaling which is observed in alkaline phosphatase and mineralization assays. RhoA Regulates Cyclin D1 and Collagen X Promoter Activity in Chondrocytes—We performed transient transfection studies in primary mouse chondrocytes to verify the roles of RhoA signaling in primary cells. Expression vectors for wild type and mutant RhoA proteins were cotransfected together with reporter plasmids for the cyclin D1 and collagen X promoters, which are active in proliferating (50Beier F.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) chondrocytes, respectively. Cyclin D1 promoter activity is up-regulated by overexpression of wild type RhoA and the activated Q63L mutant, whereas overexpression of dominant-negative T19N RhoA reduces cyclin D1 promoter activity by 39% (Fig. 5A). In contrast, collagen X promoter activity is reduced more than 2-fold by wild type and activated RhoA and strongly enhanced by dominant-negative RhoA (Fig. 5B). These data support our conclusion that RhoA signaling supports proliferation and inhibits hypertrophic differentiation in chondrocytes. We and others have shown that PTH/PTHrP signaling stimulates cyclin D1 transcription in chondrocytes (55Beier F. Ali Z. Mok D. Taylor A.C. Leask T. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P. Mol. Biol.

Recent work has identified a Rho-specific activator, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor CDEP, as a target of PTH in chondrocytes (58Koyano Y. Kawamoto T. Kikuchi A. Shen M. Kuruta Y. Tsutsumi S.

Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether RhoA signaling is required for PTH/PTHrP-induced activation of the cyclin D1 promoter. 10-8m PTHrP induces a strong (6-fold) activation of the cyclin D1 promoter in primary mouse chondrocytes, as described previously (55Beier F. Ali Z. Mok D. Taylor A.C. Leask T. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. LuValle P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3852-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of dominant-negative RhoA blocks this activation by 40%, indicating that RhoA signaling is required for maximal induction of cyclin D1 transcription by PTH/PTHrP. In accordance with these data, we demonstrate expression of CDEP mRNA throughout chondrogenic differentiation of micromass cultures and ATDC5 cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 5D). In both cell types, the highest levels of CDEP expression are seen at early stages where cell proliferation is strongest. ROCK Inhibition Accelerates Hypertrophic Differentiation—The kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 are among the most important effectors of RhoA (33Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2121340868,"The ribosome-associated Trigger Factor (TF) cooperates with the DnaK system to assist the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides in Escherichia coli. TF unifies two functions in one to promote proper protein folding in vitro. First, as a chaperone it binds to unfolded protein substrates, thereby preventing aggregation and supporting productive folding. Second, TF catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds, which can be a rate-limiting step in protein folding. Here, we investigated whether the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) function is essential for the folding activity of TF in vitro and in vivo by separating these two TF activities through site-directed mutagenesis of the PPIase catalytic center. Of the four different TF variants carrying point mutations in the PPIase domain, only the exchange of the conserved residue Phe-198 to Ala (TF F198A) abolished the PPIase activity of TF toward both a tetrapeptide and the model protein substrate RNase T1 in vitro. In contrast, all other activities of TF F198A tested were comparable with wild type TF. TF F198A retained a similar binding specificity toward membrane-bound peptides, assisted the refolding of denatured d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in vitro, and associated with nascent polypeptides in an in vitro transcription/translation system. Importantly, expression of the TF F198A encoding gene complemented the synthetic lethality of ΔtigΔdnaK cells and prevented global protein misfolding at temperatures between 20 and 34 °C in these cells. We conclude that the PPIase activity is not required for the function of TF in folding of newly synthesized proteins.

In contrast, all other activities of TF F198A tested were comparable with wild type TF. TF F198A retained a similar binding specificity toward membrane-bound peptides, assisted the refolding of denatured d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in vitro, and associated with nascent polypeptides in an in vitro transcription/translation system. Importantly, expression of the TF F198A encoding gene complemented the synthetic lethality of ΔtigΔdnaK cells and prevented global protein misfolding at temperatures between 20 and 34 °C in these cells. We conclude that the PPIase activity is not required for the function of TF in folding of newly synthesized proteins. Trigger Factor (TF) 1The abbreviations used are: TF, Trigger factor; aa, amino acid(s); FKBP, FK506-binding protein; GAPDH, d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PPIase, peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase; RCM-RNase T1, reduced and carboxymethylated RNase T1. 1The abbreviations used are: TF, Trigger factor; aa, amino acid(s); FKBP, FK506-binding protein; GAPDH, d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PPIase, peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase; RCM-RNase T1, reduced and carboxymethylated RNase T1. was first discovered in Escherichia coli as a protein that triggered the translocation of the precursor of pro-OmpA into membrane vesicles (1Crooke E. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5216-5220Google Scholar). Although this activity indicated a secretion-specific chaperone function for TF, E. coli cells depleted for TF were subsequently shown to lack any secretion defect (2Guthrie B. Wickner W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5555-5562Google Scholar). Later, TF was rediscovered as a ribosome-associated chaperone and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) (3Stoller G. Ruecknagel K.P. Nierhaus K.H. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.-U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4939-4948Google Scholar, 4Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Google Scholar). TF is located on the large ribosomal subunit near the peptide exit channel and binds to virtually all nascent polypeptides (4Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Google Scholar, 5Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. Vorderwülbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A. Ban N. Deuerling E. Bukau B. Nature. 2002; 419: 171-174Google Scholar, 6Valent Q.A. Kendall D.A. High S. Kusters R. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5494-5505Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that TF is the first chaperone that interacts with nascent chains and assists cotranslational protein folding. Genetic evidence indicates that TF cooperates with the DnaK system to ensure proper folding of cytosolic proteins. E. coli cells deleted for the TF-encoding tig gene show no growth defects at temperatures between 15 and 42 °C, and mutants lacking the dnaK gene are viable between 20 °C and 37 °C. However, the combined deletion of the tig and dnaK genes causes aggregation of at least 340 species of newly synthesized cytosolic proteins and synthetic lethality at 37 °C (7Deuerling E. Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Nature. 1999; 400: 693-696Google Scholar, 8Teter S.A. Houry W.A. Ang D. Tradler T. Rockabrand D. Fischer G. Blum P. Georgopoulos C. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1999; 97: 755-765Google Scholar, 9Deuerling E. Patzelt H. Vorderwülbecke S. Rauch T. Kramer G. Schaffitzel E. Mogk A. Schulze-Specking A. Langen H. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1317-1328Google Scholar). In vitro TF chaperone activity prevents aggregation and promotes refolding of denatured rabbit d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (10Huang G.C. Li Z.Y. Zhou J.M. Fischer G. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1254-1261Google Scholar). In contrast to DnaK, TF, in addition to its chaperone activity, can efficiently catalyze cis/trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl peptide bonds in chromogenic tetrapeptides and the RNase T1 protein substrate in vitro (PPIase activity) (3Stoller G. Ruecknagel K.P. Nierhaus K.H. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.-U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4939-4948Google Scholar, 4Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Google Scholar, 11Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Google Scholar). For RNase T1, the slow isomerization is the rate-limiting step in the folding process (12Schmid F.X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 123-143Google Scholar). Unlike other prolyl isomerases, TF binds with high affinity to unfolded RNase T1, and this chaperone function is the prerequisite for the excellent catalysis of folding (11Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Google Scholar). There are a few other examples of PPIases that also display a chaperone activity, including the periplasmic PPIase SurA from E. coli and the mammalian FKBP52. However, in these proteins the two activities are localized in different domains (13Pirkl F. Fischer E. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37034-37041Google Scholar, 14Behrens S. Maier R. de Cock H. Schmid F.X. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 285-294Google Scholar). TF is different, because both activities involve the same substrate binding pocket in the central PPIase domain. A similar finding was only observed for the periplasmic chaperone and PPIase FkpA from E. coli (15Ramm K. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 485-498Google Scholar). TF has a modular structure with functions assigned to two of the three domains. The N-terminal domain (aa 1-144) mediates ribosome binding. The central domain (aa 145-247) harbors the peptide binding site and the catalytic PPIase activity, both of which involve the same binding pocket (16Patzelt H. Rudiger S. Brehmer D. Kramer G. Vorderwulbecke S. Schaffitzel E. Waitz A. Hesterkamp T. Dong L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14244-14249Google Scholar, 17Stoller G. Tradler T. Rucknagel K.P. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 117-122Google Scholar, 18Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 67-71Google Scholar). This domain has homology to PPIases of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) family and mediates substrate binding specificity (16Patzelt H. Rudiger S. Brehmer D. Kramer G. Vorderwulbecke S. Schaffitzel E. Waitz A. Hesterkamp T. Dong L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14244-14249Google Scholar, 19Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 211-215Google Scholar). An important open question is whether the activity of TF as a ribosome-associated folding factor relies on both its chaperone and PPIase activity. To separate the PPIase and chaperone activities of TF, we constructed TF mutant proteins with specific alterations in the PPIase domain. Of four different TF variants, the mutant protein TF F198A fully retains its chaperone activity but lacks the catalytic PPIase function. This TF mutant provided a unique tool to investigate the importance of the PPIase activity for TF function in promoting the folding of newly synthesized proteins in vivo. Growth Conditions—Strains were grown in LB (Luria Broth) medium containing IPTG as indicated and supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), tetracycline (5 μg/ml), or kanamycin (40 μg/ml) when appropriate. Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strains were derivatives of MC4100. Strain GK2, carrying a chromosomal deletion of the entire dnaK open reading frame and expressing wild type levels of DnaJ, was constructed as follows. The dnaK gene of MC4100 was replaced with a kanamycin resistance cassette using plasmid pKD4 as PCR-template and the primers dnaK-5′ (5′-CAGACTCACAACCACATGATGACCGAATATATAGTGGAGACGTTTAGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG-3′) and dnaK-3′ (5′-TTCCGCTGTTTTGGAAACGCCTAAAATCTCGTAATAATCTTGCTTAGCCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3′) as described (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Google Scholar), resulting in strain GK1. Subsequently, the kanamycin resistance cassette was removed using plasmid pCP20 (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Google Scholar), resulting in strain GK2. Mutations in the tig gene were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pDS56-tig-His6 as template (21Hesterkamp T. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21865-21871Google Scholar), resulting in pDS56-tig178, pDS56-tig198, pDS56-tig221, pDS56-tig224, and pDS56-tig233, respectively. Plasmid pTrc-tig and pTrc-tig198 are derivatives of pTrc99B (22Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene. 1988; 69: 301-315Google Scholar). Utilizing PCR, tig was amplified using pDS56-tig as template and primer 5′-tig (5′-CAAGTTTCAGTTGAAACCACTC-3′) and 3′-tig-BamHI (5′-GGCCGGATCCTTACGCCTGCTGGTTCATCAGCTC-3′), gel purified, and subsequently digested with BamHI. Plasmid pTrc99B was digested with NcoI, blunt-ended using T4-DNA-polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc.), then digested with BamHI, gel purified, and ligated with the BamHI-digested tig fragment, resulting in pTrc-tig. pTrc-tig198 was constructed by exchanging the StuI fragment of pTrc-tig with the corresponding StuI fragment of pDS56-tig198. In Vivo Complementation Analysis—P1 lysates, P1 transductions, and disruption of chromosomal genes were done as described (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Google Scholar, 23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). GK2 was transformed using plasmid pTrc-tig or pTrc-tig198, respectively. The deletion of tig, encoding TF, was introduced by P1 transduction using a P1 lysate derived from a strain carrying Δtig::kan genetically linked to zba-3054::Tn10, conferring tetracycline resistance as described (7Deuerling E. Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Nature. 1999; 400: 693-696Google Scholar). After P1 transduction, cells were selected on LB medium supplemented with 10 μm IPTG and 5 μg/ml tetracycline. Subsequently, tetracycline-resistant clones were tested for cotransduction of Δtig::kan by growth on LB plates containing 10 μm IPTG and 40 μg/ml kanamycin. Protein Purification—TF and TF variants were purified as C-terminally His6-tagged proteins by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography (21Hesterkamp T. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21865-21871Google Scholar). PPIase Tetrapeptide Assay—The assay was performed essentially as described (24Fischer G. Bang B. Ludwig B. Mann K. Hacker J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1375-1383Google Scholar). To start a reaction, 84 μm succinyl-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-para-nitroanilide (Bachem Biochemica GmbH), 0.08 mg/ml chymotrypsin (Sigma; C-7762) and 100 nm TF or TF variant were mixed in 35 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, at 10 °C. Absorption at 395 nm was followed in a photometer (Shimatsu). The first 30 s of the assay were treated as dead time in which the large excess of the pre-existing trans isomer is cleaved by chymotrypsin. Data after 30 s were fitted to a single-exponential equation (GraFit program). The catalytic efficiency of TF and TF variants was corrected for spontaneous isomerization by the equation kcat/Km = (kexp - ksp)/cTF, where kexp is the experimental rate constant, ksp is the constant of the spontaneous isomerization reaction without TF, and cTF is the concentration of TF or TF variants, respectively. RNase T1 Refolding Assay—RNase T1 from Aspergillus oryzae (Sigma; R-1003) was denatured, reduced, and carboxymethylated using dithiothreitol as the reducing agent according to the protocol (25Mücke M. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7848-7854Google Scholar). Protein refolding was induced by dilution to final concentrations of 1 μm reduced and carboxymethylated RNase T1 (RCM-RNase T1) and 1.6 m NaCl, respectively, in a spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; LS 55). The concentration of TF variants was 0.2 μm. Screening of Membrane-bound Peptides—Cellulose membrane-bound 13-meric peptides scanning the sequence of the λcI protein with an overlap of 10 amino acids were incubated with 500 nm TF or TF variants for 30 min at 25 °C. Bound chaperone was electrotransferred by fractionated semi-dry blotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected using TF-specific antisera (16Patzelt H. Rudiger S. Brehmer D. Kramer G. Vorderwulbecke S. Schaffitzel E. Waitz A. Hesterkamp T. Dong L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14244-14249Google Scholar, 26Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Google Scholar). Prevention of GAPDH Aggregation—Aggregation of denatured GAPDH from rabbit muscle (Sigma; G-2267) was measured according to the method described (10Huang G.C. Li Z.Y. Zhou J.M. Fischer G. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1254-1261Google Scholar). 125 μm GAPDH was denatured overnight at 4 °C. Upon 50-fold dilution of the denatured enzyme into GAPDH buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol), aggregation was monitored by 90° light scattering at 620 nm in a spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; LS 55) in the presence or absence of 1 or 2 μm TF or TF variants. GAPDH Refolding Assay—Refolding of denatured GAPDH was performed as described (10Huang G.C. Li Z.Y. Zhou J.M. Fischer G. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1254-1261Google Scholar). Denatured enzyme was 50-fold diluted into GAPDH buffer (see above) containing 2.5 μm TF or TF variant, kept at 4 °C for 30 min, and for a further 240 min at 25 °C. At different time points within these 240 min, an aliquot was taken, and GAPDH activity was measured. To analyze time points, a 200-μl aliquot was mixed with 800 μl of GAPDH buffer to final concentrations of 667 μm β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (β-NAD; Sigma; N-0632) and 667 μmdl-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP; Sigma G-5251). Absorbance of synthesized NADH was followed in a spectrometer (Shimatsu) at 340 nm. Data were fitted to a single exponential equation (GraFit program). Relative activity of refolded GAPDH was calculated by dividing the rate constants by the rate constant determined for the same amount of non-denatured GAPDH. Miscellaneous—In vitro transcription/translation assays were performed in an E. coli-based transcription/translation system isolated from a Δtig strain (7Deuerling E. Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Nature. 1999; 400: 693-696Google Scholar, 27Schaffitzel E. Rüdiger S. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1235-1243Google Scholar). Isolation of aggregates was performed as described previously (28Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rüdiger S. Röder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Google Scholar). Mutations in the TF PPIase Domain—Based on a study on human FKBP12 in which residues that are essential for its catalytic PPIase activity (29DeCenzo M.T. Park S.T. Jarrett B.P. Aldape R.A. Futer O. Murcko M.A. Livingston D.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 173-180Google Scholar) were identified, we designed mutations in the homologous PPIase domain of TF. We exchanged the conserved residues Glu-178 (Glu-37 in FKPB12), Phe-198 (Trp-59 in FKBP12), Tyr-221 (Tyr-82 in FKBP12), and Phe-233 (Phe-99 in FKBP12) in the TF PPIase domain to generate the TF E178V, TF F198A, TF Y221F, and TF F233L mutants, respectively. As illustrated by a homology model of the TF PPIase domain, these amino acids localize within or adjacent to the central substrate binding pocket (Fig. 1). The TF mutant proteins were analyzed for their structural integrity by circular dichroism measurements, proteinase K digestion, and determination of their ability to associate with E. coli ribosomes. In these assays, all mutant proteins behaved similarly to wild type TF (data not shown). TF F198A Is Deficient in PPIase Activity—We tested the TF mutants for their catalytic PPIase activity toward two substrates, a chromogenic tetrapeptide and the model protein substrate RNase T1. These assays may give different results, because the binding affinity of TF for protein substrates is much higher than that for peptides (11Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Google Scholar, 16Patzelt H. Rudiger S. Brehmer D. Kramer G. Vorderwulbecke S. Schaffitzel E. Waitz A. Hesterkamp T. Dong L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14244-14249Google Scholar). Small alterations in the binding pocket may have a more pronounced effect on the affinity of TF for peptides. This phenomenon has also been observed for other PPIases (30Scholz C. Schindler T. Dolinski K. Heitman J. Schmid F.X. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 69-73Google Scholar). The tetrapeptide assay detects PPIase activity by measuring the trans isomer-specific proteolytic cleavage of the substrate succinyl-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide, which contains a mixture of cis and trans Phe-Pro bonds (24Fischer G. Bang B. Ludwig B. Mann K. Hacker J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1375-1383Google Scholar). The TF variants TF F198A and TF F233L were inactive (<1% of TF wild type activity; Fig. 2A), even when added in a 20-fold higher concentration than wild type TF (data not shown). TF Y221F showed a residual activity of ∼15% compared with wild type TF, whereas TF E178V was slightly more active than wild type TF, as observed earlier (31Tradler T. Stoller G. Rücknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Google Scholar). Importantly, none of the TF variants was degraded by chymotrypsin during the assay as detected by Western blotting (data not shown). Refolding of RCM-RNase T1 is limited by the slow trans to cis isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds at Pro-39 and Pro-55 (12Schmid F.X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 123-143Google Scholar). RCM-RNase T1 is unfolded at 15 °C and pH 8 under low salt conditions (0.4 m NaCl) but folds back to an enzymatically active form under 2 m salt conditions. The refolding of RCM-RNase T1 upon dilution into 2 m salt buffer can be followed by measuring intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. In this assay, only TF F198A exhibited no significant catalytic activity. In contrast to the tetrapeptide assay, the variants TF Y221F and TF F233L were active in the refolding of RNase T1, although less than wild type TF, and TF E178V displayed wild type activity (Fig. 2B). Together, these findings show a consistent lack of PPIase activity for the TF F198A mutant. TF and TF F198A Show Similar Binding Specificities—It is possible that mutations in the substrate binding pocket of the PPIase domain may alter the substrate binding specificity of TF and, thereby, prevent TF mutant proteins from acting in the prolyl isomerization of the two substrates tested. The TF binding specificity can be investigated by using libraries consisting of 13-meric membrane-bound peptides (16Patzelt H. Rudiger S. Brehmer D. Kramer G. Vorderwulbecke S. Schaffitzel E. Waitz A. Hesterkamp T. Dong L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14244-14249Google Scholar). To check whether the PPIase deficiency of TF F198A could be due to a shift in binding specificity, we investigated its recognition of different amino acid stretches in a model substrate. We incubated peptide libraries, scanning the sequence of the λcI protein with either TF or TF F198A to equilibrium. Subsequently, bound chaperone was electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunodetected. As shown in Fig. 2C, both TF proteins recognized the same peptides and, therefore, displayed comparable binding specificities. Although the signal intensities for TF and TF F198A on the peptide libraries were similar (Fig. 2C), TF and TF F198A may differ to some extent, because this method does not quantitatively measure the affinity for peptides. Other TF mutants behaved similarly (data not shown). TF F198A Is Active as a Chaperone in Vitro—TF efficiently prevents the aggregation and promotes the refolding of chemically denatured GAPDH. The refolding of GAPDH does not depend on the isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds. Therefore, this assay selectively monitors the chaperone, but not the PPIase activity, of TF (10Huang G.C. Li Z.Y. Zhou J.M. Fischer G. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1254-1261Google Scholar). To analyze the chaperone activity of the TF F198A, we denatured GAPDH overnight in 3 m GdnHCl. Upon 50-fold dilution, GAPDH aggregated rapidly. Stoichiometric amounts of TF efficiently prevented the GAPDH aggregation, as no increase of light scattering signal at 620 nm was observed. All TF mutant proteins, including the PPIase deficient variant TF F198A, showed a similar activity as wild type TF (Fig. 3A). GAPDH activity can be monitored by following the reduction of NAD+ to NADH at 340 nm in a photometer. This assay was used to determine the folding kinetics of denatured GAPDH in the presence of TF and TF variants. At different time points after 50-fold dilution of the denatured enzyme, we determined GAPDH activity. In the absence of TF, GAPDH remained enzymatically inactive over a 4-h time period. In contrast, the presence of wild type TF restored up to 80% of non-denatured GAPDH activity, similar to results reported earlier (10Huang G.C. Li Z.Y. Zhou J.M. Fischer G. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1254-1261Google Scholar). All TF variants revealed a chaperone activity comparable with wild type TF (Fig. 3B). Mutations in the TF PPIase Domain Do Not Abolish Interaction with Nascent Polypeptides—Ribosome association and interaction with nascent polypeptides are crucial for TF function in vivo (5Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. Vorderwülbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A. Ban N. Deuerling E. Bukau B. Nature. 2002; 419: 171-174Google Scholar). To characterize the ability of TF PPIase mutant proteins to bind nascent polypeptide chains, we performed cross-linking analysis in an E. coli-based in vitro transcription/translation system derived from TF-deficient cells (27Schaffitzel E. Rüdiger S. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1235-1243Google Scholar). We generated arrested nascent polypeptide chains of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), which is a natural substrate of TF (9Deuerling E. Patzelt H. Vorderwülbecke S. Rauch T. Kramer G. Schaffitzel E. Mogk A. Schulze-Specking A. Langen H. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1317-1328Google Scholar). Translation was carried out in the presence of [35S]methionine to label the nascent polypeptides and exogenously added TF or TF variants. Upon addition of the chemical cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), all TF proteins revealed cross-linking products of ∼70 and 90 kDa with a similar cross-linking efficiency (Fig. 4). We conclude that none of the TF mutant proteins, including TF F198A, are impaired in the association with nascent polypeptides. The PPIase Activity of TF Is Not Essential for Its in Vivo Function—Analyses described above revealed that TF F198A behaves similarly to wild type TF with regard to its chaperone function in vitro but is deficient in PPIase activity. Thus, this protein provided us a unique opportunity to determine the functional importance of TF PPIase activity in the chaperoning of nascent polypeptides in vivo. We analyzed whether the PPIase activity of TF is crucial for complementing the lethality of ΔtigΔdnaK cells. We therefore introduced a plasmid expressing either TF wild type or TF F198A under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter into ΔdnaK cells. Subsequently, we performed phage P1 cotransduction experiments in which a Tn10::Tet-selective marker placed close to the Δtig::kan allele was transduced into ΔdnaK cells. In the presence of 10 μm IPTG, tetracycline, and kanamycin-resistant ΔtigΔdnaK cotransductants expressing either plasmid-encoded TF F198A or TF wild type protein were found at 30 °C on LB media with a similar cotransduction frequency (91 and 88%, respectively). No cotransductants could be observed in the absence of IPTG in the growth media. Growth analysis revealed that ΔdnaKΔtig cells complemented with genes encoding either wild type TF or TF F198A show a very similar IPTG concentration-dependent growth behavior on LB/IPTG-plates at temperatures between 20 and 34 °C, i.e. within the growth range of cells lacking DnaK (Fig. 5A). Thus, the PPIase-deficient TF F198A variant is as efficient as wild type TF in complementing the ΔtigΔdnaK synthetic lethality. To analyze protein folding in these strains, we grew the cells at 30 and 34 °C to logarithmic phase in the presence of 10 μm IPTG and subsequently isolated aggregated proteins. The cellular levels of wild type TF and TF F198A expressed from plasmid in ΔdnaKΔtig cells were similar (Fig. 5B) and slightly higher as compared with the expression of chromosomally encoded TF in ΔdnaK cells (data not shown). As reported earlier, only mild folding defects were detectable in ΔdnaK cells (Fig. 5C), in contrast to the massive protein aggregation observed in cells lacking both DnaK and TF (9Deuerling E. Patzelt H. Vorderwülbecke S. Rauch T. Kramer G. Schaffitzel E. Mogk A. Schulze-Specking A. Langen H. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1317-1328Google Scholar). The presence of TF F198A compensated for the loss of TF in ΔdnaKΔtig cells as efficiently as wild type TF. Neither the pattern nor the total amount of aggregated proteins isolated from these strains differed significantly from the aggregated proteins found in ΔdnaK cells at 30 (Fig. 5C) and 34 °C (data not shown). We conclude that the chaperone activity of TF F198A is sufficient to compensate for the loss of TF in vivo. The mechanism by which ribosome-associated TF assists the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides is not understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the activity of TF in the folding of newly synthesized proteins relies on its PPIase or its chaperone activity. Both activities colocalize in the central PPIase domain of TF. To separate these activities, we genetically engineered four different TF mutant proteins with exchanges of amino acid residues in or adjacent to the substrate binding pocket of TF. Replacing Glu-178 with Val or Tyr-221 with Phe had little effect on TF PPIase activity in vitro. The mutant protein TF F233L did not catalyze the isomerization of a tetrapeptide but promoted the peptidyl-prolyl isomerization-limited refolding of RNase T1. This TF variant may thus be deficient only in the correct binding of peptide substrate rather than in the PPIase activity itself. Our results are in agreement with earlier findings by Fischer and co-workers, who found that the exchange of Phe-233 to Tyr resulted in the loss of TF PPIase activity toward tetrapeptides in vitro (31Tradler T. Stoller G. Rücknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Google Scholar). In addition, when the F233Y mutant was used to complement a Δtig strain, a reduced survival rate on plates after storage for 25 days at 6 °C was observed as compared with wild type TF (32Schiene-Fischer C. Habazettl J. Tradler T. Fischer G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1865-1873Google Scholar). This might suggest an involvement of TF in cell viability at very low temperatures. However, the interpretation of this finding is difficult, because 6 °C is below the physiological growth temperature of E. coli. Moreover, no further in vitro and in vivo characterizations of this TF mutant protein, such as an investigation of its substrate binding properties, had been performed. It was reported earlier that the replacement of Phe-198 by either His or Trp in TF decreases the catalytic efficiency of the PPIase to <0.3% compared with the wild type protein (31Tradler T. Stoller G. Rücknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.-U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Google Scholar). However, these variants were unstable and were only characterized regarding their PPIase activity toward tetrapeptides in vitro. To obtain a stable PPIase-deficient TF, we exchanged Phe-198 with Ala based on a corresponding mutation in the homologous human FKBP12 that resulted in a stable but inactive enzyme (29DeCenzo M.T. Park S.T. Jarrett B.P. Aldape R.A. Futer O. Murcko M.A. Livingston D.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 173-180Google Scholar). In contrast to all other TF variants tested here, TF F198A was deficient in PPIase activity toward both tetrapeptide and protein substrate. We characterized the TF F198A variant extensively. In addition to its PPIase activity, we tested the variant for its binding specificity, chaperone properties, and ability to associate with ribosomes and nascent polypeptides in vitro. In all these assays, TF F198A behaved similarly to wild type TF. In E. coli, the folding of newly synthesized cytosolic proteins critically depends on the function of ribosome-associated TF and the cooperating DnaK chaperone system. Cells lacking TF are viable but show increased levels of DnaK (9Deuerling E. Patzelt H. Vorderwülbecke S. Rauch T. Kramer G. Schaffitzel E. Mogk A. Schulze-Specking A. Langen H. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1317-1328Google Scholar). The simultaneous deletion of both chaperone genes, tig and dnaK, leads to a massive aggregation of proteins, including many essential species, and is accompanied by cell death (7Deuerling E. Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Nature. 1999; 400: 693-696Google Scholar, 8Teter S.A. Houry W.A. Ang D. Tradler T. Rockabrand D. Fischer G. Blum P. Georgopoulos C. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1999; 97: 755-765Google Scholar). The in vivo analysis of TF F198A provided evidence that the PPIase function of TF is neither essential for complementing the lethality of ΔtigΔdnaK cells nor essential for the productive folding of newly synthesized proteins at all temperatures tested. Like wild type TF, the TF F198A variant efficiently suppressed protein aggregation in ΔtigΔdnaK cells. We cannot exclude the possibility that some substrates do depend on TF PPIase activity change, however, these protein aggregates were not detected by our method. Moreover, we cannot rigorously rule out a minor residual PPIase activity of TF F198A at 30 °C in vivo, because all in vitro PPIase assays had to be conducted at temperatures below 30 °C due to the fast isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds at room temperature and above. However, in an independent study, we provided evidence that TF is functional in vivo even in the absence of the entire PPIase domain. 2G. Kramer, A. Rutkowska, R. Wegrzyn, H. Patzelt, T. A. Kurz, F. Merz, T. Rauch, S. Vorderwülbecke, E. Deuerling, and B. Bukau, submitted for publication. Taken together, we conclude that the de novo folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, in the vast majority, does not require the ribosome-associated PPIase activity of TF in E. coli. However, we do not exclude the possibility that the PPIase activity of other cytosolic PPIases found in E. coli might play a role in the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides. What is the role of TF PPIase activity? At least two hypotheses are conceivable. First, the PPIase function might only be required for specific substrates or under specific environmental conditions not tested here. Very recently, it has been reported that the maturation of the extracellular protease SpeB of Strep-tococcus pyogenes is influenced by the PPIase activity of its TF (33Lyon W.R. Caparon M.G. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3661-3667Google Scholar). However, a data base search revealed that no SpeB homolog exists in E. coli. Moreover, cells lacking TF do not show any secretion defect (2Guthrie B. Wickner W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5555-5562Google Scholar). We instead favor a second hypothesis according to which the FKBP-like hydrophobic substrate binding pocket of TF provides a tool for the recognition of hydrophobic stretches in unfolded proteins, as is typical for a chaperone. This property is independent of the catalytic activity of TF, which has no functional importance for E. coli under the conditions tested here. Two findings support this hypothesis. (i) Members of the FKBP family show PPIase-independent chaperone activity (15Ramm K. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 485-498Google Scholar). (ii) There is no ribosome-associated PPIase known in eukaryotic cells. Our results now provide evidence that the only known ribosome-associated PPIase activity in prokaryotes, based on TF, is not crucial for the folding of newly synthesized proteins in E. coli. We thank the members of the Bukau Laboratory for discussions and S. Wilbanks and R. Wegrzyn for comments on the manuscript."

Transfection resulted in expression of caveolin-1 mRNA, a high abundance of caveolin-1 protein, and the formation of caveolae on the plasma membrane. Cholesterol efflux from HepG2/cav cells was 280 and 45% higher than that from parent HepG2 cells when human plasma and human apoA-I, respectively, were used as acceptors. The difference in efflux was eliminated by treatment of cells with progesterone. There was no difference in cholesterol efflux to cyclodextrin. Cholesterol efflux from plasma membrane vesicles was similar for the two cell types. Transfection led to a 40% increase in the amount of plasma membrane cholesterol in cholesterol-rich domains (caveolae and/or rafts) and a 67% increase in the rate of cholesterol trafficking from intracellular compartments to these domains. Cholesterol biosynthesis in HepG2/cav cells was increased by 2-fold, and cholesterol esterification was reduced by 50% compared with parent HepG2 cells. The proliferation rate of transfected cells was significantly lower than that of non-transfected cells. Transfection did not affect expression of ABCA1 or the abundance of ABCA1 protein, but decreased secretion of apoA-I. We conclude that overexpression of caveolin-1 in hepatic cells stimulates cholesterol efflux by enhancing transfer of cholesterol to cholesterol-rich domains in the plasma membrane.

We conclude that overexpression of caveolin-1 in hepatic cells stimulates cholesterol efflux by enhancing transfer of cholesterol to cholesterol-rich domains in the plasma membrane. Cholesterol efflux is the first step in the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) 1The abbreviations used are: RCT, reverse cholesterol transport; HDL, high density lipoprotein; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B, type I; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered solution; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RT, reverse transcription. pathway, removing excess cholesterol from tissues, including the arterial wall, thus preventing the development of atherosclerosis (for review, see Ref. 1Sviridov D. Nestel P. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 161: 245-254Google Scholar). Enhancing cholesterol efflux from the arterial wall may potentially prevent and even reverse intracellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters, a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Enhancing cholesterol efflux from liver cells, the main source of high density lipoprotein (HDL), raises plasma HDL concentrations (2Basso F. Freeman L. Knapper C.L. Remaley A. Stonik J. Neufeld E.B. Tansey T. Amar M.J.A. Fruchart-Najib J. Duverger N. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44 (M. J. A.): 296-302Google Scholar) and consequently increases protection against atherosclerosis by RCT and other mechanisms (3Barter P. Kastelein J. Nunn A. Hobbs R. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 168: 195-211Google Scholar). Enhanced cholesterol efflux can be achieved either by improving the ability of extracellular acceptors to take up cholesterol released from cells or by stimulating cells to release more cholesterol to plasma acceptors. A number of approaches have been tested to improve the ability of cells to release cholesterol. One of these approaches is overexpression of genes involved in the cholesterol efflux pathways. Overexpression of ABCA1 (4Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Google Scholar), scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) (5Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20368-20373Google Scholar) leads to increased protection against atherosclerosis. Stimulation of cholesterol efflux in vitro and enhanced protection against atherosclerosis in vivo are also achieved by overexpression of several genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism in plasma, but not normally expressed in most extrahepatic cells. These included apoA-I (9Major A.S. Dove D.E. Ishiguro H. Su Y.R. Brown A.M. Liu L. Carter K.J. Linton M.F. Fazio S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1790-1795Google Scholar, 10Ishiguro H.

Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 175-189Google Scholar). It has been suggested that caveolin is involved in intracellular cholesterol trafficking (14Smart E.J. Ying Y.-s. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Google Scholar) and that caveolae are the preferential source of cholesterol for efflux (15Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14932-14938Google Scholar, 16Fielding P.E. Russel J.S. Spencer T.A. Hakamata H. Nagao K. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4929-4937Google Scholar). As an essential component of caveolae, caveolin is also involved in numerous signaling pathways (17Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 219-228Google Scholar). Involvement of caveolin in cholesterol trafficking makes it a potential target in the search for approaches to improve cholesterol efflux. There are contradictory reports on the relevance of the level of caveolin expression to cholesterol efflux (18Wang L. Connelly M.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen H.-h. Williams D.L. Brown D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 807-815Google Scholar, 19Frank P.G. Marcel Y.L. Connelly M.A. Lublin D.M. Franklin V. Williams D.L. Lisanti M.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11931-11940Google Scholar, 20Frank P.G.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2506-2513Google Scholar), with the overall effect most likely to be cell type-specific. In this work, we demonstrate that overexpression of caveolin-1 in HepG2 cells results in the formation of caveolae and enhancement of cholesterol efflux. Cells—HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (all reagents from JRH Biosciences). Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in a collagen-coated 12-well tissue culture plate and cultured for 24 h to 60-80% confluence. To obtain stable transfectants, HepG2 cells were transfected with the pIRES2-EGFP/caveolin-1 plasmid (a gift of Dr. C. Fielding) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium for 5 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The transfection medium was removed, and fresh complete growth medium was added. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells in one well were split into 10-cm dishes in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418, and the medium was changed every 3-4 days until G418-resistant colonies were clearly evident. Individual colonies were picked into 24-well plates to continue incubation with G418 selection medium. Individual colonies were evaluated for caveolin expression, and a monoclonal line was used for all experiments. Electron Microscopy—Cells were processed for embedding in resin and sectioned for electron microscopy exactly as described previously (22Hailstones D. Sleer L.S. Parton R.G. Stanley K.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 369-379Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—Cells were grown on sterile collagen-coated glass coverslips to ∼60% confluence and fixed in acetone for 20 min at -20 °C. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) and incubated for 1 h with anti-caveolin-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Cells were washed again and incubated in the dark for 30 min with Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. After mounting onto glass slides, cells were observed under a Zeiss META confocal microscope. Three-dimensional images were reconstructed from images obtained by serial sectioning. Cholesterol Acceptors—Blood from healthy normolipidemic volunteers (plasma total cholesterol values ranging from 3.4 to 5.0 mmol/liter) was collected in saline containing streptokinase (final concentration of 150 units/ml; Sigma), and plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Plasma samples were not pooled, but rather used individually. ApoA-I was isolated as described previously (23Morrison J.R. Fidge N.H. Grego B. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 145-152Google Scholar). Cholesterol Efflux—Cells were grown to 80% confluence prior to experiments; the cultures were 100% confluent by the time of incubation with cholesterol acceptors. To label cellular cholesterol, cultures were incubated in serum-containing medium with [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol (specific radioactivity of 1.81 TBq/mmol, final radioactivity of 74 kBq/ml; Amersham Biosciences) for 48 h in a CO2 incubator. After labeling, cells were washed six times with PBS and incubated for 18 h in serum-free medium. For metabolic labeling of cellular cholesterol, cells were incubated in serum-free Leibovitz L-15 medium with [3H]acetate (specific radioactivity of 95.2 GBq/mmol, final radioactivity of 7.4 MBq/ml; ICN) for 3 h at 15 °C. Cells were washed and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing lipid-free apoA-I (final concentration of 50 μg/ml), cyclodextrin (final concentration of 200 μg/ml), or the indicated concentrations of human plasma. When indicated, a bovine serum albumin (BSA)-progesterone complex (0.5 mg/ml BSA and 10 μg/ml progesterone) was added to the incubation medium, and the same amount of BSA was added to the control incubations. The medium was then collected and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, and the supernatant was counted or used for further analysis. Cells were harvested using a cell scraper and dispensed in 0.5 ml of distilled water, and aliquots were counted or used for further analysis. Metabolically labeled cholesterol was isolated from aliquots of the cells and medium by TLC as described previously (24Sviridov D. Fidge N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1887-1896Google Scholar, 25Sviridov D. Pyle L. Fidge N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33277-33283Google Scholar). Cholesterol efflux is expressed as the percentage of labeled cholesterol transferred from cells to the medium. Plasma Membrane Vesicle Preparations and Cholesterol Efflux Therefrom—Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared by the method originally described by Bellini et al. (26Bellini F. Phillips M.C. Pickell C. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 777: 209-215Google Scholar) with modifications introduced by Gaus et al. (27Gaus K. Dean R.T. Kritharides L. Jessup W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13002-13014Google Scholar). In brief, plasma membrane “blebbing” was induced by incubating cells (labeled with [3H]cholesterol as described above) with 50 mm formaldehyde and 2 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma). The buffer was collected; loose cells were removed by centrifugation; and vesicles were repeatedly centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 3 h in a Ti-70 rotor to remove formaldehyde and dithiothreitol. Small vesicles were then removed by concentrating the solution using 0.1-μm filters. The plasma membrane vesicles (20 μg of protein) were incubated in 1 ml of DMEM with or without 5% human plasma for 2 h at 37 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged through a 0.1-μm filter at 400 × g for 30 s and rapidly washed with DMEM. Aliquots of eluted and retained fractions were counted. The “yield” of separation (y; i.e. amount of plasma protein eluted through the filter) was determined in a control sample, and cholesterol efflux was calculated as follows: (eluted [3H]cholesterol/total [3H]cholesterol) × 1/y. Cholesterol Trafficking—To label the entire cellular cholesterol pool, cells were incubated in serum-containing medium with [14C]cholesterol (final radioactivity of 0.2 MBq/ml) for 48 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After washing, cells were further incubated in serum-free medium for 18 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Cells were cooled on ice; [3H]acetate (final radioactivity of 7.4 MBq/ml) was added; and cells were further incubated in Leibovitz L-15 medium for 3 h at 15 °C. Under these conditions, intracellular cholesterol trafficking is blocked, whereas cholesterol biosynthesis proceeds (28Kaplan M.R. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 446-453Google Scholar, 29Urbani L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1919-1923Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, cells were quickly warmed and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C to allow a portion of the newly synthesized cholesterol to be transferred to the plasma membrane. The cells were cooled on ice and washed three times with the ice-cold PBS. Cholesterol oxidase (Roche Applied Science) was added to the cells at a final concentration of 1 unit/ml, and flasks were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Under these conditions, only cholesterol in plasma membrane cholesterol-rich domains is oxidized (15Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14932-14938Google Scholar, 30Smart E.J. Ying Y.-s. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Google Scholar), forming cholestenone (referred to as oxysterol throughout), and the reaction is carried out to completion (15Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14932-14938Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from cells and analyzed by TLC as described previously (31Sviridov D. Fidge N. Beaumer-Gallon G. Fielding C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 79-86Google Scholar). “No-oxidase” and “no-warm-up” controls were included in each experiment. The amount of oxidizable cholesterol was calculated as the amount of [14C]oxysterol or [3H]oxysterol as a fraction of the total non-oxidized [3H]cholesterol in the sample (entire cholesterol pool), thus correcting for losses during lipid separation. The no-oxidase control, which was 10% of the “oxidized” samples, was subtracted from the experimental values. Cholesterol Biosynthesis and Esterification—To assess cholesterol biosynthesis, cells were incubated in serum-free medium with [3H]acetate (final radioactivity of 7.4 MBq/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. To assess cholesterol esterification, cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with [14C]oleic acid (specific activity of 2.22 GBq/mmol, final radioactivity of 0.185 MBq/ml; Amersham Biosciences) complexed with BSA (essentially fatty acid-free; Sigma). Cells were washed, and lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC as described previously (24Sviridov D. Fidge N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1887-1896Google Scholar). Spots of cholesterol and cholesteryl oleate were identified by standards (Sigma), scraped, and counted in a β-counter. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells following a modification of the guanidinium thiocyanate method (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). The RNA concentration was determined by measuring the absorption at 260 nm. Reverse transcription was carried out in 20 μl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, and 50 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described previously (6Escher G. Krozowski Z. Croft K.D. Sviridov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11015-11019Google Scholar). PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPS, 100 ng of the appropriate primers (caveolin 5′-primer, GAGGGACATCTCTACACCGTTC; and caveolin 3′-primer, ACTGAATCTCAA TCAGGAAGCTCT), 2 μl of reverse-transcribed cDNA, and 1 units of Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was amplified with a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 35 cycles. The amplification profile involved denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. 10 μl of each PCR reaction was mixed with 2 μl of 6-fold concentrated loading buffer and loaded onto a 1.2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis was carried out at a constant voltage of 100 V for 30 min. The sequences of the fragments amplified by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The amount of ABCA1 mRNA in HepG2 and HepG2/cav cells was quantified by real-time RT-PCR according to Su et al. (33Su Y.R. Linton M.F. Fazio S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2180-2187Google Scholar). Amplification of cDNA was from 50 ng of total RNA. The primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-TCCTCTCCCAGAGCAAAAAGC-3′; and reverse, 5′-GTCCTTGGCAAAGTTCACAAATACT-3′. The probe used was 5′-ACTCCACATAGAAGACTACT-3′, labeled with carboxyfluorescein and carboxytetramethylrhodamine at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. 18 S rRNA was used as an internal control with the probe labeled with VIC™ (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and carboxytetramethylrhodamine at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The results are expressed as ΔCt (difference between Ct values for ABCA1 and 18 S RNAs). The interassay variation was <2% as determined on 3 separate days. The efficiency of the control and ABCA1 probes was similar. ApoA-I Synthesis and Secretion—HepG2 or HepG2/cav cells were incubated for 2 h in serum-free medium, and the medium was collected. Cells were scraped, suspended in 500 μl of PBS containing leupeptin and pepstatin (final concentration of 1 μg/ml), and sonicated for 10 s (50% duty). The suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was taken for analysis. ApoA-I concentration in the cell lysate and medium was determined by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (34Sviridov D. Luong A. Pyle L. Fidge N. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 231-238Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and proteins were separated on a 6% (ABCA1) or 15% (caveolin) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by immunoblotting using either rabbit anti-ABCA1 serum (raised against a recombinant fragment of human ABCA1 (amino acids 1314-1450)) or rabbit anti-human caveolin-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence development and quantified by densitometry. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were reproduced two to four times, and representative experiments are shown. Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Means ± S.D. are presented. Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance of the differences. Stable Transfection of HepG2 Cells with Caveolin-1—When HepG2 cells were stably transfected with caveolin-1 (HepG2/cav cells), a strong signal of 394 bp corresponding to caveolin mRNA was detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Expression of caveolin was also analyzed by Western blot analysis using specific anti-caveolin-1 antibody. A single band of 22 kDa migrating at the same position as caveolin from endothelial cells was detected in HepG2/cav cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3). No expression of caveolin-1 mRNA or caveolin protein was detected in non-transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 4). This confirms the previous findings of Fujimoto et al. (35Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Nomura R. Une T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3509-3517Google Scholar) that HepG2 cells do not normally express caveolin. The plasmid used for transfection contained green fluorescent protein, enabling evaluation of the efficiency of transfection. After the final cloning, ∼90% of the cells expressed green fluorescent protein. Cells were also treated with anti-caveolin-1 antibody and studied using confocal microscopy. HepG2/cav cells stained with anti-caveolin antibody (Fig. 2A), whereas control HepG2 cells showed no staining (data not shown). Caveolin in HepG2/cav cells was mostly present on the plasma membrane; however, significant staining was also found in the perinuclear area. This is consistent with the caveolin present in plasma membrane caveolae and the Golgi and is similar to the pattern observed in caveola-rich cholesterol-loaded endothelial cells (36Chao W.T. Fan S.S. Chen J.K. Yang V.C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1094-1099Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells (37Peterson T.E. Guicciardi M.E. Gulati R. Kleppe L.S. Mueske C.S. Mookadam M. Sowa G. Gores G.J. Sessa W.C. Simari R.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1521-1527Google Scholar), and mouse peritoneal macrophages (38Gargalovic P. Dory L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 11-21Google Scholar). The pattern of distribution of caveolin between different regions in the plasma membrane of HepG2/cav cells was studied by reconstructing three-dimensional confocal images. Most caveolin was found on the dorsal side of cells, as evident from three-dimensional (Fig. 2B) and cross-sectional (Fig. 2C) images as well as well as from quantitative analysis of the intensity distribution of caveolin-1 staining in transfected cells (Fig. 2D). Weak staining was found on the ventral parts of the membrane (Fig. 2, B and C). The caveolin-1-transfected cells were also examined by electron microscopy. Surface-connected pits with the typical morphology of caveolae and ∼65 nm in size were observed in the transfected cells on both the dorsal surfaces of the cells and in regions of cell-cell contacts, but not in control cells (Fig. 2E). However, caveola abundance was low, with, on average, less than one caveolar profile/cell profile. Cholesterol Efflux—To evaluate the effect of caveolin expression on cholesterol efflux, cellular cholesterol was labeled with [3H]cholesterol, and cells were incubated with human plasma, lipid-free apoA-I, cyclodextrin, and medium alone. Compared with HepG2 cells, the efflux from HepG2/cav cells was 80, 280, and 45% higher (p < 0.01 for all) when 5% plasma, 2% plasma, and 50 μg/ml apoA-I, respectively, were used as acceptors (Fig. 3A). There was no significant difference in cholesterol efflux from the two cell types to cyclodextrin (200 μg/ml), a nonspecific cholesterol acceptor. When cellular cholesterol was metabolically labeled with [3H]acetate, the efflux from HepG2/cav cells to 5% plasma was 20% higher than that from HepG2 cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3B). Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking—Caveolae are considered to be a principal source of cholesterol for efflux (15Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14932-14938Google Scholar, 16Fielding P.E. Russel J.S. Spencer T.A. Hakamata H. Nagao K. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4929-4937Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that caveolin is involved in transporting cholesterol from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane pool (14Smart E.J. Ying Y.-s. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Google Scholar), where it becomes accessible for efflux. Introduction of caveolin into cells not expressing it naturally and formation of caveolae may also increase the amount of cholesterol in pools accessible for efflux. To assess these possibilities, cells were labeled with [14C]cholesterol, allowing labeled cholesterol to equilibrate among all cellular pools. Cells were then treated with cholesterol oxidase under conditions in which only cholesterol in cholesterol-rich domains on the cell surface (rafts and/or caveolae) is oxidized. The relative amount of cholesterol in cholesterol-rich domains in HepG2/cav cells was 40% higher compared with that in HepG2 cells (p < 0.02) (Fig. 4A). To assess the rate of cholesterol trafficking, cells were incubated with [3H]acetate for 3 h at 15 °C. Cells were then warmed up for 20 min at 37 °C to allow newly synthesized cholesterol to move to the plasma membrane before treatment of cells with cholesterol oxidase. The amount of newly synthesized [3H]cholesterol that moved to the cholesterol-rich domains in the plasma membrane was 67% higher in HepG2/cav cells compared with that in HepG2 cells (p < 0.02) (Fig. 4B). These experiments indicate that cholesterol efflux in cells overexpressing caveolin-1 is enhanced due to increased transfer of cholesterol to plasma membrane pools accessible for efflux. However, they do not distinguish between contributions of increased cholesterol flow to these domains and higher steady-state concentrations of cholesterol in this pool. To investigate the issue further, we compared the efflux of cholesterol from plasma membrane vesicles prepared from HepG2 and HepG2/cav cells. Cholesterol efflux from the vesicles, which reflects the concentration of cholesterol in the plasma membrane without contribution of cholesterol flow from intracellular compartments, was similar for the two cell types (Fig. 5). This is consistent with a lack of difference between the two cell types in cholesterol efflux to cyclodextrin, which is an indirect measure of plasma membrane cholesterol content (Fig. 3A) (39Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4508-4517Google Scholar). Furthermore, we treated cells with progesterone, a potent inhibitor of intracellular cholesterol trafficking (14Smart E.J. Ying Y.-s. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Google Scholar, 31Sviridov D. Fidge N. Beaumer-Gallon G. Fielding C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 79-86Google Scholar). To minimize nonspecific equilibration of cholesterol between cellular compartments, the duration of efflux incubation was shortened to 1 h in these experiments, a change in conditions that affected the magnitude of the difference in efflux from the two cell types. Nevertheless, the efflux of [14C]cholesterol from HepG2/cav cells to 5% plasma was significantly higher compared that from parent HepG2 cells; this difference was completely eliminated in the presence of 10 μg/ml progesterone (Fig. 6A). Progesterone also eliminated the difference in efflux of intracellular cholesterol after labeling cells metabolically with [3H]acetate (Fig. 6B). These experiments indicate that overexpression of caveolin-1 enhances cholesterol efflux mainly by stimulating intracellular cholesterol trafficking, with apparently increased steady-state concentrations of cholesterol in plasma membrane cholesterol-rich domains contributing little to the efflux. Cholesterol Biosynthesis and Esterification—Cholesterol biosynthesis and esterification in HepG2 and HepG2/cav cells were assessed as an indirect measure of changes in intracellular cholesterol content. The rate of [3H]acetate incorporation into cholesterol in HepG2/cav cells was almost twice that in HepG2 cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 7A). In contrast, the rate of [14C]oleic acid incorporation into cholesteryl esters in HepG2/cav cells was 40% lower compared with that in HepG2 cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 7B). Cell Proliferation—Caveolin and caveolae are tightly linked to cell growth by changing cellular cholesterol content (21Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2506-2513Google Scholar) and/or through platelet-derived growth factor signaling (37Peterson T.E. Guicciardi M.E. Gulati R. Kleppe L.S. Mueske C.S. Mookadam M. Sowa G. Gores G.J. Sessa W.C. Simari R.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1521-1527Google Scholar). When the rate of proliferation was analyzed in HepG2 and HepG2/cav cell cultures seeded at the same density, the rate was significantly slower in HepG2/cav cells. 51% fewer cells were found in HepG2/cav cultures than in HepG2 cultures after 4 days of culturing, when the cultures were approaching confluency (p < 0.001) (Fig. 8). This finding is consistent with reports of Fielding et al. (21Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2506-2513Google Scholar), who demonstrated inhibition of human skin fibroblast proliferation after transfection with caveolin-1.

https://openalex.org/W2013642367,"Satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) RNA is naturally uncapped at its 5′ end and lacks polyadenylation at its 3′ end. Despite lacking these two hallmarks of eukaryotic mRNAs, STNV-1 RNA is translated very efficiently. A ∼130-nucleotide translational enhancer (TED), located 3′ to the termination codon, is necessary for efficient cap-independent translation of STNV-1 RNA. The STNV-1 TED RNA fragment binds to the eukaryotic cap-binding complexes, initiation factor (eIF) 4F and eIF(iso)4F, as measured by nitrocellulose binding and fluorescence titration. STNV-1 TED is a potent inhibitor of in vitro translation when added in trans. This inhibition is reversed by the addition of eIF4F or eIF(iso)4F, and the subunits of eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F cross-link to STNV-1 TED, providing additional evidence that these factors interact directly with STNV-1 TED. Deletion mutagenesis of the STNV-1 TED indicates that a minimal region of ∼100 nucleotides is necessary to promote cap-independent translation primarily through interaction with the cap binding subunits (eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E) of eIF4F or eIF(iso)4F.

Initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells is a complicated process requiring 8–10 initiation factors for proper alignment of the initiation codon of messenger RNA on the 40 S ribosome and subsequent joining of the 60 S ribosome (for review, see Refs. 1Sonenberg N.

The eIF4G component of eIF4F then acts as a scaffold for the assembly of other initiation factors (for review, see Refs. 7Marcotrigiano J. Burley S.K. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 61: 269-297Google Scholar, 8Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2906-2922Google Scholar, 9Gallie D.R. Plant Mol.

Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Google Scholar). Initiation factors eIF4A, eIF3, and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) are known to interact with eIF4G during this process (for review, see Refs. 7Marcotrigiano J. Burley S.K. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 61: 269-297Google Scholar, 9Gallie D.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 949-970Google Scholar, and 10Marcotrigiano J. Lomakin I.B. Sonenberg N. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 193-203Google Scholar). PABP binds the poly(A) tail present at the 3′ end of most cellular mRNAs, and the interaction of PABP with eIF4G implies that the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cellular mRNA are brought into close proximity during the initiation process (for review, see Refs. 9Gallie D.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 949-970Google Scholar and 12Sachs A.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 447-466Google Scholar). This assembly of factors on the mRNA presumably functions in an ATP-dependent unwinding of secondary structure in the 5′-UTR of the mRNA before binding and scanning of the 40 S ribosome to find the correct initiation codon (5Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 515-521Google Scholar). Plant eIF4F consists of two subunits, a small cap-binding protein, eIF4E (26 kDa), and a large subunit, eIF4G (180 kDa). Higher plants possess an isozyme form of eIF4F, termed eIF(iso)4F (13Browning K.S. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11228-11232Google Scholar, 14Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Google Scholar). eIF(iso)4F, like eIF4F, consists of two subunits, eIF(iso)4E (28 kDa), and a large subunit, eIF(iso)4G (86 kDa). eIF(iso)4F has functions similar to eIF4F in the initiation of translation of plant mRNAs (14Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of plant eIF(iso)4E is ∼50% similar to plant eIF4E and retains all the conserved tryptophan residues found in cap-binding proteins (15Allen M.L. Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23232-23236Google Scholar, 16Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Browning K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4096Google Scholar). The large subunit, eIF(iso)4G, is significantly smaller than plant eIF4G (86 versus 180 kDa, (15Allen M.L. Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23232-23236Google Scholar)), sharing ∼30–40% similarity with central and C-terminal regions of eIF4G. Rodriguez et al. (17Rodriguez C.M. Freire M.A. Camilleri C. Robaglia C. Plant J. 1998; 13: 465-473Google Scholar) show that the mRNA for eIF4E is present in all tissues except the specialization zone of roots, and the mRNA for eIF(iso)4E is abundant in developing tissues such as floral organs, meristems, and leaf primordia. Distribution of the eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E proteins within plant cells is not known, although eIF(iso)4G co-localizes with microtubules in situ as measured by immunolocalization (18Bokros C.L. Hugdahl J.D. Kim H.-H. Hanesworth V.R. Van Heerden A. Browning K.S. Morejohn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7120-7124Google Scholar). There are alternative forms of initiation of translation that do not have an absolute requirement for the cap structure and initiate translation in a cap-independent manner (19Schneider R.J. Mohr I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 130-136Google Scholar, 20Bushell M. Sarnow P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 395-399Google Scholar). The most studied of these alternate forms of initiation, internal initiation, is exemplified by the mammalian picornaviruses. Typically, viral RNAs that initiate by internal initiation have long 5′-UTRs and a region of secondary structure that functions as an internal ribosome entry site, and they do not require cap-binding protein for their initiation. Internal ribosome entry sites are found on some cellular mRNAs and are thought to promote initiation of these mRNAs when cap-binding protein is unavailable (for review, see Ref. 21Hellen C.U.T. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Google Scholar). Viruses have a number of mechanisms for internal initiation and a variety of initiation factor requirements (22Sarnow P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2801-2806Google Scholar, 23De Quinto S.L. Lafuente E. Martínez-Salas E. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1213-1226Google Scholar, 24Martínez-Salas E. Ramos R. Lafuente E. De Quinto S.L. J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Google Scholar), including no initiation factors at all for the cricket paralysis virus internal ribosome entry site (26Jan E. Sarnow P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 889-902Google Scholar). Rotoviruses and influenza virus use a viral protein to structurally mimic PABP to recruit eIF4G (27Groft C.M. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1273-1283Google Scholar, 28Varani G. Allain F.H.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 158-160Google Scholar). The picornavirus-like viruses in plants, the potyviruses, lack a cap at their 5′ end but possess a virus-encoded covalently linked protein (VPg) at the 5′ end of the viral RNA (29Urcuqui-Inchima S. Haenni A.-L. Bernardi F. Virus Res. 2001; 74: 157-175Google Scholar). It has been shown that the potyvirus VPg or its precursor interacts specifically with eIF(iso)4E or eIF4E (30Wittmann S. Chatel H. Fortin M.G. Laliberte J.F. Virology. 1997; 234: 84-92Google Scholar, 31Léonard S. Plante D. Wittmann S. Daigneault N. Fortin M.G. Laliberté J.F. J.

Virol. 2002; 83: 2085-2089Google Scholar). The genes for naturally occurring potyvirus-resistant plant varieties have been shown to encode defective forms of eIF(iso)4E or eIF4E (34Ruffel S. Dussault M.H. Palloix A. Moury B. Bendahmane A. Robaglia C. Caranta C. Plant J. 2002; 32: 1067-1075Google Scholar, 35Lellis A.D. Kasschau K.D. Whitham S.A. Carrington J.C. Curr.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1272-1282Google Scholar). Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) RNA, a luteovirus, also lacks a 5′ cap structure (37Wang S.P. Guo L. Allen E. Miller W.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 728-738Google Scholar). Wang and Miller (38Wang S. Miller W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13446-13452Google Scholar) previously identified a cap-independent translational enhancer (TE) domain located within the 3′-UTR of BYDV. The TE stimulates translation of viral and heterologous genes 30–100-fold (38Wang S. Miller W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13446-13452Google Scholar), and inactivation of this enhancer region renders BYDV RNA cap-dependent (37Wang S.P. Guo L. Allen E. Miller W.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 728-738Google Scholar, 39Wang S.P. Browning K.S. Miller W.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4107-4116Google Scholar). The addition of the BYDV TE domain in trans specifically inhibits in vitro translation and is reversed by the addition of eIF4F (39Wang S.P. Browning K.S. Miller W.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4107-4116Google Scholar). The BYDV TE has been shown to interact through base pairing with a stem-loop located in the 5′-UTR (40Guo L. Allen E.M. Miller W.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1103-1109Google Scholar, 41Guo L. Allen E. Miller W.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1808-1820Google Scholar), serving as a way for the viral RNA to bring the 5′- and 3′-UTRs into contact mimicking the eIF4G-PABP interaction. Satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV), a positive strand RNA necrovirus, requires co-infection of tobacco necrosis virus (TNV) for its replication (42Kassanis B. Nixon H.L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1961; 25: 459-471Google Scholar, 43Kassanis B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1962; 27: 477-488Google Scholar, 44Kassanis B. Phillips M.P. J. Gen. Virol. 1970; 9: 119-126Google Scholar). STNV RNA contains a 29-nucleotide 5′-UTR, a 588-nucleotide coding region for its own viral coat protein, and a 622-nucleotide 3′-UTR (45Ysebaert M. van Emmelo J. Fiers W. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 273-287Google Scholar). STNV RNA lacks a 5′ cap structure and a poly(A) tail (46Horst J. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Mandels S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4748-4752Google Scholar). The sequences of three strains of STNV were determined, STNV-1 (45Ysebaert M. van Emmelo J. Fiers W. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 273-287Google Scholar), STNV-2 (47Danthinne X. Seurinck J. Van Montagu M. Pleij C.W.A. van Emmelo J. Virology. 1991; 185: 605-614Google Scholar), and STNV-C (48Bringloe D.H. Gultyaev A.P. Pelpel M. Pleij C.W.A. Coutts R.H.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1539-1546Google Scholar). Sequence comparison shows that STNV-1 and STNV-2 are more closely related to each other than STNV-C. Previous studies from this laboratory for STNV-1 (49Timmer R.T. Benkowski L.A. Schodin D. Lax S.R. Metz A.M. Ravel J.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9504-9510Google Scholar) and others for STNV-2 (50Danthinne X. Seurinck J. Meulewaeter F. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3340-3349Google Scholar) identified a translational enhancer domain (TED) in the 3′-UTR just after the termination codon for the STNV coat protein. Deletion of the TED domain of STNV-1 RNA lowers the translational efficiency and increases the amount of eIF4F necessary for half-maximal translation by about 10-fold (49Timmer R.T. Benkowski L.A. Schodin D. Lax S.R. Metz A.M. Ravel J.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9504-9510Google Scholar). Translational efficiency is restored, and the eIF4F requirement is lowered if the TED-deleted STNV RNA is transcribed with a 5′ cap group (49Timmer R.T. Benkowski L.A. Schodin D. Lax S.R. Metz A.M. Ravel J.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9504-9510Google Scholar). These results suggest that the 3′ STNV-1 TED functions in place of a 5′ cap group. The STNV-2 TED functions independently in a heterologous mRNA at various positions to stimulate cap-independent translation (51Meulewaeter F. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1347-1356Google Scholar). Maximal cap independence of STNV-1 RNA (49Timmer R.T. Benkowski L.A. Schodin D. Lax S.R. Metz A.M. Ravel J.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9504-9510Google Scholar) or STNV-2 RNA (50Danthinne X. Seurinck J. Meulewaeter F. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3340-3349Google Scholar, 51Meulewaeter F. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1347-1356Google Scholar, 52Meulewaeter F. Danthinne X. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. Plant J. 1998; 14: 169-176Google Scholar) occurs when both the 5′- and 3′-UTRs are present with the coding region. These results suggest that the tertiary structure of the viral RNA may be important for maximal cap independence. The STNV-2 TED was recently shown by van Lipzig et al. (53van Lipzig R. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. Meulewaeter F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1080-1086Google Scholar) in UV-cross-linking assays to bind 28- and 30-kDa proteins in wheat germ extracts (53van Lipzig R. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. Meulewaeter F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1080-1086Google Scholar). These proteins were not identified but were suggested to correspond to the plant cap-binding proteins eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E (53van Lipzig R. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. Meulewaeter F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1080-1086Google Scholar). Further deletion studies more finely mapped the 5′ and 3′ boundaries of the STNV-2 TED (54van Lipzig R. Gultyaev A.P. Pleij C.W.A. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. Meulewaeter F. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 229-236Google Scholar). Mutation or deletion of the STNV-1 5′-UTR reduces translational efficiency up to 50%; however, unlike the alterations of the 3′-UTR, deletions or mutations in the 5′-UTR do not significantly impact the amount of eIF4F required for initiation of translation (49Timmer R.T. Benkowski L.A. Schodin D. Lax S.R. Metz A.M. Ravel J.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9504-9510Google Scholar). These findings suggest that although the 3′-UTR of STNV may be sufficient for recruitment of translation initiation factors and ribosomes, the 5′-UTR is necessary for efficient 5′-3′ communication and proper initiation at the initiator AUG. Several models for ribosomal recruitment by the STNV TED have been proposed, including base pairing to 18 S rRNA, base pairing of the 5′ and 3′-UTRs and direct recruitment of a component(s) of the translational apparatus (49Timmer R.T. Benkowski L.A. Schodin D. Lax S.R. Metz A.M. Ravel J.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9504-9510Google Scholar, 51Meulewaeter F. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. RNA (N.

Y.). 2002; 8: 229-236Google Scholar). Given the profound effects of the STNV-1 TED on eIF4F requirement (49Timmer R.T. Benkowski L.A. Schodin D. Lax S.R. Metz A.M. Ravel J.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9504-9510Google Scholar), it seems likely that eIF4F is directly involved in the cap-independent translation of this viral RNA. We provide biochemical evidence for specific interaction of eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E, the cap binding subunits of eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F, respectively, with the 3′ TED of STNV-1 RNA. Plasmid Construction—All STNV clones used in this study were derived from a full-length STNV-1 cDNA (L06057 (49Timmer R.T. Benkowski L.A. Schodin D. Lax S.R. Metz A.M. Ravel J.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9504-9510Google Scholar)). Sets of appropriate oligonucleotides containing a HindIII site and the T7 promoter in the forward primer and a BamHI site in the reverse primer were used to prepare STNV-1 TED or the truncation mutants by DNA amplification (see Table I). The resulting purified amplification products were then either used directly as transcription templates or cloned into pUC18 digested with HindIII and BamHI. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing at the DNA Sequencing Facility (Institute of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas at Austin). Plasmids were linearized with BamHI before transcription.Table IOligonucleotides used for DNA amplification and cloning of STNV-1 TED deletion mutants Open table in a new tab The TED truncation mutants were placed back onto the STNV-1 5′-UTR and coding region using NsiI and BamHI sites (see Fig. 1) to replace the wild type TED. The plasmid for these constructs contained nucleotides 1–750 (STNV-1 750) of STNV RNA 1 (49Timmer R.T. Benkowski L.A. Schodin D. Lax S.R. Metz A.M. Ravel J.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9504-9510Google Scholar). Briefly, truncation mutants were amplified using the corresponding primers listed in Table I. DNA amplification products were precipitated with ethanol, cleaved with NsiI and BamHI, and gel-purified. Purified mutant DNA was ligated to gel-purified STNV-1 750 that had been previously digested with NsiI and BamHI. The resulting constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were linearized with BamHI and utilized as the template for in vitro transcription. In Vitro Transcription of Plasmids—RNA was transcribed from amplified DNA templates or linearized plasmid using the MegaShortscript, MegaScript, or Message Machine T7 Kits (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The template for the 125-nucleotide fragment of 18 S was the control template for the MegaShortscript kit (Ambion). The multiple cloning region RNA (∼150 nucleotides) was transcribed from amplified DNA made using M13 forward and M13 reverse primers and Bluescript plasmid as the template. Transcription reactions (0.5–1.0-ml reactions) were purified on sterile 20 cc Sephadex G100 columns pre-equilibrated with sterile buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl). Peak fractions were pooled, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in sterile water. For radiolabeled RNAs, each 20-μl reaction was supplemented with 0.02 mCi of 3000Ci/mmol [α-32P]UTP or [α-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Radiolabeled RNAs averaged ∼2 × 105 cpm/pmol. Fluorescent TED was transcribed using coumarin-labeled 5-UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and purified as described above. All RNAs were analyzed by urea gel electrophoresis and stained with Stains-All (Sigma). Preparation of Initiation Factors—Highly purified eIF4F, eIF(iso)4F, recombinant eIF(iso)4G and recombinant eIF(iso)4E, eIF4A, and eIF4B were prepared as described previously (14Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Google Scholar, 55Van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Google Scholar, 56Metz A.M. Wong K.C.H.

The preparation of recombinant eIF4G, eIF4E, and the eIF4F complex will be described elsewhere. 2M. L. Allen, K. Ruud, L. Campbell, P. Murphy, and K. S. Browning, manuscript in preparation. Nitrocellulose Binding Assay—The 50-μl reaction mixture contained 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 2.4 mm DTT, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 70 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm KCl, and protein and RNA as indicated. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 10–15 min and filtered. The two-filter method was used as described (58Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Google Scholar). Filter wells were rinsed twice with 100 μl of ice-cold wash buffer (58Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Google Scholar) and air-dried for 10 min, and both membranes were exposed to a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Spots were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The percent binding was determined by dividing the value on the nitrocellulose membrane (RNA bound to protein) by the sum of the values on the nitrocellulose (RNA bound to protein) and nylon (unbound RNA). Each protein level was in triplicate and averaged. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Fluorescence Titration Assay—Preparations of eF4F, eIF4E, eIF(iso)4F, or eIF(iso)4E were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT to remove excess m7GTP remaining from the affinity purification. The titrations were carried out on a SLM 8000 fluorometer at room temperature at an excitation wavelength of 385 nm, and the emission wavelength was scanned at 443 nm. The 1-ml reaction mixture contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 1 × 10-8m coumarin-labeled STNV-1 TED. Increasing amounts of protein in 2.5-μl aliquots containing 0.32 pmol of protein were sequentially added until saturation was reached. The data for each point were collected in triplicate and averaged. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. In Vitro Translation Assay—The standard reaction mixture contained, in 50 μl, capped AMV RNA 4 as indicated, 12 μl of wheat germ S30 extract, 24 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 2.9 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm KCl, 2.4 mm DTT, 0.1 mm spermine, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 34 μm [14C]leucine, 50 μm concentrations of 19 amino acids, 7.8 μm creatine phosphate, 3 μg of creatine kinase, 0.75 A260 unit of yeast tRNA (57Lax S.R. Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 109-128Google Scholar). Incubation was for 30 min at 27 °C, and the amount of [14C]leucine incorporated into protein was determined as previously described (57Lax S.R. Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 109-128Google Scholar). UV Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—The standard translation mixture described above was used for UV cross-linking of the STNV-1 TED followed by immunoprecipitation of the subunits of eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F. The 320-μl reaction mixture contained 200 μl of wheat germ S30 extract, 24 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 2.9 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm KCl, 2.4 mm DTT, 0.1 mm spermine, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 50 μm concentrations of 19 amino acids (-leucine), 7.8 μm creatine phosphate, 3 μg of creatine kinase, 0.75 A260 unit of yeast tRNA, and 15 μl of 32P-labeled STNV-1 TED (>5 × 106 cpm) or 15 μl of 32P-labeled 18 S rRNA fragment (>5 × 106 cpm). The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 27 °C. The cross-linking and immunoprecipitation procedures were provided by Dr. E. Gottlieb (this university). 3E. Gottlieb, personal communication. The reaction mixture was divided into 50-μl portions on a Parafilm-lined tray on ice, placed 11 cm from the bottom of a StrataLinker (Stratagene), and UV-irradiated (254 nm) for 4 min. The portions were pooled and incubated with 5000 units of T1 nuclease (Ambion) for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was added to 2.5 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) previously coupled to 10 μl of rabbit pre-immune, anti-eIF4F, or anti-eIF(iso)4F serum and incubated at room temperature for 2 h with mixing. The protein A-Sepharose was collected by a brief centrifugation and washed 3 times with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The bound protein-RNA complexes were released by heating with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer for 2 min at 90 °C. After centrifugation to remove the protein A-Sepharose beads, the proteins were separated by 12.5% PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Three-hybrid Plasmid Construction—The three-hybrid vector, pIIIMS2-2 (59SenGupta D.J. Zhang B.L. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Google Scholar), was modified to include Age1 and Mlu1 sites within the polylinker region to facilitate the cloning of the mutants in the correct orientation. Briefly, STNV-1 TED-(613–752) was amplified by PCR with primers 613F and 752R containing Age1 and Mlu1 sites, respectively (Table I). The amplification product was cloned into PCR2.1-TOPO according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was cut with EcoRI and treated with Klenow, gel-purified, and ligated into SmaI-cut and phosphatase-treated pIIIMS2-2. The plasmid containing STNV-1 TED-(613–752) was digested with Age1 and Mlu1 and used in the construction of the STNV-1 TED truncation clones for the three-hybrid analysis. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Yeast Three-hybrid Assay—pGAD vector containing initiation factors and the indicated pIIIMS2-2/STNV-1 TED constructs were co-transformed into the yeast strain L40-coat (59SenGupta D.J. Zhang B.L. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Google Scholar) and analyzed by β-galactosidase filter assay methods as described previously (60Metz A.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31033-31036Google Scholar). The iron response element/iron response protein interaction was used as a positive control (59SenGupta D.J. Zhang B.L. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Google Scholar). pIIIMS2-2 containing STNV-1 TED in the reverse orientation was used as a negative control. Binding of Initiation Factors to STNV-1 TED—The ability of eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F to bind STNV-1 TED was measured in a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. The results shown in Table II indicate that the complexes eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F, both native and recombinant, bind to STNV-1 TED. Their respective recombinant subunits eIF4G, eIF4E, eIF(iso)4G, or eIF(iso)4E bound ∼5–10-fold less well, indicating that the complexes have a much higher binding affinity than the individual subunits. As expected, initiation factor eIF4A binds STNV-1 TED poorly.Table IIBinding of STNV-1 TED to initiation factors n, native protein; r, recombinant protein.Initiation factoraThe amount of RNA bound was calculated as a percent of the total TED RNA (0.02 pmol, ≈2 × 105 cpm/pmol) bound by 5 pmol of added proteinTotal TED RNA boundaThe amount of RNA bound was calculated as a percent of the total TED RNA (0.02 pmol, ≈2 × 105 cpm/pmol) bound by 5 pmol of added protein%neIF4F69 ± 6reIF4F79 ± 2reIF4G12 ± 1reIF4E11 ± 1neIF(iso)4F55 ± 4reIF(iso)4F51 ± 5reIF(iso)4G3 ± 0.5reIF(iso)4E7 ± 0.5neIF4A5 ± 1a The amount of RNA bound was calculated as a percent of the total TED RNA (0.02 pmol, ≈2 × 105 cpm/pmol) bound by 5 pmol of added protein Open table in a new tab Dose responses to native or recombinant eIF4F or eIF(iso)4F and their recombinant subunits are shown in Fig. 2. The native and recombinant complexes of eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F bind to STNV-1 TED very strongly, whereas the individual subunits bind the STNV-1 TED poorly even at high levels of protein. The ability of recombinant eIF4F, eIF(iso)4F, and their cap binding subunits, eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E, to bind to coumarin-labeled STNV-1 TED was measured by fluorescence titration. The fluorescence binding curves shown in Fig. 3 confirm the nitrocellulose binding assay results. The binding affinities of eIF4F or eIF(iso)4F complexes to STNV-1 TED are much higher than for the individual eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E subunits. The estimated Kd values for the complexes in both the nitrocellulose binding and fluorescence assays are compared in Table III. The Kd values for the eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F complexes are in good agreement between the two assays. The binding affinities for eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E estimated from"

We demonstrate that the endogenous AHR physically associates with the endogenous TRAP/DRIP/ARC/Mediator complex in a ligand-dependent manner. The Med220 subunit, which is known to interact with several nuclear hormone receptors through its LXXLL motifs, potentiates AHR-dependent reporter gene activity in an LXXLL-independent manner. Depletion of Med220 substantially reduces endogenous AHR-mediated transcription from the mouse cytochrome P4501A1 gene (CYP1A1). Both Med220 and CDK8 (another subunit of TRAP/DRIP/ARC/Mediator) are recruited to the CYP1A1 enhancer in a TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin)-dependent fashion in vivo, and Med220 LXXLL motifs are not required. Med220 rapidly and persistently associates with the enhancer but not the promoter of the CYP1A1 gene after TCDD treatment with similar kinetics as AHR and the coactivators p300 and p/CIP. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for Med220 in AHR-regulated transcription that differs mechanistically from its role in transcriptional regulation by other previously studied transcription factors.

Birnbaum L. Schecter A. Dioxins and Health. Plenum Press, New York1994: 139-162Google Scholar). The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand activated transcription factor, is the intracellular protein that mediates most of the toxic effects of these compounds. Additionally, AHR may also play an important role in normal developmental and physiological setting possibly via an endogenous ligand(s). The evidence in support of this is largely derived from AHR knock-out mice. These mice are viable but exhibit many physiological changes and developmental abnormalities, including reduced liver weight, a depressed immune system, and reproductive defects such as small litter size (2Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Science. 1995; 268: 722-726Google Scholar). Unliganded AHR forms a complex with the chaperone protein hsp90, a co-chaperone protein called p23 (3Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13519-13524Google Scholar), and the hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2 (XAP2) (4Meyer B.K. Pray-Grant M.G. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Perdew G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 978-988Google Scholar). This complex resides in the cytoplasm. Upon ligand binding, the AHR undergoes a conformation change and dissociates from the complex. The resulting exposure of its nuclear localization sequence triggers the nuclear translocation of AHR (5Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 428-438Google Scholar). Inside the nucleus, AHR dimerizes with a related nuclear protein called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). This heterodimer can then recognize its cognate DNA binding site called the xenobiotic response element and activates genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and cell proliferation (6Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Google Scholar, 7Schmidt J. Bradfield C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Google Scholar). AHR-regulated transcription is under intense scrutiny since the biological activities of AHR are largely due to its ability to alter gene expression. A model system frequently used to study AHR-regulated transcription is the murine cytochrome P4501A1 gene (CYP1A1). Early studies established that AHR is capable of initiating enhancer-promoter communication during CYP1A1 transcriptional activation (8Ko H. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Google Scholar, 9Morgan J. Whitlock J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11622-11626Google Scholar); occupation of the enhancer region by liganded AHR/ARNT elicits chromatin remodeling over the promoter and assembly of the general transcription machinery. The mechanistic details of these events are, however, not fully elucidated. Direct interactions between transcriptional activators such as AHR/ARNT and general transcription factors are not sufficient for nucleation of the general transcription machinery. For example, activators are unable to render productive and robust transcription in vitro with transcription reactions reconstituted with basal factors alone, indicating that additional cofactors are required (10Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Google Scholar, 11Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Google Scholar). Biochemical isolation and studies of the related or identical multisubunit complexes, murine Mediator (12Jiang Y.W. Veschambre P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C.

Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Google Scholar) (hereafter referred to as the Mediator complex), suggest that these complexes can stimulate in vitro transcription mediated by several activators. Certain subunits of the Mediator complex can directly interact with transcription activators, whereas other subunits associate with the general transcription apparatus (17Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Google Scholar). Thus, Mediator may function as an adaptor to convey regulatory signals from enhancers to promoters. We demonstrate here a role for Mediator in AHR/ARNT-dependent transcription of CYP1A1. The mechanism of Mediator action differs for AHR/ARNT from other previously described transcription factors. Our observations shed light on the enhancer-promoter communication invoked by AHR. Furthermore, potential differences in the structural composition of the Mediator in different tissue and promoter contexts could help explain differential regulation of gene expression mediated by AHR/ARNT and impact our understanding of receptor-mediated chemical toxicity and carcinogenesis. Antibodies and Cell Culture—Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to AHR and ARNT were described previously (18Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Agbunag R.V. Ong M.S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 511-518Google Scholar). Antibodies to p/CIP were generated against amino acids 691–851 of mouse p/CIP in this laboratory. Med220 (M-255), CDK8 (C-19), p300 (N-15), and pol II (N-20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The Med130 antibody was purchased from Rockland Inc. Hepa-1 and human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Med220+/+ and Med220-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (19Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G.

Med220-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts stably infected with wild type Med220, and LXXLL-mutated Med220 (19Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G.

Plasmid Constructs—Expression constructs of wild type Med220 and LXXLL-mutated Med220 were derived from pWZLhyg-FH220 (19Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation—Hepa-1 cells were treated with Me2SO or TCDD at a final concentration of 10-8m for 60 min and then washed extensively with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 12.1.1-12.1.9Google Scholar). The final KCl concentration in the nuclear extract was 300 mm. Before immunoprecipitation the buffer content of the nuclear extract was adjusted to contain 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 12.5% glycerol, 250 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 plus 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). 400 μg of nuclear extract was pre-cleared with 35 μl of protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h, and immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C with AHR antibody, ARNT antibody, or pre-immune IgG. Immunocomplexes were collected using 35 μl of protein A-Sepharose containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The Sepharose beads were washed 4 times with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 12.5% glycerol, 250 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Immunocomplexes were eluted with SDS-sample buffer and separated in 6% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis and probing with Med220, Med130, AHR, or ARNT antibodies. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—Transfections of expression plasmids were performed using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen). For Hepa-1 and HepG2 cells, a dual-luciferase system (Promega) was used. DNA mixtures of the indicated amount of Med220 wild-type or mutant constructs were cotransfected into 12-well plates with 40 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter (pRL-TK) driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and 200 ng of firefly luciferase reporter (pGL-CYP1A1) driven by 4.2 kilobases of the 5′ upstream regulatory region of the rat CYP1A1 gene, including its promoter and multiple xenobiotic response elements. The final DNA concentrations were adjusted using empty expression vector to ensure that equal amounts of DNA were used in each plate. After 24 h transfected cells were treated with either TCDD or vehicle (Me2SO) for 16 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in Passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured using the luciferase assay reagent (Promega). The Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize the firefly luciferase activity of each sample. Each transfection was carried out in triplicate. RNA Interference in HepG2 Cells—A Med220 small interfering RNA oligo (siMed220), 5′-GGCUCUCAAAGUAACAUCU(TT)-3′, a scrambled RNA oligo(SC) with similar GC content, 5′-GAGUAAGUCCAUCACCUAU(TT)-3′, and their respective complementary oligos synthesized by Dharmacon were deprotected and annealed per the manufacturer's protocol. For ectopic reporter assays, siMed220 or SC were cotransfected into 12-well plates with a mixture of 200 ng of pGL-CYP1A1 firefly luciferase reporter and 40 ng of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter or a mixture containing 50 ng of GAL4-VP16 expression construct, 200 ng of GAL4 firefly luciferase reporter, and 40 ng of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter. Transfections were performed at 90% cell confluency with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection mixtures were replaced with fresh medium 5 h later. 36 h post-transfection cells transfected with the pGL-CYP1A1 reporter were treated with Me2SO or TCDD for an additional 16 h, whereas the cells transfected with the GAL4 reporter were left undisturbed. Cell lysates were harvested, and reporter activities were determined as described above. For the effect of Med220 knock-down on endogenous CYP1A1 induction, siMed220 or SC oligos were transfected into 6-well plates at 30% confluency using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). 24 h later cells were transfected again with the same procedures for an additional 24 h, and cells were treated with either Me2SO or TCDD for 6 h. Total RNA was then isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and assayed for CYP1A1, AHR, and β-actin mRNA levels by real time PCR. For detection of Med220 protein levels cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and 40 μg of whole cell extract was then separated on 6% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with either the Med220 antibody or AHR antibody. Reverse Transcription and Real-time Quantitative PCR—Reverse transcriptions were carried out with Thermoscript reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen) using 500 ng of Total RNA in a 20-μl volume. 10% of the reaction product was used together with SYBER-GREEN PCR master mix (Applied Biosystem) to assemble a 100-μl reaction that was divided into three 30-μl replicas and run on an I-cycler PCR machine (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR reaction parameters were 94 °C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. A first derivative plot of the melting curve obtained after an individual PCR reaction reveals a single peak at the melting temperature of the individual amplicon. PCR primers were 5′-TAAATCGCCAGGCAGTGCA-3′ and 5′-CCCACCATCACTGTTCCCTTA-3′ for human Med220, 5′-CCTGAATGCCTTCAAGGAC-3′ and 5′-ACGAAGGAAGAGTGTCGG-3′ for human CYP1A1, 5′-AGAAGGTCACTCTCTTTGGTTTGG-3′ and 5′-GCAGCAAGATGGCCAGGAA-3′ for murine CYP1A1, 5′-GCTCCTCCTGAGCGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGACA-3′ for human β-actin, 5′-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3′ and 5′-CAATAGTGATGACCTGGCCGT-3′ for murine β-actin. Med220 and CYP1A1 mRNA levels were normalized with the amount of β-actin mRNA. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIPs were carried out as we described previously (21Wang S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11821-118217Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with TCDD for 60 min except for the time-course analysis. The sizes of the majority of chromatin fragments were reduced to below 600 bp by sonication. The primers used to amplify the murine CYP1A1 promoter region were 5′-AATGGAGGCCCCAGTACTTAC-3′ and 5′-AGAACTACCACCTTCAGGGTTAGG-3′. ChIP-reIP utilized a similar ChIP protocol, except that the primary immunocomplex obtained with the p300 antibody was eluted by 10 mm dithiothreitol with agitation at 37 °C for 30 min. The eluate was diluted 50 times with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and immunoprecipitated with the Med220 antibody. AHR/ARNT Interacts with the Mediator Complex in Vivo—To explore the potential involvement of Mediator in AHR/ARNT-regulated transcription we set out to test whether the AHR/ARNT dimer can interact with Mediator. Hepa-1 cells were treated with TCDD or vehicle (Me2SO) for 60 min. Nuclear extracts from these cells were prepared, and immunoprecipitations were performed using an AHR antibody. Two of the Mediator subunits, Med220 and Med130, were co-immunoprecipitated with AHR (Fig. 1A) from cells treated with TCDD but not from cells not treated with this AHR ligand. Whereas Med220 may be a loosely attached subunit, since nullification of Med220 does not seem to compromise the overall integrity of the Mediator complex (19Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Google Scholar), Med130 is an integral part of the Mediator; the absence of Med130 destabilizes the associations of Med100 and Med95 with the Mediator complex (22Stevens J. Cantin G.T. Wang G. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Berk A.J. Science. 2002; 296: 755-758Google Scholar). Hence, this coimmunoprecipitation experiment indicates that AHR/ARNT interacts with the Mediator complex. We also immunoprecipitated ARNT from a nuclear extract of Hepa-1 cells untreated with TCDD. We were unable to detect co-immunoprecipitation between Med220, Med130, and ARNT (Fig. 1B). These last results indicate ARNT, at least when not associated with AHR, does not interact with the Mediator complex. Med220 and Also Med220 with Mutated LXXLL Motifs Enhance AHR/ARNT-mediated Reporter Gene Activity in Hepa-1 and HepG2 Cells—To assess the potential contribution of individual subunits of the Mediator complex to AHR/ARNT-regulated transcription, cDNA expression constructs for various Mediator subunits, including Med78, Med95, Med100, Med130, Med150, Med 220, Med230, and Med220 were cotransfected into Hepa-1 cells together with a reporter plasmids containing 4.2 kilobases of the 5′ upstream regulatory region of the rat CYP1A1 gene, including its promoter and multiple xenobiotic response elements. 24 h post-transfection cells were treated with Me2SO or TCDD for an additional 16 h, and reporter activities were then measured. Among all the cDNA constructs tested only Med220 elicited a significant enhancement of AHR/ARNT-regulated reporter activity (Fig. 2, B and C, and data not shown). Although the results cannot rule out potential involvements of other Mediator subunits because relevant cellular protein abundance and the stoichiometric composition of the Mediator complex could also impact the results of the experiments, they do reveal a role for Med220. Med220 is the interacting subunit within the Mediator complex for several nuclear receptors (NR), including thyroid hormone receptor (TR), vitamin D receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and estrogen receptor (ER) (14Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8329-8333Google Scholar, 16Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Naar A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Google Scholar, 19Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Google Scholar, 23Burakov D. Wong C.W. Rachez C. Cheskis B.J. Freedman L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20928-20934Google Scholar). Mutations of two LXXLL motifs in Med220 abolish its interaction and transcriptional coactivation activity with NRs (24Ren Y. Behre E. Ren Z. Zhang J. Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5433-5446Google Scholar, 25Yuan C. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Google Scholar). Another important class of NR coactivators is the p160 family including SRC-1, NCoA2, and p/CIP, which can also interact with NRs via their LXXLL motifs (26Heery D. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar). The p160 family of coactivators has also been implicated in AHR/ARNT-mediated transcription (27Beischlag T. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4319-4333Google Scholar, 28Kumar M. Perdew G. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 273-286Google Scholar). SRC-1 can interact with both AHR and ARNT (27Beischlag T. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4319-4333Google Scholar), and the interaction between AHR and SRC-1 depends on the LXXLL motifs of the latter (28Kumar M. Perdew G. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 273-286Google Scholar). We, therefore, extended our study using Med220 derivatives with mutated LXXLL motifs. We found that Med220 with either one or both of its LXXLL motifs mutated enhanced AHR/ARNT-regulated reporter activity with equal potency as wild type Med220 in Hepa-1 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Depletion of Endogenous Med220 Compromises AHR-regulated CYP1A1 Transcription—We used RNA interference to deplete endogenous Med220 in order to examine the contribution of Med220 to AHR-regulated transcription. We were pre-cluded from using Med220 wild type and Med220 knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) in this study because CYP1A1 expression is known to be repressed in MEF (29Gradin K. Toftgard R. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13511-13518Google Scholar) and also because the receptor appeared to be more abundant in Med220-/- MEF than in Med220+/+ MEF (data not shown). HepG2 cells were transfected with a small interference RNA oligo against human Med220 (siMed220) or a corresponding scrambled control oligo (SC) for 48 h followed by Me2SO or TCDD treatment for 6 h. Total RNA was then prepared and analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR to determine Med220 mRNA levels. Whole cell extracts of the transfected HepG2 cells were also analyzed for Med220 protein levels. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the siMed220 oligo drastically reduced Med220 mRNA and protein levels but did not affect AHR protein levels. For the Med220 effect on AHR/ARNT-mediated reporter gene transcription, either siMed220 or SC oligos was cotransfected with the CYP1A1-luciferase reporter plasmid into HepG2 cells. 36 h after transfection, cells were treated with Me2SO or TCDD for an additional 16 h, and reporter activities were then determined. As showed in Fig. 3C, siMed220 treatment significantly reduced TCDD-induced reporter activity, but SC had no effect. When the same oligos were cotransfected into HepG2 cells along with GAL4-VP16 expression and GAL4-based reporter plasmids, no significant difference in reporter activities were observed between siMed220-treated and SC-treated cells (Fig. 3D), in accordance with previous studies showing that VP16 targets the TRAP80 subunit in the Mediator complex and that GAL4-VP16-mediated reporter activities are unaffected by the absence of Med220 (30Ito M. Yuan C.X. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 683-693Google Scholar). To study the effects of small interfering RNA on the endogenous CYP1A1 gene, HepG2 cells were transfected with the siMed220 oligo or the control oligo SC for 48 h followed by Me2SO or TCDD treatment for 6 h. Total RNA was then prepared and analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. TCDD triggered CYP1A1 transcription was significantly compromised in siMed220-treated cells (Fig. 3E). We noticed that siMed220 decreases both the reporter gene activity and the endogenous CYP1A1 mRNA levels in the absence of TCDD. This is probably due to transcription of CYP1A1 in the absence of TCDD, also depending on AHR. Several lines of evidence support this last claim; constitutive levels of AHR-responsive genes CYP1A2 and UGT1*06 decrease dramatically in AHR null mice as compared with wild type mice (2Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Science. 1995; 268: 722-726Google Scholar), and a substantial decrease of CYP1B1 basal transcription is also observed in primary AHR-/- MEFs when compared with AHR+/+ MEFs (31Alexander D. Ganem L.G. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F. Jefcoate C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3311-3322Google Scholar). To provide additional support for this notion we used real time quantitative PCR to compare CYP1A1 mRNA levels in Hepa-1 cells with those in c35, a mutant derivative of Hepa-1 that contains a mutant, substantially inactivated form of AHR (32Sun W. Zhang J. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31845-31854Google Scholar). We found indeed that in the absence of TCDD, c35 had much less CYP1A1 mRNA than Hepa-1 (Fig. 3F). The measurable level of CYP1A1 transcription in the absence of the exogenous ligand is probably due to the effect of an endogenous ligand in Hepa-1 cells (33Hankinson O. Andersen R.D. Birren B.W. Sander F. Negishi M. Nebert D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1790-1795Google Scholar) or to the presence of a small amount of AHR inside the nucleus at any given time, resulting from trafficking of the receptor between the cytoplasm and nucleus (34Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Google Scholar). Mediator Associates with the Murine CYP1A1 Enhancer in Vivo in a TCDD-dependent Fashion—We carried out ChIP experiments to investigate whether the Mediator complex is recruited to the endogenous CYP1A1 gene upon its transcription activation. Hepa-1 cells were treated with Me2SO or TCDD for 60 min followed by formaldehyde cross-linking. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer and sonicated so that the size of the majority of chromatin fragments was reduced below 600 bp. Antibodies against Med220 and CDK8 were then used to pull down their associated chromatin fragments. Reversal of cross-linking and deproteinization were then carried out. DNA fragments were purified and amplified by PCR with primers flanking the mCYP1A1 enhancer region (Fig. 4A). We thereby detected TCDD-dependent enhancer association for both Med220 and CDK8 (Fig. 4B), indicating that the Mediator was recruited to the CYP1A1 enhancer region via AHR/ARNT. Interestingly, studies from several different laboratories demonstrated that although sharing the majority of subunits with the Mediator complex, some smaller complexes devoid of certain subunits, such as cyclin C and CDK8, do exist (15Näär A.M. Beaurang P.A. Zhou S. Abraham S. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Google Scholar, 35Wang G. Cantin G.T. Stevens J.L. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4604-4613Google Scholar). The heterogeneity of the Mediator may provide an additional layer of modulation to different transcription activators and promoters. Our results indicate that in the context of CYP1A1 transcription, the large complex of Mediator is utilized. Similar ChIP experiments in Med220+/+ MEFs demonstrated TCDD-inducible binding of Med220 and AHR to the CYP1A1 enhancer in these cells (Fig. 4C). However, no Med220 association with the enhancer was observed in Med220-/- MEFs, although TCDD-inducible binding of AHR to the enhancer still occurred (Fig. 4C). Moreover, TCDD-inducible binding of CDK8 to the enhancer could only be detected in Med220+/+ MEFs (Fig. 4C). This strongly suggests that Med220 is critical for the recruitment of the Mediator complex by AHR/ARNT. In agreement with the fact that CYP1A1 expression is suppressed in MEFs, ChIP assays in these cells revealed that although receptor binding and Med220 recruitment to the enhancer were readily observed 60 min post-TCDD treatment, no increase of pol II occupancy over the promoter could be detected even after 2 h of TCDD treatment (data now shown), suggesting that AHR is capable of recruiting Mediator even in the absence of a stabilized preinitiation complex over the promoter. To study the role of the LXXLL motifs of Med220 in the process of recruitment, we performed ChIP experiments in Med220 null MEFs stably infected with a mutant Med220 in which both of LXXLL motifs are mutated. As shown in Fig. 4D, Med220 with mutated LXXLL motifs can still be recruited to the enhancer in response to TCDD. Collectively, therefore these results show that Med220 is recruited to the murine CYP1A1 enhancer after TCDD treatment, that the LXXLL motifs in Med220 are not required for recruitment, and that the large complex of the Mediator containing CDK8 is employed. Kinetics of Assembly of AHR, Med220, and Other Coactivators at the CYP1A1 Enhancer after TCDD Treatment—Different transcription activators recruit different coactivator complexes in distinct kinetic manners to their target promoters, as is evident from a few well studied nuclear receptor systems. The ER recruits Med220 and the p/CIP member of the p160 family of coactivators simultaneously to the estrogen-responsive regulatory sequences, and these proteins appear to associate and disassociate from the regulatory sequences of the pS2 and the cathepsin D genes in a cyclic fashion, the timing coinciding with receptor DNA binding and pol II occupancy over the regulatory region (36Burakov D. Crofts L.A. Chang C.P. Freedman L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14359-14362Google Scholar, 37Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Google Scholar). In the case of TR, the receptor-mediated recruitment of p160 family of coactivators precedes Med220 recruitment (38Sharma D. Fondell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7934-7939Google Scholar). We carried out ChIP kinetic studies on the murine CYP1A1 regulatory regions using antibodies against AHR, Med220, and various other cofactors in Hepa-1 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2015556948,"Gram-negative bacterial autotransporter proteins are a growing group of virulence factors that are characterized by their ability to cross the outer membrane without the help of accessory proteins. A conserved C-terminal β-domain is critical for targeting of autotransporters to the outer membrane and for translocation of the N-terminal “passenger” domain to the bacterial surface. We have demonstrated previously that the Haemophilus influenzae Hia adhesin belongs to the autotransporter family, with translocator activity residing in the C-terminal 319 residues. To gain further insight into the mechanism of autotransporter protein translocation, we performed a structure-function analysis on Hia. In initial experiments, we generated a series of in-frame deletions and a set of chimeric proteins containing varying regions of the Hia C terminus fused to a heterologous passenger domain and discovered that the final 76 residues of Hia are both necessary and sufficient for translocation. Analysis by flow cytometry revealed that the region N-terminal to this shortened translocator domain is surface localized, further suggesting that this region is not involved in β-barrel formation or in translocation of the passenger domain. Western analysis demonstrated that the translocation-competent regions of the C terminus migrated at masses consistent with trimers, suggesting that the Hia C terminus oligomerizes. Furthermore, fusion proteins containing a heterologous passenger domain demonstrated that similarly small C-terminal regions of Yersinia sp. YadA and Neisseria meningitidis NhhA are translocation-competent. These data provide experimental support for a unique subclass of autotransporters characterized by a short trimeric translocator domain.

These data provide experimental support for a unique subclass of autotransporters characterized by a short trimeric translocator domain. Secretion of proteins in Gram-negative bacteria is complicated by the presence of two membranes in the cell envelope. To overcome this barrier, organisms have evolved a variety of protein secretion systems that differ, in part, by the mechanism of translocation across the outer membrane. In some cases, translocation across the outer membrane is accomplished via a channel that spans the cytoplasmic membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane, allowing translocation of the protein directly from the cytoplasm to the extracellular milieu. In other cases, the polypeptide is transported across the cytoplasmic membrane and into the periplasm via the Sec apparatus and then is translocated across the outer membrane by a pore-forming complex. The individual pathways of this latter class of protein secretion systems are defined by the nature of the pore formed in the outer membrane. For example, the secretin proteins of the Type II secretion pathway form very large ring-shaped structures, with 10–14 subunits giving rise to a pore with an external diameter of 14–20 nm and an internal diameter of 5–10 nm (1Stathopoulos C. Hendrixson D.R. Thanassi D.G. Hultgren S.J. St. Geme III, J.W. Curtiss III, R. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The PapC usher required for the assembly of P pili on uropathogenic Escherichia coli forms a hexameric ring, with an external diameter of ∼12 nm and an internal diameter of ∼2 nm (2Thanassi D.G. Saulino E.T. Lombardo M.J. Roth R. Heuser J. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3146-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Autotransporter proteins, named for their ability to traverse the outer membrane without the assistance of accessory proteins, have long been thought to be translocated through a monomeric pore. However, recent evidence presented by Veiga et al. (3Veiga E. Sugawara E. Nikaido H. de Lorenzo V. Fernandez L.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) suggests that the pore formed by the Neisseria gonorrhoeae IgA1 protease is oligomeric, with at least six subunits, and has an external diameter of ∼9 nm and an internal diameter of ∼2 nm.Autotransporters are a rapidly growing family of proteins that are being recognized increasingly as virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria. These proteins are present in diverse organisms and mediate a wide array of functions, including proteolysis, adherence, invasion, and cytotoxicity (4Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Members of the autotransporter family are characterized by three domains. An N-terminal signal sequence directs the polypeptide through the Sec apparatus and into the periplasm. A C-terminal β-domain then integrates into the outer membrane and forms a pore, allowing the internal “functional” domain, referred to as the passenger domain, to be presented on the bacterial surface (4Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In the vast majority of cases, the passenger domain is cleaved from the β-domain and then either released into the extracellular medium or non-covalently tethered to the bacterial surface. Given the vast differences in passenger domain functions, the defining characteristic of an autotransporter lies in the ability of the β-domain to translocate the passenger domain. The distinctive nature of this translocation process has resulted in a great deal of study. Deletion analyses performed with a number of autotransporters have shown that the β-domain is generally ∼300 residues in length (5Klauser T. Kramer J. Otzelberger K. Pohlner J. Meyer T.F. J. Mol.

YadA are capable of translocating an N-terminal epitope tag to the surface, leading the authors to suggest that YadA belongs to a distinct subfamily of oligomeric autotransporters (10Roggenkamp A. Ackermann N. Jacobi C.A. Truelzsch K. Hoffmann H. Heesemann J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3735-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).In a previous work (11St. Geme III, J.W. Cutter D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6005-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the Haemophilus influenzae Hia adhesin is an autotransporter protein, establishing that residues 780–1098 harbor translocator activity. More recently, we discovered that Hia contains two distinct binding domains, both of which mediate attachment to epithelial cells via the same host cell receptor, although with differing affinities (12Laarmann S. Cutter D. Juehne T. Barenkamp S.J. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 731-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The primary high affinity binding domain resides within residues 541–714, whereas the secondary binding domain is contained in residues 50–374 and binds to host cells with ∼20-fold decreased affinity. In the present study, we examined the Hia β-domain in greater detail. Using a series of deletion mutants and chimeric proteins, we found that the C-terminal 76 residues are both necessary and sufficient for translocation of a passenger domain. In addition, we discovered that the Hia C terminus oligomerizes, forming a trimer. Further analyses revealed that the C termini of YadA and Neisseria meningitidis NhhA are sufficient for surface localization of foreign polypeptides. Our results extend previous work performed with YadA and clearly demonstrate the existence of a subfamily of autotransporter proteins, typified by a short translocator domain that undergoes trimer formation to form a β-barrel.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—Non-typable H. influenzae (NTHi) strain 11 is the strain from which hia was originally cloned and has been described previously (13Barenkamp S.J. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NTHi strain 32 was recovered from the middle ear fluid of a child with acute otitis media. Laboratory strains employed in these studies included H. influenzae strain DB117 (rec1–) (14Setlow J.K. Brown D.C. Boling M.E. Mattingly A. Gordon M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 546-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), E. coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen), and E. coli BL21(DE3) (15Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4788) Google Scholar). N. meningitidis strain BB-1148 is a serotype C strain and was a generous gift from Carl Frasch (Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD).The plasmid pHapS243A is a derivative of pGJB103 containing the hap gene from H. influenzae strain N187 with a point mutation at the codon encoding the active-site serine (9Hendrixson D.R. de la Morena M.L. Stathopoulos C. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The plasmid pDH106 contains the coding sequence for the Hap passenger domain (residues 1–1034) with an engineered SalI site at the 3′-end (16Hendrixson D.R. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The plasmid pHMW8-7 contains hia from H. influenzae strain 11 in pT7-7, and pHMW8-6 contains hia interrupted with a kanamycin cassette (13Barenkamp S.J. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The plasmid pHMW32-1 contains hia from NTHi strain 32 cloned into the SalI and EcoRI sites of pT7-7. The plasmid pHAT10 encodes a novel polyhistidine epitope tag, with six histidine residues spread throughout 19 amino acids (KDHLIHNVHKEEHAHAHNK), and strong affinity for immobilized metal ions (Clontech). The plasmid pMW10 encodes YadA from Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O:8 and was a kind gift from Virginia Miller (Washington University, St. Louis, MO).E. coli strains were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar or in LB broth and stored at –80 °C in LB broth with 50% glycerol. H. influenzae strains were grown on chocolate agar, on brain-heart infusion agar supplemented with hemin and NAD, or in brain-heart infusion broth supplemented with hemin and NAD, as described previously (17Anderson P. Johnston Jr., R.B. Smith D.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1972; 51: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Antibiotic concentrations used to select for plasmids included 100 μgml–1 ampicillin and 12.5 μg ml–1 tetracycline in E. coli and 5 μg ml–1 tetracycline in H. influenzae.Recombinant DNA Methods—DNA ligations, restriction endonuclease digestions, gel electrophoresis, and PCR were performed according to standard techniques (18Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced into E. coli by electroporation (19Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). H. influenzae was transformed using the MIV method of Herriott et al. (20Herriott R.M. Meyer E.M. Vogt M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 517-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Inactivation of hia in H. influenzae Strain 32—To construct a H. influenzae strain 32 mutant deficient in expression of Hia, bacteria were transformed with linearized pHMW8-6. Transformants were selected by plating on brain-heart infusion agar supplemented with hemin, NAD, and 20 μg ml–1 kanamycin. Allelic exchange was confirmed by Southern analysis, and loss of Hia expression was confirmed by Western immunoblotting.Construction of Plasmids Used in This Study—To generate in-frame deletions within Hia, we began with pHMW8-7. Using recombinant PCR, a 1.1-kb AlwNI-MfeI fragment with a deletion of coding sequence for residues 780–976, a 950-bp AlwNI-MfeI fragment with a deletion of coding sequence for residues 780–1022, and a 900-bp AlwNI-MfeI fragment with a deletion of coding sequence for residues 780–1046 were produced and inserted in place of the wild-type 1.7-kb AlwNI-MfeI fragment in pHMW8-7, generating constructs pHMW8-7Δ780-976, pHMW8-7Δ780-1022, and pHMW8-7Δ780-1046.To generate plasmids encoding the HapS-Hia chimeras, pHMW8-7 was used as a template to amplify the coding sequence for Hia residues 780–1098, 977–1098, 1023–1098, and 1047–1098 with an engineered SalI site at the 5′-end and an engineered BamHI site at the 3′-end. These PCR products were digested with SalI and BamHI and then ligated into SalI-BamHI-digested pDH106, generating pUC19::HapS-Hia780–1098, pUC19::HapS-Hia977–1098, pUC19::HapS-Hia1023–1098, and pUC19::HapS-Hia1047–1098. These pUC19::HapS-Hia chimeras were then digested with PstI and BamHI, liberating the ∼6-kb inserts. These inserts were then ligated into PstI-BglII-digested pGJB103, generating pHapS-Hia780–1098, pHapS-Hia977–1098, pHapS-Hia1023–1098, and pHapS-Hia1047–1098. Plasmids encoding the HapS-YadA and HapS-NhhA chimeras were generated in a similar manner. The coding sequences for YadA residues 325–422 and NhhA residues 473–591 were amplified using pMW10 and genomic DNA from BB-1148 as templates, respectively, with engineered SalI and BamHI sites as before. These PCR products were digested with SalI and BamHI and ligated into SalI-BamHI-digested pDH106, generating pUC19::HapS-YadA325–422 and pUC19::HapS-NhhA473–591. The ∼5.5-kb inserts were liberated by digestion with PstI and BamHI and were subsequently ligated into PstI-BglII-digested pGJB103, generating pHapS-YadA325–422 and pHapS-NhhA473–591.To generate constructs encoding the HAT 1The abbreviation used is: HAT, histidine affinity tag. epitope fused to varying Hia C-terminal regions, a fragment containing the hia promoter and coding sequence for the Hia signal sequence was amplified by PCR, engineering HindIII sites on both ends. After digestion with HindIII, the fragment was ligated into a HindIII-digested alkaline phosphatase-treated pHAT10, generating pHAT::HiaSS. Transformants with the proper orientation of the insert were identified by nucleotide sequencing. pUC19::HapS-Hia780–1098, pUC19::HapS-Hia977–1098, pUC19::HapS-Hia1023–1098, and pUC19::HapS-Hia1047–1098 were digested with SalI and BamHI to liberate inserts encoding Hia C-terminal regions. These inserts were then ligated into SalI-BamHI-digested pHAT::HiaSS, generating pHAT::Hia780–1098, pHAT::Hia977–1098, pHAT::Hia1023–1098, and pHAT::Hia1047–1098. The plasmid pHMW8-7 was used as a template to amplify the coding sequence for Hia residues 820–1098, 853–1098, 872–1098, 889–1098, 911–1098, 928–1098, 948–1098, and 990–1098 with an engineered SalI site at the 5′-end and an engineered BamHI site at the 3′-end. PCR products were digested with SalI and BamHI and ligated into SalI-BamHI-digested pHAT:HiaSS, generating pHAT::Hia820–1098, pHAT::Hia853–1098, pHAT::Hia872–1098, pHAT::Hia889–1098, pHAT::Hia911–1098, pHAT::Hia928–1098, pHAT::Hia948–1098, and pHAT::Hia990–1098. All constructs were examined by nucleotide sequencing to ensure that the inserts were in-frame and that all PCR products were free of mutations.Cell Fractionation and Protein Analysis—Whole-cell sonicates were prepared by resuspending bacterial pellets in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and sonicating to clarity. Outer membrane proteins were recovered on the basis of Sarkosyl insolubility as described by Carlone et al. (21Carlone G.M. Thomas M.L. Rumschlag H.S. Sottnek F.O. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 330-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, whole-cell sonicates and outer membrane fractions were treated with 95% formic acid as described previously (22St. Geme III, J.W. Kumar V.V. Cutter D. Barenkamp S.J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 364-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, bacteria were incubated with cross-linkers (dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) or 3,3′-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidyl propionate), Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions prior to preparation of outer membrane proteins. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 7.5–15% polyacrylamide gels. To ensure that comparable amounts of protein were analyzed, similar volumes from cultures of similar density were loaded into each lane. Western blots were performed with a guinea pig polyclonal antiserum raised against Hia residues 50–252, a guinea pig polyclonal antiserum raised against HapS, or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the HAT epitope (Clontech). An anti-guinea pig or anti-rabbit IgG antiserum conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) was used as the secondary antibody, and detection of antibody reactivity was accomplished by incubation of the membrane in a chemiluminescent substrate solution (Pierce) and exposure to film.Flow Cytometry Analysis of Bacteria—For E. coli strains, bacteria were inoculated 1:25 from overnight cultures into LB broth containing 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin and were grown to an A600 ≈ 0.4. For H. influenzae strains, bacteria were resuspended from a plate into brain-heart infusion broth supplemented with hemin and NAD to an A600 ≈ 0.2 and were grown to an A600 ≈ 0.8. With each sample, 1 ml of bacteria was fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate-buffered saline, washed once with Tris-buffered saline, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and the appropriate primary antibody diluted 1:1000. Samples were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.25 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and Cy2-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:100). Incubations with the primary and secondary antibodies were for 1 h each. After incubation with the secondary antibody, samples were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and surface-localized protein was measured by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with Cellquest software (BD Biosciences).Quantitative Adherence Assays—Adherence assays were performed with Chang epithelial cells (Wong-Kilbourne derivative, clone 1-5c-4, human conjunctiva, ATCC CCL20.2) or with A549 respiratory epithelial cells (ATCC CCL185) as described previously (23St. Geme III, J.W. Falkow S. Barenkamp S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2875-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Percent adherence was calculated by dividing the number of adherent colony-forming units/monolayer by the number of colony-forming units inoculated.Nucleotide Sequencing and DNA and Protein Sequence Analysis— Nucleotide sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer and the BigDye Terminator Premix-20 kit (Applied Biosystems/PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Double-stranded plasmid DNA was used as template, and sequencing was carried out along both strands. Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW at EBI (ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/).Nucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers—The nucleotide sequence for hia from NTHi strain 32 has been deposited with GenBank and assigned the accession number AY443498.RESULTSThe C-terminal 76 Residues of Hia Are Necessary and Sufficient for Translocator Activity—In initial studies, we compared the full-length Hia sequences from 10 different clinical isolates of NTHi and found significant overall similarity throughout the entire protein sequence. However, the protein expressed by strain 32 (Hia32) was found to be exceptional, lacking the sequence corresponding to residues 590–976 of Hia from the prototypic strain 11 (Hia11) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 1B, this truncation results in loss of the N-terminal seven β-strands of the predicted β-domain. Examination of outer membrane fractions by immunoblotting and surface-localized protein by flow cytometry revealed appreciable amounts of Hia in the outer membrane and on the surface of strain 32 (data not shown). Comparison of wild-type strain 32 and an isogenic Hia-deficient mutant (32hia) revealed that Hia32 was capable of mediating high levels of adherence to Chang cells, comparable with adherence by Hia11 (Fig. 1C). Consistent with this result, E. coli DH5α expressing Hia32 was highly adherent (Fig. 1C).With this information in mind, we hypothesized that the functional translocator domain of Hia from other isolates may also be smaller than recognized previously. To explore this possibility, we constructed a series of in-frame deletions within the Hia11 C terminus, allowing the examination of progressively shorter regions of the Hia C terminus for the ability to translocate the Hia passenger domain. Western analysis demonstrated that all deletion mutants except for HiaΔ780–1046 were properly inserted into the outer membrane (Fig. 2A). Flow cytometry analysis using an antiserum raised against residues 221–658 of Hia11 revealed that full-length Hia, HiaΔ780–976, and HiaΔ780–1022 were all surface-localized, whereas the passenger domain in HiaΔ780–1046 was absent from the bacterial surface (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these flow cytometry data, in adherence assays with Chang cells, E. coli BL21(DE3) expressing HiaΔ780–976 or HiaΔ780–1022 was capable of wild-type levels of adherence. In contrast, BL21(DE3) expressing HiaΔ780–1046 was non-adherent, indistinguishable from BL21(DE3) harboring vector alone (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Immunoblot and functional analysis of Hia deletion mutants expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). A, outer membrane proteins detected by Western blot with a guinea pig antiserum directed against Hia residues 50–252. B, flow cytometry analysis of Hia on the bacterial surface performed with a guinea pig antiserum against Hia residues 221–658. Strain BL21(DE3)/pT7-7 (vector) was used as the negative control, and the corresponding histogram was superimposed (solid line) on results with E. coli expressing wild-type Hia (pHMW8-7) or the Hia deletion derivatives (filled histograms).

Bars represent the means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To extend these results, we generated fusions between the passenger domain of the H. influenzae Hap adhesin (HapS) and regions of the Hia C terminus comparable with those examined in the Hia deletion mutants. Hap has been shown previously to be an autotransporter that promotes microcolony formation and mediates adherence to cultured epithelial cells and extracellular matrix proteins (9Hendrixson D.R. de la Morena M.L. Stathopoulos C. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Fink D.L. Buscher A.Z. Green B. Fernsten P. St. Geme III, J.W. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After translocation of the passenger domain (HapS) to the bacterial surface, Hap undergoes an autoproteolytic cleavage event that releases HapS into the extracellular milieu. Mutating the active site serine to an alanine (HapS243A) prevents this cleavage event, locking the adhesin in a fully cell-associated form and thus enhancing adhesive properties (9Hendrixson D.R. de la Morena M.L. Stathopoulos C. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). HapS243A was used as a positive control in these experiments, as the HapS-Hia fusions lack the cleavage sites normally present in Hap. Western analysis of outer membranes prepared from H. influenzae DB117 expressing HapS243A, HapS-Hia780–1098, HapS-Hia977–1098, HapS-Hia1023–1098, or HapS-Hia1047–1098 revealed that all the chimeras except HapS-Hia1047–1098 were present in the outer membrane, albeit at reduced levels compared with HapS243A (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis confirmed the presence of HapS on the bacterial surface for all constructs except HapS-Hia1047–1098 (Fig. 3B). Consistent with these data, all the chimeras except HapS-Hia1047–1098 were capable of promoting appreciable bacterial adherence to A549 cells, although to a lesser level than HapS243A (Fig. 3C). Considered together, these results indicate that the C-terminal 76 residues of Hia are both necessary and sufficient for translocation of a passenger domain.Fig. 3Immunoblot and functional analysis of HapS-Hia chimeras expressed in H. influenzae DB117. A, outer membrane proteins detected by Western blot with a guinea pig antiserum directed against HapS.

Bars represent the means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given that the translocator domain is much smaller than previously believed, we elected to explore further the role of residues 780–1022. Specifically, we wondered whether residues 780–1022 form transmembrane β-strands, as suggested by secondary structure predictions and depicted in Fig. 1B. One possibility is that these residues form additional transmembrane β-strands that are dispensable for translocator activity but are important in other undetermined ways. Alternatively, this region may be completely surface-localized, thus explaining why it is not required for translocator activity. To discriminate between these possibilities, we generated constructs consisting of the Hia signal sequence and the HAT epitope fused upstream of progressively shorter regions of the Hia C terminus. The arrowheads in Fig. 1B identify the starting residues for these constructs, which address every predicted periplasmic and extracellular loop. Western analysis of outer membrane proteins prepared from bacteria expressing these constructs confirmed proper localization of all proteins except Hia1047–1098, which was not present in the outer membrane (data not shown). Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis revealed that the HAT epitope was surface localized in all cases except Hia1047–1098 (data not shown). These data indicate that residues 780–1022 are surface localized and do not form transmembrane β-strands. Additionally, residues 1023–1046 are required for either Hia insertion into the outer membrane or Hia stability in the outer membrane.The Hia C Terminus Undergoes Oligomerization—In considering the finding that the C-terminal 76 residues of Hia are able to translocate a passenger domain to the bacterial surface, we wondered about the mechanism by which this limited sequence might form a channel large enough to allow transit of the passenger domain. Studies performed with other outer membrane proteins have revealed that all form β-barrel structures with an even number of β-strands (25Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 443-447Crossre"
https://openalex.org/W2103689369,"Actin cytoskeleton dynamics critically regulate T cell activation. We found that the cytoplasmic adaptor HIP-55, a Src/Syk-kinases substrate and member of the drebrin/Abp1 family of actin-binding proteins, localized to the T cell-antigen-presenting cell (APC) contact site in an antigen-dependent manner. Using green fluorescent protein fusion proteins, both Src homology 3 (SH3) and actin binding domains were found necessary for recruitment at the T cell-APC interface. HIP-55 was not implicated in conjugate formation and actin polymerization but regulated distal signaling events through binding and activation of hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a germinal center kinase (GCK) family kinase involved in negative signaling in T cells. Using RNA interference and overexpression experiments, the HIP-55-HPK1 complex was found to negatively regulate nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) activation by the T cell antigen receptor. Moreover, we show that HIP-55, which partly co-localized with early endocytic compartments, promoted both basal and ligand-dependent T cell receptor (TCR) down-modulation, resulting in a decreased TCR expression. SH3 and actin-depolymerizing factor homology domains were required for this function. As controls, the expression of CD28 and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein CD59 was not affected by HIP-55 overexpression. These results suggest that, in addition to binding to HPK1, HIP-55 might negatively regulate TCR signaling through down-regulation of TCR expression. Our findings show that HIP-55 is a key novel component of the immunological synapse that modulates T cell activation by connecting actin cytoskeleton and TCRs to gene activation and endocytic processes.

Cytoskeletal dynamics also appear to be involved in the specific patterning of negative regulatory receptors that fine-tune T cell biological responses (6Roumier A. Olivo-Marin J.C. Arpin M.

Evidence suggests that IS formation correlates with transcription of cytokine genes, cellular proliferation, and effector cell differentiation (8Lanzavecchia A. Sallusto F. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, the exact function of the IS is still unclear, and it has been proposed that the IS serves as a site where clustered TCRs could be subjected to endocytosis, allowing TCR signaling down-regulation (8Lanzavecchia A. Sallusto F. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 9Lee K.H. Holdorf A.D. Dustin M.L. Chan A.C. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S.

Immunol. 2002; 14: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Several actin-binding proteins have been involved in the process of T cell activation mediated by APCs. One of the best studied examples is the complex formed by the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) with the actin-related protein Arp2/3 (11Mullins R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This complex is activated following the phosphorylation of the adaptor SLP-76 by activated ZAP-70. SLP-76 then associates with Nck (12Bubeck Wardenburg J. Pappu R. Bu J.Y. Mayer B. Chernoff J. Straus D. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Vav1 (13Tuosto L. Michel F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), a guanine exchange factor that promotes the activation of Rho GTPases and their effectors, including WASP. The WASP-Arp2/3 complex then regulates actin nucleation, resulting in the extension and branching of the actin filaments. Genetic studies have shown that WASP- and Vav1-deficient T cells exhibit TCR clustering and activation defects following TCR engagement (14Snapper S.B. Rosen F.S. Mizoguchi E. Cohen P. Khan W.

However, the function of several other classes of actin cytoskeleton regulatory proteins expressed in lymphocytes are currently unclear (for review, see Ref. 16Fuller C.L. Braciale V.L. Samelson L.E. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 191: 220-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).We have investigated the involvement during T cell activation of the cytoplasmic adaptor protein HIP-55 (also called SH3P7 or mAbp1), a member of the drebrin/Abp1 class of actin-binding proteins. The drebrin/Abp1 family is conserved from yeast to mammals and is characterized by the presence of a homologous N-terminal actin-depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domain (17Drubin D.G. Mulholland J. Zhu Z.M. Botstein D. Nature. 1990; 343: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 18Lappalainen P. Kessels M.M. Cope M.J. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This family includes SH3P7 in mouse (19Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 393-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Larbolette O. Wollscheid B. Schweikert J. Nielsen P.J. Wienands J. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1990; 343: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The ADF-H domain is also found in proteins that regulate the disassembly of actin filaments such as cofilins and twinfilins (18Lappalainen P. Kessels M.M. Cope M.J. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The drebrin/Abp1 family, which binds F-actin but not actin monomers, is involved in signaling events in multiple organisms and cells. For example, the yeast Abp1 is connected to endocytic trafficking and Arp2/3 activation (21Olazabal I.M. Machesky L.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas drebrins participate in cytoskeleton plasticity and morphogenesis in neurons (22Ishikawa R. Hayashi K. Shirao T. Xue Y. Takagi T. Sasaki Y. Kohama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29928-29933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HIP-55 is composed of an N-terminal ADF-H domain, two consensus tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and a C-terminal SH3 domain and has no activity of actin polymerization (19Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 393-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The homologue of HIP-55 in mouse was found to be a substrate of Src and Syk family kinases following B-cell receptor stimulation (20Larbolette O. Wollscheid B. Schweikert J. Nielsen P.J. Wienands J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may represent a common effector of antigen receptor-signaling pathways in leukocytes. Moreover, HIP-55 associates with dynamin, a GTPase that functions in endocytosis, indicating that it may also connect the actin cytoskeleton to endocytic function (24Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Qualmann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 25Mise-Omata S. Montagne B. Deckert M. Wienands J. Acuto O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Finally, HIP-55 was cloned as a hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1)-interacting protein (23Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), an association that suggests HIP-55 involvement in the regulation of HPK1 activity and localization. HPK1 is a member of the GCK family (26Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which is involved in TCR and B cell receptor signaling (27Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Sauer K. Liou J. Singh S.B. Yablonski D. Weiss A. Perlmutter R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45207-45216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HPK1 function in T cells is unclear. However, overexpression of HPK1 inhibits ERKs and AP-1 activities following TCR cross-linking (27Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, the drebrin/Abp1 family represents a novel group of signaling molecules with connecting functions between cellular trafficking, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal organization.In this study, we show that antigen-dependent TCR engagement results in the accumulation of HIP-55 at the T cell-APC contact site. Using a combination of confocal microscopy, RNA interference, and overexpression experiments, we show that HIP-55 does not contribute to the early formation of T cell-APC conjugates. However, we found that HIP-55 is a key component of the immunological synapse that regulates T cell activation by bridging TCRs and the actin cytoskeleton to gene activation and endocytic processes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice and Reagents—Homozygous DO11.10 mice were a gift from Dr. S.D. Hurst (DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA). Recombinant mouse IL-12 was purchased from BD Pharmingen. Ovalbumin-derived (OVA) peptide (323-339), TRITC- and FITC-conjugated phalloidin were from Sigma. Staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE) was from Toxin Technologies (Madison, WI). Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody X3 was purified from hybridoma supernatant. Anti-WASP was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse was from Dako (Copenhagen, Denmark), Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD43, anti-mouse CD4 (GK1.5), anti-mouse CD62L (Mel-14), anti-mouse IL4, anti-EEA1, anti-GM130, anti-CD28, and anti-CD59 were from BD Pharmingen. Cell Tracker Orange (CMTMR) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other chemicals were from Sigma.Plasmids—The NFAT and IL-2 promoter luciferase reporter plasmids were obtained as described previously (29Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The vectors encoding hemagglutinin A (HA)-tagged wild-type and kinase-dead HPK1 were a gift of Dr. F. Kiefer (Max Planck Institute, Germany) (26Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Full-length HIP-55 cDNA and mutants with deletion of the SH3 or ADF-H domain (ΔSH3 and ΔADF-H, respectively) were amplified by PCR from a cDNA library of Jurkat cells. cDNAs were then cloned into pCDNA3.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen) to generate in-frame fusions with a V5-epitope sequence at the 3′-end. HIP-55-GFP, ΔADF-H-GFP and ΔSH3-GFP were generated by subcloning from pCDNA3.1/V5-His vectors into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech).Cell Culture and Transfection—CD4+ CD62Lhigh naive T cells from DO11.10 mice were purified from spleen and sorted by positive selection. Cells were then incubated with irradiated splenocytes, 0.5 μm OVA peptide (323-339), 100 IU/ml IL-12, and 10 μg/ml anti-IL-4 mAb for 1 week as described previously (30Cottrez F. Hurst S.D. Coffman R.L. Groux H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4848-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Mouse A20 B lymphoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. C. Fournier (INSERM U477, Paris, France). Human leukemia Jurkat T cells and simian virus 40 large T antigen-transfected Jurkat (Jurkat TAg) cells were cultured and transfected as described (29Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Raji and U937 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured as Jurkat cells. To establish stably transfected Jurkat cells, 2 days after electroporation with pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N1-HIP-55, pEGFP-N1-ΔADF-H and pEGFP-N1-ΔSH3, 1 mg/ml G418 was added to the culture media. After 1 month, drug-resistant clones were isolated by limiting dilution, and the protein levels in the clones were determined by Western blot analysis.Cell Conjugation and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Conjugate formation was carried out as described (31Cannon J.L. Labno C.M. Bosco G. Seth A. McGavin M.H. Siminovitch K.A. Rosen M.K. Burkhardt J.K. Immunity. 2001; 15: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, APCs were dyed with 10 μm CMTMR and pulsed or not with OVA peptide (A20 B cells) with 2 μg/ml anti-CD3 mAb (U937 cells) or 5 μg/ml SEE (Raji cells). APCs and T cells were then mixed at a 1:1.5 ratio and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The conjugates were then gently resuspended and plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides for 20 min before fixation. Before use, live GFP-HIP-55-transfected Jurkat cells were separated from dead cells by passage over Ficoll. Cells were fixed in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked in PBS/saponin/BSA, and stained with the indicated primary and secondary antibody. After labeling, samples were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS-SP)FACS-based Conjugation Assay—FACS-based conjugation assays were performed following procedures adapted from Ref. 32Callewaert D.M. Radcliff G. Waite R. LeFevre J. Poulik M.D. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. Conjugates between equal numbers of U937 and GFP-HIP-55-transfected Jurkat cells were obtained as described above. Cell conjugation was then determined by two-color flow cytometric analysis using a FACStar (BD Biosciences), and the percentage of T cell conjugation was represented as the number of dual labeled (CMTMR/GFP) events divided by the sum of the dual labeled events plus unconjugated Jurkat T cells events × 100.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described (29Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Affinity purified polyclonal antibodies against HIP-55 were produced as described previously (25Mise-Omata S. Montagne B. Deckert M. Wienands J. Acuto O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Anti-HA mAb (12CA5) was from Roche Applied Science, anti-V5 mAb was from Invitrogen, anti-HPK1 and anti-ERK2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-actin was from Chemicon.Actin Polymerization—Measurement of actin polymerization was measured on Jurkat cells transfected with indicated GFP-tagged HIP-55 constructs. After 36 h, cells were prewarmed for 15 min at 37 °C and then stimulated or not with anti-CD3 mAb (10 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of 3.7% paraformaldehyde, followed by blocking with PBS, 1% BSA, and 0.1% NaN3. Cells were permeabilized in 0.05% saponin and incubated with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. F-actin content in GFP-gated cells was analyzed in triplicate by flow cytometry.Luciferase Reporter Assays—Luciferase assays were done as described previously (29Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stimulated either by an equal number of SEE-pulsed Raji cells or unpulsed Raji cells for the next 6 h of culture. In some experiments, transfected Jurkat TAg cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb (5 μg/ml) or a combination of PMA (100 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml). Luciferase activities were assayed using the Promega luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and measured in a luminometer (EG&G Berthold; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Normalization of transfection efficiency was performed by measuring β-galactosidase activities. Normalized luciferase activities were determined in triplicate and expressed as fold increase relative to the basal activity seen in unstimulated mock-transfected cells.RNA Interference—siRNAs were synthesized, annealed, and purified by Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sequence for HIP-55 siRNAs was described previously (25Mise-Omata S. Montagne B. Deckert M. Wienands J. Acuto O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The sequences for HPK1 and scramble siRNAs were 5′-AAUGAGCUGUGUGACAUCUGG-3′ and 5′-AAGCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCG-3′, respectively. Jurkat cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of pEF-CD20, 0.4 μg of siRNA, and 0.4 μg of NFAT-luc using Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the same transfection was performed on transfected cells, and CD20+ Jurkat cells were purified using anti-mouse IgG magnetic beads (Dynal, Norway) incubated with anti-CD20 mAb. Cells that had been detached from the beads were then stimulated or not with anti-CD3 or a combination of PMA and ionomycin. Luciferase activities were measured in triplicate as described above and expressed as the percentage of maximal activities seen in PMA- and ionomycin-stimulated cells. For protein expression, cell lysates of purified CD20+ Jurkat cells were prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer and Western blotted as described in the previous section.Flow Cytometry Analysis of TCR-CD3 Down-regulation—Stably transfected Jurkat cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3 (2 μg/ml) mAb for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then transferred to ice-cold PBS containing 1% BSA and 0,1% NaN3 and washed twice. Collected cells were stained with a phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer. As shown in the formula labeled Equation 1, %CD3expressed=(MFIattimet/MFIofvectorexpressedcellsattime0)×100(Eq. 1) CD3 expression was calculated with gated GFP+ T cells.RESULTSHIP-55 Is Recruited to the T cell-APC Contact Site in Activated T Cells—To investigate HIP-55 involvement in T cell activation, we first studied, using confocal microscopy, its distribution during the formation of conjugates between DO11.10 OVA-specific TCR-transgenic CD4+ T cells and A20 B cells pulsed with the OVA peptide. In the absence of antigen, HIP-55 was homogeneously distributed throughout subcortical regions of the T cell cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Following antigen stimulation, a time-dependent relocalization of HIP-55 was observed, and, at 10 min, a clear enrichment of HIP-55 molecules at the center of the contact area was observed (indicated by the white arrowheads in Fig. 1A). Between 10 and 30 min, HIP-55 was still enriched along the T cell-APC contact region referred to as mature synapse. After 60 min of activation, the cluster of HIP-55 molecules had retracted to a smaller area in the center of the IS.We next compared the localization of HIP-55, CD43, and WASP. CD43 is a transmembrane glycoprotein found at the periphery of the T cell-APC junction (33Delon J. Kaibuchi K. Germain R.N. Immunity. 2001; 15: 691-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), whereas WASP accumulates at the T cell-APC interface (31Cannon J.L. Labno C.M. Bosco G. Seth A. McGavin M.H. Siminovitch K.A. Rosen M.K. Burkhardt J.K. Immunity. 2001; 15: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, these two proteins could be used as markers of different regions of the IS. In the absence of antigen, CD43 was uniformly distributed on the T cell surface, whereas WASP was occasionally seen enriched in the T cell-APC contact site and at the opposite pole of the contact zone. In the presence of antigen, both HIP-55 and WASP re-localized at the center of the contact zone. This clearly contrasted with CD43, which was segregated at the periphery of the IS. When randomly selected conjugates were scored for the presence or absence of HIP-55 at the site of contact, we found that ∼70% of the conjugates formed in the presence of antigen showed HIP-55 accumulation, whereas, in the absence of antigen only, 2-3% of conjugates showed accumulation (Fig. 1C). These results show that HIP-55 is relocalized to the T cell-APC junction in an antigen-dependent manner.HIP-55 Targets the T Cell-APC Contact Site via Its SH3 and ADF-H Domains—We sought to investigate which domains of HIP-55 are important for IS recruitment by using Jurkat cells. U937 monocytic cells armed with Fc receptor-bound anti-CD3 antibodies formed conjugates with Jurkat cells in which endogenous HIP-55 was found to accumulate at the contact site (Fig. 2A), therefore making this experimental system amenable for carrying out structure-function analysis of the HIP-55 molecule. Two GFP-tagged HIP-55 mutants were generated: (i) the ΔADF-H mutant lacking the first 146 amino acids containing the ADF-H domain that binds filamentous actin (F-actin) (19Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 393-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); and (ii) the ΔSH3 mutant lacking the C-terminal SH3 domain that interacts with the proline-rich sequences (Fig. 2B). The subcellular distribution of GFP fusion proteins transiently expressed in Jurkat T cells engaged in anti-CD3-dependent conjugates was then analyzed. In unstimulated cells, GFP-HIP-55 and GFP-ΔADF-H mutant proteins were homogeneously distributed at the plasma membrane, in contrast to the cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution of GFP-ΔSH3 mutant proteins (Fig. 2C). Upon stimulation, whereas the majority of the GFP-HIP-55 proteins redistributed to the central T cell-APC contact zone, the relocalization of both ΔADF-H and ΔSH3 mutant proteins was affected, because a significant proportion of mutant proteins accumulated at the periphery of the T cell-APC contact zone (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that both the SH3 and F-actin binding domains of HIP-55 are required for its targeting to the T cell-APC interface.Fig. 2HIP-55 targets to the T cell-APC contact site via its SH3 and ADF-H domains. A, Jurkat cells were incubated for 10 min in the presence of U937 cells pulsed with an anti-CD3 mAb (+) or untreated (-). Conjugates were then fixed and stained with HIP-55 antibody. U937 cells are shown in red (CMTMR). Arrowheads indicate endogenous HIP-55 accumulation at the contact site. B, schematic structure of the GFP-tagged HIP-55 constructs used here. C, conjugates between Jurkat cells transfected with GFP-tagged HIP-55 constructs and U937 cells were prepared as described for panel A. Cells were mixed for 10 min and fixed, and GFP staining was analyzed by confocal microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HIP-55 Negatively Regulates TCR-induced IL-2 Promoter Activation but Not the Formation of T Cell-APC Conjugates and Actin Polymerization—We asked whether wild-type or mutant HIP-55 proteins could affect the formation of stable T cell-APC conjugates. We adapted a FACS-based assay (32Callewaert D.M. Radcliff G. Waite R. LeFevre J. Poulik M.D. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to measure the ability of Jurkat cells transfected with GFP fusion proteins to form conjugates with U937 cells. Conjugates were formed as described in Fig. 2A and then analyzed by dual flow cytometry. The quantification of these experiments showed that the percentage of control-transfected T cells in conjugates increased 3-7-fold in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb (Fig. 3A). Jurkat cells transfected with ΔADF-H and ΔSH3 mutant proteins formed conjugates with the same efficiency as wild-type HIP-55-transfected Jurkat cells in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb. The only noticeable effect of ΔADF-H and ΔSH3 pr"

Using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled fibronectin degradation assay combined with the phagokinetic cell migration assay, structure-function relationships of MT1-MMP were studied. Our data indicate that MT1-MMP initiates substrate degradation and enhances cell migration; cell migration occurs as a concurrent but independent event. Using recombinant DNA approaches, we demonstrated that the hemopexin-like domain and a nonenzymatic component of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP are essential for MT1-MMP-mediated cell migration. Because the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP was not required for MT1-MMP-mediated fibronectin degradation and cell migration, it is proposed that cross-talk between the hemopexin domain of MT1-MMP and adjacent cell surface molecules is responsible for outside-in signaling. Employing cDNAs encoding dominant negative mutations, we demonstrated that Rac1 participates in the MT1-MMP signal transduction pathway. These data demonstrated that each domain of MT1-MMP plays a distinct role in substrate degradation and cell migration. Substrate degradation and cell migration are key steps in cancer metastasis.

MMPs have been linked to the metastatic phenotype of tumor cells through both correlative and functional studies. Production and activation of MMPs in tumors are required for degradation of the ECM and dissemination of cancer cells to distant organs (2Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Google Scholar). MMPs also play an important role in tumor angiogenesis (6Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 117-137Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation of latent MMP-2 (pMMP-2) in tumors has been the focus of considerable recent interest based on the identification of a new category of intrinsic membrane-type MMPs (MT1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6-MMPs) (7Seiki M. Cancer Lett. 2003; 194: 1-11Google Scholar). MT1-MMP is able to activate pMMP-2 on the surface of tumor cells by assembling a unique triplex with tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and pMMP-2; a second MT1-MMP molecule then cleaves the propeptide of pMMP-2, thereby activating the enzyme at the cell surface (8Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Google Scholar, 9Murphy G.K. Atknison V. Gavrilovic S. Edwards J.D. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 2000; 14: 165-174Google Scholar, 10Zucker S. Drews M. Conner C. Foda H.D. DeClerck Y.A. Langley K.E. Bahou W.F. Docherty A.J. Cao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1216-1222Google Scholar). Integrin receptors, α3β1 and αvβ3, participate in this response (11Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cherish D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Google Scholar). Recombinant MT1-MMP hydrolyze collagen types I, II, and III and digests cartilage proteoglycan, fibronectin, fibrinogen, vitronectin, and laminin (12Ohuchi E. Imai K. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2446-2451Google Scholar). It is now recognized that the actions of MMPs are not restricted to the simple breakdown of ECM, but include revealing the cryptic site on ECM molecules hidden within folded or assembled protein structures (13Kalluri R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 422-433Google Scholar, 14Xu J. Rodriguez D. Petitclerc E. Kim J.J. Hangai M. Moon Y.S. Davis G.E. Brooks P.C. Yuen S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1069-1079Google Scholar); an important aspect of this phenomenon is MMP-conducted cell migration. Recent studies have indicated that MMP-mediated cleavage of laminin 5 (15Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Google Scholar, 16Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Google Scholar) and type IV collagen (14Xu J. Rodriguez D. Petitclerc E. Kim J.J. Hangai M. Moon Y.S. Davis G.E. Brooks P.C. Yuen S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1069-1079Google Scholar) can expose a cryptic epitope that potentiates tumor cell migration. All MMPs have an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a propeptide domain, a catalytic domain, a hinge region, and a hemopexin-like (PEX) domain (17Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Google Scholar). MT1-MMP is unique from secretory MMPs because of addition of transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains (8Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Google Scholar). This feature helps explain how MT1-MMP behavior differs from soluble MMPs (18Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Google Scholar). An important function of the PEX domain of MT1-MMP involves the formation of a homophilic complex that associates two MT1-MMPs together for the activation of pMMP-2 (19Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Google Scholar). Other structure-function relationships of MT1-MMP involved in cell migration and invasion remain to be defined. In the current study, we examined the domain functions of MT1-MMP in substrate degradation and cell migration by employing mutations and exploring signal pathways in MT1-MMP-induced cell migration. Our data demonstrated that the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP is primarily required for enzymatic activity toward ECM substrates, whereas the PEX domain and a component of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP are essential for MT1-MMP-induced cell migration. Reagents—Human fibronectin and oligo primers were purchased from Invitrogen. FITC was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). The pcDNA3 and pSG5 expression vectors were described previously (20Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Google Scholar). Recombinant pMMP-2 was produced by COS-1 cells transfected with pMMP-2 cDNA as previously described (20Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Google Scholar). Anti-human MMP-2 (hemopexin domain), TIMP-2, and MT1-MMP (catalytic domain, clone 114) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Anti-human MMP-2 antibody (recognized N-terminal region of active form) was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (AB808, Temecula, CA). T7 and c-Myc monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI) and Roche Diagnostics (Nutley, NY), respectively. Anti-MT1-MMP (hinge region) polyclonal antibody used for immunofluorescent staining was purchased from Triple Point Biologics (Portland, OR). Anti-Rac1 antibody (clone 102) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1, NIH3T3, human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, and human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Plasmids were transfected into cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected LNCaP and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were generated using FuGENE 6 followed by isolation of single colonies after 4 weeks of G418 selection. Construction of Plasmids—Expression vectors including MT1-MMP, TIMP-1, -2, pMMP-2, and soluble MT1-MMP (sol.MT1) without transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains have been described in detail previously (18Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Google Scholar, 21Zucker S. Conner C. DiMassmo B.I. Ende H. Drews M. Seiki M. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23730-23738Google Scholar, 22Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Google Scholar). MTΔC lacking the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP was generated by introducing a stop codon after Phe562 based on a PCR strategy using the primer sets: forward primer, number 1563: 5′-3′: CACGAATTCCGGACCATGTCTCCCGCCCCAAGA and reverse primer, number 1929: 5′-3′: AAGAATTCTCAGAAGAAGAAGACTGCAAG. The PCR fragments were then cloned into pSG5 vector. To generate the Sol.MT1-IL2RTM chimera, a PCR fragment encoding soluble MT1-MMP cDNA and a transmembrane domain of interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) using forward primer 1563 and reverse primer 1105, 5′-3′: AAAGATCTTCAGGTGAGCCCACTCAGGAGGAG, with Sol.MT-IL2RTM/Cyto as a template (22Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Google Scholar) was amplified followed by subcloning in pSG5 vector. To ensure co-expression of MT1-MMP with the dominant negative dynamin mutation, K44A (kindly provided by Dr. S. Schmid, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) in the same cell, we constructed a DNA plasmid, in which MT1-MMP and K44A cDNAs were inserted in the same vector controlled by two individual cytomegalovirus promoters. The basic vector for this construct was derived from our previous construct, EMMPRIN/GFP (23Zucker S. Hymowitz M. Rollo E.E. Mann R. Conner C.E. Cao J. Foda H.D. Tompkins D.C. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1921-1928Google Scholar). A shuttle vector was first constructed by substitution of EMMPRIN cDNA from EMMPRIN/GFP cDNA with MT1-MMP cDNA at the EcoRI cloning site (designated MT1/GFP). Subsequently, green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA from MT1/GFP cDNA was replaced by the hemagglutinin-tagged K44A cDNA to generate MT1/K44A plasmids. For MT1-MMP-GFP chimeric cDNA (MT1-GFP), a stop codon from MT1-MMP was removed by PCR-based technology and the resultant PCR fragment was cloned into pcDNA3 at EcoRI and NotI sites. GFP cDNA from pEGFP 1 plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was then subcloned at the NotI site followed by adjusting GFP cDNA into the MT1-MMP frame with 11 additional amino acids (AAAGIHRPVAT) added between MT1-MMP and GFP. To construct a constitutively inactive MT1-MMP-GFP fusion protein (MT1E240A-GFP), glutamic acid (Glu240) of MT1-MMP was converted to alanine by a PCR amplification using wild-type MT1-MMP as a template with mutagenesis primers (forward 5′-3′: GTGGCTGTGCACGCGCTGGGCCATGCC and reverse primer 5′-3′: GGCATGGCCCAGCGCGTGCACAGCCAC) (bold letters represent mutation site) (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) to generate MT1E240A. A EcoRI-XhoI fragment converting Glu240 to alanine from MT1E240A and a XhoI fragment from MT1-GFP chimeric cDNA was sequentially subcloned into pcDNA3 to generate the MT1E240A-GFP chimera. To generate a substitute mutation by replacing the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP with that of pMMP-2 named MT1-MMP2CAT, a modified two-step PCR was employed as previously described (18Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Google Scholar). In brief, MT1-MMP signal peptide/propeptide domains (fragment A) (primer sets: forward primer 1563 and reverse primer 1092, 5′-3′: GCGAGGGAAGAAGTTGTAGCGCTTCCTTCGAACATTGG), pMMP-2 catalytic domain (fragment B) (primer sets: forward primer 2139, 5′-3′: TACAACTTCTTCCCTCGCAAG, and reverse primer 1093, 5′-3′: CCCATAGAGCTCCTGAATGCCCTT), and the rest of MT1-MMP including the hinge region, PEX domain, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (fragment C) (primer sets: forward primer 1094, 5′-3′: GGCATTCAGGAGCTCTATGGGGGTGAGTCAGGGTTCCCCACCAA, and reverse primer 1564, 5′-3′: CACGAATTCTCAGACCTTGTCCAGCAGGGAAC) were first amplified by PCR separately. Using resultant PCR products as templates (fragments A and B), the signal/propeptide domains of MT1-MMP and the catalytic domain of pMMP-2 were then fused together by PCR using forward primer 1563 and reverse primer 1093. A final PCR fragment encoding MT1-MMP2CAT was amplified using the fused MT1-MMP2CAT fragment and fragment C as templates with forward primer 1563 and reverse primer 1564 followed by subcloning the entire cDNA into the pcDNA3 vector. Similarly, MT1-MMP2CAT-PEX and MT1-MMP2PEX were engineered (Fig. 5A). All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing using ABI Prism BigDye Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). FITC-Substrate Degradation Assay—To examine the invasive ability of cells on fibronectin or gelatin, the substrate proteins were conjugated with FITC in borate-buffered saline (pH 10) for 30 min at room temperature. After extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), FITC-labeled substrate was coated on glass coverslips by incubation with glutaraldehyde cross-linked gelatin for 1 h at room temperature (24Chen W.T. Yeh Y.Y. Nakahara H. J. Tissue Culture Methods. 1994; 16: 177-181Google Scholar). Transfected cells were then replated onto FITC-labeled substrate for an 18-h culture. The cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and observed under fluorescent microscopy (Olympus, IX-70). The spent conditioned medium was collected and examined for the presence of degraded FITC-labeled substrate (FLEXStation, Molecule Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with 488 and 507 nm wavelengths for excitation and emission, respectively. Immunofluorescent Staining—Cells transfected with various cDNA constructs were grown on glass coverslips coated with 50 μg/ml l-lysine or FITC-labeled substrate for 18 h under normal culture conditions. 4% Paraformaldehyde/PBS fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies for wild-type and mutant MT1-MMP (polyclonal antibody against hinge region of MT1-MMP, 0.5 μg/ml in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS), for MT1-MMP2PEX, MT1-MMP2CAT-PEX chimera (monoclonal antibody against hemopexin domain of MMP-2, 0.2 μg/ml in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS), or TIMP-2 (0.2 μg/ml in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS) at room temperature for 2 h followed by detecting with the secondary antibodies either fluorescein- or Texas Red-conjugated IgG (1:1500 dilution, Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). After extensive washes, the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with anti-fading medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). The samples were examined and photographed with an Olympus fluorescent microscope. Phagokinetic Migration Assay—The phagokinetic migration assay (25Albrecht-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 11: 395-404Google Scholar) has been widely used to evaluate cell migratory ability. Coverslips treated with l-lysine (50 μg/ml) were coated with 0.5% gelatin for 1 h at room temperature followed by air drying. The coverslips placed in 12-well plates were incubated with freshly made colloidal gold particles for 40 min followed by washing with sterile PBS. Cells (1 × 104/well) were replated onto colloidal gold particle-coated coverslips for 18 h followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Migratory cells were observed and photographed under light microscopy (Olympus). For a combination study between the phagokinetic assay and the FITC-substrate degradation assay (FITC-substrate degradation/phagokinetic migration assay), coverslips were sequentially coated with FITC-labeled fibronectin or gelatin and colloidal gold particles. Substrate degradation and cell migration were determined under fluorescent and light microscopy. Determination of Rac Activity—Rac activity was measured in a pull-down assay using the Rac-binding domain of p21-activated kinase fused to glutathione S-transferase (26Sander E.E. van Delft S. Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells transfected with both wild-type Rac1-GFP chimera and MT1-MMP or mock control cDNAs were incubated in serum-free conditioned medium for 18 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm MgCl2, plus protease mixture inhibitors). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 2 min, samples were withdrawn for analysis of total Rac, and the remaining lysate was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 20 μg of a 50% slurry of glutathione S-transferase-p21-activated kinase fusion protein on glutathione-coupled agarose beads (kindly provided by Prof. X. D. Ren, SUNY at Stony Brook). Beads were then washed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using mouse anti-Rac1 antibody. Procedures for Gelatin Substrate Zymography, Immunoprecipitation, Preparation of Cell Lysates, and Western Blotting—Basic protocols for these techniques have been described in our previous paper (20Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Google Scholar). Initiation of Substrate Degradation and Cell Migration by Cells Expressing MT1-MMP—To examine the contribution of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 to substrate degradation and cell migration, an assay was employed that allowed evaluation of substrate degradation (demonstrated by loss of fluorescence of FITC-labeled substrate) and cell migration (determined based on a track of digested substrate) in the same slide by plating transfected cells onto FITC-labeled fibronectin (27Pavlaki M. Cao J. Hymowitz M. Chen W.T. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2740-2749Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were used as recipient cells in this study because of lack of detectable MT1-MMP and high expression of transfected foreign genes (18Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were co-transfected with both MT1-MMP and pMMP-2 cDNAs along with their inhibitors, TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 cDNAs, respectively. The MT1-MMP producing cells detected by immunocytochemistry using anti-MT1-MMP antibody (Fig. 1, A, a1, b1, c1, and d1) readily degraded FITC-fibronectin and migrated over digested fibronectin leaving a pine-twig track as a fingerprint (Fig. 1A, a). The intensity of digestion of fibronectin was dramatically increased by co-transfection of MT1-MMP with pMMP-2 cDNAs in COS-1 cells (Fig. 1A, b), but was limited in area to the cell migration track. COS-1 cells transfected with pMMP-2 cDNA alone were not able to initiate substrate degradation and cell migration (data not shown). This data suggests that only cell surface active MMP-2 (aMMP-2) bound to MT1-MMP enhanced substrate digestion. Cells co-transfected with TIMP-1 cDNA along with MT1-MMP and pMMP-2 cDNAs resulted in partial inhibition of substrate degradation (down to the basal digestion level resulting from MT1-MMP alone) induced by the cells producing both MT1-MMP and MMP-2, but did not interfere with cell migration (Fig. 1A, c). In contrast, overexpression of TIMP-2 in transfected cells expressing both MT1-MMP and pMMP-2 (as evidenced by immunofluorescent staining for both MT1-MMP and TIMP-2) (Fig. 1A, d and d1) totally abolished substrate degradation by transfected COS-1 cells. The independent effect of TIMP-2 on MT1-MMP-induced cell migration, however, could not be determined in this assay because of lack of indicator (substrate degradation, see Fig. 3A). Consistent with the loss of FITC-fibronectin, the release of degraded FITC-fibronectin in the conditioned medium from each group was matched to that of coverslips by analyzing solubilized fluorescent-labeled fibronectin (Fig. 1B).Fig. 3No effect on MT1-MMP-induced cell migration by impairment of enzymatic activity. A, TIMP-2 does not interfere with MT1-MMP-induced cell migration: COS-1 cells expressing MT1-GFP chimera were plated onto colloidal gold-coated FITC-labeled fibronectin coverslips in the presence of recombinant TIMP-2 (10 nm) for 18 h in serum-free conditioned medium at 37 °C. The transfected cells were identified based on GFP expression as indicated by arrows. TIMP-2 abolished FITC-fibronectin degradation (b), but not cell migration (b1). B, constitutively inactive MT1-MMP (MTE240A)-transfected cells retain enhanced cell migration: COS-1 cells transfected with MT1-GFP or MTE240A-GFP were plated onto colloidal gold particle-coated coverslips for 18 h at 37 °C. Cell migration was determined based on the cleared gold particle track. The defect of enzymatic function of MT1-MMP by converting glutamic acid (Glu) 240 in the catalytic center to alanine (Ala) does not interfere with MT1-MMP-induced cell migration. C, converting Glu240 of MT1-MMP to Ala impaired MT1-MMP enzymatic activity: COS-1 cells transfected with MT1-GFP or MTE240A-GFP were plated onto FITC-labeled fibronectin-coated coverslips for 18 h at 37 °C followed by examination under fluorescent microscopy. Cells expressing MT1E240A failed to digest fibronectin substrate (absence of fibronectin invasion track).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because transiently transfected COS-1 cells may result in high expression of foreign genes, it raised a question if the substrate degradation and the cell migration in COS-1 cells transfected with MT1-MMP cDNA were because of unusually high expression of the enzyme in the cells. To test this possibility, stable cell lines expressing MT1-GFP chimera in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and MT1-MMP in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 were examined using the FITC-substrate degradation assay. In agreement with the data obtained from COS-1 cells, LNCaP and MDA-MB-231 stable cells expressing MT1-MMP were able to digest FITC-labeled fibronectin and migrate over digested substrate (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, overexpression of MT1-GFP in COS-1 cells demonstrated that most of the MT1-GFP chimera was mainly distributed in the perinuclear region. The relative proportion of MT1-GFP expressed at the plasma membrane was considerably less than the perinuclear region; this observation was confirmed by cell surface biotinylation followed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The role of cell surface proteinases was further supported by interfering with MT1-MMP endocytosis in COS-1 cells transfected with a plasmid containing both MT1-MMP cDNA and a dominant negative dynamin mutation, K44A cDNA, controlled by a separate cytomegalovirus promoter (MT1/K44A, Fig. 2A). Increased MT1-MMP staining at the cell surface (employing an anti-MT1-MMP Ab) was found in cells expressing both MT1-MMP and K44A, indicating that MT1-MMP internalization occurs, in part, through clathrin-coated vesicles (Fig. 2B) (28Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Google Scholar, 29Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Google Scholar). Blocking endocytic machinery of MT1-MMP expressing COS-1 cells by overexpression of a dynamin mutation (K44A) resulted in ∼70% of the FITC-labeled substrate degradation as compared with ∼10% FITC-fibronectin digestion in COS-1 cells expressing MT1-MMP alone (Fig. 2C). This effect was not observed in K44A or dynamin cDNA-transfected control cells (lacking MT1-MMP cDNA) as examined by the FITC-substrate degradation/phagokinetic migration assay (data not shown). Because the number of transfected cells was the same (phase-contrast image, Fig. 2C, a1 and b1), it is concluded that the increased substrate degradation by MT1/K44A expressing cells was contributed by enhanced cell migration resulting from the accumulation of MT1-MMP at the plasma membrane. Migration of Cells Expressing MT1-MMP Is Independent of Substrate Degradation—In the FITC-substrate degradation assay employed in this study, determination of cell migration is dependent on the loss of FITC-labeled fibronectin. This raises the question whether blockage of enzymatic activity of MT1-MMP in cells by TIMP-2 results in abrogation of cell migration (Fig. 1A, d). To clarify this issue, we examined cell migration on coverslips coated with both colloidal gold particles (25Albrecht-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 11: 395-404Google Scholar) and FITC-labeled fibronectin (FITC-substrate degradation/phagokinetic migration assay). To directly visualize the interfering effect of TIMP-2 on MT1-MMP-induced cell migration, we took advantage of a fluorescent marker gene encoding GFP that was mechanically fused to the 3′-end of MT1-MMP cDNA to generate MT1-GFP chimeric cDNA. The MT1-GFP fusion protein, expressed as the anticipated ∼90-kDa protein (Western blot analysis), was able to activate pMMP-2 and was visualized on the surface of the transfected COS-1 cells (data not shown). COS-1 cells transfected with MT1-GFP cDNA were plated onto colloidal gold-coated FITC-labeled fibronectin coverslips and cultured in serum-free conditioned medium with or without recombinant TIMP-2 (10 nm). In the absence of TIMP-2, MT1-GFP expressing cells were capable of degrading FITC-fibronectin (Fig. 3A, a). The migration of MT1-GFP expressing cells was confirmed in the phagokinetic migration assay based on the cleared gold particle track in the observed field (Fig. 3A, a1). As expected, TIMP-2 interfered with substrate degradation of MT1-GFP expressing cells (Fig. 3A, b). Surprisingly, the migration of these cells in the presence of TIMP-2 was not altered as demonstrated by the unimpaired cleared gold particle track (Fig. 3A, b1). This observation was further confirmed by generating GFP-tagged, constitutively inactive MT1-MMP by converting glutamic acid 240 (Glu240) in the catalytic center to alanine, designated as MT1E240A-GFP. MT1E240A-GFP was expressed on the transfected cell surface (Fig. 3B, b), but failed to activate pMMP-2 as examined by gelatin zymography (data not shown). Because this mutation disrupted catalytic activity, MT1E240A-GFP expressing cells were not able to degrade the fibronectin substrate (Fig. 3C, b). However, MT1E240A-GFP expressing cells exhibited unimpaired enhanced cell migration as examined by the phagokinetic migration assay (Fig. 3B, b1). Taken together, these data demonstrated for the first time that the enzymatic function of MT1-MMP is not required for MT1-MMP-induced enhancement of cell migration but is required for substrate degradation. The Role of Transmembrane and Cytoplasmic Domains of MT1-MMP in Substrate Degradation and Cell Migration—MTMMPs are unique among other MMPs because of their plasma membrane anchor. MT1-MMP also possesses a short cytoplasmic tail that might play a critical role in outside-in signals for MT1-MMP-induced cell migration. To further define the role of the TM and cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP in substrate degradation and cell migration, we next examined the structure-function relationships of MT1-MMP. To this end, deletion and fusion mutants were generated by employing a two-step PCR (18Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Google Scholar). The TM and cytoplasmic domains of MT1-MMP were individually deleted to generate Sol.MT (22Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Google Scholar) and MTΔC, respectively (Fig. 4A). These mutants were expressed by transfection of COS-1 cells with corresponding cDNAs; wild-type and mutant MT1-MMP protein expres"
https://openalex.org/W2021781936,"Eph receptors and their cognate ligands ephrins are important players in axon guidance and neural patterning during development of the nervous system. Much of our knowledge about the signal transduction pathways triggered by Eph receptors has been related to the modulation of actin cytoskeleton, which is fundamental in mediating the cellular responses in growth cone navigation, cell adhesion, and cell migration. In contrast, little was known about whether long term activation of Eph receptor would regulate gene expression. Here we report a novel signaling pathway of EphA4, which involves activation of the tyrosine kinase Jak2 and the transcriptional activator Stat3. Transfection of COS7 cells with EphA4, but not the kinase-dead mutant, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, Stat1, and Stat3. Treatment of cultured C2C12 myotubes with ephrin-A1 also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3, which was abolished by the Jak2 inhibitor AG490. Moreover, Jak2 was co-immunoprecipitated with EphA4 in muscle, and both proteins were concentrated at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of adult muscle. By using microarray analysis, we have identified acetylcholinesterase, the critical enzyme that hydrolyzed the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the NMJ, as a downstream target gene of the Jak/Stat pathway in muscle. More importantly, ephrin-A1 increased the expression of acetylcholinesterase protein in C2C12 myotubes, which was abolished by AG490. In contrast, ephrin-A1 reduced the expression of fibronectin mRNA in C2C12 myotubes independently of Jak2. Finally, the expression level of acetylcholinesterase in limb muscle of EphA4 null mice was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type control. Taken together, these results have identified Jak/Stat proteins as the novel downstream targets of EphA4 signaling. In addition, the present study provides the first demonstration of a potential function of Eph receptors and Jak/Stat proteins at the NMJ. Eph receptors and their cognate ligands ephrins are important players in axon guidance and neural patterning during development of the nervous system. Much of our knowledge about the signal transduction pathways triggered by Eph receptors has been related to the modulation of actin cytoskeleton, which is fundamental in mediating the cellular responses in growth cone navigation, cell adhesion, and cell migration. In contrast, little was known about whether long term activation of Eph receptor would regulate gene expression. Here we report a novel signaling pathway of EphA4, which involves activation of the tyrosine kinase Jak2 and the transcriptional activator Stat3. Transfection of COS7 cells with EphA4, but not the kinase-dead mutant, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, Stat1, and Stat3. Treatment of cultured C2C12 myotubes with ephrin-A1 also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3, which was abolished by the Jak2 inhibitor AG490. Moreover, Jak2 was co-immunoprecipitated with EphA4 in muscle, and both proteins were concentrated at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of adult muscle. By using microarray analysis, we have identified acetylcholinesterase, the critical enzyme that hydrolyzed the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the NMJ, as a downstream target gene of the Jak/Stat pathway in muscle. More importantly, ephrin-A1 increased the expression of acetylcholinesterase protein in C2C12 myotubes, which was abolished by AG490. In contrast, ephrin-A1 reduced the expression of fibronectin mRNA in C2C12 myotubes independently of Jak2. Finally, the expression level of acetylcholinesterase in limb muscle of EphA4 null mice was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type control. Taken together, these results have identified Jak/Stat proteins as the novel downstream targets of EphA4 signaling. In addition, the present study provides the first demonstration of a potential function of Eph receptors and Jak/Stat proteins at the NMJ. Eph receptors, the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), 1The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; NMJ, neuromuscular junction; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; CBD2, cytokine-binding domain 2; JH, Jak homology; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AChR, acetylcholine receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; SH, Src homology; Stat, signal transducers and activators of transcription; Jak, Janus kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; NMJ, neuromuscular junction; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; CBD2, cytokine-binding domain 2; JH, Jak homology; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AChR, acetylcholine receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; SH, Src homology; Stat, signal transducers and activators of transcription; Jak, Janus kinase. and their cognate ligands, ephrins, play critical roles in diverse processes in both developing and mature nervous system. Initial studies mainly focused on the roles of ephrins as a repulsive primary messenger in axon guidance, topographic mapping, and neural patterning during early development of the nervous system (1Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Google Scholar, 2Wilkinson D.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 155-164Google Scholar). More recent studies revealed the unexpected functions of Eph receptors in synapse formation and synaptic plasticity (3Gerlai R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 205-209Google Scholar, 4Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. Neuron. 2002; 33: 159-162Google Scholar, 5Lai K.O. Ip N.Y. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 395-402Google Scholar). Outside the nervous system, Eph receptors are also involved in the regulation of fluid homeostasis and vascular development (6Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Google Scholar). The biological functions of Eph receptors are therefore quite different from most other RTKs, which are involved in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. This can be attributed to the unusual properties of the ephrin ligands, as well as the unique bi-directional signaling of the ephrins/Eph receptors. Unlike the ligands of conventional RTK, ephrins are membrane-bound proteins. Eight ephrins have been identified in mammals, which are classified into A and B subclasses based on their modes of membrane anchorage. The ephrin-A ligands (ephrin-A1 to A5) are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, whereas the ephrin-B ligands (ephrin-B1 to B3) anchor to the membrane via a transmembrane domain. Receptor specificity has been reported for the ephrin/Eph interactions, such that the A class ephrins activate the EphA receptors, whereas the ephrin-B ligands activate EphB receptors, with the notable exception of EphA4 (7Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E. Henkemeyer M. Strebhardt K. Hirai H. Wilkinson D.G. Pawson T. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1996; 17: 9-19Google Scholar). The membrane anchorage of ephrins is essential for the activation of Eph receptors, which can be mimicked by artificial clustering of tagged soluble ephrins (8Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Google Scholar). In addition, the surface density of ephrins can determine the resulting signaling pathways and cellular responses (9Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D. Van Etten R.L. Daniel T.O. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Google Scholar). Unlike most RTK, activation of Eph receptors does not lead to cell proliferation (10Lhotak V. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7071-7079Google Scholar, 11Brambilla R. Schnapp A. Casagranda F. Labrador J.P. Bergemann A.D. Flanagan J.G. Pasquale E.B. Klein R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3116-3126Google Scholar), suggesting that Eph receptors trigger distinct signaling pathways when activated by their ligands. In addition, upon binding to the Eph receptors, both the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked and transmembrane ephrins are capable of transducing intracellular signals to elicit biological responses (12Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 339-346Google Scholar). Rapid advances have been made in recent years in elucidating the bi-directional signal transduction of ephrins and Eph receptors (6Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Google Scholar, 13Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2823-2832Google Scholar). The Rho family of GTPases, for example, has been identified to link the Eph receptor signaling to the re-organization of actin cytoskeleton. Ephrin-A1 induces the ephexin-mediated exchange of GDP to GTP on Rho, resulting in the activation of RhoA and Rho kinase. On the other hand, activation of EphA receptors inhibits Rac/Cdc42 and the downstream effector p21-activated kinase (14Shamah S.M. Lin M.Z. Goldberg J.L. Estrach S. Sahin M. Hu L. Bazalakova M. Neve R.L. Corfas G. Debant A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 2001; 105: 233-244Google Scholar, 15Wahl S. Barth H. Ciossek T. Aktories K. Mueller B.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 263-270Google Scholar). Together, these lead to the initiation of growth cone collapse. Other guanine nucleotide exchange factors are also associated with EphB receptors, and they have been implicated as crucial downstream mediators of EphB signaling in dendritic spine morphogenesis (16Irie F. Yamaguchi Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1117-1118Google Scholar, 17Penzes P. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 2003; 37: 263-274Google Scholar). Besides the Rho family of GTPases, activation of Eph receptors also regulates the activity of other kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (18Gu C. Park S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4579-4597Google Scholar) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (19Stein E. Huynh-Do U. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1303-1308Google Scholar, 20Elowe S. Holland S.J. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7429-7441Google Scholar, 21Miao H. Wei B.R. Peehl D.M. Li Q. Alexandrou T. Schelling J.R. Rhim J.S. Sedor J.R. Burnett E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 527-530Google Scholar, 22Pratt R.L. Kinch M.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7690-7699Google Scholar, 23Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Google Scholar). In addition, several non-receptor tyrosine kinases have been implicated as downstream mediators of Eph receptor signaling. The tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a critical component of the integrin signaling pathway, is modulated after activation of EphA receptors (24Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Google Scholar, 25Carter N. Nakamoto T. Hirai H. Hunter T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 565-573Google Scholar). Various members of the Src family kinases have also been shown to interact with activated Eph receptors through the SH2 domain (26Ellis C. Kasmi F. Ganju P. Walls E. Panayotou G. Reith A.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1727-1736Google Scholar, 27Zisch A.H. Kalo M.S. Chong L.D. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2657-2670Google Scholar, 28Choi S. Park S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5413-5422Google Scholar). Moreover, Src is critical in the EphB2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor in cortical neurons (29Takasu M.A. Dalva M.B. Zigmond R.E. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 491-495Google Scholar), as well as the activation of ERK in response to EphB1 signaling (23Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Google Scholar). Finally, the tyrosine kinases Abl and Arg can interact with activated EphB2, and the kinase activity of Abl decreases upon treatment with ephrin-B1 (30Yu H.H. Zisch A.H. Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3995-4006Google Scholar). The downstream targets of Abl and Arg in the Eph signaling pathway remain to be elucidated. Virtually all studies on the signaling mechanisms of Eph receptors focus on the potential link to actin dynamics, which is crucial in cellular responses such as growth cone collapse, cell adhesion, and cell migration. Much less is known about whether Eph signaling can regulate gene expression. It is unlikely that gene transcription is involved in some of the ephrin-mediated responses such as growth cone collapse, which happens within minutes. However, recent findings that Eph receptors are involved in synapse formation and synaptic plasticity have raised the possibility that long term activation of Eph receptors may produce long lasting effects. For example, long term infusion of ephrin-A5-IgG or EphA5-IgG into the hippocampus, which affects the learning behavior of mice, regulates the transcript level of tubulin and microtubule-associated protein-2 (31Gerlai R. Shinsky N. Shih A. Williams P. Winer J. Armanini M. Cairns B. Winslow J. Gao W. Phillips H.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9538-9549Google Scholar). Furthermore, the long lasting form of long term potentiation, which depends on protein synthesis and is thought to involve structural remodeling at the synapses, is impaired in mice lacking EphB2 (32Grunwald I.C. Korte M. Wolfer D. Wilkinson G.A. Unsicker K. Lipp H.P. Bonhoeffer T. Klein R. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1027-1040Google Scholar). Finally, ephrin-B2 can enhance the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-dependent gene transcription in cultured neurons, which may be important in the development and remodeling of neuronal synapses (29Takasu M.A. Dalva M.B. Zigmond R.E. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 491-495Google Scholar). These studies therefore suggest that regulation of gene transcription may represent an important mechanism underlying long term responses to ephrins, particularly at the synapses. In the present study, the possibility of regulating gene expression by ephrin/Eph signaling and the underlying mechanism were explored. Here we report that activation of EphA4 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulators Stat1 and Stat3, which belong to the signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) family. The tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Jak2, which is constitutively associated with EphA4. Consistent with our previous findings that EphA4 is concentrated at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (33Lai K.O. Ip F.C. Cheung J. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 1034-1047Google Scholar), both Jak2 and Stat proteins are also localized at the NMJ of adult muscle. Finally, we have identified acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as a target gene of the Jak/Stat pathway in muscle, and ephrin-A1 increases the expression of AChE protein in cultured myotubes in a Jak2-dependent manner. Antibodies and Reagents—The antibodies against tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1, Stat3, Tyk2, FAK, and threonine/tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK-1/2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Inc., and the antibody against tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak2 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognized Stat1 (sc-346), Stat3 (sc-7179), Jak2 (sc-278), and EphA4 (sc-921) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the monoclonal antibodies that recognized AChE and the α-isoform of Stat1 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. The anti-EphA4 antibody that was used for Western blotting in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments was a kind gift from Dr. David Wilkinson (National Institute for Medical Research, UK). The Fctagged ephrin-A1 recombinant chimeric protein was purchased from R&D Systems, and the Fc fragment of human IgG and the anti-Fc antibody were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. The Jak2 inhibitor AG490 was purchased from Calbiochem. The EphA4 null mice were kindly provided by Dr. Perry Bartlett (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Australia). The expression constructs of EphA4 and kinase-dead EphA4 were subcloned into the expression vector pMT21 as described previously (33Lai K.O. Ip F.C. Cheung J. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 1034-1047Google Scholar). The luciferase construct that was linked to the Stat1-responsive enhancer (pGAS-Luc) was a kind gift by Dr. Zilong Wen (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore). The full-length construct of AChE was kindly provided by Dr. Karl Tsim (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology). Transfection, Western Blot Analysis, and Luciferase Assay—COS7 cells (1.5 × 106) were plated onto a 100-mm culture dish in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected the next day by 16 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 6 h before being lysed by RIPA at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysate was then analyzed in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted by antibodies against phospho-Stat1, phospho-Stat3, phospho-Jak2, and phospho-Tyk2. To examine the role of Jak2, the transfected cells were serum-starved in the presence of Me2SO or AG490 at various concentrations. For luciferase assay, COS7 cells (5 × 105) were plated on a 60-mm dish and co-transfected the next day by pGAS-Luc and EphA4, EphA4KD, or empty vector in a ratio of 1:9. pRL-CMV (25 ng), which encoded the Renilla luciferase, was included in the transfection mix for normalization. Two days after transfection, the cells were serum-starved overnight and lysed by the Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). The luciferase activity was measured by the Dual Luciferase Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down—Transfected COS7 cells were lysed by Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF) that contained 0.5% Nonidet P-40 plus 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The cell lysate (500 μg) was then incubated with anti-Jak2 or anti-EphA4 (sc-921) antibodies (2 μg) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Likewise, cortical neurons that were cultured for 15 days were lysed by the same Tris buffer that contained 0.1% Nonidet P-40 plus all the protease inhibitors, and the lysate (800 μg) was subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-Jak2 or anti-EphA4 antibodies (3 μg). To examine the interaction between EphA4 and Jak2 in vivo, frozen brain or muscle tissues were homogenized in the Tris lysis buffer (without Nonidet P-40) plus all the protease inhibitors. To obtain the membrane fraction, the samples were then centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 1 h, and the pellet was solubilized with the homogenization buffer that contained all the protease inhibitors plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40. For coimmunoprecipitation, the membrane fraction (1.5 mg) was incubated overnight with anti-EphA4 or anti-Jak2 antibodies (4 μg) at 4 °C. For the pull-down assay, the N- and C-terminal halves of Jak2, which contained JH domains 3–7 and JH domains 1–3, respectively (34Harpur A.G. Andres A.C. Ziemiecki A. Aston R.R. Wilks A.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1347-1353Google Scholar), were amplified from the full-length construct of Jak2 (a gift from Dr. Zilong Wen) by Vent polymerase and subcloned into the GST vector. The GST-tagged cytokine-binding domain 2 (CBD2) of LIF receptor (35He W. Gong K. Zhu G. Smith D.K. Ip N.Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 214-218Google Scholar) was used as a negative control. The GST fusion proteins were purified and incubated with glutathione beads for 1 h (1 μg of protein/10 μl of beads per reaction). The immobilized protein was then incubated with lysate of COS7 cells (100 μg) transfected with EphA4 for 1 h. Beads were washed six times by phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the proteins were eluted by 2× SDS sample buffer (20 μl). Treatment of C2C12 Myotubes with Ephrin-A1—The muscle cell line C2C12 was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and was differentiated into myotubes in 60-mm plates by culturing in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum for 3 days. The Fc fragment of IgG (negative control) or ephrin-A1-Fc recombinant protein (200 μg/ml) was pre-clustered in phosphate-buffered saline by anti-Fc antibody in a ratio (w/w) of 10:1 at room temperature for 2 h. To examine the induction of Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation, the myotubes were serum-starved for 6–8 h prior to treatment with ephrin-A1. They were then aspirated and treated with pre-clustered Fc or ephrin-A1-Fc, which was diluted in DMEM to 2 μg/ml. To examine the role of Jak2, the C2C12 myotubes were starved for 6 h in the presence of Me2SO or AG490 (75 μm) before the addition of Fc or ephrin-A1-Fc. To study the regulation of AChE protein level by ephrin-A1, C2C12 myotubes were pre-incubated with Me2SO or AG490 (75 μm) for 3 h. The cells were then treated with pre-clustered Fc or ephrin-A1-Fc in the presence of Me2SO or AG490 for 24 h, after which the cells were lysed by RIPA for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein samples (12 μg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted by antibody against AChE (1:8000). The membrane was then stripped and re-blotted with antibody against ERK-1/2 (Cell Signaling Inc.), and the intensities of the bands corresponding to AChE and ERK-2 were quantified by Photoshop 7.0. Immunohistochemistry, Microarray Analysis, RNA Extraction, and Northern Hybridization—Gastrocnemius muscle sections from adult rat were immunostained using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Stat1 (1:300), Jak2 (1:100), or Stat3 (1:100) as described previously (33Lai K.O. Ip F.C. Cheung J. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 1034-1047Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of staining, the antibody was pre-incubated at 4 °C overnight with an equivalent amount of the peptide against which the antibody was raised. To test the effect of AG490 in regulating gene expression, C2C12 myotubes that were differentiated for 3 days were treated with Me2SO or AG490 (75 μm) for 48 h, and total RNA was extracted by the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by formaldehyde RNA gel as described previously (36Ip F.C. Fu A.K. Tsim K.W. Ip N.Y. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1607-1612Google Scholar). An equal amount of total RNA (15 μg) was then reverse-transcribed to cDNA and hybridized with microarray chip (Affymetrix chip set 230). Of the 6256 genes that were expressed in C2C12 myotubes, 186 genes were identified to be down-regulated in the presence of AG490 by 2-fold or more. To confirm the regulation of AChE transcript, differentiated C2C12 myotubes were treated with Me2SO, AG490 (75 μm), Fc, or ephrin-A1 (2 μg/ml) for 24 h, and total RNA was extracted by the guanidinium thiocyanate method as described previously (36Ip F.C. Fu A.K. Tsim K.W. Ip N.Y. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1607-1612Google Scholar). Total RNA was analyzed by formaldehyde RNA gel, and Northern hybridization against cDNA probes corresponding to full-length AChE and partial sequence of fibronectin or tropomyosin (37Fu A.K. Cheung W.M. Ip F.C. Ip N.Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 241-253Google Scholar) was performed as described previously (36Ip F.C. Fu A.K. Tsim K.W. Ip N.Y. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1607-1612Google Scholar). Analysis of AChE Expression in EphA4 Null Mice—Wild-type, heterozygous, or homozygous null mice were genotyped as described (38Coonan J.R. Greferath U. Messenger J. Hartley L. Murphy M. Boyd A.W. Dottori M. Galea M.P. Bartlett P.F. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 436: 248-262Google Scholar). Hindlimb muscle from EphA4–/– mice and their wild-type littermates at postnatal day 14 were homogenized, and the cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared as described above. The difference in AChE expression was consistently observed in two different pairs of wild-type and EphA4 null mice, and the representative result was shown. In addition, to eliminate the possible variation arising from different muscles, AChE expression was also compared between the gastrocnemius muscle from two different pairs of wild-type and EphA4 null mice originated from two distinct litters, and similar down-regulation of AChE protein level in EphA4 null mice was observed (data not shown). Activation of the Jak/Stat Pathway by EphA4 —To screen for transcription factors that represent downstream targets of Eph receptor signaling, we examined potential signaling molecules activated by EphA4 overexpressed in COS7 cells. The cell lysate was then immunoblotted with antibodies that specifically recognized phosphorylated forms of various transcription factors. It was found that two members of the Stat family, Stat1 and Stat3, were tyrosine-phosphorylated upon overexpression of EphA4 (Fig. 1A). The phosphorylation occurred on Tyr701 and Tyr705 of Stat1 and Stat3, respectively, which were essential for their dimerization. The induction of Stat1 and Stat3 phosphorylation required the kinase activity of EphA4, because overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant of EphA4 (EphA4KD), in which the Lys630 was changed to Arg, failed to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). To verify that the transcriptional activity of the Stat proteins was also induced by EphA4 activation, COS7 cells were co-transfected with EphA4 and a luciferase reporter construct that was linked to the Stat1-responsive enhancer element (GAS-Luc). Overexpression of EphA4 significantly induced the transcriptional activity of Stat1 (Fig. 1B). Stat proteins are important components of the signaling pathways activated by many cytokines. The receptor complexes of cytokines lack an intrinsic kinase activity and require the Janus kinase (Jak), a family of non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which consists of Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2, to phosphorylate the Stat proteins (39Aaronson D.S. Horvath C.M. Science. 2002; 296: 1653-1655Google Scholar). To examine whether EphA4 could activate the Jaks, the lysate of transfected COS7 cells was immunoblotted with antibody that specifically recognized Tyr1007/1008 of mouse Jak2 or Tyr1054/1055 of human Tyk2, which are essential for their kinase activity. Overexpression of EphA4 but not EphA4KD induced the Jak2 and Tyk2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that both the Jaks and the Stat proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated upon activation of EphA4. Furthermore, the resulting tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 correlated with increased transcriptional activity. Stat1 and Stat3 might be tyrosine-phosphorylated directly by the autophosphorylated EphA4, or as in the case of cytokine receptors, their phosphorylation was induced by the Jaks. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the transfected cells were pre-treated with the Jak2 inhibitor AG490, which specifically inhibited Jak2 but not other tyrosine kinases (40Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Google Scholar). The presence of AG490 significantly reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1, Jak2, and Tyk2, and completely abolished the EphA4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 (Fig. 2A). AG490 also significantly decreased the EphA4-induced phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase FAK (Fig. 2B). In contrast, AG490 did not affect the kinase activity of EphA4, as revealed by the similar level of EphA4 autophosphorylation at various concentrations of AG490 (Fig. 2B). These results therefore suggested that activation of EphA4 would recruit Jak2 to phosphorylate Stat1 and Stat3. Jak2 Was Constitutively Associated with EphA4 —To study further the interactions between EphA4, Jak2, and Stat proteins, the cell lysate of COS7 cells transfected with EphA4 was subjected to immunoprecipitation by antibody against Jak2, and the product was immunoblotted by anti-EphA4 antibody. EphA4 was co-immunoprecipitated with Jak2 by the anti-Jak2 antibody (Fig. 3A, upper panel). The association between EphA4 and Jak2 was confirmed in the reciprocal immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A, middle panel). Interestingly, although EphA4KD did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak/Stat proteins (Fig. 1, A and C), co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that it could still interact with Jak2 (Fig. 3A). Thus it was likely that the association between Jak2 and EphA4 was constitutive and did not require tyrosine phosphorylation of the Eph receptor. The specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation was indicated by the absence of Stat1 in the EphA4 complex (Fig. 3A, lower panel). The interaction between EphA4 and Jak2 was further verified by GST pull-down assay. The N-terminal (contained the JH domains 3–7) or C-terminal half (contained the JH domains 1–3) of Jak2 was individually linked to GST. Much stronger interaction was observed for EphA4 and GST-JH3–7 when compared with GST-JH1–3 (Fig. 3B), indicating that EphA4 mainly interacted with the N-terminal half of Jak2. To examine whether the association between Jak2 and EphA4 was observed in cells that endogenously expressed the two proteins, the immunoprecipitation was performed using the cell lysate of cultured cortical neurons. Similar to the results in transfected COS7 cells, Jak2 and EphA4 was co-immunoprecipitated, and the association was observed in the reciprocal immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3C). Finally, to examine whether the interaction between Jak2 and EphA4 occurred in vivo, the co-immunoprecipitation was performed using membrane protein fractions of rat brain and muscle. The association between Jak2 and EphA4 was observed in both brain and muscle (Fig. 3D). Induction of"

No structural information on this enzyme is as yet available. It is generally believed, however, that the active site region is located in the more conserved N-terminal portion of PCS, whereas various, as yet unidentified (but supposedly less critical) roles have been proposed for the C-terminal region. To gain insight into the structural/functional organization of PCS, we have conducted a limited proteolysis analysis of the enzyme from Arabidopsis (AtPCS1), followed by functional characterization of the resulting polypeptide fragments. Two N-terminal fragments ending at positions 372 (PCS_Nt1) and 283 (PCS_Nt2) were produced sequentially upon V8 protease digestion, without any detectable accumulation of the corresponding C-terminal fragments. As revealed by the results of in vivo and in vitro functional assays, the core PCS_Nt2 fragment is biosynthetically active in the presence of cadmium ions and supports phytochelatin formation at a rate that is only ∼5-fold lower than that of full-length AtPCS1. The loss of the C-terminal region, however, substantially decreases the thermal stability of the enzyme and impairs phytochelatin formation in the presence of certain heavy metals (e.g. mercury and zinc, but not cadmium or copper). The latter phenotype was shared by PCS_Nt2 and by its precursor fragment PCS_Nt1, which, on the other hand, was almost as stable and biosynthetically active (in the presence of cadmium) as the full-length enzyme. AtPCS1 thus appears to be composed of a protease-resistant (and hence presumably highly structured) N-terminal domain, flanked by an intrinsically unstable C-terminal region. The most upstream part of such a region (positions 284–372) is important for enzyme stabilization, whereas its most terminal part (positions 373–485) appears to be required to determine enzyme responsiveness to a broader range of heavy metals.

Living organisms have developed a variety of mechanisms to counteract the toxic effects of heavy metal (HM) 1The abbreviations used are: HM, heavy metal; PCS, phytochelatin synthase; AtPCS1, phytochelatin synthase 1 from A. thaliana; PC, phytochelatin; GSH, reduced glutathione; MT, metallothionein; Nt, N-terminal; Ct, C-terminal; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. ions. The most common is perhaps HM chelation and sequestration by metal binding (poly)peptides such as metallothioneins (MTs) and phytochelatins (PCs) (1Cobbett C. Goldsbrough P. Annu. Rev. Plant. Biol. 2002; 53: 159-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar). The latter are (λ-Glu-Cys)n-X peptides, in which n usually ranges from 2 to 5 and X is commonly a Gly, but can also be a β-Ala, Glu, or Ser residue (2Rauser W.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 31: 19-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In plants and other organisms, PCs are synthesized from glutathione (GSH) by the enzyme phytochelatin synthase (PCS) (3Zenk M.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). As revealed by the pioneering studies of Zenk and coworkers (4Grill E. Loeffler S. Winnacker E.L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6838-6842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PCS is a cytosolic λ-Glu-Cys dipeptidyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2.15) that catalyzes the transpeptidation of the λ-Glu-Cys moiety of GSH onto a second GSH molecule to form PC2 or onto a preformed PCn molecule to form the corresponding n+1 derivative. In both fission yeast and plants, the in vivo synthesis of PCs can be induced by a variety of metal ions, the most effective of which is cadmium (2Rauser W.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 31: 19-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Our understanding of PCS function, expression, and mechanism of action has been greatly advanced by the identification of specific Arabidopsis PCS mutants (cad-1) (5Howden R. Goldsbrough P.B. Andersen C.R. Cobbett C.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and by the isolation of PCS-encoding genes (or cDNAs) from fission yeast (6Ha S.B.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 3640-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PCS mutants have invariably been found to be sensitive to heavy metals (especially cadmium), thus supporting the notion of a direct role of PCs in intracellular HM sequestration and detoxification (1Cobbett C. Goldsbrough P. Annu. Rev. Plant. Biol. 2002; 53: 159-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar, 12Sanità Di Toppi L. Prasad M.N.V. Ottonello S. Prasad M. Strzalka K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Metal Toxicity and Tolerance in Plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002: 59-93Crossref Google Scholar). In most organisms, PCS is expressed constitutively (6Ha S.B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B. Cobbett C.S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 8Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and leads to PC accumulation within a few minutes from exposure to cadmium or other HMs (most notably, copper, silver, arsenic, mercury, zinc, and lead) (13Grill E. Winnacker E.L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 14Scheller H.V. Huang B. Hatch E. Goldsbrough P.B. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that PCS is primarily regulated by HM-dependent enzyme activation. Despite the chemical diversity of metals that can function as enzyme activators, such an activation has long been thought to rely on a direct interaction between PCS and metal ions. Evidence for a substantially different mechanism has been provided by the results of a study conducted with recombinant PCS from Arabidopsis (AtPCS1), which implied that metal binding to the enzyme is not primarily responsible for catalytic activation (15Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). More specifically, it has been reported that a Cd·GS2 thiolate complex (or a Cd·PCn complex) and free GSH can act, respectively, as the λ-Glu-Cys acceptor and donor of AtPCS1-catalyzed dipeptidyl transfer. Only a 2-fold enhancement of the transpeptidation rate seems to be conferred by a direct interaction of the metal with AtPCS1, which binds approximately seven Cd2+ ions/monomer. One aspect of this model that has been challenged recently concerns the mechanism of termination. It has been argued that, because HM·PCn complexes are co-substrates for PCn+1 formation, it is not clear how PC synthesis can be terminated, at least under in vitro conditions, where there is an excess of free GSH, but no effective sink for product removal or sequestration (16Oven M. Page J.E. Zenk M.H. Kutchan T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4747-4754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been found previously that even though PC synthesis can be induced in vivo by lead and mercury ions, the resulting HM·PC complexes mainly contain copper rather than the metal ions utilized for induction (17Maitani T. Kubota H. Sato K. Yamada T. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The availability of PCS coding sequences from a wide range of organisms has also led to a model for the functional organization of PCS, in which the more conserved N-terminal region is thought to correspond to the catalytic domain (18Cobbett C.S. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2000; 3: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Although substantiated by the observation that mutations targeting the N-terminal portion of AtPCS1 (e.g. the cad1–3 mutant (5Howden R. Goldsbrough P.B. Andersen C.R. Cobbett C.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar)) dramatically reduce cadmium tolerance and in vivo PC production, this model is still largely hypothetical. In addition, the loss of part of the C-terminal region of AtPCS1, as in the cad1–5 mutant (5Howden R. Goldsbrough P.B. Andersen C.R. Cobbett C.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), definitely leads to a defective cadmium tolerance (and impaired in vitro PC synthesis) phenotype. This argues that the putative C-terminal domain, which contains multiple cysteine residues, often arranged in pairs (or near pairs) as in MTs (18Cobbett C.S. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2000; 3: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and for which diverse functions have been proposed in recent years, does somehow contribute to PCS functionality. Bacterial Expression and Purification AtPCS1—The AtPCS1 cDNA was isolated as the result of a multicopy suppression screening aimed at identifying Arabidopsis cDNAs (from a yeast expressible cDNA library cloned into the expression vector pFL61 (19Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar)) capable of increasing cadmium tolerance in the cadmium-hypersensitive, Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant Δyap1 (strain YPH252, a kind gift of S. Kuge, Department of Microbiology, University of Tokyo). 2A. Bolchi and S. Ottonello, unpublished data. The coding region of AtPCS1 was PCR-amplified (25 cycles) using the pFL_AtPCS1 plasmid as template (50 ng), a high fidelity thermophilic DNA polymerase (Vent, New England Biolabs), and the following sequence-specific primers: 5′-GCTAGCGCGAGTTTATATCGGCGATC-3′ (PCS_plus); 5′-GGATCCCTAATAGGCAGGAGCAGCG-3′ (PCS_minus). Following intermediate cloning in the pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega) and NheI/BamHI digestion, the AtPCS1 amplicon was transferred to the pET28b expression vector (Novagen) as an in-frame fusion with a plasmid-encoded hexahistidine tag sequence. After sequence verification, the pET_AtPCS1 plasmid was electroporated into BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and allowed to proceed for 4.5 h at 30 °C. Bacterial cells were then collected, suspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, plus a protease inhibitor mixture containing phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, leupeptin, and pepstatin), and lysed by sonication. The lysate was loaded onto a metal-affinity resin (Talon, Clontech) equilibrated in 10% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, plus protease inhibitors. After washing with equilibration buffer, and with the same buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, rAtPCS1 was eluted with 100 mm imidazole. The composition and purity of protein fractions were assessed by gel electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide (11%) gels (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin and carbonic anhydrase as standards. Limited Proteolysis—Limited proteolysis reactions containing 25 μg of purified rAtPCS1 and Staphylococcus aureus V8 endoprotease (Fluka, 45712) at a 1:25 protease/AtPCS1 (w/w) ratio, were routinely set up in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (80 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol) and allowed to proceed at 37 °C for various lengths of time (10–60 min, as specified in the text). At 10-min intervals, aliquots of the above reaction mixture (10 μl each) were taken up and immediately blocked by 5 min boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). When required, either 200 μm CdSO4 or 200 μm CuCl2 were added to proteolysis reaction mixtures. A similar experimental arrangement was utilized for trypsin (Sigma, T8642) digestions, which were conducted in 30 mm Hepes-Na buffer (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 8% glycerol at a 1:1000, trypsin/AtPCS1 (w/w) ratio. Proteolysis products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, sized by comparison with a 6- to 175-kDa molecular mass protein standard mixture (New England Biolabs), and quantified by densitometric analysis carried out on digitized images with the Multi-Analyst/PC software (Bio-Rad). N-terminal Microsequencing and MALDI-MS Analysis of AtPCS1 Digestion Products—Scaled up digestion mixtures, assembled without any added HM and blocked after ∼60 min of proteolysis, were electrophoresed as above, and the gel was electroblotted onto Immobilon-PSQ (Millipore). Membrane areas containing AtPCS1 polypeptide fragments (visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining) were cut out and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis using a blot cartridge device and a Procise 494A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). For MALDI-MS fingerprinting, Coomassie Blue-stained bands were excised from polyacrylamide gels, washed twice (10 min each) in deionized MilliQ-grade water, followed by additional washes with acetonitrile and 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate (three 15-min washes each). Protein samples were then reduced with dithiothreitol (45 min at 56 °C), followed by free cysteine alkylation by incubation in the presence of 55 mm iodoacetamide (30 min at room temperature in the dark). The supernatant obtained from this alkylating treatment was discarded, and the reaction was stopped by washing gel pieces with acetonitrile and with digestion buffer. In situ digestion of individual polypeptide bands was carried out by incubating gel pieces with trypsin (12.5 ng/μl) in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate pH 7.8 (2 h at 4 °C). The trypsin solution was then removed and replaced with a new aliquot of the same digestion solution, and the incubation was continued for an additional 18 h at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted by washing gel particles with 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile at room temperature. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded with a Voyager DE-PRO spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). A mixture of analyte and matrix solution (10 mg/ml α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid in 66% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in MilliQ-grade water) was applied to the metal sample plate and dried down at room temperature. Mass calibration was performed using external peptide standards. Raw data were analyzed using computer software supplied by the manufacturer and were reported as monoisotopic masses. Cloning of Truncated AtPCS1 Species—cDNA fragments coding for truncated PCS_Nt species were obtained by PCR using the pFL_AtPCS1 template and PCS_plus forward primer as above, with the following reverse primers: 5′-GGATCCCTAGTCATCAGGACCTTTGATGC-3′ (Nt1_minus) and 5′-GGATCCCTACTCAGCCACCCATCTGATG-3′ (Nt2_minus). The PCS_Ct cDNA fragment was also amplified under the above conditions using the previously described PCS_minus primer and the forward primer: 5′-ATGGCTAGCATCCGAATTACAGAGGACTCA-3′ (Ct_plus). Individual amplicons were first cloned into the intermediate vector pGEM-T-Easy, sequence-verified, digested with NotI, and transferred to the yeast expression vector pFL61. Following NheI/BamHI digestion, the PCS_Nt1 and Nt2 cDNAs were then subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET28b. After sequence verification, the same expression system and purification conditions previously applied to full-length AtPCS1 were utilized for expression and purification of both PCS_Nt species. Cadmium Tolerance Assays in Yeast—For in vivo cadmium tolerance assays, the three truncated AtPCS1 cDNA species (PCS_Nt1, Nt2, and Ct) cloned in the yeast expression vector pFL61, plus the full-length pFL_AtPCS1 (positive control) and the empty pFL61 vector (negative control) were transformed into cadmium-hypersensitive, Δyap1 yeast cells using the lithium acetate procedure (21Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were first selected for their ability to grow on SD-agar medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, 1.5% agar) supplemented with leucine, tryptophan, histidine, lysine, and adenine, but lacking uracil, and subsequently utilized for cadmium gradient plate assays as described previously (22Lanfranco L. Bolchi A. Ros E.C. Ottonello S. Bonfante P. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For the determination of PC levels, the various transformants were first grown to an A600 value of 1.0 in SD medium lacking uracil, then supplemented with 50 μm CdCl2 and grown for an additional 24 h at 30 °C. PCS Activity Assays and PC Analysis—Standard phytochelatin synthase assays were conducted at 35 °C in reaction mixtures (250 μl final volume) containing 200 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6.6 mm GSH, 200 μm CdCl2, and variable amounts of the different PCS species, as indicated in the text. When required, the type and concentration of HMs (HgCl2, ZnCl2, or CuSO4) were also changed, as specified in the text. For activity assays aimed at specifically monitoring PC3 formation, reaction mixtures contained the same components as above plus 500 μm preformed PC2 (Applichem). After blocking by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid at a final concentration of 5% (v/v), 50-μl aliquots of individual reaction mixtures were diluted with an identical volume of MilliQ-grade water and analyzed by HPLC on an Aqua C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex). A 0–20% (v/v) linear concentration gradient of acetonitrile, containing 0.05% phosphoric acid, was utilized for elution. Thiols were monitored by post-column derivatization with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and were quantified using GSH calibration curves. The same analytical procedure was utilized for PC detection and quantification in yeast transformants (see above), which were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and extracted in 5% sulfosalicilyc acid, 6.3 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid as described previously (23De Knecht J. Van Dillen M. Koevoets P. Schat H. Verkleij J. Ernst W. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Other Methods—Sequence conservation profiles were generated from sets of PCS polypeptide sequences, aligned with ClustalW (24Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar), by calculating percent identity values using the AlgnIO module of Bio-Pearl. Average pairwise percent identities were determined using sliding windows of 51 amino acids with an incremental step of 5 residue positions. Only alignment columns without gaps in the AtPCS1 sequence were considered for analysis, which included the following sequences: A. thaliana (AAD16046), B. juncea (CAC37692), Thlaspi caerulescens (BAB93120), T. aestivum (AAD50592), Allium sativum (AAO13809), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (NP_593552), and C. elegans (NP_496475). The PCS coding sequence from Typha latifolia was obtained by conceptual translation of the corresponding mRNA (AF308658). For immunoblot analyses, a polyclonal antibody raised against B. juncea PCS (a kind gift of T. Rausch, Heidelberg Institute of Plant Sciences, Heidelberg, Germany) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies were utilized along with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (SuperSignalWest Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The suggestion that PCS might be composed of two distinct domains, an essential N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain, whose role is uncertain but most likely accessory, was based on the alignment of a fairly limited and heterogeneous set of PCS sequences, derived from organisms as diverse as a unicellular fungus, two plants, and a nematode worm (1Cobbett C. Goldsbrough P. Annu. Rev. Plant. Biol. 2002; 53: 159-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar, 18Cobbett C.S. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2000; 3: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The picture arising from such an alignment is certainly informative, but still largely hypothetical and potentially imprecise. Taking advantage of the current availability of a large number of PCS homologs, especially from land plants, we initially examined sequence conservation within the PCS family in a more detailed and plant lineage-oriented manner. As revealed by this analysis (Fig. 1, line a), when disparate organisms are compared, the pattern of sequence conservation is indeed consistent with the idea of two separate “domains,” even though the border between them is not well defined, with a progressive decrease of sequence conservation in going from position 200 to position 260 of the Arabidopsis enzyme. It must also be noted that the length of different PCS homologs ranges from 360 to 500 amino acids, thus implying that a rather long, and perhaps functionally important, C-terminal region is present in all PCS enzymes identified to date. This view is reinforced by the observation that the level of sequence conservation in the C-terminal region is similar to that of the N-terminal region, when only plant PCS sequences are considered, and even more so when such analysis is restricted to dicotyledonous plants (Fig. 1, lines b and c, respectively). By pointing to some important and conserved function of the C-terminal region, at least in specific branches of the eukaryotic domain, the above observations motivated an experimental investigation of the structural and functional organization of PCS. Limited Proteolysis Analysis of AtPCS1—Recombinant AtPCS1 (rAtPCS1; molecular mass = 56.6 kDa, including a stretch of 20 extra amino acids at the N terminus, carrying the hexahistidine tag) was purified to near homogeneity from an overproducing Escherichia coli strain by metal-affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Recombinant PCS was catalytically competent, with the same specific activity as the corresponding untagged protein from which the histidine tag had been removed by thrombin treatment (data not shown, but see below). To probe the structural organization of PCS, purified rAtPCS1 was subjected to limited proteolysis with V8 protease, both in the absence and in the presence of Cd2+ ions (Fig. 2). A 44-kDa proteolytic fragment accumulated in Cd2+-unsupplemented reaction mixtures after a 10-min incubation in the presence of V8 protease. Although this 44-kDa fragment was by far the major product of AtPCS1 proteolysis at this early digestion time, small amounts of other polypeptides (including undigested rAtPCS1) were also visible. One such polypeptide, with an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa, and a less abundant 30-kDa fragment progressively accumulated during an additional 10-min incubation (lane 4), after which the limited proteolysis pattern became essentially stable (up to at least 1 h). As further shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9), a qualitatively similar digestion pattern was obtained in the presence of 200 μm Cd2+. The most striking difference, compared with the digestion conducted in the absence of Cd2+, was a significantly reduced cleavage rate of full-length AtPCS1, which remained ∼50% intact after a 10-min digestion and was still well detectable even after 40 min. This effect was not due to metal-induced inhibition of the V8 protease, because Cd2+, at the same concentration, did not impair digestion of an unrelated (non-cadmium binding) protein such as bovine serum albumin (data not shown). Because AtPCS1 is known to bind Cd2+ ions at sub-micromolar concentrations even in the absence of GSH (15Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 25Maier T. Yu C. Kullertz G. Clemens S. Planta. 2003; 218: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), this effect most likely reflects a cadmium-induced stabilization of the enzyme. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that the rate of formation of the 34-kDa fragment was enhanced (rather than depressed) in cadmium-supplemented reactions (cf. lanes 2 and 3), and that effects identical to those elicited by cadmium were observed in the presence of copper, another PCS-binding HM (25Maier T. Yu C. Kullertz G. Clemens S. Planta. 2003; 218: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To define the boundaries of the protease-resistant regions of AtPCS1, the two main V8 digestion products (the 44- and 34-kDa fragments) as well as other less represented fragments, obtained from a scaled-up limited proteolysis reaction, were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected both to N-terminal microsequencing and to in situ trypsin digestion followed by MALDI-MS fingerprinting (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Mass signals were assigned to individual AtPCS1 fragment-derived peptides on the basis of their mass values and of the cutting specificity of trypsin; the C terminus was then deduced by taking into account fragment size (as derived from SDS-PAGE analysis) and the amino acid cleavage specificity (Asp or Glu) of V8 protease. All fragments were found to bear the same N terminus as the undigested rAtPCS1. As shown in Fig. 3, the 44-kDa polypeptide (hereafter designated as PCS_Nt1) ends at position 372 (numbering refers to the untagged AtPCS1 sequence), whereas the other major proteolysis product, the 34-kDa fragment (hereafter designated as PCS_Nt2), ends at position 283. No polypeptide species corresponding to the C-terminal fragments complementary to PCS_Nt1 and PCS_Nt2 could be detected even upon extensive sampling and MALDI-MS analysis of proteolysis products, including much less abundant polypeptide bands that were barely visible by Coomassie staining. It thus appears that one region of AtPCS1, even in the presence of HM ions, is particularly susceptible to proteolytic attack and separates a fairly large N-terminal domain (PCS_Nt1) from a smaller and strikingly unstable C-terminal region. Cleavage at a second site, which becomes accessible upon generation of the PCS_Nt1 fragment, yields PCS_Nt2, the N-terminal core domain fragment, which accumulates at high levels after prolonged proteolysis (Figs. 2 and 3). In Vivo Functional Characterization of Truncated AtPCS1 Variants in a Cadmium-sensitive Yeast Mutant Strain—To examine the functional properties of the two major polypeptide fragments generated by limited proteolysis, we initially employed various chromatographic methods (including RP-HPLC) to purify them out of limited digestion mixtures. None of these methods, however, resulted in a clean fractionation of individual PCS_Nt fragments, which exhibited a fairly strong tendency toward nonspecific aggregation. We thus resorted to cloning truncated versions of the AtPCS1 cDNA"
https://openalex.org/W1978060888,"Staphylococcus aureus cause infections by producing toxins, a process regulated by cell-cell communication (quorum sensing) through the histidine-phosphorylation of the target of RNAIII-activating protein (TRAP). We show here that TRAP is highly conserved in staphylococci and contains three completely conserved histidine residues (His-66, His-79, His-154) that are phosphorylated and essential for its activity. This was tested by constructing a TRAP– strain with each of the conserved histidine residues changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. All mutants were tested for pathogenesis in vitro (expression of RNAIII and hemolytic activity) and in vivo (murine cellulitis model). Results show that RNAIII is not expressed in the TRAP– strain, that it is non hemolytic, and that it does not cause disease in vivo. These pathogenic phenotypes could be rescued in the strain containing the recovered traP, confirming the importance of TRAP in S. aureus pathogenesis. The phosphorylation of TRAP mutated in any of the conserved histidine residues was significantly reduced, and mutants defective in any one of these residues were non-pathogenic in vitro or in vivo, whereas those mutated in a non-conserved histidine residue (His-124) were as pathogenic as the wild type. These results confirm the importance of the three conserved histidine residues in TRAP activity. The phosphorylation pattern, structure, and gene organization of TRAP deviates from signaling molecules known to date, suggesting that TRAP belongs to a novel class of signal transducers.

Staphylococcus aureus are Gram-positive bacteria that are part of the normal flora but can become pathogenic and cause disease in humans and animals once they produce toxic exomolecules (1Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4673) Google Scholar). S. aureus pathogenesis is regulated by quorum sensing mechanisms (2Miller M.B. Bassler B.L. Annu. Rev.

Once the autoinducers reach threshold concentration, they activate signal transduction pathways, leading to the expression of genes that code for virulence factors (1Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4673) Google Scholar). To date two quorum-sensing systems have been described in S. aureus (5Balaban N. Goldkorn T. Gov Y. Hirshberg M. Koyfman N.

SQS 1 consists of the autoinducer RNAIII-activating protein (RAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RAP, RNAIII-activating protein; TRAP, target of RAP; RIP, RNAIII-inhibiting peptide; agr, accessory gene regulator; WT, wild type. and its target molecule TRAP (5Balaban N.

RAP is a 277-amino acid protein that is orthologous to the ribosomal protein L2 and is specifically secreted by S. aureus (7Korem M. Sheoran A.S. Gov Y. Tzipori S. Borovok I. Balaban N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 223: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). TRAP is a 167-amino acid protein that is constitutively expressed but is histidine-phosphorylated in a RAP-dependent manner (5Balaban N. Goldkorn T. Gov Y. Hirshberg M. Koyfman N. Matthews H.R.

SQS 2 consists of the products of the accessory gene regulatory system agr. The chromosomal agrBDCA operon is active from the mid-exponential phase of growth and encodes two transcripts, RNAII and RNAIII (8Novick R.P. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Ross H.F. Ji G. Kreiswirth B.

RNAII encodes AgrB, AgrD, AgrC, and AgrA, where AgrD is a pro-peptide that yields a peptide pheromone (AIP) that is secreted with the aid of AgrB (10Lyon G.J. Wright J.S. Muir T.W. Novick R.P.

AgrC and AgrA are part of a bacterial two-component system, AgrC as the receptor component that is phosphorylated in an AIP ligand-dependent manner and AgrA as regulator (13Lina G. Jarraud S. Ji G.

The components of SQS1 and SQS2 interact with one another and the following scenario is, thus, emerging (5Balaban N. Goldkorn T. Gov Y. Hirshberg M. Koyfman N. Matthews H.R. Nhan R.T. Singh B.

When RAP reaches a threshold concentration it induces the histidine phosphorylation of its target molecule TRAP, reaching peak phosphorylation at the mid-exponential phase of growth. The phosphorylation of TRAP leads, by a yet unknown mechanism, to activation of the agr and the production of RNAII (in the mid-exponential phase of growth) (5Balaban N. Goldkorn T. Gov Y.

AIP induces the phosphorylation of AgrC (13Lina G. Jarraud S. Ji G. Greenland T. Pedraza A. Etienne J. Novick R.P. Vandenesch F. Mol.

J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). AIP also indirectly down-regulates the phosphorylation of TRAP (5Balaban N. Goldkorn T. Gov Y. Hirshberg M.

TRAP is hypothesized then, to be available for interacting with another RAP molecule, leading to a sustainable activation of agr and to the production of toxins (18Hong-Geller E. Gupta G. J. Mol. Recognit. 2003; 16: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). TRAP was first discovered as a quorum-sensing transducer of S. aureus (5Balaban N. Goldkorn T. Gov Y. Hirshberg M. Koyfman N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2658-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and was then suggested to be a more global responder to stress, because it was overexpressed in cells exposed to antibiotic treatment (19Singh V.K. Jayaswal R.K. Wilkinson B.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 199: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). Like typical sensors of classical two component systems (4Kleerebezem M. Quadri L.E. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), TRAP is histidine-phosphorylated in the presence of RAP (5Balaban N. Goldkorn T. Gov Y.

Balaban, unpublished data. In addition, the C-terminal part of TRAP was used as a vaccine to protect from an infection, 3G. Yang, personal communication. suggesting that parts of the molecule may be extracellular. However, unlike classical sensors, TRAP does not contain a kinase or a transmembrane domain (5Balaban N.

It is, therefore, suggested that TRAP is a non-classical signal transducer and may be bound to the membrane through other proteins. The phosphorylation of TRAP has been suspected to be essential for S. aureus pathogenesis because in the presence of RIP, which is a linear heptapeptide that competes with RAP and inhibits TRAP phosphorylation, infections caused by staphylococci were prevented (5Balaban N.

Using mutagenesis and complementation studies we show here that TRAP is essential for S. aureus pathogenesis. Using site-directed mutagenesis studies we show here that the three conserved histidine residues are important for TRAP activity. Bacteria—S. aureus 8325-4 (further referred as WT); 8325-4 TRAP disrupted mutant strain (TRAP–) grown with 100 μg/ml kanamycin; S. aureus RN6390B (ATCC 55620); S. aureus NB8 (TRAP– strain containing recovered traP gene) grown with 100 μg/ml kanamycin and 10 μg/ml erythromycin, Staphylococcus epidermidis strain sofi, a clinical isolate of Tel Aviv University, Israel. Nares-isolates of S. aureus were obtained from patients at the onset of maintenance hemodialysis (21Balaban N. Gov Y. Bitler A. Boelaert J.R. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Staphylococci were grown at 37 °C in tryptic soy broth, tryptic soy agar plates or on sheep blood agar plates (Remel, Lenexa, KS). Escherichia coli V2F1 (Invitrogen) and E. coli NS 2626 (Dam– strain) were grown in LB. DNA Manipulations—For E. coli, preparation of plasmids, DNA manipulations, and transformation of competent cells were as previously described (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For S. aureus genomic DNA was prepared as described (28Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Standard procedures were employed for restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, Northern blotting, and radiolabeling of DNA probes (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) unless otherwise stated. The nucleotide sequences of the TRAP genomic regions in S. aureus clinical isolates were determined from both strands by the dideoxy procedure with the ABI Prism 377 automatic sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base with accession numbers AJ489447 (clinical isolate 12), AJ489448 (clinical isolate 15), AJ489449 (clinical isolate 11), and AJ489450 (clinical isolate 7). Amplification of traP by PCR—Forward (5′-GCGCGGATCCATCGCTCATTCGTTCG-3′) and reverse (5′-CGCGAAGCTTCCATTGGCATGTATGT-3′) primers were designed. Chromosomal DNA of S. aureus clinical nare isolates were used as templates to PCR-amplify the DNA fragment containing an intact traP gene as well as its putative promoter and transcriptional terminator. To amplify the traP gene in S. epidermidis, forward (5′-ATGTATTTATATACATCTTATGGGAC-3′) and reverse (5′-TTAATGATCTTCTATTGG-3′) primers were designed, and chromosomal DNA of S. epidermidis strain Sofi was used as a template. Sequence Analysis, Data Base Search, and Deduced Protein Analysis—Primary sequences of traP were identified in databases of the University of Oklahoma Advanced Center for Genome Technology (strain NCTC 8325) (www.genome.ou.edu/staph.html), The Institute for Genomic Research (strain COL) (www.tigr.org), and the S. aureus Sequencing Group at the Sanger Centre (EMRSA-16/MRSA252 and MSSA/strain 476) (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_aureus) using BLAST algorithms (BLASTn and tBLASTn) (29Altshul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) of databases including the NCBI Microbial Genomes Databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Microb_blast/unfinishedgenome.html). Multiple sequence alignments were made with the Sequencher™ program version 4.0 (GeneCodes). Phylogenetic comparison of the aligned nucleotide sequences was performed by the neighbor-joining method using the Tamura-Nei distance parameter in PAUP 4.0 (48Tamura K. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 512-526PubMed Google Scholar, 49Nei M. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics. Columbia University Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). Construction of TRAP-disrupted Mutant (TRAP–)—Two oligonucleotide primers P1 (upstream, 5′-GGATCCGACGCTAATGTAAATGGTG-3′) and P2 (downstream, 5′-AAGCTTTTCTATGTTGTACTCATTT-3′) were designed to PCR-amplify an ∼1.4-kilobase fragment encompassing the gene encoding for TRAP using S. aureus 8325-4 chromosomal DNA as template. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The cloned fragment was subsequently subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pTZ18RΔEcoRI. A kanamycin resistance cassette was subsequently inserted to the unique EcoRI site present in the traP gene. The vector pTZ18R cannot replicate in S. aureus, and the above construct was used as a suicide vector to transfer the mutation in S. aureus. Approximately 10 μg of pTZ-TRAP::kan DNA was electroporated to S. aureus RN4220 cells, and the transformants were selected on tryptic soy agar plates containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin. Southern blot and PCR analysis revealed that the resulting transformants possessed both the native and the mutated gene, suggesting that the entire construct was integrated into the chromosome due to a single crossover event. The mutation in the gene-encoding TRAP was subsequently transduced by preparing phage 80α lysates of the above transformants and infecting the S. aureus 8325-4 with that lysate. The transductants with mutations in the traP gene were subsequently confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Restoring TRAP Activity—Primers P1 (upstream, 5′-GGATCCGACGCTAATGTAAATGGTG-3′) and P2 (downstream, 5′-AAGCTTTTCTATGTTGTACTCATTT-3′) were designed to PCR-amplify an 888-kilobase fragment encompassing the gene encoding for TRAP, including its promoter region and termination site and BamHI/HindIII digestion sites (underlined), using S. aureus RN6390 chromosomal DNA as template. The PCR product (“whole traP”) was digested and cloned into the BamHI/HindIII sites of pAUL-A, which can replicate in E. coli at 37 °C and in S. aureus at 30 °C and can be used as a suicide vector if grown at 37 °C in S. aureus. pAUL-A contains the gene for erythromycin resistance. The resulting plasmid (pAUL-A::traP (pYG14) was used to transform (by electroporation) E. coli V2F1. Cells were selected on LB agar plates containing 300 μg/ml erythromycin. Plasmid was isolated from positive clones and used to subclone (by electroporation) E. coli NS 2626 Dam– strain, and positive clones were selected on LB agar plates with 300 μg/ml erythromycin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The plasmid was isolated from positive clones and used to transform S. aureus RN4220 cells, and transformants were selected on tryptic soy agar plates containing 10 μg/ml erythromycin at 30 °C. A positive clone (RN4220 containing pYG14 (NB6)) was selected, the plasmid was isolated, and the presence of pYG14 was confirmed by PCR (using forward M13 primer and reverse 3′ TRAP primer) followed by DNA sequencing. For transduction phage ϕ11 was used to produce a phage lysate of strain NB6. The lysate was then used to infect the recipient strain S. aureus TRAP–, and infected cells were selected by growing them for 24–48 h at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml erythromycin and 100 μg/ml kanamycin. Colonies that grew were tested for the presence pYG14 by PCR (using forward and reverse traP primers), and positive clone (NB8) was grown on sheep blood agar plate and tested positively for hemolytic activity. Site-directed Mutagenesis Studies—In-frame mutations of residues His-66, His-79, His-154, and His-124 were introduced within the traP-coding region, where plasmid pYG14 (pAUL-A::traP) was used as a template for mutagenesis. Two complimentary oligonucleotide pairs were designed for each mutagenesis (primers 3 and 4 for His-66, primers 5 and 6 for His-79, primers 7 and 8 for His-154, and primers 9 and 10 for His-124 (Table I). Primers 1 and 2 were used to amplify the whole gene containing the mutation (Table I). To introduce a mutation, for example, in His-66 and replace it with Ala (H66A), two PCR reactions were carried out using the 1 + 4 and 2 + 3 primers and the S. aureus 8325-4 DNA as a template. The PCR products were purified (Roche Applied Science kit) and treated with Klenow to remove a hanging A nucleotide, and DNA fragments containing the mutations were then gel-purified. Purified PCR products were mixed and used as templates to amplify the whole gene containing the mutation using external primers 1 + 2. The PCR product (whole traP containing Ala-66 instead of His-66) was digested and cloned into the BamHI/HindIII sites of pAUL-A. The resulting plasmid (whole Ala66 traP::pAUL-A (pYG7)) was used to transform (by electroporation) E. coli V2F1. Cells were selected on LB agar plates containing 300 μg/ml erythromycin. The plasmid was isolated from positive clones. The in-frame mutation within traP in pAUL-A was confirmed by DNA sequencing, the plasmid was used to subclone (by electroporation) E. coli NS 2626 Dam– strain, and positive clones were selected on LB agar plates with 300 μg/ml erythromycin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The plasmid was isolated from positive clones and used to transform S. aureus RN4220 cells, and transformants were selected on tryptic soy agar plates containing 10 μg/ml erythromycin at 30 °C. A positive clone (YG4) was selected, the plasmid was isolated, and the presence of the mutation was confirmed by PCR (using forward M13 primer and reverse 3′ TRAP primer) followed by DNA sequencing. For transduction, phage ϕ11 was used to produce a phage lysate of strain YG4. The lysate was then used to infect the recipient strain S. aureus TRAP–, and infected cells were selected by growing them for 24–48 h at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml erythromycin and 100 μg/ml kanamycin.

Cells were grown with shaking for 40 min at 37 °C for the times indicated. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were resuspended in 20 μl of 50 mg/ml lysostaphin in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA for 10 min at room temperature, Laemmli sample buffer was added (without boiling), and the sample (total cell homogenate) was separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was autoradiographed and then stained in Coomassie to ensure that equal amounts of protein were in fact loaded on the gel. Detection of RNAIII; RNA Purification and Northern Blot Analysis— Early exponential cells were grown from A600 0.03 for several hours with shaking at 37 °C. At timed intervals cells (∼3 × 108) were collected by centrifugation (2 min, 12,000 × g) and resuspended in 20 μl of lysostaphin in TES buffer (100 μg/ml lysostaphin (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. 20 μl of 2% SDS containing proteinase K (100 μg/ml) was added and vigorously vortexed for 1 min followed by 10 min of incubation at room temperature. The sample was frozen and thawed twice. 15 μl of RNA sample (∼1 × 108 cells) was mixed with 11% deionized glyoxal, 16 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 55% Me2SO (final concentrations) and incubated for 1 h at 65 °C. RNA loading buffer (Ambion) was added, and sample was applied to a 1% agarose gel in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, supplemented with 5 mm iodoacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). Gel was Northern-blotted by dry transfer. The membrane was prehybridized using rapid-hyb (Amersham Biosciences) followed by hybridization with PCR-radiolabeled RNAIII-specific DNA (amplified by PCR using the forward primer, 5′-ATGATCACAGAGATGTGA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTGAGTCCTAGGAAACTAACT-3′), using S. aureus RN6390B chromosomal DNA as a template. Membranes were autoradiographed. To test for RNAIII in all mutant strains cells were grown from the early exponential phase of growth for several hours (to A600 = 3.0) and analyzed for RNAIII as above. Cellulitis Mouse Model—Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C on tryptic soy agar plates and collected into sterile saline. Bacteria (1 × 109 colony-forming units in 100 μl saline) were injected subcutaneously together with 1 mg of sterile Cytodex beads (Sigma) into 7-week-old immunocompetent hairless mice (Crl:SKH1-hrBR, Charles River Laboratories) (n = 8). Animals were observed daily for mortality, overall health, and development of lesions. The size of the lesions were measured several days post-challenge (area = 0.5 (π(length)(width))). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test by Microsoft Excel (Microsoft). Significance was accepted when the p value was ≤0.05. TRAP Is Unique to Staphylococci but Is Conserved among Strains and Species—The traP gene in various clinical isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was amplified by PCR, and its sequence was determined. Multiple sequence alignment of traP from multiple strains of both species indicates that the traP gene sequence is highly conserved. However, individual traP nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences can be divided into subgroups (Fig. 1, A and B). Our analysis of nucleotide sequences of the strains in the present study are consistent with those of Gilot et al. (34Gilot P. Lina G Cochard T. Poutrel B. J. Clin.

In order to understand the role of this residue in the catalytic mechanism of sulfite oxidase, steady-state and stopped-flow analyses were performed on wild-type and Y343F human sulfite oxidase over the pH range 6–10. In steady-state assays of Y343F sulfite oxidase using cytochrome c as the electron acceptor, kcat was somewhat impaired (∼34% wild-type activity at pH 8.5), whereas the Kmsulfite showed a 5-fold increase over wild type. In rapid kinetic assays of the reductive half-reaction of wild-type human sulfite oxidase, kredheme changed very little over the entire pH range, with a significant increase in Kdsulfite at high pH. The kredheme of the Y343F variant was significantly impaired across the entire pH range, and unlike the wild-type protein, both kredheme and Kdsulfite were dependent on pH, with a significant increase in both kinetic parameters at high pH. Additionally, reduction of the molybdenum center by sulfite was directly measured for the first time in rapid reaction assays using sulfite oxidase lacking the N-terminal heme-containing domain. Reduction of the molybdenum center was quite fast (kredMo = 972 s-1 at pH 8.65 for wild-type protein), indicating that this is not the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle. Reduction of the molybdenum center of the Y343F variant by sulfite was more significantly impaired at high pH than at low pH. These results demonstrate that the Tyr343 residue is important for both substrate binding and oxidation of sulfite by sulfite oxidase.

SO belongs to the family of proteins containing the molybdopterin (MPT) cofactor, which consists of a single molybdenum atom coordinated to a pterin derivative through a dithiolene group (4Schindelin H.

Deficiency of this enzyme due to either a defect in the MPT cofactor, or to a point mutation in the SO gene itself leads to severe neurological problems that often result in death at an early age (6Johnson J.L.

Acta. 1995; 1262: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of native chicken liver SO has been solved at a resolution of 1.9 Å (11Kisker C. Schindelin H.

Chicken SO is a homodimer of 52-kDa subunits, and the N- and C-terminal domains of each subunit are linked by a hinge region that is very flexible and is only weakly defined in the crystal structure (11Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The 10-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1–84 in the chicken SO crystal structure) contains a b5-type heme that is deeply buried but not covalently linked to the protein. The heme domain of rat SO can be removed by trypsin cleavage at the hinge region, and the remaining C-terminal molybdenum domain retains both its dimeric structure and the MPT cofactor (12Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2017-2025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the molybdenum domain has the ability to oxidize sulfite in the presence of a nonspecific electron acceptor such as ferricyanide (12Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2017-2025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 42-kDa C-terminal domain of chicken SO consists of two sub-domains: the MPT-binding region (residues 96–323 of chicken SO) and the dimerization interface (residues 324–466).The overall reaction catalyzed by SO is summarized below, and the complete reaction cycle is shown in Fig. 1. SO32-+H2O+2(cytc)ox→SO42-+2(cytc)red+2H+Reaction 1 In the reductive half of the reaction cycle, sulfite binds at the MoVI center and is oxidized to sulfate, generating a transient two-electron reduced MoIVFeIII species. In the first intramolecular electron transfer (IET), one of the two reducing equivalents generated by sulfite oxidation is transferred from MoIV to the b5-type heme in the N terminus of SO, yielding a MoVFeII species that can be detected using EPR spectroscopy (13Cohen H.J. Fridovich I. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 374-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the oxidative half of the reaction cycle, one electron is transferred from the heme FeII to the terminal electron acceptor, cytochrome cox. After a second IET from MoV to FeIII, which produces the MoVIFeII state of the enzyme, the fully oxidized species is regenerated by electron transfer from FeII to a second molecule of cytochrome cox. The second IET step (from MoV to FeIII) has been extensively studied in reverse after reduction of the heme by one electron using flash photolysis (14Feng C. Kedia R.V. Hazzard J.T. Hurley J.K.

In addition, the reductive and oxidative half-reactions of chicken SO have been analyzed using stopped-flow analysis (19Brody M.S. Hille R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6668-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Brody M.S. Hille R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that the rate of the reductive half-reaction limited the overall rate at pH values over 7.0.In the crystal structure of chicken SO, the molybdenum atom is pentacoordinated in a square pyramidal geometry with three sulfur and two terminal oxo ligands. Two of the sulfur atoms are from the dithiolene group of MPT, and the third is from the side chain of Cys185 (Cys207 in human SO). The dithiolene sulfur atoms of the MPT cofactor are essential for coordinating the molybdenum atom during oxo transfer from water to the sulfite molecule (4Schindelin H. Kisker C. Rajagopalan K.V. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 58: 47-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The importance of the Cys207 residue has been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis (21Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7387-7391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and EPR studies (22George G.N. Garrett R.M. Prince R.C. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Am. Chem.

A combination of spectroscopic techniques including extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and resonance Raman have shown that in the oxidized state, additional coordination to the MoVI atom is provided by two terminal (equatorial and axial) oxo groups with bond lengths of 1.71 Å (22George G.N.

Although chicken SO was purified in the fully oxidized MoVI/FeIII state, the equatorial oxo ligand in the crystal structure was assigned as a water/hydroxo molecule based onaMo–O bond length distance of 2.3 Å. In addition, a mixture of sulfite and sulfate appeared to be present in the active site near the equatorial water/hydroxo ligand, indicating that the structure obtained was that of reduced enzyme (either MoV or MoIV) with bound product. Redox cycling studies have shown that only one oxo ligand is exchanged during the reaction cycle (25Garton S.D. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2590-2591Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and these studies combined with the crystal structure indicate that it is probably the equatorial oxo/hydroxo ligand, and not the apical ligand, that is catalytically active. In light of the rapid IET rates (>1000 s-1) observed in this enzyme (14Feng C. Kedia R.V. Hazzard J.T. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5816-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Feng C. Wilson H.L. Hurley J.K. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 4: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), one surprising finding from the crystal structure was the large intramolecular distance of 32 Å between the molybdenum and iron centers. The most likely explanation for the rapid IET rates is that despite the fairly extensive network of hydrogen bonds seen between the two domains in the crystal structure, the two domains adopt a conformation closer to each other in solution. In fact, IET rates decrease with increasing viscosity of the solution, indicating that domain movement is essential for efficient electron transfer between the heme and molybdenum domains of SO (14Feng C.

In addition, a recent electron-electron double resonance spectroscopy study analyzing the one-electron reduced paramagnetic (MoVFeIII) form of SO detected a range of Mo–Fe distances in solution, further demonstrating that the protein exists in multiple conformations (26Codd R. Astashkin A.V. Pacheco A. Raitsimring A.M. Enemark J.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 338-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Based on the crystal structure, the residues forming the substrate-binding pocket of chicken SO are three arginines at positions 138, 190, and 450 as well as Tyr322 and Trp204. All five of these residues are conserved in all mammalian SO proteins isolated to date. The importance of Arg138 (Arg160 in human SO) was demonstrated by the identification of the R160Q variant in a human patient with severe SO deficiency (27Garrett R.M. Johnson J.L. Graf T.N. Feigenbaum A. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6394-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Whereas mutations of the other substrate binding pocket residues have yet to be observed in human patients, Tyr322 (Tyr343 in human SO) was proposed to be important in labilizing the oxo group of MoVI to allow oxygen transfer to sulfite based on the proximity of this residue to the equatorial oxo/hydroxo group in the crystal structure (11Kisker C.

Rapid kinetic assays of the reductive half-reaction of chicken SO (19Brody M.S. Hille R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6668-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) indicated a role for unprotonated Tyr322 in binding the substrate, based on a pKa value of 9.3 for the specificity constant (kred/Kd). Furthermore, this residue has been proposed to serve an additional role as a proton shuttle between water (or OH-) in the coupled electron-proton transfer (CEPT) mechanism during reduction and reoxidation of the molybdenum center (23Astashkin A.V. Raitsimring A.M. Feng C. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 6109-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A recent study of human SO using flash photolysis has directly demonstrated the importance of Tyr343 in facilitating IET at low pH between the molybdenum and heme metal centers (15Feng C. Wilson H.L.

The studies described here were designed to extend our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of this essential protein through detailed kinetic analyses of wild type and the Y343F variant of human SO.The initial two-electron reduction of the MoVI center by sulfite is virtually impossible to measure spectroscopically in the full-length SO protein due to the presence of the heme cofactor. However, if the 10-kDa N-terminal heme domain of SO is removed, the remaining C-terminal molybdenum domain retains both its dimeric structure and the ability to oxidize sulfite when ferricyanide rather than cyt c is used as the terminal electron acceptor (12Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2017-2025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant production of this domain in the absence of the interfering heme chromophore has allowed spectroscopic analyses to be performed in which the absorption spectrum of the molybdenum center could be directly monitored (9Garrett R.M.

In this study, the molybdenum domain of both wild-type human SO and the Y343F variant were recombinantly expressed and purified. Kinetic analyses, including steady-state and stopped-flow assays on both wild-type and the Y343F molybdenum domain, were performed in which the rate of the reduction of the molybdenum center by sulfite was directly measured for the first time. The results obtained from stopped-flow assays on the molybdenum center demonstrate that the initial reduction of the molybdenum center by sulfite is not the rate-limiting step in overall catalysis at either high or low pH in either the wild-type protein or the Y343F variant. Taken together, the data presented in this study corroborate the proposed role of Tyr343 in substrate binding as well as catalysis in this essential human protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe Y343F mutation was introduced into the wild-type human SO-containing plasmid construct pTG918 (28Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) with the mutagenic primer (GGCGGGATTTCAAAGGCTTCTC) as described previously (15Feng C.

The Y343F molybdenum domain construct was generated by cleavage of pTG918 Y343F with the restriction enzymes NdeI and HindIII. The resulting 640-bp fragment spanning the Y343F mutation was then ligated into the similarly digested wild-type molybdenum domain construct pTG818 (28Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by sequence analysis performed at the Duke University DNA analysis facility.Both recombinant wild-type and Y343F human SO were expressed and purified as previously described (21Garrett R.M.

After the phenyl-Sepharose column, fractions exhibiting an A413/A280 ratio greater than 0.89 were pooled and further purified using a Zorbax GF-250 high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration column (Agilent Technologies) in 250 mm KPO4 buffer at pH 7.80. Fractions exhibiting an A413/A280 ratio ≥ 0.96 were then pooled and used in the experiments described in this study. The His6-tagged molybdenum domains of both the wild-type and Y343F variant were purified as previously described (28Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The molybdenum content of purified proteins was determined using a PerkinElmer Zeeman/3030 atomic absorption spectrometer as previously described (21Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7387-7391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Johnson J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Steady-state kinetic assays were performed aerobically at 25 °C using a 1.0-cm path length cuvette in a Shimadzu UV-1601PC spectrophotometer. Assays were carried out in 20 or 100 mm buffers adjusted to the desired pH with acetic acid to minimize anion inhibition of SO (19Brody M.S. Hille R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6668-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30Kessler D.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 370: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The buffers used were as follows: Bis-Tris (pH 6.0–6.5), Bis-Tris propane (pH 6.75–7.5), Tris (pH 7.5–8.75), and glycine (pH 8.75–10.0). The glycine buffers were adjusted to the desired pH using NaOH. The steady-state pH profile was performed using 15–50 μm horse heart cyt c (Sigma), 0.50–2.5 μg/ml SO, and varying concentrations of sulfite in a final assay volume of 1 ml. The concentration of SO was determined from the A413 using an extinction coefficient of 113 mm-1 cm-1. The reduction of cyt c was monitored at 550 nm using an extinction coefficient of 19 mm-1 cm-1.Steady-state assays using ferricyanide as the electron acceptor were performed using 50 mm buffers, 40 μm ferricyanide, 1.5–5.0 μg/ml SO, and varying concentrations of sulfite in a final assay volume of 1 ml. The reduction of ferricyanide was monitored at 420 nm, and enzyme activity was reported in units/mg, where a unit is equal to a change of 1.0 absorbance units/min at 420 nm.Rapid reaction kinetic studies were performed using an SX.18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). The dead time of the instrument was determined to be <1.7 ms with a path length of 10 mm. To prepare the instrument for anaerobic operation, the flow tubing and valve lines were incubated with 250 mm sodium dithionite for several hours and then thoroughly rinsed with O2-free water. The sample-handling unit of the stopped-flow apparatus was fitted with an anaerobic accessory that enclosed the drive syringe plungers and was flushed continuously with nitrogen gas. The temperature for the reaction was maintained at either 10 or 25 °C using a circulating water bath connected to the thermostat bath housing the drive syringes. All buffers were made anaerobic by bubbling with argon gas for at least 30 min prior to use, and solutions of human SO were prepared by diluting <100 μl of a concentrated stock of the enzyme into a final volume of ∼5 ml of anaerobic buffer. All dilutions were performed in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products Inc.), and 5-ml gas-tight syringes (Hamilton Co.) were used to load samples into the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. For full-length wild-type human SO and the Y343F variant, rapid kinetic assays of the reductive half-reaction were performed anaerobically at 25 °C using 0.3–0.8 μm protein. Reduction of the b5-type heme of SO was directly monitored by measuring the extinction change of the Soret peak at 415, 426, or 430 nm. Similar rate constants were obtained when the reaction was monitored by measuring the α peak at 560 nm. For the molybdenum domain of wild-type and Y343F human SO, the greatest spectral change between the reduced and oxidized species was seen between 350 and 365 nm. Stopped-flow assays were performed anaerobically at 10 °C using 15–18 μm protein, and the extinction change was monitored at 355 or 360 nm. For both full-length and molybdenum domain assays, the kobs of each individual reaction was obtained by fitting individual kinetic traces to single exponential curves using a nonlinear least-squares Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.The steady-state reaction parameters kcat and Km were obtained by a direct fit of the concentration dependence to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The maximal rate parameter kred and the Kdsulfite for the reductive half-reactions were obtained by fitting the kobs at varying sulfite concentrations to a hyperbolic curve (Equation 1). kobs=kred[S]/(Kd+[S])(Eq. 1) The limiting rate parameters (kcat or kred for steady state and stopped-flow assays, respectively) were plotted as a function of pH, and the pKa values were obtained using Equation 2 for bell-shaped double ionization curves and Equation 3 for sigmoidal single ionization curves as described previously by Brody and Hille (19Brody M.S. Hille R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6668-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). kcat/Km=Tmax/(1+10(pKa1-pH)+10(pH-pKd2))(Eq. 2) kred/Kd=((AEH(10(-pH)))+(AE(10(-pKa)))]/[(10(-pH))+(10(-pKa)))(Eq. 3) In Equation 2, Tmax represents the theoretical maximal value of the kinetic parameter where it is assumed that only the middle ionization state (EH for the double equilibrium E = EH = EH2) is catalytically active. In Equation 3, AEH and AE represent the theoretical catalytic activity of the protonated and unprotonated forms, respectively, of the ionization group.The atomic coordinates of the crystal structure of chicken SO (11Kisker C.

Since Tyr343 is the human equivalent of the chicken Tyr322, the Y343F variant of human SO was generated and purified from recombinant Escherichia coli. The protein behaved similarly to wild-type human SO throughout all purification steps, and the Mo/heme ratio as measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy ranged from 0.78 to 0.85 in all protein preparations used in this study.Initial steady-state assays were performed on human SO and the Y343F variant using cyt c as the terminal electron acceptor over the pH range 7–10 for both wild-type and Y343F SO (Table I). The activity of the Y343F variant was impaired across the entire pH range, with a more significant loss in activity observed at low pH"
https://openalex.org/W2031602416,"Bacterial infection sometimes impairs bone metabolism. In this study, we infected the osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and identified genes that were up-regulated in the BCG-infected cells by the suppression subtractive hybridization method. A gene encoding 4-1BB (CD137), a member of the tumor necrosis factor-α receptor family, was found to be one of the up-regulated genes. Up-regulation of 4-1BB was also observed by infection with Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus, and by treatment with lipopolysaccharides and heat-killed BCG. Bone marrow cells and the macrophage-like cell lines J774 and RAW264.7 were found to express 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL). Recombinant 4-1BB (r4-1BB) that was immobilized on culture plates strongly inhibited macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)/receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced in vitro osteoclast formation from bone marrow cells. Anti-4-1BBL antibody also inhibited osteoclast formation to a lesser extent, indicating involvement of reverse signaling through 4-1BBL during inhibition of osteoclast formation. A casein kinase I (CKI) inhibitor markedly suppressed the inhibitory effect of r4-1BB on M-CSF/RANKL-induced osteoclast formation, suggesting that CKI might be involved in 4-1BB/4-1BBL reverse signaling. r4-1BB showed no effects on M-CSF- or RANKL-induced phosphorylation of I-κB, ERK1/2, p38, or JNK, whereas RANKL-induced phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), was completely abolished by r4-1BB, suggesting that 4-1BB/4-1BBL reverse signaling may interfere with PI3K/Akt pathway. r4-1BB also abolished RANKL-mediated induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells-2. This study may elucidate a novel role of 4-1BB in cell metabolism, especially osteoclastogenesis. Bacterial infection sometimes impairs bone metabolism.

Tuberculosis is an ancient disease but still ranks as one of the foremost killers of the 21st century. About one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and more than two million people die annually from tuberculosis (1Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione M.C. JAMA. 1999; 282: 677-686Google Scholar). Most tuberculosis cases are pulmonary, but the microorganism sometimes invades the central nervous system, the lymphatic system, and the musculoskeletal system, or is sometimes disseminated throughout the whole body. Mycobacterium infection in bones and joints presents ∼10% of the extra-pulmonary cases (2Moon M.S. Spine. 1997; 22: 1791-1797Google Scholar).

Osteomyelitis and osteitis caused by M. tuberculosis or BCG infection sometimes lead to vertebral caries in some patients as a result of increased bone resorption. Bone is maintained by dynamic equilibrium between osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bone marrow cells. M. tuberculosis and BCG infection of bone alters this equilibrium, resulting in the loss of extracellular matrix and collapse of bone, especially vertebrae. Whether this bone resorption is attributable to direct effects of the bacteria on bone cells or infection-induced activation of inflammatory cells has not been clarified. However, a few studies have shown that mycobacterial antigens interfere with bone metabolism. Wax D, a mycobacterial cell wall peptidoglycan fragment-arabinogalactan-mycolic acid complex, induced reactive bone formation accompanied with osteomyelitis in Buffalo rats (5Kawabata Y. Semba I. Hirayama Y. Koga T. Nagao S. Takada H. FEMS Immun. Med. Microbiol. 1998; 22: 293-302Google Scholar). Heat shock protein 10 of M. tuberculosis stimulates bone resorption in bone explanting cultures and induces osteoclast recruitment but inhibits proliferation of an osteoblast bone-forming cell line (6Meghji S. White P.A. Nair S.P. Reddi K. Heron K. Henderson B. Zaliani A. Fossati G. Mascagni P. Hunt J.F. Roberts M.M. Coates A.R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1241-1246Google Scholar). The secreted protein MPB70 of BCG has significant homology with four repeat domains of osteoblast-specific factor 2/periostin (7Ulstrup J.C. Jeansson S. Wiker H.G. Harboe M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 63: 672-675Google Scholar). Epidemiological study suggests that MPB70-overproducing strains of BCG seem to be associated with an increased incidence of osteitis after BCG vaccination of neonates (7Ulstrup J.C. Jeansson S. Wiker H.G. Harboe M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 63: 672-675Google Scholar). Osteoblasts express various enzymatic markers such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and produce collagenous and noncollagenous bone matrix proteins, including osteocalcin (OCN) and osteopontin (OPN) (8Anbin J.E. Liu F. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 51-67Google Scholar). Osteoblasts also express receptors for various hormones, including parathyroid hormone (9Dempster D.W. Cosman F. Parisien M. Shen V. Lindsay R. Endocr.

Heersche J.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1822-1826Google Scholar). In addition, osteoblasts have the ability to produce cytokines and augment an inflammatory response. Some cytokines produced by osteoblasts modulate proliferation and differentiation of osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are multinuclear cells with bone-resorbing activity. They play a crucial role in bone remodeling (see Refs. 16Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Google Scholar and 17Chambers T.J. J. Pathol. 2000; 192: 4-13Google Scholar for review). Two molecules, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL), are essential and sufficient for differentiation to osteoclasts (18Takahashi N.

Cell. 1998; 93: 165-176Google Scholar). M-CSF, which is indispensable for macrophage maturation, binds to its receptor in early osteoclast precursors, thereby providing signals required for their survival, proliferation, and differentiation to osteoclasts (21Yoshida H.

Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2592-2594Google Scholar). RANKL, belonging to the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) family, binds to their receptor, receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) and activates several intracellular signaling pathways, leading to osteoclastic differentiation and activation (18Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 449-455Google Scholar). In the present study, to clarify the effect of Mycobacterium infection on bone metabolism, genes up-regulated in BCG-infected osteoblastic cells were screened by the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technique (23Diatchenko L.

Up-regulation of 4-1BB was not limited to BCG-infected osteoblastic cells but observed in osteoblastic cells by infection with Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus, and by treatment with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and heat-killed BCG. We also report that 4-1BB has the ability to suppress M-CSF/RANKL-induced in vitro osteoclastogenesis. Antibodies and Chemicals—Recombinant human soluble RANKL was purchased from PeproTech EC Ltd.

Bone marrow macrophages (BMM) were purified by the method of Takeshita et al. (28Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, G-10 column-eluted bone marrow cells were cultured in α-MEM with 10% FBS in the presence of 50 ng/ml M-CSF for 3 days. After the 3-day culture, non-adherent cells were removed by vigorously washing with PBS and adherent cells were harvested by pipetting with 0.02% EDTA in PBS and seeded in a new dish. Adherent cells were further cultured with osteoclast differentiation medium (α-MEM with 10% FBS containing 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 20 ng/ml RANKL) for 3 days. The purity of TRAP-positive cells in this preparation was >95%. BMM cells were cultured 12 h to 6 days in various medium conditions indicated. Bacterial Infection of Osteoblastic Cells—BCG was grown in sterile Middlebrook 7H9 medium (BD Biosciences, Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD) supplemented with albumin-dextrose-catalase (BD Biosciences) and 0.05% Tween 80 at 37 °C with shaking (160 rpm). Prior to the assays, bacteria cultured up to A560 nm 0.6 were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and passed throughout an 18-gauge needle 10 times. The bacterial cell suspension was placed in a 50-ml plastic tube and agitated for 2 min. MC3T3-E1 cells were mixed with BCG suspension in cell-bacteria ratios of 1:100. After 12 h, the infected cells were rinsed three times with DPBS, followed by addition of fresh α-MEM containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin. After 12 h, the gentamicin-containing medium was replaced by gentamicin-free α-MEM. The period of infection varied from 12 h to 6 days and was stipulated for each experiment as described under “Results.” Colony forming units were determined as follows. The infected cells were lysed in 1 ml of DPBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the resulting lysates were passed 10 times through an 18-gauge needle. The lysates were diluted in Middlebrook 7H9 broth, and a 100-μl aliquot of the dilutions was spread in duplicate onto Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates and incubated for 21 days. MC3T3-E1 cells were also infected with E. coli strain MC4100 in cell-bacteria ratios of 1:50. After 2 h, the infected cells were rinsed and incubated in fresh α-MEM containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin. After 22 h, the infected cells were rinsed three times with DPBS, followed by addition of fresh α-MEM containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin. After 24 h, the gentamicin-containing medium was replaced by gentamicin-free α-MEM. Treatment of Osteoblastic Cells with LPS or Heat-killed BCG— MC3T3-E1 cells were mixed with E. coli LPS at the final concentration of 1 μg/ml. BCG suspension was treated at 120 °C for 2 min and MC3T3-E1 cells were mixed with the heat-killed BCG in cell-bacteria ratios of 1:100. Twelve hours after these treatments, the cells were rinsed three times with DPBS, followed by addition of fresh α-MEM containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin. After 12 h, the gentamicin-containing medium was replaced by gentamicin-free α-MEM. Construction of the Subtracted cDNA Library—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and poly(A)+ mRNA was affinity-purified from the total RNA with an oligo(dT) cellulose column (Takara Biomedicals, Kyoto, Japan). SSH was performed using the PCR-select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Tester cDNA was synthesized from mRNAs of MC3T3-E1 cells infected with BCG for 6 days, and driver cDNA was from mRNAs of uninfected MC3T3-E1 cells. The subtracted cDNAs were inserted into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega Madison, WI) and transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue to yield an infection-specific cDNA library. Screening of the Subtracted cDNA—A PCR-select differential screening kit was used to screen differentially expressed products according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). Plasmid DNA was obtained from each clone of the subtractive cDNA library by boiling bacterial cells from a colony of each clone. Inserted DNA regions were amplified from the recombinant plasmid DNA using NP-1 and NP-2 primers (Clontech) and dot-blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with RsaI-digested tester cDNA as a positive probe and RsaI-digested driver cDNA as a negative prove. Probes were chemically labeled using the ECL direct nucleic acid labeling and detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Nucleotide sequences of positive clones were determined with an ABI 310 automatic sequencer (ABI Prism, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequence data were analyzed using the NCBI program BLAST2.0 (available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from mammalian cells using TRIzol reagent and converted into cDNA using Superscript II RT (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) with oligo(dT) primers. PCR reactions were performed in 50 μl of reaction buffer containing 5 ng of each cDNA in a PCR apparatus (ASTEC PC-800 system; Fukuoka, Japan). The conditions for amplification were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50–65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. To evaluate quantification of amplified DNA, 5 μl of PCR products were withdrawn from the samples after 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 cycles and then electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels. Primer DNA used for amplification are listed in the online supplemental table. Preparation and Immobilization of Recombinant 4-1BB—To construct a plasmid expressing the extracellular form of 4-1BB, 4-1BB cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers s-GGAATTCCATATGGGAAACAACTGTTACAAC and as-CCGCTCGAGTCACAGCTCATAGCCTCCTCC (underlined areas are the NdeI and XhoI sites, respectively). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the NdeI-XhoI region of pET-22b(+) (Novagen), allowing expression of the extracellular form of 4-1BB protein fused to the poly histidine tag at the C terminus. Recombinant 4-1BB (r4-1BB) was expressed in E. coli BL21 harboring the plasmid by treatment with isopropylthio-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. r4-1BB that was formed into insoluble inclusion bodies was solubilized in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. r4-1BB were purified by Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography over a ProBond™ resin (Invitrogen) column under denaturing conditions as described in the manufacturer's instructions. The peak fractions were then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 to remove urea. Removal of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was accomplished by fractionation with a Triton X-114 (Sigma) column (29Liu S. Tobias R. McClure S. Styba G. Shi Q. Jackowski G. Clin. Biochem. 1997; 30: 455-463Google Scholar). LPS concentrations in r4-1BB samples used in this study were less than 1 pg/μg of protein. To immobilize r4-1BB on culture plates, the 96-well plate (IWAKI grass, Tokyo, Japan) was incubated with r4-1BB at 37 °C for 1 h and washed with PBS. Plates were blocked by α-MEM containing 10% FBS at 37 °C for 1 h and washed with PBS. TRAP Staining—At 3 or 5 days of culture, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. After treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, the cells were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) as described previously (30Sakai H. Kobayashi Y. Sakai E. Shibata M. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 550-556Google Scholar). TRAP-positive mono- or multinuclear cells were counted under a light microscope. Cells containing three or more nuclei were considered a multinuclear cell. Analysis of Cell Proliferation—G-10 column-eluted bone marrow cells were cultured at 6.5 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well plates with or without immobilized r4-1BB. Cells were cultured in α-MEM with 10% FBS in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF. Medium was changed to remove non-adherent cells after 1 day. CKI-7 was used at the concentration of 20 μm during incubation when indicated. For determination of cell viability, adherent cells were stained with trypan blue and counted under a light microscope. Alternatively, viability of adherent cells was determined by the WST-1 quantitative colorimetric assay for cell survival (Cell counting kit; Dojindo Laboratory, Kumamoto, Japan). Immunoblot Analysis—Mammalian cells were washed three times with PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4, and solubilized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 units/ml aprotinin). Lysed cells were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and the protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Lowry method (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Proteins in the lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.2% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at 4 °C overnight, the membranes were incubated with anti-4-1BB, anti-β-actin, anti-phospho-I-κB, anti-phospho-MAPK, anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-JNK, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Unless otherwise state, antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:2000 to 1:5000. Anti-phospho-Akt was used at a dilution of 1:500. Anti-c-fos, TRAF6, and NFAT2 were used at a dilution of 1:200. The membranes were washed five times with TBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated with secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5000 in TBS with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed five times with TBST, and signals were detected using an ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Differences between data were analyzed with the Student's t test. Expression of Osteoblastic Markers and Analysis of Suppression Subtraction Library Genes after BCG Infection—Expression of ALP, OCN, and OPN, typical markers of initial differentiation of osteoblasts, was analyzed at the transcriptional level in MC3T3-E1 cells with or without BCG infection. After 6 days culture, non-infected cells reached confluence and their expression of OCN mRNA was clearly increased (Fig. 1A). However, the BCG-infected cells showed significant reduction of ALP and OCN mRNA expression as previously reported (32Hotokezaka H. Kitamura A. Matsumoto S. Hanazawa S. Amano S. Yamada T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 47: 453-458Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression of OPN mRNA was highly increased in the BCG-infected cells. To identify genes specifically up-regulated by BCG infection, the SSH technique was applied using the mRNA extracted from BCG-infected or -uninfected MC3T3-E1 cells. Differential screening of 400 cDNA clones resulted in 40 positive clones. Sequencing analysis classified the 40 clones into 10 genetic loci. RT-PCR was performed with the same mRNA samples using specific primers for the 10 genes, revealing that all of them were actually up-regulated by BCG infection. BLAST analysis of their sequences revealed that they shared homology with known genes as listed in Table I. As TNF-α family proteins have recently been reported as important signaling molecules to regulate bone remodeling, especially bone resorption (16Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Google Scholar), we focused on the increased expression of 4-1BB of BCG-infected MC3T3-E1 cells in this study.Table IBCG infection-up-regulated gene products identified from subtraction, RT-PCR, and sequence analysisNameAccession IDRedundancy in screeningSerum amyloid ANM_0113157HaptoglobinNM_0173703Complement component C3XM_12874312Ferritin heavy chainBC0123143Coagulation factor XIIIBC0110731Monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3)S712511LPS-induced CXC chemokine (LIX)AF349465624p3S824696Nuclear body-associated kinase 1b (NBAK1)AF17030214—1BB /CD137AL6071431 Open table in a new tab Increased Expression of 4-1BB Protein in BCG-infected Osteoblastic Cells—As described above, the amount of 4-1BB mRNA was increased during BCG infection (Fig. 1B). To determine whether 4-1BB was increased at the protein level in BCG-infected cells. We performed immunoblot analysis using anti-4-1BB antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, 4-1BB protein appeared 12 h after BCG infection and increased in a time-dependent manner, whereas the non-infected cells showed no 4-1BB production. Increased Expression of 4-1BB by Infection with E. coli, S. typhimurium, and S. aureus, and by Treatment with Heat-killed BCG and LPS—To determine whether up-regulation of 4-1BB was specific to BCG infection, expression of 4-1BB was examined for osteoblastic cells infected with E. coli, S. aureus, and S. typhimurium (Fig. 1B and supplementary data). Infection with these microorganisms increased 4-1BB expression as well as BCG did. Treatment of osteoblastic cells with heat-killed BCG and E. coli LPS also showed increased expression of 4-1BB (Fig. 1B). 4-1BB Ligand Is Expressed in Macrophage-like Cell Lineage Cells, but Not in Osteoblastic Cells—4-1BB, a TNF-α family receptor, binds to 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL). To determine what cells were regulated by 4-1BB, we examined mouse osteoblasts, the osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, the fibroblast cell line NIH3T3, the macrophage-like cell lines J774 and RAW264.7, and G-10 column-eluted bone marrow cells for expression of 4-1BBL. 4-1BBL mRNA was detected in J774, RAW264.7, and G-10 column-eluted bone marrow cells, but not in mouse osteoblasts, MC3T3-E1, or NIH3T3 (Fig. 1C). These results suggested that 4-1BB might affect macrophage lineage cells, but not osteoblastic or fibroblastic cells. Because human 4-1BB induces the expression of M-CSF in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (33Langstein J. Schwarz H. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 829-833Google Scholar), we examined whether 4-1BB induced the expression of M-CSF in bone marrow cells. Expression of M-CSF was clearly increased 12 h after addition of r4-1BB to G-10 column-eluted bone marrow cell culture (Fig. 1D). However, in MC3T3-E1 cells, expression of M-CSF was not affected by treatment with r4-1BB (data not shown). Immobilized r4-1BB Inhibits M-CSF/RANKL-induced Osteoclastogenesis—Based on the fact that the macrophage-like cell lines and G-10 column-eluted bone marrow cells had the ability to express 4-1BBL, we determined whether 4-1B"
https://openalex.org/W2150652034,"Microsomal glutathione transferase-1 (MGST1) is a membrane-bound enzyme involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and the protection of cells against oxidative stress. The proposed active form of the enzyme is a noncovalently associated homotrimer that binds one substrate glutathione molecule/trimer. In this study, this complex has been directly observed by electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of active rat liver MGST1 reconstituted in a minimum amount of detergent. The measured mass of the homotrimer is 53 kDa, allowing for the mass of three MGST molecules in complex with one glutathione molecule. Collision-induced dissociation of the trimer complex resulted in the formation of monomer and homodimer ion species. Two distinct species of homodimer were observed, one unliganded and one identified as a homodimer·glutathione complex. Activation of the enzyme by N-ethylmaleimide through modification of Cys49 (Svensson, R., Rinaldi, R., Swedmark, S., and Morgenstern, R. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 15144–15149) was monitored by the observation of an appropriate increase in mass in both the denatured monomeric and native trimeric forms of MGST1. Together, the data correspond well with the proposed functional organization of MGST1. These results also represent the first example of direct electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of a detergent-solubilized multimeric membrane protein complex in its native state.

Together, the data correspond well with the proposed functional organization of MGST1. These results also represent the first example of direct electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of a detergent-solubilized multimeric membrane protein complex in its native state. Membrane proteins are estimated to constitute about one-third of the total proteome (1Torres J. Stevens T.J. Samso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 137-144Google Scholar) and have important and diverse roles in biology, including functions as cell-surface receptors, ion channels, and transporters and in cell adhesion. However, because of the difficulty in producing crystals of detergent-solubilized proteins for x-ray crystallography, only ∼1% of the unique protein structures so far solved at high resolution are of membrane proteins (2Werten P.J. Remigy H.W. de Groot B.L. Fotiadis D. Philippsen A. Stahlberg H. Grubmuller H. Engel A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 65-72Google Scholar). Integral membrane proteins thus pose an important challenge in structural biology.Microsomal glutathione transferase-1 (MGST1) 1The abbreviations used are: MGST1, microsomal glutathione transferase-1; ES, electrospray; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide. 1The abbreviations used are: MGST1, microsomal glutathione transferase-1; ES, electrospray; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide. is a member of the MAPEG (membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism) superfamily. At present, other mammalian members of the MAPEG family are two glutathione transferases/peroxidases (MGST2 and MGST3), 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, leukotriene C4 synthase, and microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase (the closest relative to MGST1) (3Jakobsson P.J. Morgenstern R. Mancini J. Ford-Hutchinson A. Persson B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 689-692Google Scholar). MGST1 functions both as a glutathione transferase and as a peroxidase, thus potentially protecting cells from reactive compounds and oxidative stress (3Jakobsson P.J. Morgenstern R. Mancini J. Ford-Hutchinson A. Persson B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 689-692Google Scholar, 4Kelner M.J. Bagnell R.D. Montoya M.A. Estes L.A. Forsberg L. Morgenstern R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13000-13006Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of MGST1 has previously been investigated by electron crystallography (5Hebert H. Schmidt-Krey I. Morgenstern R. Murata K. Hirai T. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 751-758Google Scholar, 6Schmidt-Krey I. Murata K. Hirai T. Mitsuoka K. Cheng Y. Morgenstern R. Fujiyoshi Y. Hebert H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 243-253Google Scholar), radiation inactivation (7Boyer T.D. Vessey D.A. Kempner E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16963-16968Google Scholar), cross-linking (8Lundqvist G. Yucel-Lindberg T. Morgenstern R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 103-108Google Scholar), and hydrodynamic (9Morgenstern R. Guthenberg C. Depierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 243-248Google Scholar) studies and has been suggested to be a homotrimer both in the microsomal membrane and in the purified form. Electrospray (ES) mass spectrometry has shown that the enzyme is partly N-acetylated (10Shore L.J. Odell G.B. Fenselau C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 181-186Google Scholar). Interestingly, equilibrium dialysis (11Sun T.H. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 193-196Google Scholar) and stopped-flow active-site titrations (12Morgenstern R. Svensson R. Bernat B.A. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3378-3384Google Scholar) have indicated that the MGST1 homotrimer binds only one molecule of the substrate GSH, making enzyme-substrate interaction an important study parameter. Thus, MGST1 constitutes a well studied, but incompletely defined model protein to probe the limits of mass spectrometry in the analysis of the native characteristics of membrane-bound proteins.In recent years, ES mass spectrometry has developed from being a method to determine the molecular mass of proteins (13Fenn J.B. Mann M. Meng C.K. Wong S.F. Whitehouse C.M. Science. 1989; 246: 64-71Google Scholar) to being a tool for observing noncovalent multimeric protein assemblies (for reviews, see Refs. 14Sobott F. Robinson C.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 729-734Google Scholar, 15Miranker A.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 601-606Google Scholar, 16Loo J.A. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1997; 16: 1-23Google Scholar). ES analyses of several biologically important soluble macromolecular complexes and their stoichiometric organization have been reported (17Rostom A.A. Robinson C.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121 (A. A.): 4718-4719Google Scholar, 18Green B.N. Gotoh T. Suzuki T. Zal F. Lallier F.H. Toulmond A. Vinogradov S.N. J. Mol.

Furthermore, secondary structure elements and structural dynamics can also be studied by mass spectrometry in hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments, in which the exchange kinetics of amide protons are measured (21Katta V. Chait B.T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 5: 214-217Google Scholar, 22Chung E.W. Nettleton E.J. Morgan C.J. Gross M. Miranker A. Radford S.E. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15161-15172Google Scholar), making ES mass spectrometry an attractive tool for studies of protein structure and organization. However, the study of detergent-solubilized proteins by ES mass spectrometry is challenging because of protein ion signal suppression due to the presence of excess detergent (24Rundlett K.L. Armstrong D.W. Anal Chem. 1996; 68: 3493-3497Google Scholar). Consequently, analysis of integral membrane proteins has usually relied on the removal of detergent prior to sample analysis by, for example, organic solvent extraction (25Barnidge D.R. Dratz E.A. Jesaitis A.J. Sunner J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 1-9Google Scholar) or reversed-phase (26Whitelegge J.P. Gundersen C.B. Faull K.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1423-1430Google Scholar) or size-exclusion (27Whitelegge J.P. le Coutre J. Lee J.C. Engel C.K. Prive G.G. Faull K.F. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, Heck and co-workers reported the analysis of short transmembrane peptides embedded in lipid vesicles (29Demmers J.A. Haverkamp J. Heck A.J. Koeppe II, R.E. Killian J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Soc. 2002; 124: 11191-11198Google Scholar) as well as the study of noncovalent complexes between a K+ ion channel protein and membrane phospholipids (32Demmers J.A. van Dalen A. de Kruijff B. Heck A.J. Killian J.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 541: 28-32Google Scholar). This work showed the feasibility of directly measuring hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics of detergent-solubilized proteins in solution by ES mass spectrometry and thereby obtaining structural information. Although ES has now been extensively used in the direct study of noncovalent interactions, the application of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) in this area of research been more restricted, although it should be noted that Van Dorsselaer et al. (33Moniatte M. Lesieur C. Vecsey-Semjen B. Buckley J.T. Pattus F. van der Goot F.G. Van Dorsselaer A. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Processes. 1997; 169: 179-199Google Scholar, 34Moniatte M. van der Goot F.G. Buckley J.T. Pattus F. van dorsselaer A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 269-272Google Scholar) have reported MALDI data on the subunit stoichiometry of high mass noncovalent complexes of membrane proteins.We have sought to extend the direct ES analysis of detergent-solubilized proteins to the analysis of noncovalent macromolecular assemblies. Purified rat liver MGST1 protein was solubilized in a minimum amount of detergent compatible with enzyme activity. The ES interface conditions were optimized for the preservation of noncovalent protein complexes while allowing desolvation from the MGST1 protein complex. This permitted the stoichiometry of the protein complex to be investigated. Additionally, “in-source” collision-induced dissociation of the complex was performed. This allowed the noncovalent binding of GSH to the complex to be investigated. Furthermore, to illustrate the ability of ES mass spectrometry to monitor functional changes, i.e. covalent modifications in intact membrane proteins, MGST1 was analyzed after enzyme modification by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; relative molecular weight of Mr 125,000) (35Svensson R. Rinaldi R. Swedmark S. Morgenstern R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15144-15149Google Scholar). As MGST1 contains one cysteine residue/subunit, this mass labeling was additionally beneficial in the identification of homotrimer peaks in the ES mass spectra. To the best of our knowledge, the results presented here represent the first application of ES mass spectrometry to the direct analysis of a biologically important noncovalently bound membrane protein complex.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and Solutions—Horse heart myoglobin, GSH, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, NEM, and Triton X-100 were obtained from Sigma (Stockholm, Sweden). The structures of Triton X-100, GSH, and NEM are shown in Scheme 1. Deionized water was used after further purification using a Milli-Q reagent-grade water system (Millipore S. A., Molsheim, France). Rat MGST1 was purified as described previously (36Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 591-597Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry—All data were acquired on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QTOF1, Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) equipped with the standard Z-spray ES source. Sample solutions were pumped to the ES capillary at a flow rate of 10 μl/min using a Hamilton type 22 syringe pump. The source block temperature was maintained at either 60 or 80 °C. The nebulizer gas was set to maximum flow (20 liters/h), and the desolvation gas flow was set to 75 liters/h (both nitrogen). The declustering potential (cone voltage) was maintained at 180 V unless otherwise indicated, and the ES capillary voltage was +3.0 kV. To maintain noncovalent interactions during the transmission of ions into the gas phase and through the subsequent mass spectrometry analysis, the following instrumental parameters were optimized. Argon gas was admitted into the collision cell, raising the pressure reading on the nearby analyser Penning gauge from 7.6 × 10–6 to 4.0 × 10–5 millibars. The source rotary pump line was “throttled,” with the result that the pressure on the analyser gauge increased further to 5.1 × 10–5 millibars. The parameters controlling the transfer and collision cell hexapoles were set to allow maximum transmission of high m/z ions (>3000 Thomson). The time-of-flight pusher frequency was set manually at a pusher time of 200 μs.Determination of Limiting Triton X-100 Concentrations for ES Mass Spectrometry—A preliminary experiment was performed to determine the detergent level compatible with ES analysis of multimeric protein complexes. Yeast alcohol dehydrogenase was used as a model complex, having a tetramer average relative molecular weight of Mr ∼147,000. A stock solution of 100 pmol/μl alcohol dehydrogenase was prepared in 10 mm ammonium acetate and diluted in the same buffer to give a protein concentration of 10 pmol/μl. Triton X-100 was included in the buffer at 0, 0.02, 0.1, and 0.2% (v/v). Each sample was infused into the ES interface, and the ion intensity of the most intense tetramer charge state was normalized to that achieved in a detergent-free solution.Buffer Exchange of MGST1—A solution of 2 mg/ml MGST1 in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8), 1 mm GSH, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 m KCl, and 20% glycerol was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Econo-Pac 10DG column, Bio-Rad) using 1 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8) and 0.1 mm GSH as a running buffer to obtain ≈2 mg/ml MGST1 in the latter buffer and ∼0.2% Triton X-100 (not removed in the size-exclusion procedure). The pooled sample was then diluted 5-fold with the same buffer to give 0.3–0.4 mg/ml MGST1 in 1 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8), 0.1 mm GSH, and ∼0.04% Triton X-100.Activation of MGST1 was accomplished by adding 1 mm NEM to an aliquot of 2 mg/ml MGST1 in 1 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8), 0.1 mm GSH, and 0.2% Triton X-100 on ice. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mm GSH, after which the sample was diluted as described above. The concentration of the GSH-NEM conjugate was estimated to 0.2 mm in the final solution. This conjugate is a potential, but poor inhibitor of MGST1; and because of the higher affinity of the enzyme for GSH (0.2 mm; KD = 20 μm), the primary enzyme species in the experimental buffer will be the E·GS– (enzyme·glutathionate anion) complex.Enzyme Activity Assay—Enzyme activity was determined as described (37Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Google Scholar), with 0.1% Triton X-100 included in the assay medium.Sample Analysis by ES Mass Spectrometry—ES mass spectrometry analysis was started immediately after the final dilution step in the buffer exchange procedure (i.e. 5-fold dilution in 1 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8) to reach 0.3–0.4 mg/ml protein and ∼0.04% Triton X-100). Before each individual sample, the syringe and the inlet capillary were washed with water. Horse heart myoglobin (16,951.5 Da) was used for external calibration of the m/z scale. The maximum entropy program (38Ferrige A.G. Seddon M.J. Green B.N. Jarvis S.A. Skilling J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 707-711Google Scholar) within MassLynx software was used in the data analysis.RESULTSElectrospray Tolerance of Triton X-100 —The maximum detergent concentration compatible with the ES analysis of a multiprotein complex was determined taking tetrameric alcohol dehydrogenase as an example. With 0.1% Triton X-100 in the sample buffer, the tetramer ion signal was reduced to 31% of its value when electrosprayed from a detergent-free solution (data not shown). Accordingly, in our experiments, a 0.1% detergent level was regarded as the maximum acceptable level of detergent for ES analysis.Enzyme Activity at Limiting Detergent Concentrations—We have previously determined that MGST1 binds ∼1.5 g of Triton X-100/g of protein (9Morgenstern R. Guthenberg C. Depierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 243-248Google Scholar). By varying the ratio of protein to detergent in this region, it was possible to find conditions that yielded fully active protein and no visible aggregation. Gel filtration was utilized for buffer exchange (to lower the ionic strength and to remove glycerol) because it was observed that, upon dialysis, the protein tended to aggregate. A solution of 0.5 mg/ml MGST1 in 0.05% Triton X-100 was fully active as determined by an enzyme activity assay (data not shown). It was important to include GSH in the buffer, which is in accordance with the known stabilizing effect of this substrate.Mass Measurement of MGST1—Detergent-solubilized MGST1 (0.3–0.4 mg/ml, ∼20 pmol/μl) with ∼0.04% Triton X-100 was infused into the ES source at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The resulting mass spectrum was dominated below m/z 2000 by detergent cluster ions, which were singly charged and separated by 44 Thomson (Figs. 1A and 2A). Triton X-100 is a polymer with the molecular formula C14H21O(CH2CH2O)nH, where n has an average value of 9.5 (molecular mass of C2H4O = 44 Da); and the average mass of a Triton X-100 molecule is 625 Da. In the first few scans after sample infusion was started, a peak envelope was resolved in the m/z 1450–3000 range (Fig. 1A). Deconvolution of this ion series revealed the presence of two components of 17,340 and 17,382 Da, which were present at a 1:3 ratio (Fig. 1B). A mass of 17,340 Da is in good agreement with the theoretical mass of MGST1 (17,340.3 Da after cleavage of the N-terminal methionine; GenBank™/EBI accession number NP_599176 (39DeJong J.L. Morgenstern R. Jörnvall H. DePierre J.W. Tu C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8430-8436Google Scholar)), whereas 17,382 Da corresponds to the mass of acetylated MGST1 (10Shore L.J. Odell G.B. Fenselau C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 181-186Google Scholar). In subsequent scans, the monomeric protein peaks were obscured by detergent ions.Fig. 1Multimeric forms of MGST1 observed by ES mass spectrometry. MGST1 (∼0.35 mg/ml) was analyzed under nondenaturing conditions at a cone voltage of 180 V. A, summation of the first 60 scans (5 min) after sample injection.

A declustering potential of 180 V was used because lower potentials failed to clearly resolve the m/z 5000–9000 peak envelope from the background. Manual interpretation of the data led to the charge state designation as shown in Fig. 1C. From the data in Fig. 1A, the mass of the neutral species was calculated to fall in the range of 53,033–53,277 Da (Fig. 1C). It should be noted that the peaks in the high m/z 5000–9300 range were broad (full-width at half-maximum: 10.7, 16.3, 22.1, 23.7, and 28.1 Thomson for the 10+ to 6+ peaks, respectively), and mass values were determined from the peak top m/z values. The expected mass of the MGST1 homotrimer falls in the range of 52,020 Da (3 × 17,340) to 52,146 Da (3 × 17,382) depending on the degree of acetylation. Experimentally, the measured mass was higher than these values, and the excess was found to depend on which charge state was used in the mass determination (Fig. 1C). The excess mass can be explained by the incomplete removal of solvent and other noncovalently bound adducts from the protein complex. The excess mass was greatest for lower charge state complexes and lowest for the higher charge state complexes. This can be explained by considering the desolvation (noncovalent adduct removal) process within the ES interface, where charged species are accelerated through a potential difference (cone voltage) and undergo collisions with residual gas molecules. Ions with a higher charge state are accelerated to a greater translational energy than their lower charge state equivalents and thus undergo more energetic desolvating collisions with the residual gas molecules. Therefore, noncovalently bound adducts and solvent molecules are more efficiently removed from the higher charge state ions. The additional mass observed allows for the addition of one GSH molecule (307 Da) in combination with Triton X-100 (e.g. C14H21O(CH2CH2O)9H, 603 Da), water, phosphate, or potassium adducts.Collisionally Activated Dissociation of the Homotrimer Complex—To confirm the composition of the observed homotrimer complex, the declustering potential (cone voltage) was increased to induce dissociation of the assembled complex. Increasing the cone voltage from 180 V (Fig. 2A) to 195 V (Fig. 2B) resulted in the appearance of a series of monomer peaks in the m/z 1700–2500 range (Fig. 2B). At a cone voltage of 195 V, a novel series of peaks appeared in the m/z 2600–5000 range (Fig. 2, B and C). The new peaks at m/z 2675, 3161, 3864, and 4968 were interspersed among the high m/z monomer peaks (m/z 2898 (6+), 3477 (5+), and 4347 (4+)) and were designated to correspond to odd-numbered charge states (13+ to 7+) of MGST1 homodimers that were formed by in-source collision-induced dissociation of the homotrimer complex. In Fig. 2C, the 195 V spectrum is shown on an expanded scale in the m/z range covering the 13+ to 7+ charge states of the dimer. The apparent discrepancy in the peak intensities of the 12+ and 10+ charge states is due to the overlap of monomer peaks onto homodimer peaks. Deconvolution of the 11+ to 9+ charge states on the true mass scale gives a mass for the major component of 34,764.5 Da (Fig. 2D). This is in good agreement with the mass of a homodimer of two acetylated MGST1 subunits (theoretical mass of 34,764.0 Da). Identification of the homodimer species was aided by the fact that MGST1 is only partially acetylated, thereby giving a triplet of peaks for each dimer charge state. This is shown in Fig. 2E for the 10+ charge state of the dimer, where homodimers of non/non-, non/mono-, and mono/mono-acetylated forms of MGST1 gave peaks at 3469.0, 3473.3, and 3477.4 Da, respectively. The respective forms of acetylated homodimers are also evident in the deconvoluted mass spectrum shown in Fig. 2D, giving observed masses of 34,679, 34,722.5, and 34,764.5 Da. The presence of enhanced MGST1 monomer and dimer series in the high cone voltage experiment and the concurrent disappearance of the trimer indicate that the MGST1 trimer fragments under these conditions to a dimer and monomer.Glutathione Binding to the MGST1 Homodimer—To stabilize the native protein, the enzyme substrate, i.e. reduced GSH, was included in the sample buffer at 0.1 mm in all experiments. In the ES mass spectra of MGST1 (Figs. 1A and 2A), the peaks corresponding to the MGST1 trimer were of low intensity and were broad due to the presence of undissociated Triton X-100, GSH, and water molecules and/or buffer salts adducted to the trimer. When the cone voltage was increased from 180 V (Figs. 1A and 2A) to 195 V (Fig. 2, B and C), the trimer dissociated to a monomer and dimer. The mass spectrum obtained at a cone voltage of 195 V showed a series of peaks corresponding to the MGST1 homodimer accompanied by a satellite series of peaks of higher mass (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2, C–E). These satellite peaks were not observed for the monomer charge states. For the 10+ charge state, the m/z increment of the adduct peak relative to the MGST1 homodimer was 30.5 ± 0.5 Thomson (Fig. 2E), translating to the addition of one GSH molecule (307 Da) to the complex. An additional series of adducts was also observed that corresponded to a complex ∼40 Da heavier than the GSH complex (Fig. 2, D and E). This was probably due to the additional presence of a potassium adduct. As the origin of the homodimer is the homotrimer, the observation of the GSH adduct on the homodimer, but not the monomer, indicates that the parent homotrimer contains just one GSH molecule.Enzyme Mass Labeling by NEM—MGST1 activity is increased up to 30-fold through covalent modification (+125 Da) of Cys49 by NEM (35Svensson R. Rinaldi R. Swedmark S. Morgenstern R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15144-15149Google Scholar). Incorporation of NEM was essentially complete (>85%) after 5 min of incubation as indicated by ES mass spectrometry. Upon incubation of MGST1 with NEM, enzyme activation was accompanied by a mass shift of the monomer corresponding to the addition of one NEM molecule/monomer (Fig. 3, A and B). The observed molecular mass of the most abundant species of monomer (i.e. acetylated) increased from 17,382 to 17,507 Da after NEM modification (Fig. 3). NEM labeling also shifted the peaks corresponding to MGST1 trimers to higher m/z values. The 9+ charge state of the MGST1 trimer was shifted from m/z 5898.6 to m/z 5940.5 (Fig. 3, C and D). This shift corresponds to a mass increase of 377 Da, in good agreement with the addition of 125 Da/monomer. These data also substantiate the identification of the envelope of ions in the m/z 5000–9000 range as corresponding to MGST1 homotrimers.Fig. 3NEM modification of MGST1.

Detergent-solubilized proteins are difficult to analyze by ES mass spectrometry due to the competitive ionization of excess detergent. In a preliminary study, different classes of detergents (MEGA-10, Thesit, Zwittergent 3–12) were tested (data not shown), but Triton X-100 was found to be the most compatible with the ES analysis of proteins. Therefore, we initially determined the level of Triton X-100 compatible with the ES analysis of noncovalent protein complexes using the tetramer of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase as a model noncovalent protein complex. Unsurprisingly, there was a decreased response for protein multimer ions with increasing amounts of detergent under fixed desolvation conditions (data not shown). As the detergent is surface active, and in excess, it will compete with protein ions in the desorption process from the ES-generated droplets and, furthermore, will form adducts with protein ions. By recording ES spectra at a relatively high cone voltage (180 V), it was established that the energetic interface conditions improved the alcohol dehydrogenase tetramer peak shape and signal intensity. This preliminary study showed that, although the presence of detergent is deleterious to ES analysis, low levels of detergent (i.e. <0.1%) can be tolerated.By reconstituting MGST1 in a minimum amount of Triton X-100 in the presence of GSH, the enzyme could be stabilized in its active form. Enzyme activity in the low detergent buffer was measured, demonstrating correctly folded"
https://openalex.org/W1973346467,"The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) forms a disulfide-linked dimer through cysteine residues within its N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD). However, these disulfide linkages are dispensable for the formation of the dimeric CaR and for the functional reconstitution of two inactive CaRs. In this study, using molecular modeling, mutagenesis, and biochemical and biophysical analyses, we examined the importance of two leucine residues, Leu-112 and Leu-156, in the ECD of the CaR for the non-covalent dimerization and functional reconstitution. We found that the mutant receptor carrying L112S and L156S still exists mostly as a covalently linked dimer and has a significantly higher apparent affinity for calcium than the wild-type receptor. However, a combination of four mutations, L112S, L156S, C129S, and C131S, significantly reduces receptor dimerization and markedly inactivates the CaR. We also found that L112S and L156S mediate the non-covalent intermolecular interactions important for functional reconstitution. Because mutating either the two cysteines or the two leucines enhances the apparent ligand affinity of the CaR, it is likely that the changes in intermolecular relationships between two receptor protomers linked by these leucines and cysteines are essential for receptor activation. Moreover, these mutations are unlikely to have negative effects on the secondary structure of each protomer of the dimeric receptor. Thus, the detrimental effects of the combined mutations on the function of the CaR further suggest that CaR dimerization through its ECD is essential for the formation of a functional tertiary structure of the CaR.

Biometrics. 1955; 11: 1-42Google Scholar). The CaR is a G protein-coupled receptor that activates phospholipase C and mobilizes intracellular calcium in response to elevated concentrations of [Ca2+]o, other divalent and trivalent inorganic cations, and organic polyamines. Recently, we have shown that the CaR forms a covalently linked dimer on the cell surface (2Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Google Scholar) and dimerizes even in the absence of any interprotomer disulfide linkage (3Zhang Z. Sun S. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5316-5322Google Scholar), suggesting that interprotomer interactions in addition to covalent disulfide bonds are critical for dimerization of the CaR. Through functional reconstitution of various pairs of inactivating mutant receptors, we demonstrated that non-covalent dimerization of the CaR is functionally important (3Zhang Z. Sun S. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5316-5322Google Scholar, 4Bai M. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2834-2839Google Scholar). The CaR belongs to the subfamily C of G protein-coupled receptors, which share significant sequence and structural homology with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Like the mGluRs (5Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Google Scholar, 6Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Google Scholar, 7Nakanishi S. Nakajima Y. Masu M. Ueda Y. Nakahara K. Watanabe D. Yamaguchi S. Kawabata S. Okada M. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 230-235Google Scholar), the CaR interacts with its cationic agonist in its unusually large ECD (613 residues) (8Hammerland L.G. Krapcho K.J. Garrett J.E. Alasti N. Hung B.C. Simin R.T. Levinthal C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 642-648Google Scholar, 9Brauner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18382-18386Google Scholar). The interprotomer disulfide linkages of both the CaR and mGluRs are formed only between dimeric ECD protomers (3Zhang Z. Sun S. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5316-5322Google Scholar, 10Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28144-28151Google Scholar). Although these disulfide linkages are dispensable for the dimerization and the functional reconstitution of the CaR (3Zhang Z. Sun S. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5316-5322Google Scholar), a collaborative involvement of two ECD protomers of the CaR is important in the sensing of [Ca2+]o (4Bai M. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2834-2839Google Scholar). Thus, the structural integrity of the dimeric ECD of the CaR has to be maintained by non-covalent interprotomer interactions within the ECD in the absence of the disulfide linkages. In accordance, crystallographic studies suggest that the interprotomer disulfide bond in mGluR1 is unlikely to act as a structural scaffold to support the defined interprotomer relationships because of its location within the disordered segment. Instead, the dimeric ECD of mGluR1 possesses a well defined dimer interface, with its location apart from that of the cysteine mediating the interprotomer disulfide bond (12Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Google Scholar). Studies of the possible sites of interprotomer interactions have suggested that dimerization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) could be mediated by hydrophobic interactions, involving associations of the extracellular domains (ECDs), transmembrane domains (TMDs), and/or C-terminal tails (C-tails) (13Rios C.D. Jordan B.A. Gomes I. Devi L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 71-87Google Scholar). The presence of conserved hydrophobic residues at the dimer interface of the ECD of mGluR1 suggests that hydrophobic interactions between the ECDs may play an important role in the dimerization of this receptor (12Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Google Scholar). The functional importance of these hydrophobic residues has been examined by Sato et al. (14Sato T. Shimada Y. Nagasawa N. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4314-4321Google Scholar), showing that one of hydrophobic residues at the dimer interface, Ile-120, was critical for setting the active state of the mGluR1. However, there is no study presently that shows the importance of Ile-120 and other hydrophobic residues at the dimer interface for the dimerization of mGluR1 nor that links the dimerization of mGluR1 to receptor activation. In this study, we elucidated the relations between receptor dimerization and activation of the CaR. We found that the CaR dimerizes through non-covalent interactions between two ECD protomers and that conserved Leu-112 and Leu-156 are important in mediating the non-covalent dimerization critical for the functional reconstitution. In addition, we found that the dimerization of the ECD via non-covalent as well as covalent interactions is essential to confine the CaR in an inactive conformation under non-stimulating conditions. Site-directed Mutagenesis—We used the site-directed mutagenesis approach described by Kunkel (15Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar) to produce mutated receptors in which the leucine residues at positions 112 and 156 on the putative dimer interface of the human CaR were mutated individually to serines. The dut-1 ung-1 strain of Escherichia coli CJ236 was transformed separately with mutagenesis cassettes 1 and 2, as described previously (16Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Google Scholar). To introduce mutation L112S into a mutant receptor containing C129S and C131S, we made another cassette 1 containing two Cys-to-Ser mutations. Uracil-containing, single-stranded (ss) DNA was produced by infecting the cells with the helper phage VCSM13 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The ssDNA was then annealed to a mutagenesis primer that contained the desired nucleotide change encoding a single-point mutation flanked on both sides by wild-type sequences. The primer was subsequently extended around the entire ssDNA and ligated to generate closed circular heteroduplex DNA. DH5α-competent cells were transformed with these DNA heteroduplexes, and incorporation of the desired mutation was confirmed by sequencing the entire cassettes. The resultant mutated cassette 1 or 2 containing the desired mutation was doubly digested with KpnI and BspEI or BspEI and NheI and cloned into the full-length of the receptor in pcDNA3. Construction of CaR-fused YFP and CFP—ECFP or EYFP was fused to the cytoplasmic tail of the CaR by replacing C-terminal 172 amino acid residues with these fluorescence proteins. We used PCR to amplify the coding region of the ECFP and EYFP with a BamHI site at the 5′-end and XbaI site at the 3′-end, using a primer pair, 2279 (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′) and 2280 (5′-GCTCTAGATTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCA-3′). The PCR products containing ECFP or EYFP are digested with BamHI and XbaI and subcloned to the CaR in pcDNA3 through an internal BamHI site and an external XbaI at the 3′-end of the coding region of the CaR. The point mutations in the CaR that are generated by site-directed mutagenesis were moved into YFP- and CFP-fused CaR by subcloning the mutation-containing cassettes, as described previously (16Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Google Scholar). Transient Expression of CaRs in HEK293—CaR cDNA was prepared with the Midi Plasmid Kit (Qiagen). LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) was employed as a DNA carrier for transfection. The HEK293 cells used for transient transfection were provided by NPS Pharmaceuticals (Salt Lake City, UT) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone). The DNA-liposome complex was prepared by mixing DNA and LipofectAMINE in OPTI-MEM I-reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) and incubating the mixture at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-LipofectAMINE mixture was then diluted with OPTI-MEM I-reduced serum medium and added to 90% confluent HEK293 cells plated on 13.5 × 20.1-mm glass coverslips using 2.5 μg of DNA. After the cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, an equivalent amount of OPTI-MEM I-reduced serum medium with 20% FBS was added to the medium overlying the transfected cells, and the latter was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS at 24 h after transfection. The expressed [Ca2+]o-sensing receptor protein was assayed 48 h after the start of transfection. To co-express two receptors, 1.25 μg of each of the two cDNAs was mixed and used to transfect HEK293 cells. Detection of Expressed CaR on the Cell Surface—Before whole cell lysates were prepared, intact HEK293 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged CaR were labeled with 1 mm ImmunoPure N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce), a membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, as described previously (2Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Google Scholar). The surface-biotinylated HEK293 cells were solubilized, and the FLAG-tagged receptor was immunoprecipitated with FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The immunopurified species were subsequently eluted and subjected to SDS-containing PAGE with a linear gradient of polyacrylamide (3-10%). The forms of the receptor present on the cell surface were detected with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad), followed by visualization of the biotinylated bands with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For cross-linking experiments, we added an appropriate amount of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3), a noncleavable, membrane-impermeable cross-linker (Pierce), into the labeling solution with ImmunoPure N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin. Measurement and Calculation of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer in Fixed Cells—Cells singly or co-expressing CaR-fused CFP and YFP were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and observed with a Nikon Diaphot-300 epifluorescence microscope with a 100-watt mercury lamp, a 60-Å and ∼1.4 numerical aperture Plan-APO objective, Nomarski optics, and the following filter sets (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT): CFP (440-nm/20-nm excitation filter, 455-nm longpass dichroic mirror, 480-nm/30-nm emission filter); YFP (500-nm/25-nm excitation, 525-nm dichroic, 545-nm/35-nm emission); and FRET (440-nm/20-nm excitation, 455-nm dichroic, 535-nm/25-nm emission). Images were captured with a liquid-cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) equipped with a KAF-1400 chip, operated by the MetaMorph imaging system (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) and a Model D122 shutter driver (UniBlitz, Rochester, NY). The exposure time is 100 ms. We used a 100× object lens to view the images and employed the image-processing technique called Threshold Exclusion to selectively quantitate the fluorescence signals at the rim or surface of the cells that had fluorescent intensity much greater than that inside the cells. Because CFP and YFP are not an ideal pair of fluorophores due to overlapping emission and excitation spectra of the donor (CFP) and the acceptor (YFP), a certain amount of the CFP emission leaked through the FRET filter, and a certain amount of YFP was directly excited by the FRET excitation wavelength when cells were observed under the FRET filter set. To eliminate these experimental artifacts, the following correction was performed for each pair of CFP and YFP, FRET=IFRET-CCFP-CYFP(Eq. 1) where IFRET is the intensity of FRET in CFP- and YFP-co-expressed cells measured by the FRET filter set and CCFP and CYFP are the contributions from the emission of CFP and direct excitation of YFP, respectively (17Jin T. Yue L. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12879-12884Google Scholar). These two contributions could not be directly measured in cells co-expressing the YFP and CFP. However, they could be measured in cells expressing only CFP or YFP. The contributions of YFP and CFP to FRET in co-expressed cells are proportional to those in single-expressed cells (18Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Google Scholar), CCFPinco-transfectedcellswithFRETfilterICFPinco-transfectedcellswithCFPfilter=CCFPinsinglytransfectedcellswithFRETfilterICFPinsinglytransfectedcellswithCFPfilter(Eq. 2) and CYFPinco-transfectedcellswithFRETfilterIYFPinco-transfectedcellswithYFPfilter=CYFPinsinglytransfectedcellswithFRETfilterIYFPinsinglytransfectedcellswithYFPfilter(Eq. 3) where ICFP and CCFP in the singly transfected cells are the intensities of CFP observed under the CFP filter set and FRET filter set, respectively, and IYFP and CYFP in the singly transfected cells were the intensities of YFP observed under the YFP filter set and FRET filter set, respectively; ICFP and IYFP in the co-transfected cells were the intensity of CFP observed under the CFP filter set and the intensity of YFP observed under the YFP filter set. In singly transfected cells, CCFP/ICFP and CYFP/IYFP were determined to be 0.61 and 0.38 for the wild-type CaR-fused CFP and YFP; 0.63 and 0.39 for the mutant CaR-fused CFP and YFP; and 0.64 and 0.36 for non-fused CFP and YFP, respectively. In co-transfected cells, we first measured the FRET with the FRET filter set, then the IYFP with the YFP filter set, and finally the ICFP with the CFP filter set. We used the equations above to calculate CCFP and CYFP in co-transfected cells and subsequently FRET. Because FRET intensity is a function of the expression level of CFP and YFP, it is not possible to compare FRET intensity between cells expressing different levels of CFP and YFP. To compare FRET between cells, we normalized the FRET signal to the expression of CFP and YFP that was proportional to ICFP and IYFP, respectively. The normalized FRET signals, FRET/(ICFP × IYFP), in multiple cells were averaged and their standard errors of the mean (S.E.) were calculated. Measurement of [Ca2+]i by Fluorometry in Cell Populations—HEK293 cells, which were plated on coverslips and transfected with CaR cDNAs, were loaded for 2 h at room temperature with Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% dextrose and washed once at 37 °C for 20 to 30 min with a buffer solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% dextrose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The coverslips were then placed diagonally in a thermostatted quartz cuvette that contained the buffer solution, using a modification of the technique employed previously (19Fajtova V.T. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E151-E158Google Scholar). The CaR was activated by multiple additions of [Ca2+]o in incremental doses to reach the desired concentrations. Excitation monochronometers were centered at 340 nm and 380 nm, with emission light collected at 510 ± 40 nm through a wide-band emission filter. The 340/380 excitation ratio of emitted light was used as readout for [Ca2+]i as described previously (19Fajtova V.T. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E151-E158Google Scholar). The activities of the wild-type and mutant CaRs were determined in response to increasing concentrations of [Ca2+]o. The mean EC50 values for receptors were calculated from the EC50 values for all individual experiments and were expressed with S.E. as the index of dispersion. Each of the experiments presented in the results was performed at least three times. Among the three crystal structures of the ECD of mGluR1 that have been determined (12Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Google Scholar), two crystal forms of mGluR1 ECD were obtained without glutamate; one exists as an open-open dimer (Protein Data Bank number 1EWT) and the other as an open-closed dimer (1EWV). Only one crystal form was obtained with glutamate (1EWK), similar to the open-closed form obtained without glutamate (1EWV). In all three crystal forms, each protomer consists of a lobe I (LB1) domain and a lobe II (LB2) domain. Only the LB1 domain provides the dimer interfaces. Fig. 1 shows a ribbon diagram of a model of the CaR ECD obtained by submitting a partial sequence of the CaR ECD to the SWISS-MODEL, a fully automated protein structure homology-modeling server, accessible via the ExPASy web server (20Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar, 21Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Google Scholar, 22Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Google Scholar). Even though we submitted the sequence of the CaR ECD with all three crystal structures of mGluR1 as templates, the SWISS-MODEL successfully generated only one model for the CaR corresponding to the open-open conformer of mGluR1a (1EWT). The two conserved leucine residues, Leu-112 and Leu-156, are predicted at the dimer interfaces (Fig. 1). The Leu-156 residue in one protomer is in close contact with its counterpart in the other protomer, whereas the Leu-112 in one protomer is aligned spatially with its counterpart in the other protomer but is not in very close contact. Therefore, our model predicts that Leu-156 plays more important role than Leu-112 in mediating hydrophobic interprotomer interactions. To demonstrate that the key hydrophobic dimerization motifs of the CaR are present in the ECD, we tested whether a CaR lacking both the cysteines that mediate interprotomer disulfide linkages and the TMs 2 to 7 could remain associated with a co-expressed full-length receptor during immunoprecipitation. Our previous studies have shown that the truncated receptor, R648Stop, is expressed on the surface but functionally inactive (23Yamauchi M. Sugimoto T. Yamaguchi T. Yano S. Wang J. Bai M. Brown E.M. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 2174-2182Google Scholar). Here, we further demonstrated that the truncated receptor, C129S/C131S/R648Stop, was also expressed on the cell surface but at a level significantly lower than those of R648Stop and the full-length receptors (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). When we co-transfected a FLAG-tagged receptor and a non-tagged receptor, we found that the non-tagged truncated receptor, C129S/C131S/R648Stop, could be readily co-immunoprecipitated with a tagged full-length receptor, C129S/C131S (Fig. 2, lane 3), and vice versa: the non-tagged full-length receptor, C129S/C131S, could be readily co-immunoprecipitated with a tagged truncated receptor, C129S/C131S/R648Stop (Fig. 2, lane 4), where the less-expressed, tagged, truncated receptor, C129S/C131S/R648Stop, was mostly in association with the non-tagged full-length receptor, C129S/C131S. In addition, the stability of the truncated receptor C129S/C131S/R648Stop is significantly increased when it was associated with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that the expression level of the truncated receptor is dependent on the formation of homodimers and heterodimers. Our previous studies have shown that non-tagged receptors when transfected alone could not be immunoprecipitated by the FLAG M2 antibody (2Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Google Scholar). These results suggest that non-covalent dimerization motifs present in the ECD are strong enough to hold the dimeric receptor together through the process of immunoprecipitation. To test whether the hydrophobic residues at the dimer interfaces of the ECD are important for forming CaR dimers, we mutated Leu-112 and Leu-156 in the CaR to hydrophilic serines. We examined the effects of these mutations on expression and dimerization of the CaR in the presence or absence of C129S and C131S (3Zhang Z. Sun S. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5316-5322Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that all the mutant receptors had cell-surface expression similar to the wild-type receptor and that the receptors carrying leucine mutations still mostly exist as disulfide-linked dimers. Only a trace amount of the mutant receptor carrying both L112S and L156S was detected as a monomer under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Next, we co-transfected some of these mutant receptors with the CaRs C-terminally truncated at either 877 or 648. The truncated receptor, A877Stop, has seven TMs intact, whereas the other, R648Stop, has only TM 1. Both non-tagged truncated receptors were co-immunoprecipitated with the tagged wild-type receptor when the leucines and cysteines were intact (Fig. 4, lane 1). Likewise, both non-tagged truncated receptors, A877Stop and R648Stop, were co-immunoprecipitated with the tagged mutant receptors carrying single or double leucine mutations, L112S and L156S (Fig. 4, lanes 2-4), via disulfide-linkages (data not shown). In contrast, neither non-tagged truncated receptor was effectively co-immunoprecipitated with the mutant receptors, if these truncated receptors had the two cysteine mutations that disrupt the interprotomer disulfide linkages (Fig. 4, lanes 6-8). For instance, C129S/C131S/R648Stop was hardly co-immunoprecipitated with any receptor carrying single or double leucine mutations, whereas the co-immunoprecipitated C129S/C131S/A877Stop was significantly reduced. These data support the hypothesis that the Leu-112- and Leu-156-containing dimer interface in the ECD is the major site that mediates non-covalent dimerization via the ECD. The similar co-immunoprecipitations of R648Stop and C129S/C131S/R648Stop with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 5) suggest that the stability of these heterodimers is similar, although their corresponding homodimeric receptors had different stability (Fig. 2).Fig. 4Co-immunoprecipitation of the receptors with cysteine and leucine mutations. Various tagged full-length receptors with leucine mutations were co-transfected with non-tagged receptors C-terminally truncated at 877 (A) and 648 (B). The co-transfected cells were biotinylated before being lysed in the presence of 100 mm iodoacetamide. After immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibody, elution with SDS sample buffer containing DTT and SDS-PAGE (3-10%), CaR surface expression was detected with avidin. In lanes 5-8, the truncated receptors have two cysteine mutations, C129S and C131S, disrupting the covalent interactions between two protomers. The full-length receptors are wild-type receptors in lanes 1 and 5 and mutant receptors carrying L112S in lanes 2 and 6, L156S in lanes 3 and 7, or L112S/L156S in lanes 4 and 8. The full-length and truncated receptors are indicated as F and T, respectively, on the right-hand side.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Nevertheless, the presence of both intact TMDs in full-length and truncated receptors resulted in reduced but detectable co-immunoprecipitation of co-transfected C129S/C131S/A877Stop (Fig. 4A, lanes 6-8), indicating that hydrophobic interactions between TMDs of the dimeric CaR also contribute to the dimerization of the CaR. The reduction in co-immunoprecipitated C129S/C131S/A877Stop suggests that the strengths of non-covalent interactions between TMDs are not adequate to hold all the dimeric receptor together through the process of immunoprecipitation. Next, we determined whether the dimerization of the CaR was significantly reduced when the receptor pair lost interactions mediated by the two cysteines and two leucines. To capture the dimeric CaR while it was still on the surface of the intact cells, we performed a cross-linking experiment on the mutant receptor carrying two cysteine mutations and one or two leucine mutations. The cell-surface proteins were treated with a cross-linking reagent (BS3) prior to the lysis of the cells. The cross-linked dimeric receptor is expected to be resistant to reducing agents, such as DTT. Under reducing conditions, the amount of the dimer relative to the monomer increased in cells transfected with the CaR with or without mutations as the concentration of the cross-linker increased (Fig. 5A). However, the change in dimer/monomer ratio in cells transfected with the mutant receptor L112S/C129S/C131S/L156S was significantly less than that in cells transfected with the wild-type receptor and other mutant receptors (Fig. 5B). The apparently low surface detection in samples treated with high concentrations of BS3 was due to the fact that both the biotinylation reagent and BS3 were chemically linked to the same pool of lysine residues on the CaR. As a result"
https://openalex.org/W2044249604,"Various mitogenic or growth inhibitory stimuli induce a rapid change in the association of terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs with polysomes. It is generally believed that such translational control hinges on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-S6 kinase pathway. Amino acid availability affects the translation of TOP mRNAs, although the signaling pathway involved in this regulation is less well characterized. To investigate both serum- and amino acid-dependent control of TOP mRNA translation and the signaling pathways involved, HeLa cells were subjected to serum and/or amino acid deprivation and stimulation. Our results indicate the following. 1). Serum and amino acid deprivation had additive effects on TOP mRNA translation. 2). The serum content of the medium specifically affected TOP mRNA translation, whereas amino acid availability affected both TOP and non-TOP mRNAs. 3). Serum signaling to TOP mRNAs involved only a rapamycin-sensitive pathway, whereas amino acid signaling depended on both rapamycin-sensitive and rapamycin-insensitive but wortmannin-sensitive events. 4). Eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha phosphorylation increased during amino acid deprivation, but not following serum deprivation. Interestingly, rapamycin treatment suggests a novel connection between the mTOR pathway and eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha phosphorylation in mammalian cells, which may not, however, be involved in TOP mRNA translational regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2028935740,"Topoisomerase I adjusts torsional stress in the genome by breaking and resealing one strand of the helix through a transient covalent coupling between enzyme and DNA. Camptothecin, a specific topoisomerase I poison, traps this covalent intermediate, thereby damaging the genome. Here we examined the activity of topoisomerase I at telomeric repeats to determine whether telomere structures are targets for DNA damage. We show that topoisomerase I is catalytically active in cleaving the G-rich telomeric strand in vitro in the presence of camptothecin but not in cleaving the C-rich strand. The topoisomerase I cleavage site is 5′-TT↓AGGG-3′ (cleavage site marked by the ↓). We also show that endogenous topoisomerase I can access telomeric DNA in vivo and form camptothecin-dependent covalent complexes. Therefore, each telomeric repeat represents a potential topoisomerase I cleavage site in vivo. Because telomere structures are comprised of a large number of repeats, telomeres in fact represent a high concentration of nested topoisomerase I sites. Therefore, more telomeric DNA damage by camptothecin could occur in cells with longer telomeres when cells possess equivalent levels of topoisomerase I. The evidence presented here suggests that DNA damage at telomeric repeats by topoisomerase I is a prominent feature of cell killing by camptothecin and triggers camptothecin-induced apoptosis.

The process involves passing an intact DNA strand through an enzyme·DNA cleavage gate followed by resealing (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

The single-stranded DNA cleavage is a transesterification reaction and involves the concurrent formation of a transient covalent bond between the active site tyrosine in topo I and the 3′-phosphoryl end of the broken DNA strand. Under normal physiological conditions, the cleavage/religation reaction strongly favors the resealed state of DNA, thereby minimizing DNA breakage; however, topo I-active poisons, such as camptothecin (CPT) and its derivatives, stabilize covalent complex formation leading to accumulated DNA breaks in the genome (4Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The efficacy of topo I poisons as anticancer agents may be related to the fact that drug-mediated cleavage complexes stabilized during S phase are much more toxic than those stabilized during G1 and G2 phases (5Horwitz S.B. Horwitz M.S. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 2834-2836PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Viglianti G.A. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar). During DNA replication, the replication fork is thought to collide with the trapped covalent cleavable complexes, resulting in a double strand break and eventually cell death (7Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 8Svejstrup J.Q. Christiansen K. Gromova I.I. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Mol.

Because tumor cells typically have a higher mitotic index relative to normal surrounding tissues, cell cycle considerations are likely to be important in selectivity of CPT; however, other tumor selectivity mechanisms may also be operable. DNA cleavage by topo I is only weakly sequence-specific with the predominant cleavage sites bearing a thymine residue at the 3′ DNA terminus of cleavage sites (9Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20418-20423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, topo I activity may be ubiquitous across the genome at large. CPT preferentially traps a subset of the enzyme cleavage sites, those having a guanine residue immediately 3′ to the cleaved bond (9Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol.

Analysis of the sequences surrounding the topo I cleavage sites revealed a degenerate consensus sequence in the presence or absence of CPT (9Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J.

Based on published consensus data noted above, topo I could bind and act at telomeric repeats. Telomeres are DNA sequences at the physical ends of linear chromosomes that enable cells to distinguish chromosome ends from any other form of double strand interruption in the genome (14Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar, 15Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Without functional, intact telomeres, the chromosomes are prone to degradation leading to apoptosis and cell death (16Blackburn E.H.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 503-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the ends may rearrange by recombination or fusion. In vivo, it is thought that telomeres form a large folded loop formed by the invasion of the 3′ overhang into the duplex part of the telomeric repeats (19Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S.

Telomere structure can be disrupted by direct damage, critical shortening, or defects in telomere-associated proteins, resulting in loss of telomere function referred to as telomere dysfunction. Cells respond to telomere dysfunction by undergoing a senescence, apoptosis, or genomic instability, depending on the cell or tissue context (18Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J.

Previously, we reported that eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II) has access to regions of telomeres in chromatin (21Yoon H.J. Choi I.Y. Kang M.R. Kim S.S. Muller M.T. Spitzner J.R. Chung I.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the finding that chromatin structure at the distal ends of the telomeric repeats has characteristics of open or diffuse chromatin structure (22Tommerup H. Dousmanis A. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5777-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The accessibility of cellular enzyme to telomeres in chromatin, in conjunction with consensus predictions of topo I cleavage activity at the telomere sequence, suggests that topo I may also access telomeric chromatin to form endogenous enzyme·DNA covalent complex in vivo. Because normal and transformed cells often differ with regard to telomere sequence and telomerase activity and because topo I is an effective anticancer target, we examined topo I targeting of the telomeric repeats. Here, we show that topo I is catalytically active in cleaving the G-rich telomeric strand in vitro in the presence of CPT and that endogenous topo I·DNA covalent complexes are present in chromosomal telomeric DNA in CPT-treated cells. These results suggest that telomeric DNA damage by topo I may be one of the early events in CPT-induced apoptosis. Materials, Enzymes, and Drugs—The topo I antibody isolated from serum of scleroderma patients and the topo II antibody directed against the C terminus of p170-kDa form were obtained from TopoGEN, Inc. (Columbus, Ohio). High pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were purchased from Genotech, Inc. (Seoul, Korea), and radioactive nucleotides were from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were from Promega. Human topo I purified from freshly extracted human placenta was obtained from TopoGEN, Inc. CPT, coralyne, and etoposide were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid Construction—A series of plasmids (pHT) was constructed to contain different lengths of human telomeric repeats as follows. The double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides, (TTAGGG)3, (TTAGGG)4, and (TTAGGG)6, were prepared by mixing equal molar quantities of two complementary strands and were then ligated into the SmaI site of pBS (Stratagene) to create pHT-G3, -G4, and -G6. The oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All constructs were verified by dideoxy DNA sequencing. Preparation of Substrate Fragments and Topo I Cleavage Reactions— Substrate fragments were prepared by 3′-32P-end labeling of the BamHI (or HindIII) digest of the plasmid pHT using α-[32P]dATP and Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, with subsequent digestion with HindIII (or BamHI). The labeled DNA was purified by non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cleavage reactions were carried out on 3′-end-labeled DNA fragments in 20 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm mercaptoethanol). Topo I poisons were added at concentrations given in each experiment. The reactions were initiated by the addition of two units of purified human topo I, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and terminated by addition of SDS to 0.5% followed by incubation with 50 μg/ml proteinase K at 56 °C for 30 min. The DNA cleavage products were precipitated with ethanol, resolved by denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and identified by comparison with the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing ladders (21Yoon H.J. Choi I.Y. Kang M.R. Kim S.S. Muller M.T. Spitzner J.R. Chung I.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—The human cervical cancer cell line HeLa and the human prostate carcinoma cell line DU145 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. The human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 and the human vulval carcinoma cell line A431 were cultured in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. In Vivo Complex of Topoisomerase (ICT) Bioassay—Topo I·DNA covalent complexes were trapped by an antibody-based ICT bioassay as previously described (23Subramanian D. Furbee C.S. Muller M.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar, 24Muller M.T. Mehta V.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Subramanian D. Kraut E. Staubus A. Young D.C. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with CPT at indicated concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium. The cells were directly lysed and overlaid onto CsCl step gradients as described in detail elsewhere (23Subramanian D. Furbee C.S. Muller M.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were collected from the bottom, and the DNA peak fractions were localized by determining the absorbance at 260 nm. Each fraction (50 μl) was applied to Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in a slot blot device. The human topo I antibody was incubated with membranes, and the immunoblot signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of Topo I·Telomere Complexes in Vivo—The DNA fractions from the CsCl gradients (containing a mixture of free DNA and topo I·DNA complex) were dialyzed and digested with HaeIII. To detect the topo I·telomere DNA complex, the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-K+ precipitation method was used as described in detail elsewhere (21Yoon H.J. Choi I.Y. Kang M.R. Kim S.S. Muller M.T. Spitzner J.R. Chung I.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Trask D.K. DiDonato J.A. Muller M.T. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were treated with SDS to 1%, followed by the addition of 0.1 volume of 2.5 m KCl. After 15 min on ice, the precipitates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 3 min, and the pellets were washed and digested with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) at 56 °C for 30 min. DNA samples were then applied to Hybond N+ membrane in a slot blot device for Southern blotting. The membrane was hybridized with a human telomeric probe prepared by random-prime labeling of a BamHI-PstI fragment from plasmid pHT-600 (21Yoon H.J. Choi I.Y. Kang M.R. Kim S.S. Muller M.T. Spitzner J.R. Chung I.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To detect topo I cleavage on telomeric repeats in vivo, SDS-K+ precipitates and supernatants were resolved by electrophoresis in an alkaline 1% agarose gel followed by Southern blotting using (CCCTAA)4 oligonucleotide as a probe. Topo I Cleavages on Telomeric Repeats in Vitro—CPT stimulates DNA single strand breaks by preferentially trapping a subset of the topo I cleavage sites (9Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20418-20423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn K.W. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1988; 202: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because DNA sequence selectivity is consistent with the ubiquity of function of topo I in the genome, we compared the enzyme consensus sequence data with various genomic sequences. This analysis revealed that the human telomeric repeat sequence displays considerable homology to the consensus sequence for vertebrate topo I (9Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20418-20423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Been M.D. Burgess R.R. Champoux J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3097-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To examine topo I cleavage activity directly, we performed the topo I cleavage reactions on a linear, 3′-end-labeled DNA target containing various lengths of telomeric repeats. Cleavage sites in the absence and presence of CPT were analyzed on a sequencing gel along with chemical sequencing ladders. As shown in Fig. 1A, a single topo I cleavage was detected at each repeat on G-rich strand. In addition, the number of topo I cleavage sites is commensurate with the number of telomeric repeats in the target sequence (pHT-G3 showed 3 cleavages, and pHT-6 showed 6, etc.). Because telomeric DNA is a tandem array of the 5′-TTAGGG3-′ and a single topo I cleavage occurs every six base pairs (Fig. 1B), a highly polymerized telomere may constitute a rather high affinity topo I cleavage environment in the human genome. We also note that cleavages were strongly or totally dependent on the presence of CPT. Topo I cleavage was not detected in reactions lacking the drug or containing 100 μm coralyne, a different but potent inducer of topo I·DNA cleavage complex. The concentrations of CPT and coralyne used in reactions were sufficient to induce topo I cleavages in other sequences (data not shown). We next determined whether the opposite (C-rich) strand possesses a topo I cleavage site. There were no topo I cleavages detected within the 5′-CCCTAA-3′ repeat sequences (Fig. 2, left panel). When the duplex DNA containing both G- and C-rich repeats on the same strand was used, topo I cleavage was observed only in the region of 5′-TTAGGG3-′ repeats, and we again observed no cleavage in the 5′-CCCTAA-3′ repeats (Fig. 2, right panel). These results clearly indicate that the G-rich side of each telomeric repeat supports a single, prominent topo I cleavage that is strongly dependent upon CPT. Formation of Topo I·Telomere Covalent Cleavable Complex in CPT-treated Cells—To determine whether endogenous topo I can access telomeric DNA in chromatin and form covalent cleavage complexes with telomeric DNA in vivo, we utilized an antibody-based ICT bioassay (23Subramanian D. Furbee C.S. Muller M.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar). This method has been successfully used to directly evaluate the action of endogenous topo I on genomic DNA in the presence of the enzyme poisons (25Subramanian D. Kraut E. Staubus A. Young D.C. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar) and in response to endogenous DNA damage (27Subramanian D. Rosenstein B.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 976-984PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mao Y. Okada S. Chang L.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4538-4543PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of topo I poisons, the breaks are stabilized and a covalent topo I·DNA complex can be trapped upon addition of protein denaturants. Genomic DNA was purified from HeLa cells that were untreated or treated with CPT using a preparative step CsCl gradient that resolves free protein (1.3 g/cc) from DNA (1.7 g/cc) (Fig. 3A). Various gradient fractions were subjected to immunoblotting analysis with a topo I antibody. Topo I was consistently detected in the DNA peak fractions of CPT-treated cells but was not detected in the DNA fractions of untreated control cells (Fig. 3B). These data establish that topo I·DNA complexes are present in DNA fractions of the preparative CsCl gradient from CPT-treated cells. To determine whether the telomeric DNA was associated with topo I, the DNA peak fractions from CPT-treated or untreated HeLa cells were recovered, dialyzed, and digested with HaeIII, followed by SDS-K+ precipitation (26Trask D.K. DiDonato J.A. Muller M.T. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). SDS-K+ treatment separates topo I-bound DNA (precipitate) from unbound free DNA (supernatant). As an internal control, SDS-K+ precipitation was performed on proteinase K-treated DNA. Proteinase K digestion will remove topo I from the DNA to reveal nonspecific trapping of naked DNA in the SDS-K+ precipitates. The DNA was recovered from the various SDS-K+ fractions and was loaded onto a slot blot device that was subsequently analyzed by Southern blotting using a probe derived from telomeric repeats. In the absence of drug, no signal was detected in the SDS-K+ precipitates, consistent with the result that the DNA peak fractions did not contain topo I in the untreated sample. Furthermore, the SDS-K+ supernatant and precipitate signals were not affected by proteinase K digestion (Fig. 4). When HeLa cells were treated with CPT at concentration of 1 or 10 μm for 1 h, the precipitated DNA samples clearly contained detectable telomeric DNA signals. If the same DNA fractions were digested with proteinase K before SDS-K+ precipitation, the signals were significantly reduced (Fig. 4). Residual signals in the SDS-K+ precipitates were due to nonspecific trapping of naked telomeric DNA. Quantification of the signal intensities of individual slots revealed that about 11% of total telomeric DNA was involved in the formation of topo I·telomere complexes under these conditions in vivo. Because detection of the protein is CPT-dependent, these results suggest the presence of a stably bound topo I on telomeric DNA in vivo. The topo I·telomere complex formation was highly reproducible in subsequent repeat experiments. Topo I·Telomere Complex Formation in Various Cell Lines Possessing Different Telomere Lengths—Because CPT induces topo I-mediated cleavages on telomeric DNA in vivo and topo I sites are clustered throughout the telomere, more topo I/CPT binding sites could be present in cells with longer telomeres. To examine this possibility, various cell lines possessing different telomere lengths were treated with CPT and subjected to ICT assay, followed by SDS-K+ precipitation. As measured by terminal restriction fragment (TRF) analysis, HeLa and HT1080 cells exhibited a heterogeneous size distribution with an average telomere length of ∼6 kb, whereas A431 and DU145 cells showed relatively short telomeres with a mean length of ∼3 kb (Fig. 5A). When HeLa and HT1080 cells were treated with 10 μm CPT for 1 h, ∼11% of total telomeric DNA fragments were contained in the SDS-K+ precipitates, which is consistent with the results of Fig. 4. On the other hand, the SDS-K+ precipitates from CPT-treated A431 and DU145 cells (10 μm for 1 h) contained 4.7 and 3.6% of total telomeric DNA, respectively (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that cells possessing longer telomeres have a larger number of topo I/CPT binding sites in their telomeres. The signals of the SDS-K+ precipitates were lost in all cell lines when the DNA peak fractions were digested with proteinase K before SDS-K+ precipitation. In the absence of CPT, we observed no signal in the SDS-K+ precipitates (Fig. 5B). To test the specificity of the telomeric DNA detected in the SDS-K+ precipitates, the membranes were stripped and rehybridized with an Alu probe. As shown in Fig. 5C, all the SDS-K+ precipitations brought down similar amounts of AluDNA, regardless of telomere length. Only a small fraction (1.6–2.3%) of total AluDNA was involved in the formation of topo I·AluDNA complexes in the presence of CPT. These results suggest that enrichment of telomeric DNA by CPT treatment in the SDS-K+ precipitates is specific and that all cell lines examined possess nearly equivalent levels of topo I. Topo I Cleavage on G-rich Telomeric Strand in Vivo—To verify that topo I was catalytically active at chromosome ends, HeLa cells were treated with 10 μm CPT for 1 h and subjected to TRF analysis (21Yoon H.J. Choi I.Y. Kang M.R. Kim S.S. Muller M.T. Spitzner J.R. Chung I.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). DNA was recovered from the CsCl gradient and digested with HaeIII, which liberates the TRF, followed by SDS-K+ precipitation. To detect CPT-mediated DNA breaks on G-rich telomeric strand, the SDS-K+ supernatants (which are depleted of topo I·DNA complexes) and precipitates (topo I-bound DNA) were digested with proteinase K, loaded on an alkaline-agarose gel, and analyzed by Southern blotting using (CCCTAA)4 oligonucleotide as a probe. The TRFs from the SDS-K+ supernatants display size heterogeneity because their length varies for the different chromosomes (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–3) (29de Lange T. Shiue L. Myers R.M. Cox S.L. Naylor S.L. Killery A.M. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). A TRF hybridization signal was seen in the SDS-K+ precipitate from CPT-treated cells but not detected in untreated cells (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 4 and 6). The results are consistent with the SDS-K+ precipitation data showing that topo I cleaves the telomeric repeats in the presence of CPT. We previously demonstrated the association of endogenous topo II with telomeric DNA in etoposide-treated cells (21Yoon H.J. Choi I.Y. Kang M.R. Kim S.S. Muller M.T. Spitzner J.R. Chung I.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A Southern blot signal was detected in the SDS-K+ precipitate from cells treated with 100 μm etoposide (Fig. 6A, lane 5). A TRF hybridization signal of etoposide-treated sample was roughly 3–5 times less (different experiments) than that of CPT-treated cells (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that CPT induces higher DNA cleavages on telomeric repeats than etoposide. When the DNA fractions were digested with proteinase K before SDS-K+ precipitation, we observed no hybridization signal in the SDS-K+ precipitates even in the longer exposure (Fig. 6B). The following evidence supports our contention that topo I recognizes and reacts at telomeres. First, there is excellent homology to consensus data that predict topo I·DNA complex formation in the presence of CPT. Second, this prediction was verified at the nucleotide level by DNA sequencing of cleavage sites in vitro. Third, sequencing data reveal that topo I cuts each repeat once; therefore, longer telomeres are more likely to represent fertile genomic environment for topo I cleavages because the DNA target sites are highly clustered. Fourth, we demonstrated recovery of CPT-dependent topo I·telomeric DNA complexes directly from cells treated with CPT. Because CPT is highly specific for topo I and we demonstrate the presence of topo I in the genomic DNA fraction from cells, it is logical to conclude that topo I is responsible for the SDS-K+ precipitation of telomeric DNA. Fifth, telomeric DNA in the SDS-K+ precipitate was eliminated if the DNA was digested with proteinase K prior to addition of KCl; thus, the recovery of DNA requires the presence of protein. Sixth, analysis of terminal restriction fragments, recovered after SDS-K+ precipitation, demonstrated the presence of telomeric DNA only when cells were CPT-treated. Moreover, when this same DNA (from CPT-treated cells) was protease-digested prior to SDS-K+ precipitation, all telomeric DNA was eliminated. DNA site selection by topo I is not totally random. Several reports have analyzed sequence selectivity of the cleavage reactions and have derived degenerate consensus cleavage sequence (9Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20418-20423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Been M.D. Burgess R.R. Champoux J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3097-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The preferred nucleotide positions on the scissile strand extend from positions -4 to -1 as follows: 5′-A or T, G or C, A or T, T ↓ -3′ (cleavage site marked by the ↓). The enzyme is covalently attached to the -1 residue. Based on consensus data base predictions, we demonstrated that topo I cleaves the G-rich telomeric strand in vitro at one strong site (↓) as shown: 5′GGGTT↓AGGGTT3′. The cleavage in the telomeric repeats is totally dependent upon CPT. DNA sequence analysis of topo I cleavage sites showed that CPT stabilizes the enzyme preferentially at sites having a +1 guanine residue (9Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20418-20423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn K.W. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although 5′-TTAGGG-3′ repeats do not display a perfect match to the topo I consensus sequence derived in the presence of CPT, each telomere repeat is sufficiently homologous to promote topo I recognition. The polymeric nature of the sites should also enhance affinity for telomeric regions of the chromosome when viewed as a genomic environment for targeted action of topo I. This suggests that topo I cleavage sites mapped in vitro are likely to be recognized in vivo and that the relative strength of the cleavage signal in vivo is a result of the repetitive, polymeric nature of the telomeric sequence. In contrast, the C-rich telomeric repeats do not fit topo I consensus sequence, nor did we detect DNA cleavage at the C-rich strands in the presence or absence of topo I poisons. Telomeres are distinctive protein-DNA caps that distinguish chromosome ends from double strand breaks in the genome (14Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar, 15Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Chromatin structures at distal telomere regions are nuclease-hypersensitive and appear to have altered nucleosome repeat intervals compared with bulk chromatin (22Tommerup H. Dousmanis A. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5777-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Nuclease hypersensitivity indicates that the chromatin structure is highly accessible to trans-acting factors, such as topo I, which is consistent with our mapping data. Our data are also consistent with cleavage activity along the entire length of the telomere; however, we cannot conclude that topo I acts within the t loop (19Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar) (nor can we rule it out at this time). Our in vitro data demonstrate that CPT treatment causes the formation of topo I·DNA covalent complex at each G-rich telomeric repeat. Our in vivo experiments were not conducted at the level of single nucleotide resolution; therefore we cannot state definitively that the in vivo cut site is at the same exact nucleotide demonstrated by sequencing data with purified enzyme. Based on consensus sequence homology, however, it seems very likely that the in vitro and in vivo sites are coincident down to the nucleotide (see Fig. 1B). In addition to sequence selectivity, topo I has been shown to preferentially recognize and cleave bent DNA (30Caserta M. Amadei A. Di Mauro E. Camilloni G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8463-8474Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Krogh S. Mortensen U.H. Westergaard O. Bonven B.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The bent helix conformation of the t loop might represent an attractive, high affinity binding region for topo I, although we cannot conclude that topo I is acting in t loops as noted above. The physiological role of topo I in telomere function is not known. Topo I participates in post-DNA damage response, and distortions in helix such as DNA mismatches, abasic sites, and UV photoproducts trap topo I cleavable complexes in vivo in the absence of CPT (27Subramanian D. Rosenstein B.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 976-984PubMed Google Scholar, 32Pourquier P. Ueng L.M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the topo I·DNA damage response is dependent on cell cycle checkpoints activated by p53 after UV-damaged DNA (28Mao Y. Okada S. Chang L.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4538-4543PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that topo I is a specific DNA damage site-nicking enzyme and a repair-proficient topoisomerase in vivo. Based on these observations, our data demonstrating the presence of topo I activity at telomeric regions in vivo suggest that topo I may play a role in DNA repair processing in response to endogenous telomere DNA damage. We hypothesize that DNA damage at telomeric repeats by topo I is a prominent feature of apoptosis by CPT (Fig. 7). This is consistent with a recent report that telomere loss occurs at early stages of CPT-induced apoptosis (33Ramirez R. Carracedo J. Jimenez R. Canela A. Herrera E. Aljama P. Blasco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 836-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although CPT-induced DNA damage occurs at many sites throughout the genome, the telomere repeats may, in fact, be favored. In addition to the polymeric nature of telomeres, noted above, each chromosome contributes the same sequence; thus, an additional amplification of target should be extant. Nested topo I recognition elements in telomeres should represent an unusually high affinity domain when viewed in a genomic context in vivo. Cells possessing longer telomeres have a larger number of topo I/CPT binding sites in telomeres compared with cells possessing short telomeres. As a result, more telomeric DNA damage by CPT could occur in cells with longer telomeres if cells have identical topo I levels (Fig. 7). Cancer cells are able to replicate indefinitely, and the presence of telomerase and stabilized telomeres is associated with immortalization. Some tumors maintain or increase the overall length of their telomeres by a mechanism of alternative lengthening of telomeres (34Henson J.D. Neumann A.A. Yeager T.R. Reddel R.R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 598-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, a large percentage of cancer cells expressing telomerase display shorter telomeres than normal cells (35Counter C.M. Botelho F.M. Wang P. Harley C.B. Bacchetti S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3410-3414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of immediate interest to examine whether more topo I molecules are recruited to the telomeres in cancer cells compared with normal cells. Although this report shows that CPT induces telomeric DNA damage by topo I, many questions remain on how tumor cells are preferentially susceptible to CPT. Topo I-mediated telomeric DNA damage by CPT may be one of many different scenarios for tumor selectivity."

Such methods convert the unphosphorylated form, “GPb,” which catalyzes glycogenolysis only in the presence of appropriate allosteric activators such as AMP, to the phosphorylated, constitutively activated form, “GPa.” However, activation of GP in this way is indirect, requires a functional cAMP kinase cascade, and is complicated by other actions of cAMP. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for the experimental manipulation of GP in intact dermal fibroblasts, involving activation by the membrane-permeable adenosine analog 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) and inhibition by caffeine and Pfizer compound CP-91149, which bind to GP at distinct sites. Potential complications because of activation of AMP-activated protein kinase by AICAR were assessed with metformin, which activates this kinase but does not activate GP.

Its formation from UDP-Glc and breakdown to Glc-1-P 1The abbreviations used are: Glc-1-P, glucose-1 phosphate; Glc-6-P, glucose-6 phosphate; Fru-6-P, fructose-6 phosphate; Man-1-P, mannose-1 phosphate; Man-6-P, mannose-6 phosphate; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; GP, glycogen phosphorylase; LLO, lipid-linked oligosaccharide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: Glc-1-P, glucose-1 phosphate; Glc-6-P, glucose-6 phosphate; Fru-6-P, fructose-6 phosphate; Man-1-P, mannose-1 phosphate; Man-6-P, mannose-6 phosphate; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; GP, glycogen phosphorylase; LLO, lipid-linked oligosaccharide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. are catalyzed, respectively, by glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase (GP). GP exists in two forms, depending upon its phosphorylation state (1Johnson L.N. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). “GPb,” the unphosphorylated form, can be stimulated by allosteric activators such as AMP. Alternatively, phosphorylase kinase can convert the enzyme into its phosphorylated, covalently activated form “GPa,” which no longer requires allosteric activation. The regulation of GP may be complicated further by phosphatases and phosphatase inhibitors and the abilities of enzymes such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (2Polekhina G. Gupta A. Michell B.J. van Dendersen B. Murthy S. Feil S.C. Jennings I.G. Campbell D.J. Witters L.A. Parker M.W. Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Curr.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) to bind to glycogen. Recently, interest has been generated in glycogen as a source of hexose units in N-linked glycoproteins (4McMahon R.J. Frost S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E640-E645PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gill A. Gao N. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44747-44753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Protein N-linked glycosylation requires the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. The oligosaccharide unit is transferred by oligosaccharyl transferase to asparaginyl residues on nascent proteins (6Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar). LLO synthesis requires contributions of enzymes in both the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum. In the cytoplasm, precursor nucleotide sugars are synthesized. In contrast, the endoplasmic reticulum is the site of assembly of the LLO, requiring UDP-GlcNAc, GDP-mannose, and UDP-glucose as well as the lipids mannose-P-dolichol and glucose-P-dolichol, which are synthesized from GDP-mannose and UDP-glucose, respectively. Two independent approaches have suggested that phosphorolysis of glycogen to form Glc-1-P can be stimulated under particular forms of cellular stress and that the Glc-1-P can be converted sequentially to Glc-6-P, Fru-6-P, Man-6-P, Man-1-P, and GDP-mannose in sufficient quantities to substantially enhance glycoconjugate synthesis. Impaired LLO mannosylation in cultured 3T3-L1 and Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells correlated with glycogen depletion resulting from glucose starvation (4McMahon R.J. Frost S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E640-E645PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, increased glucose phosphate production and glycogenolysis were coincident with endoplasmic reticulum stress and improved LLO mannosylation (5Gill A. Gao N. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44747-44753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although such experiments suggest that glycogen may be a significant precursor of mannosyl units for glycoconjugate synthesis, in each case glycogenolysis was activated indirectly. This problem could be solved by deliberate activation of GP. However, current approaches for experimental stimulation of GP in intact cells require activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase/phosphorylase kinase cascade by adding an appropriate receptor agonist, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, or a membrane-permeable form of cAMP. Activation of phosphorylase kinase by these methods results in the conversion of GPb to GPa, but other pathways also respond to cAMP, so it would be difficult to attribute any effects on LLO synthesis solely to activation of GP. Here, we examined 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), which like metformin (7Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4407) Google Scholar) is widely reported to cause activation of AMPK in cells (8Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). AICAR enhanced LLO extension as anticipated, but surprisingly its mechanism was inconsistent with that of metformin (9Shang J. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9703-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Through a pharmacological approach, we show that AICAR enhanced LLO synthesis primarily by stimulating GP not AMPK. Reagents—Compound CP-91149 (10Martin W.H. Hoover D.J. Armento S.J. Stock I.A.

AICAR (number A611700) was from Toronto Research Chemicals. AICAR-P (ZMP, number A1393), metformin (number D5035), and caffeine (number C0750) were from Sigma. All of the above reagents were prepared as stock solutions in water. Cell culture media were from Invitrogen, and sera were from Atlanta Biologicals. [2-3H]d-Mannose (10–20 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences, and 2-deoxy-[G-3H]d-glucose (10 Ci/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Culture of Normal and CDG Type I Dermal Fibroblasts—Dermal fibroblasts were cultured as described earlier (11Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Shang J. Korner C. Freeze H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were generally grown to 80–90% of confluence for experiments. As described earlier (12Shang J. Korner C. Freeze H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) the fibroblasts used were normal CRL-1904 (American Type Culture Collection). Analysis of [3H]Mannose-labeled LLOs and N-Linked Glycans by HPLC—Glycans were analyzed as described (11Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Shang J. Korner C. Freeze H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) by incubating cells for 20 min in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5 mm glucose, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and 40 μCi/ml (2.5 μm) [3H]mannose. [3H]-labeled LLOs and N-glycans were recovered and fractionated by HPLC as described previously (11Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Shang J. Korner C. Freeze H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Zeng Y. Lehrman M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In some experiments 0.1 mm unlabeled d-mannose was included during the 20-min labeling period. When indicated, the peak heights of [3H]mannose-labeled glycans detected by HPLC were normalized to their mannose contents to determine their percentages in glycan pools (11Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hexose Uptake Measurements—Uptake of tritium-labeled mannose and 2-deoxyglucose was done over a 10-min period as described (9Shang J. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9703-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Assay of Glycogen Phosphorylase in Fibroblast Extracts—Assays were performed essentially as described (5Gill A. Gao N. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44747-44753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Extracts were prepared by streptolysin O permeabilization (14Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E. Hofsteenge J. Waechter C.J. Lehrman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A solution was prepared (0.56 ml) with 31.3 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 3.13 mm MgSO4, 3.57 mm NADP+, and 1.79 mg/ml glycogen (Sigma catalog number G1508) and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature (empirically it was noticed that assay reproducibility was greatly enhanced by keeping the NADP+ solution at room temperature for at least 2 h). Water, enzymes (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to 5.7 μg/ml, and rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase to 4.3 units/ml), glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (to 4.3 μm), and any activators or inhibitors were added to a final volume of 0.7 ml. The reaction was initiated by adding 0.3 ml of extract containing 0.02 mg of cytoplasmic protein or the corresponding buffer. GP activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Multiple data points were collected over a period of 4 h at room temperature. Over this period assays were linear, and the resulting slopes were used to determine activity. Values for blank reactions lacking extract were routinely subtracted out. Stimulation of LLO Extension by AICAR—Potential enzyme activators and inhibitors were tested with primary dermal fibroblasts refed daily with RPMI 1640 medium containing normal glucose (11 mm). To evaluate the effects on synthesis of LLOs and glycoproteins, cells were then labeled for 20 min with 2.5 μm [2-3H]mannose in medium adjusted to 0.5 mm glucose. In our hands this glucose concentration shifts the distribution of LLOs from mostly Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (i.e. completed LLO) to Man2-5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol intermediates as the predominant species (9Shang J. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9703-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The effects of 0.5 mm glucose on LLO synthesis are prevented if the labeling reaction also includes 0.1 mm mannose, which efficiently drives LLO mannosylation (11Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, enzyme modulators could be evaluated for stimulatory effects on LLO synthesis by labeling in medium with 0.5 mm glucose, whereas inhibitory effects could be discerned with medium containing 0.5 mm glucose and 0.1 mm mannose. Because metformin is a positive modulator of LLO synthesis (9Shang J. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9703-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) we examined AICAR, as it has been widely reported that treatment of cells with AICAR, like metformin, activates AMPK (8Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). This requires intracellular conversion of AICAR to the phosphorylated nucleotide 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (designated AICAR-P for simplicity) by adenosine kinase (15Sabina R.L. Kernstine K.H. Boyd R.L. Holmes E.W. Swain J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10178-10183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sabina R.L. Patterson D. Holmes E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6107-6114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AICAR-P allosterically activates purified AMPK, although with a substantially lower affinity than AMP (17Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 18Henin N. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Depending upon the cell type and the experimental system, AICAR-P in intact cells appears to act primarily either by allosteric activation of AMPK (19Longnus S.L. Wambolt R.B. Parsons H.L. Brownsey R.W. Allard M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: R936-R944Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or by making AMPK a better substrate for the upstream-activating kinase complex containing LKB1 (20Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Mäkelä T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28.1-28.15Crossref Google Scholar). In any case, the mechanism of AICAR-P differs from that of metformin, which does not activate the isolated enzyme but can activate AMPK in intact cells (7Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4407) Google Scholar, 21Hawley S.A. Gadalla A.E. Olsen G.S. Hardie D.G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2420-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, AICAR enhanced extension of LLO intermediates (a and b) and increased the proportion of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 transferred to protein (e and f). However, if LLO extension was optimized by the inclusion of 0.1 mm mannose (Fig. 1, c and d), AICAR had no effect. Interestingly, the efficacy of AICAR was consistently greater than that of metformin (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol for controls was typically 1.5 versus 13% in metformin-treated cells and 29% in AICAR-treated cells), which stimulates LLO synthesis mainly by enhancing mannose uptake (9Shang J. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9703-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the effect of metformin on mannose transport (1.8-fold (9Shang J. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9703-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)) was greater than that of AICAR (1.3 ± 0.02-fold (n = 22); Fig. 2b), suggesting different mechanisms of action. Like metformin (9Shang J. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9703-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), AICAR did not increase transport of 2-deoxyglucose in fibroblasts (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2Contribution of mannose uptake to the effect of AICAR on LLO extension. Transport of 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose (2-dGlc) (a) or [3H]mannose (b) was measured with cells treated in the absence (open bars) or presence (closed bars) of 2 mm AICAR (averages of triplicates ± S.E.). c–f, cells were treated in the absence or presence of 2 mm AICAR (for 7 h) as indicated. Cultures were incubated with 40 μCi/ml [3H]mannose, 40 μCi/ml [3H]mannose with AICAR, or 60 μCi/ml [3H]mannose. [3H]Mannose uptake was measured as seen in c (average of six determinations ± S.E.). LLOs were analyzed from identical sets of cultures, and HPLC chromatograms (d–f) were placed directly below the corresponding bars in c.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify that AICAR was less dependent than metformin upon mannose uptake for its effect on LLO synthesis, incubations were done with 40 μCi/ml [3H]mannose, 40 μCi/ml [3H]mannose with AICAR, or 60 μCi/ml [3H]mannose. As shown in Fig. 2c, compared with 40 μCi/ml [3H]mannose alone, treatment of cells with AICAR has less of an effect on mannose uptake than using 60 μCi/ml [3H]mannose. However, the relative amounts of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol were 1.6% for 40 μCi/ml [3H]mannose alone, 31.7% for 40 μCi/ml [3H]mannose with AICAR, and 3.9% for 60 μCi/ml [3H]mannose (Fig. 2, d–f), indicating that mannose uptake was not a significant factor for AICAR treatment of fibroblasts. AICAR-P Activates Glycogen Phosphorylase in Fibroblast Extracts—AICAR/AICAR-P has been reported to activate the AMP-dependent form of glycogen phosphorylase, GPb, in skeletal (22Young M.E. Radda G.K. Leighton B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and cardiac (19Longnus S.L. Wambolt R.B. Parsons H.L. Brownsey R.W. Allard M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: R936-R944Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) muscle systems. In both cases AICAR-P activated GP in muscle homogenates, but distinct mechanisms were suggested. Noting that phosphorylase kinase had been reported to be a possible substrate of AMPK (23Carling D. Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1012: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) (although a more recent study failed to reach a similar conclusion (24Beyer A. Kitzerow A. Crute B. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)), in skeletal muscle GPb activation was proposed to involve the binding of AICAR-P to AMPK with a sequential phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase and phosphorylation of GPb (22Young M.E. Radda G.K. Leighton B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) rather than to involve the binding of AICAR-P directly to the AMP activation site on GPb. However, the homogenate experiments did not appear to include ATP or an ATP-generating system and were done under conditions in which all three enzymes in the cascade were diluted 130-fold with respect to the homogenate. In contrast, in cardiac muscle, activation by the effects of AICAR was proposed to involve direct allosteric activation of GP by AICAR-P rather than activation of a kinase cascade. This was supported by the observations that treatment of muscle with AICAR led to increased glycogenolysis, decreased glycogen content, no change in the phosphorylation state of AMPK, and no evidence of covalent activation of AMPK or GP. However, phosphorylation of a substrate of AMPK suggested that AICAR did activate AMPK allosterically. We found that a commercial preparation of muscle GPb (Sigma) could be activated by AICAR-P as well as AMP in the absence of ATP (data not shown), which is highly consistent with direct allosteric activation of GPb by AICAR-P. Importantly, 5 mm AMP and 5 mm AICAR-P, alone and in combination, stimulated GP activity in fibroblast extracts (Fig. 3, upper panel, lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10), whereas AICAR and metformin did not (data not shown). In these experiments cytoplasmic components were highly diluted, and reactions were done in the absence of ATP. Therefore, the results are consistent with direct allosteric activation and in discord with a sequential enzyme cascade mechanism. AICAR-dependent LLO Extension Is Blocked by Inhibitors of Glycogen Phosphorylase—To determine whether AICAR enhanced LLO extension by activating GP in intact fibroblasts, two inhibitors of GP were evaluated. Caffeine, which binds to the nucleoside-inhibitory site of GP (1Johnson L.N. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), had no effect on GP activity by itself (data not shown). However, it blocked the stimulation of GP in fibroblast extracts by AMP and AICAR-P (Fig. 3, upper panel, lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). Using the system for LLO synthesis introduced in Fig. 1, caffeine by itself did not stimulate mannosylation of LLOs (Fig. 3, lower panel, a, d, f, and i). However, as shown in Fig. 3, b and g, caffeine eliminated the stimulatory effect of AICAR on LLO extension (the chromatograms shown are representative of four independent experiments). Caffeine did not inhibit the effect of 0.1 mm mannose on LLO synthesis (Fig. 3, c and h), showing that it did not inhibit the relevant mannosyltransferases nonspecifically. Although both GP and AMPK are potential targets for AICAR-P, metformin is known only to activate the latter. GP in fibroblast extracts was not activated by metformin (data not shown), and the ability of metformin to stimulate LLO extension was not blocked by caffeine (Fig. 3, e and j). Pfizer compound CP-91149 is a highly specific inhibitor of GP, acting both in vitro and in vivo (10Martin W.H. Hoover D.J. Armento S.J. Stock I.A. McPherson R.K. Danley D.E. Stevenson R.W. Barrett E.J. Treadway J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1176-1181Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar). CP-91149 binds to a novel site on GP (25Rath V.L. Ammirati M. Danley D.E. Ekstrom J.L. Gibbs E.M. Hynes T.R. Mathiowetz A.M. McPherson R.K. Olson T.V. Treadway J.L. Hoover D.J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 677-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) distinct from the caffeine binding site. Therefore, CP-91149 was used to verify whether AICAR acted by stimulating GP. Although CP-91149 was identified as an inhibitor of hepatic GPa, it also inhibited commercial preparations of muscle GPa in the absence of AMP and, somewhat unexpectedly, muscle GPb activated by AMP (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 (upper panel, lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11), CP-91149 inhibited both AMP- and AICAR-P-activated GP in fibroblasts extracts. CP-91149 was then tested as an inhibitor of the AICAR-stimulated extension of LLOs in intact cells (Fig. 4, upper panel). Like caffeine, 20 μg/ml CP-91149 by itself did not promote LLO extension (Fig. 4, a and c), but it blocked the stimulatory effect of AICAR (b and d). This confirmed that AICAR acted by stimulating GP. The inhibitory effects of CP-91149 were dose-dependent, with less inhibition by 10 μg/ml. It was noticed that the efficacy of the AICAR treatment for LLO synthesis was variable, and the 10 μg/ml dose of CP-91149 was considerably more effective as an inhibitor when the efficacy of AICAR was lower (Fig. 4, lower panel). When AICAR increased Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol above 20% of the LLO pool, 10 μg/ml CP-91149 had no discernable effect. Consistent with previous results, the effects of metformin on LLO extension were not blocked by CP-91149 (not shown). AICAR differed from metformin in three important ways, in support of the conclusion that the primarily targets of AICAR and metformin in fibroblasts are GP and AMPK, respectively. (i) The effect of AICAR but not metformin on LLO extension was blocked by caffeine and CP-91149. (ii) The effect of metformin but not AICAR on LLO extension was highly dependent upon its ability to stimulate mannose uptake. (iii) AICAR-P, but not metformin, stimulated GPb in fibroblast extracts. These results were unexpected, because AICAR has been reported to activate AMPK in a number of systems, and the fibroblasts were responsive to metformin. Perhaps, compared with other systems, these cells may have a greater ratio of GP to AMPK. Thus, AICAR may be activating both enzymes, but GP activation may be more readily detected and have a much greater significance. Another possibility is that mannose transport in fibroblasts is controlled by an atypical AMPK cascade that is responsive to metformin but not to AICAR. It is interesting that HeLa cells lack functional LKB1 (20Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Mäkelä T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28.1-28.15Crossref Google Scholar), but mannose transport in HeLa cells is responsive to metformin (9Shang J. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9703-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There is little doubt that AICAR was converted to AICAR-P in fibroblasts, as it is in many mammalian systems (8Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar), especially because AICAR did not activate GP in extracts. Estimates based upon formation of AICAR-P from AICAR in Chinese hamster ovary cells (16Sabina R.L. Patterson D. Holmes E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6107-6114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and muscle (15Sabina R.L. Kernstine K.H. Boyd R.L. Holmes E.W. Swain J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10178-10183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are consistent with intracellular concentrations in the millimolar range sufficient to activate GP. A canine plasma AICAR concentration of 0.34 mm resulted in approximate AICAR-P tissue concentrations of 0.14 mm in skeletal muscle and 0.81 mm in cardiac muscle (15Sabina R.L. Kernstine K.H. Boyd R.L. Holmes E.W. Swain J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10178-10183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); extrapolation to 2 mm AICAR (as used in this study) therefore suggests fibroblast intracellular AICAR-P concentrations of ∼1–5 mm. Similarly, Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells treated for 7 h with 0.7 mm AICAR accumulated 11 nmol of AICAR-P/mg of cellular protein (16Sabina R.L. Patterson D. Holmes E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6107-6114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our hands, packed fibroblasts giving a volume of 1 ml would contain roughly 0.5 g of total protein, suggesting that incubation of fibroblasts with 2 mm AICAR for 7 h (as done here) might result in ∼15 mm intracellular AICAR-P. In any case, these results show that the combination of an activator (AICAR/AICAR-P) with inhibitors that act by distinct mechanisms (caffeine and CP-91149) can be used for the experimental evaluation of GP. This strategy should be applicable whether AICAR-P activates GP allosterically or stimulates AMPK to phosphorylate phosphorylase kinase, because the two inhibitors are effective for GPb and GPa. These results also demonstrate that the Glc-1-P resulting from glycogenolysis can be a significant source of hexose units for glycoconjugate assembly and provide a proof-of-principle for activation of glycogenolysis by the unfolded protein response as the cause of enhanced LLO extension (11Doerrler W.T. Lehrman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13050-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Shang J. Korner C. Freeze H. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the GP modulators used here provide glycobiologists with a novel approach for experimentally altering glycoconjugate synthesis. GP and AMPK respond to variations in energy metabolism, which can be caused by transient drops in cytoplasmic hexose concentrations. Such fluctuations are likely to affect LLO synthesis and energy metabolism in tandem. Therefore, GP and AMPK may have important roles in maintaining a consistent supply of hexose for LLOs and presumably for other glycoconjugates, such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, that require GDP-mannose.

https://openalex.org/W1997607156,"10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) converts 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, a precursor for nucleotide biosynthesis, to tetrahydrofolate. The protein comprises two functional domains: a hydrolase domain that removes a formyl group from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate and a NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase domain that reduces the formyl to carbon dioxide. As a first step toward deciphering the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, we have determined the crystal structure of the hydrolase domain of FDH from rat, solved to 2.3-Å resolution. The structure comprises two domains. As expected, domain 1 shares the same Rossmann fold as the related enzymes, methionyl-tRNA-formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase, but, unexpectedly, the structural similarity between the amino-terminal domain of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and methionyl-tRNA-formyltransferase extends to the C terminus of both proteins. The active site contains a molecule of β-mercaptoethanol that is positioned between His-106 and Asp-142 and that appears to mimic the formate product. We propose a catalytic mechanism for the hydrolase reaction in which Asp-142 polarizes the catalytic water molecule and His-106 orients the carbonyl group of formyl. The structure also provides clues as to how, in the native enzyme, the hydrolase domain transfers its product to the dehydrogenase domain. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) converts 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, a precursor for nucleotide biosynthesis, to tetrahydrofolate.

The structure also provides clues as to how, in the native enzyme, the hydrolase domain transfers its product to the dehydrogenase domain. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) 1The abbreviations used are: FDH, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; GART, glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase; FMT, methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase; THF, tetrahydrofolate; βME, β-mercaptoethanol; Nt-FDH, amino-terminal domain of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; r.m.s., root mean square; 5dTHF, 5-deaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate. (EC 1.5.1.6) is an abundant enzyme in several tissues (1Krupenko S.A. Oleinik N.V. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 227-236Google Scholar), comprising up to 1% of total cytosolic protein (2Kisliuk R.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 85: 183-190Google Scholar). In vitro, FDH converts 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-formyl-THF) to tetrahydrofolate in either an NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase reaction or an NADP+-independent hydrolase reaction (Fig. 1). The substrate for FDH, 10-formyl-THF, forms a major intracellular folate pool (3Horne D.W. Patterson D. Cook R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 729-733Google Scholar) and serves as a formyl donor in two reactions of de novo purine biosynthesis (4Benkovic S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 320-322Google Scholar). The product of the FDH-catalyzed reaction, THF, can be converted to 5,10-methylene-THF, which is required for thymidine biosynthesis, and then to 5-methyl-THF, which is required for S-adenosylmethionine biosynthesis. The precise metabolic role for FDH is unclear, but one possibility is that it converts excess 10-formyl-THF from the de novo purine pathway back to the THF pool (5Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 23-42Google Scholar). Another may be a protective one against formate toxicity by removing formate, in the form of CO2 (6Tephly T.R. Life Sci. 1991; 48: 1031-1041Google Scholar). Folate derivatives are required for the biosynthesis of the nucleotide precursors of DNA and RNA, and hence folate-metabolizing enzymes are critical for proper cell functioning. Elevated levels of these enzymes, including the key folate enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase, occur in rapidly proliferating cancer cells (1Krupenko S.A. Oleinik N.V. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 227-236Google Scholar, 7Chu E. Allegra C.J. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 109-148Google Scholar, 8Banerjee D. Mayer-Kuckuk P. Capiaux G. Budak-Alpdogan T. Gorlick R. Bertino J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1587: 164-173Google Scholar). By contrast, FDH is expressed at much lower levels in tumors compared with corresponding normal tissues (1Krupenko S.A. Oleinik N.V. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 227-236Google Scholar). In fact, elevation of intracellular levels of FDH in cultured cancer cell lines inhibits proliferation and results in cytotoxicity (1Krupenko S.A. Oleinik N.V. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 227-236Google Scholar). This suppressor effect of FDH is dependent upon its enzymatic activity (1Krupenko S.A. Oleinik N.V. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 227-236Google Scholar). These studies imply that FDH may possess a growth-regulatory function and that cancer cells lower FDH expression to enhance proliferation. FDH is a homotetramer of 902 amino acid residue monomers (9Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar, 10Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Google Scholar) where each monomer comprises two distinct functional domains connected by a 110-amino acid residue linker (9Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar). The binding site for folate is located in the N-terminal region of the enzyme (termed Nt-FDH, residues 1-310) (11Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Google Scholar). This domain shows sequence similarity with folate-binding domains in other proteins, including methionyl-tRNA- formyltransferase (FMT) and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GART) (9Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar, 11Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of FDH (residues 420-902) shows up to 50% sequence identity with aldehyde dehydrogenases (9Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar, 12Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Google Scholar, 13Hempel J. Nicholas H. Lindahl R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1890-1900Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the N-terminal domain is expressed separately, it functions as a 10-formyl-THF hydrolase, resulting in the production of formate (11Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Google Scholar), whereas the dehydrogenase reaction is catalyzed only by the full-length FDH (11Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Google Scholar, 12Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Google Scholar). This suggests that the hydrolase activity of the N-terminal domain contributes to the overall dehydrogenase reaction and, therefore, some functional communication between the two domains must exist. Thus, FDH is an interesting example of a natural fusion of two unrelated proteins that creates a new enzymatic activity. A further issue is whether the hydrolase reaction can occur in vivo independently of the dehydrogenase domain or whether these reactions are always coupled. The significance of the hydrolase reaction alone for cellular metabolism is not clear. Since this reaction does not require NADP+, one proposal is that the hydrolase reaction is used to produce THF irrespective of the redox state of the cell (14Rios-Orlandi E.M. Zarkadas C.G. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 24-35Google Scholar). Typically, NADPH levels in liver are 10-30-fold higher than NADP+ (15Greenbaum A.L. Clark J.B. Biochem. J. 1965; 95: 161-166Google Scholar), so the hydrolase activity could maintain THF levels when NADP+ is low. Interestingly, an enzyme called formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase catalyzes the same conversion of 10-formyl-THF to THF and formate in Escherichia coli (16Nagy P.L. McCorkle G.M. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7066-7073Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of this reaction under some circumstances. Enzymes similar to E. coli hydrolase are not apparent in eukaryotes, so this function might be performed by FDH. Contrary to this argument, if the hydrolase reaction were to occur in tandem with the synthesis of 10-formyl-THF, which is the opposite reaction, catalyzed by 10-formyl-THF synthase and coupled with ATP hydrolysis, the result will be a “futile cycle” that simply consumes energy. Moreover, in vitro, the hydrolase reaction requires millimolar concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol (17Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 651-655Google Scholar), and, given that β-mercaptoethanol is not present naturally in the cell, it is unlikely that this reaction occurs in vivo independently of the overall dehydrogenase activity of FDH (although it remains possible that other reducing agents such as glutathione could act in a similar manner). Previously, we have proposed a sequence of steps to describe the dehydrogenase mechanism of FDH (18Krupenko S.A. Vlasov A.P. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24030-24037Google Scholar). In this scheme, the hydrolase domain catalyzes the removal of the formyl group from 10-formyl-THF, followed by its transfer to the aldehyde dehydrogenase domain by an unknown mechanism where it is oxidized to CO2. As a first step toward deciphering the catalytic mechanism of FDH, we are pursuing structural studies of this enzyme. In this paper, we report the crystal structure of Nt-FDH from rat solved to 2.3-Å resolution. Data Collection—The expression and crystallization of Nt-FDH has been described previously (19Chumanevich A.A. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1841-1842Google Scholar). Briefly, Nt-FDH crystallizes in space group P21212 with cell dimensions a = 100.0 Å, b = 64.6 Å, and c = 64.6 Å. All crystals used for data collection were passed through a cryoprotectant solution containing 1.3 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 27% glycerol and then flash-frozen in situ using an X-Stream cryostat (Rigaku MSC). Diffraction data were collected on an RAXISIV++ image plate detector mounted on a RU-H3R rotating anode x-ray generator fitted with Osmic Confocal optics (Rigaku MSC) and operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. Data were collected at a crystal-to-plate distance of 150 mm, with an oscillation angle of 0.5° and an exposure time of 5 min/frame. Typically 100° of data were sufficient to generate essentially complete data sets. Data were collected and processed using Crystal Clear (20Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Google Scholar). Friedel pairs were not merged in order to retain the anomalous signal. To improve the phasing (and for refinement purposes), a new native set was collected in place of one described previously (19Chumanevich A.A. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1841-1842Google Scholar). Phasing—A search for derivatives was made by soaking crystals in solutions of heavy atom compounds in stabilizing buffer (1.3 m ammonium sulfate buffered in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6). The degree of substitution by heavy atoms in each data set was evaluated using difference Patterson maps. For the first derivative so identified, heavy atom positions were determined from the Patterson maps and refined prior to phasing at 3.0 Å. Subsequent derivatives were identified by difference Fouriers using the current best phases. Where measurable, contributions from the anomalous signal of the heavy atom were included in the phasing calculations. All calculations were performed using PHASES (21Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 277: 590-620Google Scholar). Model Building and Refinement—Electron density maps were calculated using CCP4 programs (22Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) and displayed using the O program (23Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y.S.W.C. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Starting with the crystal structure of FMT (24Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1FMT) as a guide, a model was built and then refined by alternating rounds of XPLOR (25Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and manual revision using O. In later rounds, water molecules were included where visible in both the 2 Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc map and with suitable hydrogen binding partners. The final rounds of refinement were performed using REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of the final model was evaluated using PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (1S3I). Preparation of Cysteine to Alanine Mutants—The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate five mutants of Nt-FDH, each replacing a cysteine with an alanine. Mutagenesis was performed on cDNA cloned into the pRSET vector. Each construct containing the mutation was then transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue cells, as described previously (28Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 146-152Google Scholar). After selection on LB-ampicillin plates, plasmids were isolated from individual colonies using the Quantum Prep kit (Bio-Rad) and the presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The entire coding region of each clone was also sequenced to ensure the absence of random mutations. Each mutant protein was expressed in E. coli and purified in the same manner as described previously for wild-type Nt-FDH (28Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 146-152Google Scholar). The hydrolase activity of each mutant enzyme was assayed using 10-formyl-DDF as a substrate, as described previously (17Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 651-655Google Scholar). Each assay was performed twice, and the numbers reported are an average of these two experiments. Structure Determination—The structure of Nt-FDH was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering. Data from crystals soaked in mercury, platinum, and uranyl compounds were used for the phasing. The best derivative was obtained using thimerosal, and this was used to identify other weaker derivatives by difference Fouriers. The data collection and phasing statistics are shown in Tables I and II, and portions of both the experimental, calculated at 3.0 Å, and final 2Fo - Fc electron density maps, at 2.4 Å, are shown in Fig. 2. The refinement of this structure was rather complicated, because several regions of the molecule were difficult to fit due to weak density, and this is one contribution to the comparatively high R and Rfree values of the structure. In particular, the region around residues 85-88 was difficult to place correctly. In fact, the density appears to encompass at least two conformations in this region, and this suggests that it may become ordered upon binding substrate. Another contributor is the inherent quality of the crystals, which grow as thin plates and do not diffract equally well in all directions. The final structure comprises residues 1-307 and 53 water molecules and has a crystallographic R factor of 24.5% (Rfree = 30.5%) at 2.3-Å resolution (Table III). As defined by PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar), 88.6% of the residues lie within the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot with one outlier (Ser-87). The two C-terminal residues of the Nt-FDH construct are not visible in the electron density and were omitted from the model. Interestingly, four of the five cysteines present in the structure appear to be modified by β-mercaptoethanol (βME). This was probably caused by the high concentration of βME present in the crystallization solution (10 mm). Thus, four molecules of βME were included in the model, modifying cysteines 86, 152, 191, and 238 (the exception is Cys-17). One of these cysteines (Cys-86) is near the active site (see below).Table IData collection statisticsNativeTHIM1aTHIM, ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid (thimerosal); PTCL, potassium tetrachloroplatinate (II); URAC, uranium acetate dihydrate.THIM2aTHIM, ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid (thimerosal); PTCL, potassium tetrachloroplatinate (II); URAC, uranium acetate dihydrate.PTCLaTHIM, ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid (thimerosal); PTCL, potassium tetrachloroplatinate (II); URAC, uranium acetate dihydrate.URAC1aTHIM, ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid (thimerosal); PTCL, potassium tetrachloroplatinate (II); URAC, uranium acetate dihydrate.URAC2aTHIM, ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid (thimerosal); PTCL, potassium tetrachloroplatinate (II); URAC, uranium acetate dihydrate.Molarity (mm)55155Length of soak1 h2 days1 h2 h1 dayReflections (measured)80,514 (7894)55,44070,86343,46228,85952,618Reflections (unique)19,201 (1863)10,38210,87511,24310,6509582Resolution (Å)2.3 (2.38−2.30)2.52.82.62.752.7Completeness (%)99.7 (100.0)68.4100.084.492.779.1I/sig5.3 (2.0)5.74.57.24.04.2RsymbRsym = (ΣII - IM)/ΣIM, where II is the intensity of the measured reflection and IM is the mean intensity of all symmetry-related reflections (where Rmerge = ΣhklΣi| Ii(hkl) - <I(hkl)>| /ΣhklΣiI i(hkl)).

Modification of Nt-FDH with N-ethylmaleimide, an agent that is directed toward cysteines, did not inhibit the hydrolase activity (data not shown). This implies that a cysteine residue is not involved in the hydrolase catalysis. However, a buried cysteine may be protected from chemical modification; hence, using site-directed mutagenesis, we replaced each of the cysteines with alanine. Each of the mutants, C17A, C86A, C152A, C191A, and C238A, was expressed in E. coli, purified, and characterized kinetically. All cysteine mutants catalyzed hydrolase activity at the same rate as wild type Nt-FDH (Table IV), indicating that a cysteine is not involved in the hydrolase mechanism and that the structural perturbations arising from modifications of those cysteines is unlikely to affect the functional architecture of the protein.Table IVActivity of mutant Nt-FDH enzymes relative to wild-type Nt-FDHNt-FDH mutantHydrolase activity, percentage of wild typeaAverage of two independent experiments.%C17A94C86A110C152A95C191A96C238A102a Average of two independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Structure Description—The structure comprises two domains (Fig. 3). Domain 1 contains a seven-stranded sheet of mixed parallel and antiparallel β-strands, comprising β1-β5 and β7-β8, packed on both sides by α-helices, and is immediately recognizable as a Rossmann fold (29Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). β6 is separate from this sheet and forms a small two-stranded sheet with part of the loop that connects domains 1 and 2. Domain 2 is mostly all β in structure and from one angle appears as a sandwich of two β-sheets, one five-stranded and the other four-stranded. However, two central strands, β12 and β16, bend at approximately right angles and link the two sheets to create a single sheet. The resulting arrangement is barrel-like and reminiscent of the OB fold (30Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Between the two domains lies a long stretch of intervening polypeptide chain, comprising residues 185-218, which is predominantly extended in structure. The secondary structure assignments are shown in Fig. 3c. As expected, since it contains the folate-binding site, domain 1 of the structure shows similarity with both FMT (24Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Google Scholar) and GART (31Chen P. Schulze-Gahmen U. Stura E.A. Inglese J. Johnson D.L. Marolewski A. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 283-292Google Scholar). This domain superimposes closely in all three enzymes, with the closest overlap being the central seven-stranded sheet and the greatest differences being in the relative positions of the surrounding helices as well as the length and structure of the connections between the elements of secondary structure. For instance, the r.m.s. deviation between the main chain atoms of 145 common residues of Nt-FDH and GART is 3.5 Å, whereas for the seven equivalent strands it is 0.8 Å. The same analysis for 156 common residues between Nt-FDH and FMT yields an r.m.s. deviation of 3.7 Å, but for the β sheet it is 1.0 Å. The divergence between Nt-FDH and GART begins at residue 187 (of both enzymes), near the C terminus of GART, whereas for FMT, the structural similarity extends all the way to the C terminus of both proteins. In fact, domain 2 of Nt-FDH and the C-terminal domain of FMT are topologically equivalent except for the connection between β12 and β14, which is much longer in Nt-FDH and includes an additional strand β13, whereas in FMT this connection, between β9 and β10, is much shorter (Fig. 4). Interestingly, although there is no topologically equivalent strand for β13 in FMT, the edge position in the sheet is occupied instead by β14 in FMT, which is at the C terminus of the protein. Given the lack of sequence similarity in the C-terminal half of these proteins, the structural overlap between Nt-FDH and FMT in this region was unexpected. The functional significance of these structural similarities is discussed below. Active Site—The location of the active site can be determined by the sequence similarity of Nt-FDH to FMT and GART and, in particular, the presence of highly conserved residues that form the active sites in these enzymes. It is situated at the base of the deep cleft between domains 1 and 2. The substrate-binding site is formed by the divergence of β strands (β4 and β5) in the central β sheet of domain 1. As viewed in Fig. 5, the active site is formed by several loops including residues 113-117 at the base, 85-89 at the top, 104-108 to the left (part of β5), 139-144 to the right, and Phe-135 from β7. Of note is the relatively poor density of the 85-89 region, making it difficult to fit these residues with high confidence (see above). Much of the active site is markedly hydrophobic in character due to residues such as Phe-35, Phe-135, Leu-141, Ala-114, and Ile-104. The lack of large side chains in residues 115-117 (Gly-Ala-Ser) may permit the close approach of the substrate molecule. Two key residues in the active site are His-106 and Asp-142. These are conserved in both FMT and GART and mutation of either of these renders Nt-FDH inactive as a hydrolase (18Krupenko S.A. Vlasov A.P. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24030-24037Google Scholar, 32Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35777-35784Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observe electron density bridging between these two residues and have interpreted this as a molecule of βME (Fig. 5). It has been fitted such that the sulfhydryl group is within hydrogen bonding distance of His-106 and the hydroxyl group within hydrogen bonding distance of Asp-142. The involvement of βME in the in vitro hydrolase mechanism of Nt-FDH is discussed below. Comparison with the Active Sites of FMT and GART—To compare the similarity of the active site with those of FMT and GART, the crystal structure of Nt-FDH was superimposed onto those of FMT and GART using several conserved residues in the active site (Fig. 6). The close correspondence of many of the loops in the active sites again shows the overall similarity of the three proteins, but it also reveals some distinctive differences. Overall, there is closer similarity of Nt-FDH with FMT than GART. Most notably, the loop in GART that is topologically equivalent to residues 113-117 in Nt-FDH and residues 117-121 in FMT adopts a wholly different conformation and occupies a different position in that enzyme. GART have been solved in a ternary complex with glycinamide ribonucleotide and the folate inhibitor, 5-deaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (5dTHF) (33Almassy R.J. Janson C.A. Kan C.C. Hostomska Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6114-6118Google Scholar). 5dTHF is very similar to THF, except that a carbon is substituted for nitrogen at position 5 of the pteridine ring. The superimposition of Nt-FDH with the GART-glycinamide ribonucleotide-5dTHF complex provides a view of how ligands may fit into the active site of Nt-FDH (Fig. 7). Specifically, it shows that βME occupies the same spatial position as the expected position of the formyl group, adjacent to N-10 of THF. This suggests that in our structure βME is a mimic of formate, such that the O-C-C backbone of βME is equivalent to O-C-O of formate. More pertinently, it shows that Asp-142 is best placed to orient a hydrolytic water between N-10 and the carbonyl carbon of formyl group and that His-142 may orient the carbonyl oxygen of the formyl group. This has implications for the mechanism of hydrolase, which is discussed below. Similarity of Nt-FDH, GART, and FMT—There are several enzymes in the cell that use 10-formyl-THF as a substrate. Three of these enzymes, GART, AICART, and FMT, use 10-formyl-THF as a formyl donor in biosynthetic reactions. Although GART and FMT show very low sequence identity with each other (19%), they share the same fold for the folate-binding domain (24Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Google Scholar). By contrast, AICART shows no sequence similarity with either GART or FMT (34Rayl E.A. Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Google Scholar), and indeed its crystal structure reveals a different fold (35Greasley S.E. Horton P. Ramcharan J. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 402-406Google Scholar). FMT is 314 residues long (36Guillon J.M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Google Scholar) and contains a Rossmann fold, comprising ∼200 amino acids, and a separate carboxyl-terminal domain of around 100 residues (24Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Google Scholar). GART is a shorter protein and contains only the Rossmann fold ("
https://openalex.org/W1963631555,"We developed a novel and generalized approach to investigate G protein-coupled receptor molecular assemblies. We solubilized a fusion protein consisting of the β2-adrenergic receptor and green fluorescent protein (GFP) for bead-based flow cytometric analysis. β2-Adrenergic receptor GFP bound to dihydroalprenolol-conjugated beads, providing a Kd for the fusion protein and, in competition with β2-adrenergic receptor ligands, Kd values for agonists and antagonists. Beads displaying chelated nickel bound purified hexahistidine-tagged G protein heterotrimers and, subsequently, the binary complex of agonist with β2-adrenergic receptor GFP. The dose-response curves of ternary complex formation revealed maximal assembly for ligands previously classified as full agonists and reduced assembly for ligands previously classified as partial agonists. Guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-induced dissociation rates of the ternary complex were the same for full and partial agonists. Soluble G protein, competing with ternary complexes on beads provided an affinity estimate of agonist-receptor complexes to G protein. When performed simultaneously, the two assemblies discriminated between agonist, antagonist or inactive molecule in a manner appropriate for high throughput, small volume drug discovery.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FPR-GFP, formyl peptide receptor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ARG, agonist-receptor-G protein ternary complex; DHA, dihydroalprenolol; LR, ligand-receptor complex. transmit extracellular signals into cells via intracellular G protein heterotrimers (1Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Google Scholar). Of currently marketed drugs, >30% modulate GPCRs (2Wise A. Gearing K. Rees S. Drug Discov. Today. 2002; 7: 235-246Google Scholar). Only 10% of the 367 human endogenous ligand GPCRs are targeted by current drugs, leaving many future targets. Novel modes of defining the activity of ligands that bind to GPCRs could contribute to the treatment of human disease. The response to epinephrine or adrenaline is a prototypic GPCR action. Equilibrium binding studies in frog erythrocyte membranes demonstrated homogeneous binding for antagonists, whereas agonists exhibited two states of agonist affinity (3Kent R.S. De Lean A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 14-23Google Scholar). The ternary complex model of agonist, receptor, and G protein accounts for the ternary complex exhibiting a higher agonist affinity than the binary complex (4DeLean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase assays define the intrinsic activity, or efficacy, for each compound. Receptors in the high affinity state range from 50% for agonists of the lowest intrinsic activity to 95% for full agonists; the percent correlated roughly with the intrinsic adenylyl cyclase activity of the agonist. The functional consequences of cellular ternary complex formation include the rapid binding of GTP to the Gα subunit, release of the receptor and the Gβγ dimer, and exposure of new Gα and Gβγ surfaces to interact with effectors such as adenylyl cyclase (5Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Google Scholar). Ternary complex formation for a series of agonists is expected to correlate with adenylyl cyclase activities. More detailed ternary complex formulations take into account the idea that receptors can exist in different activity states (6Christopoulos A. Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 323-374Google Scholar). We have previously studied the formyl peptide receptor and its numerous fluorescent ligands. The solubilized receptor forms a high agonist affinity complex with G proteins and arrestins (7Bennett T.A. Key T.A. Gurevich V.V. Neubig R. Prossnitz E.R. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22453-22460Google Scholar, 8Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49195-49203Google Scholar, 9Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49204-49212Google Scholar). Beads derivatized with chelated nickel bind hexahistidine-tagged G protein heterotrimers, and as shown by flow cytometry, form ternary complex with formyl peptide receptor (FPR) constructs on G protein beads. The constructs included wild type receptor detected with fluorescent ligand, receptor-Gα fusion protein detected with fluorescent ligand, and receptor-GFP fusion protein detected with nonfluorescent ligand (10Simons P.C. Shi M. Foutz T. Cimino D.F. Lewis J. Buranda T. Lim W.K. Neubig R.R. McIntire W.E. Garrison J. Prossnitz E. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1227-1238Google Scholar). The latter has the potential of being generalized. We have now extended the approach to the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR-GFP) using a β2AR-GFP fusion protein. We derivatized beads to discriminate GPCR assemblies sensitive to full and partial agonists and antagonists. Beads displayed dihydroalprenolol (DHA beads), following earlier work (11Caron M.G. Srinivasan Y. Pitha J. Kociolek K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2923-2927Google Scholar). DHA beads bound detergent-solubilized β2AR-GFP with Kd ∼ 3.4 nm. Competition with agonists gave Kd values for these ligands similar to published values. Beads displaying Gαsβ1γ2 hexahistidine-tagged proteins bound agonist-β2AR-GFP binary complexes in a ternary complex. For full and partial agonists, the maximal amount of ternary complex correlated with agonist efficacy. Interestingly, ternary complexes formed by both full and partial agonists were disassembled by GTPγS at the same rate, suggesting that partial agonism depends upon ternary complex assembly rather than disassembly. The affinity of β2AR-GFP for G protein was measured by competition of soluble G protein, creating a fairly complete description of the assemblies. Moreover, these well characterized assemblies can be assayed simultaneously in a manner consistent with small volume, real time, high throughput discrimination of agonists and antagonists in a primary screen, and resolution of partial agonists in a secondary dose-response screen. Reagents and Cell Culture—All reagents were from Sigma and were of analytical quality unless otherwise noted; plasticware was from VWR. The β2-adrenergic receptor-GFP construct in pSFFV.Neo was obtained using the polymerase chain reaction, resulting in a fusion protein containing an extra AGANGAAA sequence between the final amino acid of the β-adrenergic receptor and the first amino acid of the GFP. The U937 cells were maintained, selected for high expression, expanded in spinner flasks, and frozen in aliquots as previously described (10Simons P.C. Shi M. Foutz T. Cimino D.F. Lewis J. Buranda T. Lim W.K. Neubig R.R. McIntire W.E. Garrison J. Prossnitz E. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1227-1238Google Scholar). Membrane Preparation and Solubilization—Preparation of crude, post-nuclear membrane aliquots, and solubilization of the membrane aliquots have been described (10Simons P.C. Shi M. Foutz T. Cimino D.F. Lewis J. Buranda T. Lim W.K. Neubig R.R. McIntire W.E. Garrison J. Prossnitz E. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1227-1238Google Scholar). A typical solubilized membrane aliquot contained the membrane proteins from 108 cells, 100–200 nm β2AR-GFP, about 500 nm Gαs and 5 mg/ml total protein in 0.25 ml of 30 mm HEPES hemisodium salt, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 (HPSM) with 1% dodecyl maltoside. The quantification of β2AR-GFP by fluorescence is not absolute, as each harvest of cells may have a different percent of the protein enzymatically converted to the fully fluorescent form; a sample of hexahistidine-tagged GFP (kindly supplied by John Nolan, Los Alamos, NM) gave a molar fluorescence (quantum yield) equal to 0.7 of the molar fluorescence of carboxyfluorescein in our fluorimeter (10Simons P.C. Shi M. Foutz T. Cimino D.F. Lewis J. Buranda T. Lim W.K. Neubig R.R. McIntire W.E. Garrison J. Prossnitz E. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1227-1238Google Scholar). Two determinations of the active formyl peptide receptor in a preparation gave a value of 50% active receptor compared with the amount given by GFP fluorescence, and we have assumed 50% active βAR to GFP fluorescence in all calculations in this report. Synthesis of DHA Beads—We have previously described the synthesis of the Ni2+ beads used in this report (10Simons P.C. Shi M. Foutz T. Cimino D.F. Lewis J. Buranda T. Lim W.K. Neubig R.R. McIntire W.E. Garrison J. Prossnitz E. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1227-1238Google Scholar). The synthesis of the DHA beads was based on the successful affinity chromatography material developed earlier (11Caron M.G. Srinivasan Y. Pitha J. Kociolek K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2923-2927Google Scholar). Both start with the epoxy-activation of Superdex Peptide beads, a cross-linked agarose/dextran matrix with an exclusion limit of 7000 daltons, which were extruded from a packed column purchased from Amersham Biosciences. One settled volume of the epoxy-activated beads was mixed with 1 volume of 0.2 m dithiothreitol in 0.2 m NaHCO3 for 4 h at 37 °C, then rinsed on a coarse sintered glass filter five times with water. One settled milliliter of these sulfhydryl-activated beads was stirred with 1 ml of water and 40 mg of (-)-alprenolol, and 10 μl of 10% ammonium persulfate was added every 10 min at 90 °C for 2 h (we note that this can be done at 25 °C (11Caron M.G. Srinivasan Y. Pitha J. Kociolek K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2923-2927Google Scholar), but we obtained lower substitution), with added water to keep the volume constant. The derivatized beads were washed twice with water, once with 50% ethanol, five times with ethanol, once with 50% ethanol, once with water, and twice with HPSM. The beads were stored as a 50% slurry in HPSM with 0.02% NaN3 and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside at 4 °C. Binding Assay of β2AR-GFP to DHA Beads—Typically, 2 μl of the 50% suspension of DHA beads (∼3.5 × 105 beads/μl) was treated with 200 μl of HPSM containing 0.1% dodecyl maltoside and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 30–60 min to reduce nonspecific binding. The beads were centrifuged at 1400 × gmax for 20 s, the buffer was removed, and the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of HPSM containing 0.1% dodecyl maltoside. This provided 25 aliquots of 24,000 beads for 25 binding assays. A 10-μl binding assay generally consisted of 2 μl of solublilized receptor preparation, 2 μl of a ligand at some concentration, and 4 μl of HPSM containing 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, which was mixed in a 96-well plate with a V bottom (Costar) by pipetting and allowed to equilibrate for 5 min. Then 2 μl of the treated DHA bead suspension was added and mixed by pipetting followed by orbital mixing for 2 h at 4–7 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined by the inclusion of 1 mm alprenolol. The wells were brought to 200 μl with HPSM containing 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, and their contents were transferred to 12 × 75-mm tubes immediately before flow cytometric analysis of the fluorescence on the beads. Conversion of the fluorescence measured to bound β2AR-GFP was made with calibration beads (Clontech). Kinetic binding data of β2AR-GFP binding to DHA beads were analyzed via Scientist (MicroMath™, Salt Lake City, UT). A single site binding model was utilized to fit the data, and the forward binding rate constant, kf, was evaluated with the reverse binding rate constant, kr, constrained by the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd = kr/kf, at 3.4 nm (from experimental data). The concentration of DHA was assumed to be 0.4 nm in each 10-μl binding assay based on 100,000 binding sites per bead and 24,000 beads per assay. Agonist-Receptor-G Protein (ARG) Assay on G Protein-coated Beads—Coating of the Ni2+ beads with heterotrimeric G proteins has been described before in detail (10Simons P.C. Shi M. Foutz T. Cimino D.F. Lewis J. Buranda T. Lim W.K. Neubig R.R. McIntire W.E. Garrison J. Prossnitz E. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1227-1238Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 pmol of the desired α subunit and 25 pmol of hexahistidine-tagged β1γ2 were mixed with 2.5 μl of a 50% slurry of dextran chelate nickel beads (2.5 × 105 beads/μl) and 190 μl of HPSM containing 0.1% dodecyl maltoside and 1 mm dithiothreitol, then kept in suspension by rocking at 4–7 °C for 1 h. The beads were then centrifuged for 30 s at 1500 × gmax, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of the buffer. This provided 25 aliquots of 24,000 G protein-coated beads for 25 ARG assembly assays (some beads were lost to surfaces). A 10-μl ARG assembly assay generally consisted of 2 μl of solubilized receptor preparation, 2 μl of desired ligand, 4 μl of HPSM containing 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, and 2 μl of G protein-coated beads. Nonspecific fluorescence was defined in the presence of 0.1 mm GTPγS. These suspensions were mixed on an orbital mixer for 2 h, brought to 200 μl with HPSM containing 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, transferred to a 12 × 75-mm tube, and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry for bead fluorescence. For kinetic data tubes were removed from the cytometer after 20 s, 2 μl of 10-2m GTPγS was added and mixed, and the tubes were returned to the cytometer for measurement of the bead fluorescence. The cytometer data were converted to alphanumeric form and binned into 1-s intervals using the FACSQuery program, 2Available free from Bruce Edwards, [email protected] which provides a series of mean channel fluorescence values in an Excel file. These data were then analyzed using Prism (Graphpad Software). For multiplex analysis, the Ni2+ beads were given a red “address label” for dual bead experiments (Ni2+ and DHA beads in one well) by reacting 10 μl of a 50% slurry of dextran chelate nickel beads with 10 μl of 10-4m NHS-Texas Red™ in Me2SO (Molecular Probes) in 80 μl of phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 22 °C, then washing with 900 μl of 50% ethanol, twice with 100% ethanol, once with 50% ethanol, and three times with HPSM. Both types of beads were stored at 4 °C in HPSM with 0.01% dodecyl maltoside and 0.02% sodium azide for at least six months and were stable to at least one snap-freeze at -80 °C. One settled milliliter of beads (∼5 × 108 beads) could be used for ∼20,000 assays of 24,000 beads each. Binding of β2AR-GFP to DHA Beads—Based upon earlier work demonstrating affinity chromatography of β2AR (11Caron M.G. Srinivasan Y. Pitha J. Kociolek K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2923-2927Google Scholar), we derivatized Superdex Peptide beads to display dihydroalprenolol on the end of an 18-atom linker (Fig. 1). These DHA beads are built on a matrix of cross-linked agarose/dextran 13 μm in diameter with a 7000-dalton exclusion pore size, which restricts proteins to the surface. We also produced a β2AR-GFP fusion protein and expected that after solubilization it would bind to the DHA on the surface of the beads as shown schematically in Fig. 2A, making the beads fluorescent. Membranes from U937 cells that expressed β2AR-GFP were isolated and frozen, then aliquots of the membranes were thawed and solubilized (see “Experimental Procedures”) to produce soluble β2AR-GFP in a background of other membrane proteins. Binding assays were conducted (see “Experimental Procedures”) to test the specificity of the proposed interaction (Fig. 3A). In the presence of 50 nm β2AR-GFP, ∼60,000 GFP molecules were bound per bead, whereas when the receptor was blocked with 1 mm alprenolol, only 10,000 GFP molecules were bound per bead. Specific binding is the difference between these 2 bars, or 50,000 β2AR-GFP/bead. When a fusion protein consisting of the formyl peptide receptor and GFP (FPR-GFP) was used instead of β2AR-GFP, the binding was low in both the absence and presence of alprenolol, as expected. Underivatized beads, less hydrophobic, bound even less “background” fluorescence than the derivatized beads, as expected.Fig. 2Schematic diagrams of the two positive receptor-bead interactions used in this report. The receptor-GFP fusion protein is depicted as a snakeview receptor with an oval GFP on its C terminus. A, the DHA beads will bind to the β2AR-GFP unless a ligand has occupied the binding site previously. B, Ni2+ beads were first converted to G protein beads by incubation with hexahistidine-tagged G protein heterotrimers, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The β2AR-GFP will bind these G protein beads only when occupied by an agonist, here shown as isoproterenol (ISO).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Characterization of the DHA bead binding assay. Binding assays were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, specificity of the DHA bead interaction with the β2AR-GFP fusion protein, with 1 mm alprenolol (ALP) included in assays represented with striped bars. The first two assays were standard, using 50 nm β2AR-GFP; the second two assays used FPR-GFP instead of β2AR-GFP, and the third pair of assays used underivatized beads in place of DHA beads. B, binding curves were obtained by varying the amount of β2AR-GFP as shown in the absence (filled symbols) or presence (open symbols) of 1 mm alprenolol for the times indicated on the side. C, time course of β2AR-GFP binding to DHA beads; data are replotted from panel B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then tested this interaction as a function of time of incubation of β2AR-GFP with the DHA beads using 0.3–30 nm β2AR-GFP (Fig. 3B). 1, 2, and 4 h of binding resulted in binding curves that gave a Kd = 3.4 ± 0.4 nm, which agrees with values obtained from membrane preparations (12Mukherjee C. Caron M.G. Mullikin D. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1976; 12: 16-31Google Scholar) and dodecyl maltoside-solubilized preparations (13Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Google Scholar). Because the reaction was time-dependent, we chose2hasa standard time. With 100,000 β2AR-GFP molecules on the surface of 24,000 beads in 10 μl, only 0.4 nm β2AR-GFP is on the beads compared with the tens of nanomolar concentrations of β2AR-GFP in solution. Analysis of the kinetic data of β2AR-GFP binding to DHA beads (Fig. 3C) resulted in values for the forward binding rate constant, kf = 2.9 ± 1 × 103m-1s-1, and for the dissociation rate constant, kr = 8.6 ± 4 × 10-6 s-1. We note that kf is ∼2 orders of magnitude lower than reported for the binding of similar size antibody Fab fragments to epitopes on cells at 4 °C (14Nolan J.P. Chambers J.D. Sklar L.A. Robinson J.P. Babcock G.F. Phagocyte Function: A Guide for Research and Clinical Evaluation. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1998: 19-46Google Scholar). The active (-) stereoisomer of alprenolol was used in constructing the present DHA beads, in contrast to the racemic mixture used in the original affinity medium (11Caron M.G. Srinivasan Y. Pitha J. Kociolek K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2923-2927Google Scholar). The elution of 40–60% of the receptors from the original affinity medium may have resulted from receptors that were bound to the more weakly binding (+) stereoisomer. ARG Ternary Complex Assembly on G Protein Beads—The ARG assembly (Fig. 2B) assay was based on earlier work (10Simons P.C. Shi M. Foutz T. Cimino D.F. Lewis J. Buranda T. Lim W.K. Neubig R.R. McIntire W.E. Garrison J. Prossnitz E. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1227-1238Google Scholar). Here, assemblies were formed in 10 μl volumes to maximize concentrations of A, R, and G protein-coated beads, then diluted for immediate flow cytometric determination of the bead fluorescence. In Fig. 4A we demonstrate that this ARG assembly requires a cognate set of agonist, receptor, and G protein-coated beads. The binding of 40 nm β2AR-GFP to G protein beads in the presence of saturating isoproterenol (1 mm) gave a total fluorescence of 80,000 β2AR-GFP/bead. When 0.1 mm GTPγS, a non-hyrolyzable GTP analog, was added in this assembly, the fluorescence was reduced to a background of about 10,000 β2AR-GFP/bead, which demonstrates that a G protein α subunit is necessary for specific fluorescence. Specific binding was defined as the difference between these two values and is referred to as ARG/bead. In the absence of the agonist isoproterenol, only background binding was observed, demonstrating the necessity for a correct ligand for the assembly. When GFP was fused to the formyl peptide receptor, background fluorescence was again obtained, demonstrating the necessity of the correct receptor for specific fluorescence. Finally, G protein beads were assembled with αi3 subunits instead of the cognate αs subunits, and these beads also gave background fluorescence (the control assembly with cognate FPR-GFP showed specific binding, indicating active G protein beads; data not shown). Thus, the cognate agonist, receptor, and G protein were all necessary to obtain the specific fluorescence, or ARG assembly. We then varied the concentration of β2AR-GFP in the presence of two selected agonists, at saturating concentrations, in the standard ARG assembly assay, as shown in Fig. 4B. It can be seen that the GFP/bead increases linearly with the concentration of β2AR-GFP for both agonists, with the full agonist, isoproterenol, showing the greatest slope. These data are consistent with a low affinity between agonist-bound β2AR-GFP and the G beads; a Kd of 0.2–0.4 μm has been found for the interaction of agonist-bound formyl peptide receptor, and Gαi3, for example (10Simons P.C. Shi M. Foutz T. Cimino D.F. Lewis J. Buranda T. Lim W.K. Neubig R.R. McIntire W.E. Garrison J. Prossnitz E. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1227-1238Google Scholar), and would be consistent with the present data (see also Fig. 4E). The full agonists epinephrine and norepinephrine were indistinguishable from isoproterenol, and the partial agonist dobutamine gave a line with ⅔ the slope of salbutamol (data not shown). These data suggested the presence of ligand specific conformations of binary AR complexes, with full agonists giving a maximal slope and partial agonists giving a lower slope. The amount of G protein applied to the beads before washing and introduction to the ARG assembly assay was varied next. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that for the standard application, 1 pmol of G protein/24,000 beads, more than 80% of the applied protein bound to the beads and stayed on when the beads were resuspended (data not shown). In Fig. 4C it is shown that the amount of ARG assembly on the beads was a saturable function of the G protein applied to the beads. We believe that this represents saturation of the surface of the beads with G protein that is in the correct orientation to allow binding of the subsequently added partners, not an EC50 for ARG formation, which will be discussed later. Our standard assembly assay protocol, thus, results in 75% saturation of the surface of the G beads using 1 pmol of G protein heterotrimers per assay. The time of assembly was varied with saturating amounts of agonists in Fig. 4D, and as with the DHA bead binding, ARG assembly continued increasing past 3 h for isoproterenol and salbutamol, whereas for the weak partial agonist dobutamine, ARG assembly was maximal by 1 h. Similar results were obtained in three other experiments in which different receptor preparations and concentrations were used; in one case, the curve for salbutamol was maximal at 2 h. The amount of ARG formed with isoproterenol was always greater than that formed with salbutamol, which was always greater than that formed with dobutamine. To compare results between experiments, the time of assembly was standardized to 2 h. Thus, our standard assembly assay was 75% saturated with respect to G protein coverage on the bead, was linear with respect to β2AR-GFP past 60 nm β2AR-GFP, depended on the specific agonist used for assembly, and would increase with time past the standard 2 h if allowed to do so for isoproterenol and would usually increase past 2 h for salbutamol. Competition between G protein on the G beads and soluble G protein was used to estimate the affinity of agonist-bound β2AR-GFP for G protein in Fig. 4E. The large amount of soluble G protein used in this experiment precluded multiple determinations, but the data are consistent with Kd = 0.1 μm, similar to the 0.3–1 μm Kd of the agonist-bound formyl peptide receptor and Gαi3β1γ2 (10Simons P.C. Shi M. Foutz T. Cimino D.F. Lewis J. Buranda T. Lim W.K. Neubig R.R. McIntire W.E. Garrison J. Prossnitz E. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1227-1238Google Scholar). Standard ARG assemblies were made, then diluted for kinetic determination of bead fluorescence by flow cytometry, as shown in Fig. 4F. The open squares represent a sample in which the bead fluorescence was followed uninterrupted for 2 min to determine the dissociation due to dilution alone, and it is clear that there was only minimal loss of ARG over this time frame. The closed squares show the bead fluorescence when 0.1 mm GTPγS was added manually to a parallel assembly at about 25 s, and data collection was resumed at about 30 s to follow the disassembly of the ARG. A substantial loss of fluorescence occurred in the first 5 s after GTPγS addition followed by a gradual loss for the rest of the data collection. The plus symbols represent the fluorescence of an assembly that had been conducted in the presence of GTPγS and constitute background fluorescence for the experiment. Determinations of Kd for LR Dissociation and EC50 for ARG Formation—LR formation on DHA beads was competed by the addition of selected ligands, which allowed us to measure the Kd values as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” (since the beads act as a sensor, with [bound receptor] << [free receptor] < [L], the IC50 values equal Kd values to within experimental error for all the agonists). Fig. 5A shows the competition curves for these determinations, which are consistent with a single population of noninteracting binding sites, as expected. The Kd values are compared with previously reported Kd values obtained with membrane preparations (15Green S.A. Cole G. Jacinto M. Innis M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23116-23121Google Scholar) in Table I. The Kd for alprenolol in dodecylmaltoside solution has been reported to be 2.9 nm (13Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Google Scholar); in a separate experiment in which the concentration of receptor was reduced to 3 nm, we obtained a Kd of 1.8 nm. The Kd values for the rest of the ligands agreed with the previously reported Kd values obtained with membrane preparations to within a factor of three.Table IComparison of the Kd values for LR formation for selected ligands using DHA beads in the second column to their EC50 values for ARG assembly using G protein beads in the third column (potency) and to their values for ARG assembly using G protein beads in the fourth column The data were obtained from three experiments as shown in Fig. 5.

https://openalex.org/W2154054547,"DnaK from Thermus thermophilus (TDnaK) is unique because significant fractions of cellular TDnaK exist as a trigonal K·J complex that consists of three copies each of TDnaK, TDnaJ, and an assembly factor TDafA. Here, chaperone functions of the K·J complex and free TDnaK plus free TDnaJ (K+J) were compared. Substrate proteins were completely denatured at 72–73 °C or 89 °C in the absence or the presence of K·J complex or K+J and were subsequently incubated at a moderate temperature of 55 °C. TGrpE and ATP were always included in the K·J complex and K+J, and TClpB was supplemented at 55 °C. At 72–73 °C, both the K·J complex and K+J suppressed heat aggregation of substrate proteins. During the next incubation at 55 °C, K+J, assisted by TClpB, was able to disaggregate the heat aggregates and efficiently reactivate activities of the proteins, whereas the K·J complex was not; it reactivated only the soluble inactivated proteins. When substrate proteins were heated to 89 °C, both the K·J complex and K+J were no longer able to prevent heat aggregation, and because of selective, irreversible denaturation of TDafA the K·J complex dissociated into K+J, which then exhibited disaggregation activity during the next incubation at 55 °C. Thus, TClpB-assisted disaggregation activity belongs only to K+J, and TDafA is a potential thermosensor for converting the K·J complex to K+J in response to heat stress."
https://openalex.org/W2086206913,"The AAG family of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylases was initially thought to be limited to mammalian cells, but genome sequencing efforts have revealed the presence of homologous proteins in certain prokaryotic species as well. Here, we report the first molecular characterization of a functional prokaryotic AAG homologue, i.e. YxlJ, termed bAag, from Bacillus subtilis. The B. subtilis aag gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein was purified to homogeneity. As expected, B. subtilis Aag was found to be a DNA glycosylase, which releases 3-alkylated purines and hypoxanthine, as well as the cyclic etheno adduct 1,N6-ethenoadenine from DNA. However, kinetic analysis showed that bAag removed hypoxanthine much faster than human AAG with a 10-fold higher value for kcat, whereas the rate of excision of 1, N6-ethenoadenine was found to be similar. In contrast, it was found that bAag removes 3-methyladenine and 3-methylguanine ∼10–20 times more slowly than human AAG, and there was hardly any detectable excision of 7-methylguanine. It thus appears that bAag has a minor role in the repair of DNA alkylation damage and an important role in preventing the mutagenic effects of deaminated purines and cyclic etheno adducts in Bacillus subtilis.

Exposure of genomes to a variety of reactive intracellular metabolites and environmental agents results in chemical modifications of the DNA nucleobases, including oxidations, alkylations, and deaminations. Such DNA lesions are primarily repaired through the base excision repair pathway (BER). The first step of BER involves N-glycosylic cleavage of the base-sugar bonds by damage-specific DNA glycosylases. The abasic site is cleaved by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases or apurinic/apyrimidinic lyases, and repair is completed through a sequential action of a phosphodiesterase, a DNA polymerase, and a DNA ligase (reviewed in Refs. 1Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjoras M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Google Scholar and 2Dogliotti E. Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 3-27Google Scholar). Alkylating agents represent one of the most abundant classes of mutagenic and genotoxic agents present in the environment. Repair of alkylation damage is initiated by DNA glycosylases, referred to as 3-methyladenine (3mA) 1The abbreviations used are: 3mA, 3-methyladenine; 3mG, 3-methylguanine; 7mG, 7-methylguanine; bAag, B. subtilis Aag; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. DNA glycosylases, because 3mA is a major substrate for these enzymes. Escherichia coli possesses two enzymes of this kind, the constitutively expressed Tag (3Karran P. Lindahl T. Ofsteng I. Evensen G.B. Seeberg E. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 101-127Google Scholar) and the alkylation-inducible AlkA (4Evensen G. Seeberg E. Nature. 1982; 296: 773-775Google Scholar). The Tag enzyme has a narrow specificity for removal of 3mA, 3-methylguanine (3mG), and 3-ethyladenine (5Bjelland S. Bjoras M. Seeberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2045-2049Google Scholar), whereas AlkA has a much broader specificity toward a wide range of modified base residues in DNA (4Evensen G. Seeberg E.

The Tag and AlkA proteins share no significant sequence homology despite their functional similarity. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses one 3mA DNA glycosylase, MAG, which is homologous to E. coli AlkA (11Berdal K.G. Bjoras M. Bjelland S. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4563-4568Google Scholar). However, mouse, rat, and human cells possess none of these types of enzymes but another, structurally different protein termed AAG/ANPG/MPG (the term AAG will be used here) (12Lau A.Y.

Mammalian AAG recognizes and removes a broad range of damaged base residues, including deaminated adenine (hypoxanthine), cyclic etheno adducts, e.g. 1,N6-ethenoadenine, and a variety of different alkylated base residues, including 3mA, 3mG, and 7-methylguanine (7mG) (8Saparbaev M.

Through genome sequencing, open reading frames with homology to the mammalian AAG enzymes have also been identified in prokaryotic species, for instance in Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Borrelia burgdorferi. B. subtilis also possesses two AlkA homologues and a third DNA glycosylase protein with close similarity to AlkC(YhaZ), a recently identified repair gene in Bacillus cereus. 2I. Alseth, T. Lindback, K. I. Kristian, L. Lillehagen, O. A. Økstad, M. Bjørås, E. Seeberg, and A. B. Kolstø, submitted for publication. The high number of 3mA DNA glycosylases in Bacillus species probably reflects the heavy exposure of earth bacteria to environmental alkylating agents like methyl chloride. E. coli possesses an inducible repair response to changes in environmental exposure, termed the adaptive response (20Samson L. Cairns J. Nature. 1977; 267: 281-283Google Scholar, 21Sedgwick B. Vaughan P. Mutat. Res. 1991; 250: 211-221Google Scholar). The Ada protein, which is a methyltransferase that becomes activated upon methylation exposure, regulates the adaptive response in E. coli and induces transcription of AlkA and other repair proteins involved in protection against alkylation damage. A similar response system is also shown to be present in B. subtilis (22Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Allen G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Borriss R. Boursier L. Brans A. Braun M. Brignell S.C. Bron S. Brouillet S. Bruschi C.V. Caldwell B. Capuano V. Carter N.M. Choi S.K. Codani J.J. Connerton I.F. Danchin A. Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Google Scholar). The fact that AAG enzymes have been conserved in some but not all bacteria raises questions about the possible functional significance of this type of enzyme in prokaryotic cells. To elucidate the role of AAG-like proteins in prokaryotes, we have expressed the AAG homologue of B. subtilis, YxlJ, in E. coli, and characterized its enzymatic activities. We have shown that bAag indeed is a functional DNA glycosylase, excising many of the same modified base residues as its human counterpart. However, its preference for different modified residues is significantly different from that of the human enzyme, and it seems to have a more important role in the removal of premutagenic residues induced by deamination and lipid peroxidation rather than for cytotoxic residues induced by alkylating agents. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—DNA from the B. subtilis strain 168 was used for the cloning of the aag gene. E. coli strain BK2118 (tag alkA) was used in survival assays on methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-containing plates and for expression of Bacillus aag, whereas ER2566 (New England Biolabs) and BL21 codon plus (Stratagene) were used for expression only. E. coli expression vectors included pUC18 (New Eng-land Biolabs), pUC19 (New England Biolabs), pT7SCII (USB), and pQE30 (Qiagen). Purification of B. subtilis DNA—10 ml of overnight culture was washed twice in sterile water, and the cells were resuspended in 0.2 ml of 2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 ml of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1), and 0.3 g of glass beads (Sigma). The suspension was vortexed three times for 1 min and cooled on ice in between to break the cell walls. The DNA was precipitated with 96% ethanol, incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with RNase A, and precipitated with ethanol. Cloning of B. subtilis aag—Genomic B. subtilis DNA was used as template in a PCR reaction to amplify a DNA fragment containing the B. subtilis aag gene, termed bAag. The forward primer 5′-AAAACTGCAGTGATCTGCTTCGG-3′ (PstI restriction site underlined) was located 45 nucleotides upstream of the putative GCG start codon, and the reverse primer 5′-CGGATCCTCAAAGCGCCG-3′ (BamHI restriction site underlined) was located 55 nucleotides downstream of the putative stop codon. The PCR product was cloned into the PstI and BamHI restriction sites of pUC18, pUC19, pQE30, and pT7SCII. Alkylation Survival of BK2118 (tag alkA) Transformed with B. subtilis aag—Exponentially growing BK2118 transformed with pUC19/aag and pUC19 (control), were harvested, washed in PBS, and incubated for 30 min on ice, and appropriate dilutions were spread on plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mm MMS. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days, and surviving colonies were counted. Expression and Purification of B. subtilis and Human AAG Protein— Various B. subtilis aag constructs were used for expression analysis in BK2118 (pUC19, pT7SCII, and pQE30), ER2566 (pT7SCII), and BL21-RIL codon plus (pT7) at different temperatures (37, 22, and 16 °C), and the highest expression levels were obtained using BK2118/pUC19 growing at 37 °C. 2 liters of cell culture from freshly transformed colonies were grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to A600 of 1 and induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7, 500 mm NaCl, and10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and sonicated three times for 30 s. (Vibtra Cell Sonicator, Sonics and Materials Inc.). Extracts were diluted with 4 volumes of 50 mm Tris, pH 7, and 10 mm mercaptoethanol and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (10 ml) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl, and10 mm mercaptoethanol). Active fractions were step-eluted by buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7, 1 m NaCl, and 10 mm mercaptoethanol), and alkyl base DNA glycosylase activity was used to monitor bAag purification. Because of the BK2118 tag alkA phenotype, the extracts have no background 3mA DNA glycosylase activity. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm MES, pH 6, 50 mm NaCl, and10 mm mercaptoethanol) and applied to a MonoS column (HR 5/5, Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl in buffer C, and fractions were tested for glycosylase activity and analyzed by denaturing SDS-PAGE. Human AAG was purified as described previously (14O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5561-5569Google Scholar). Alkylbase DNA Glycosylase Assay—10,000–40,000 dpm (glycosylase assay and HPLC, respectively) of calf thymus DNA alkylated with [3 H]methyl-N-nitrosourea (1.5 Ci/mmol; NET-408, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was incubated with different amounts of cell extracts or purified protein for 30 min at 37 °C as described previously (37Bjelland S. Seeberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2787-2801Google Scholar). The DNA was precipitated with ethanol, and radioactivity in the supernatant was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Tri-Carb 2900TR, Packard). HPLC Analyses of Alkylated Bases—Reverse phase HPLC of methylated bases released by the purified glycosylases (B. subtilis and human AAG) was performed as follows (5Bjelland S. Bjoras M. Seeberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2045-2049Google Scholar). The supernatant was centrifuged through Millipore Ultrafuge MC filters (10,000 NMWC filter unit) and mixed with unlabeled alkylated bases as markers. Separations of 3mA, 3mG, and 7mG were obtained by HPLC (Spheri-5 RP-18, 220 × 4.6 mm; Brownlee Labs) using a linear gradient of 100–75% (v/v) 0.1 m triethyl ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.3 or pH 5.4, in methanol for elution (1 ml/min.). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillator analyzer (Tri-Carb 2900TR; Packard). 3mA, 3mG, 7mG, and 7-methyladenine reference compounds were from Fluka. Assays for Enzyme Cleavage of Hypoxanthine, 1,N6-Ethnoadenine, 8-Oxoguanine, and Tetrahydrofuran (THF)—Assays were performed with duplex DNA fragments containing hypoxanthine at position 14 (5′-GCTCATGCGCAG[hypoxanthine]CAGCCGTACTCG-3′), 1,N6-ethnoadenine (ϵA) at position 13 (5′-CGAGTACGGCGG[ϵA]CAGCCGTACTCG-3′), 8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) at position 13 (3′-GGCGGCATGACCC[8-oxoG]GAGGCCCATC-3′), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) at position 20 (5′-GCTGTTGAGATCCAGTTCG[THF]AGTAACCCACTCGTAC-3′). Different amounts of B. subtilis Aag or human AAG and 80 fmol of 32P-5′-end-labeled duplex nucleotides in reaction buffer (70 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and separated on a 20% denaturating polyacrylamide gel (Long Ranger, FMC BioProducts). 1 μg/μl purified E. coli Nfo enzyme was added to perform nicking of the sugar phosphate backbone after removal of the damaged base by the DNA glycosylases. The cleavage products were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences model 445SI). The kinetic constants, Km and kcat were determined by incubating the respective proteins with increasing concentrations of oligonucleotides containing a single hypoxanthine or 1,N6-ethnoadenine. The initial velocities were calculated by Lineweaver/Burk plots. DNA Sequencing and Sequence Analysis—Sequence analysis was performed using the GeneTingTang program (GeneTing, Lillestrøm, Norway). Homology searches were performed by the gapped BLAST alignment (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar). Protein domain searches were done by DART (NCBI), and alignment analysis was done with the ClustalW program from Pole Bio-Informatique, Lyonnais, France. GenBank™ identification (gi) numbers for AAG homologues are as follows: B. subtilis, gi 3912954; Staphylococcus aureus, gi15925334; Borrelia burgdorferii, gi:15594767; Chlamydophila pneumoniae, gi15618416; Mycobacterium tuberculosis, gi:15608826; Arabidopsis thaliana, gi15229928; Mus musculus, gi 7106361; and Homo sapiens, gi12084553.

However certain bacterial species appear to possess protein homologues of the mammalian enzymes as judged from searches in the completed genome sequences. An alignment of putative AAG sequences from B. subtilis, M. tuberculosis, and B. burgdorferi shows 33, 39, and 37% identity to human AAG, respectively (Fig. 1). The yxlJ gene of B. subtilis, here renamed aag, translates into a polypeptide of 196 amino acids (GenBank™ identification number gi 3912954). Compared with the human AAG, this putative Bacillus protein contains all of the key residues involved in substrate recognition and catalysis, except for Tyr-162 and Tyr-165 which are replaced by His. Cloning and Expression of B. subtilis Aag in E. coli—To characterize bAag, the coding region, including its promoter sequence, was cloned in the E. coli expression vector pUC19 (Fig. 2B). There are two putative start codons (ATG and GTG) located within the open reading frame, but upstream Shine-Dalgarno and promoter-like sequences makes the second putative start site, GTG, the most probable initiation codon (Fig. 2B). With this vector, bAag was expressed and purified to apparent physical homogeneity by a two-step procedure including phosphocellulose and MonoS chromatography (see “Materials and Methods”). The double mutant strain BK2118 (tag alkA) was used for the expression to avoid interference by possible contamination of endogenous 3mA DNA glycosylase activities during purification and characterization. The purification was monitored by standard assays for 3mA DNA glycosylase activity, and the final preparation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Inefficient Excision of Methylated Bases by B. subtilis Aag— Mammalian AAG has been shown to remove various methylated bases, including 3mA, 3mG, and 7mG (13O'Connor T.R. Laval J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1170-1177Google Scholar, 15Samson L. Derfler B. Boosalis M. Call K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9127-9131Google Scholar, 24O'Connor T.R. Laval F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3337-3342Google Scholar). We examined the ability of the purified bAag to remove alkylated bases from calf thymus DNA treated with [3H]methyl-N-nitrosourea (Fig. 3). The amounts of methylpurines present in such DNA were determined by HPLC to be 65% 7mG, 10% 3mA, and 0.7% 3mG (5Bjelland S. Bjoras M. Seeberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2045-2049Google Scholar). The relative activities for release of the different alkylated base residues were analyzed by treating methylated DNA with different amounts of enzyme and quantifying the radiolabeled excision products after separation by HPLC. Enzyme activity measurements were performed with purified human AAG as well as with the B. subtilis enzyme to compare efficiency and specificity of base excision by the two enzymes (Fig. 3). It appears that the rate of removal of 3mA and 3mG by bAag for the same amount of enzyme proceeds ∼10–20 times more slowly than for human AAG, whereas the activity toward 7mG is <1%. The difference between human and Bacillus Aag in the efficiency of repair of alkylated bases indicates that bAag may not be the major activity in B. subtilis for removal of alkylated base residues. Efficient Removal of Deaminated Adenine and 1,N6–Ethnoadenine—Mammalian AAG has been reported to be active against a wide variety of premutagenic lesions, such as hypoxanthine (25Kamiya H. Murata-Kamiya N. Koizume S. Inoue H. Nishimura S. Ohtsuka E. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 883-889Google Scholar), cyclic etheno adducts, e.g.1,N6-ethenoadenine and N2-ethenoguanine (26Moriya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1122-1126Google Scholar), and 8-oxoguanine (27Bessho T. Roy R. Yamamoto K. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Tano K. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8901-8904Google Scholar). The activity of the bAag to remove these lesions was analyzed on oligonucleotides with a single lesion. bAag cleaved 1,N6-ethenoadenine with an efficiency similar to that of the human AAG, whereas hypoxanthine excision was much more efficient with bAag than with the human enzyme (Fig. 4). Further experiments were performed to compare the kinetics of hypoxanthine or 1,N6-ethenoadenine removal by B. subtilis and human AAG. There was no difference in the Km and kcat values observed between AAG and bAag for excision of 1,N6-ethenoadenine (Table I). In contrast, bAag showed a 10-fold higher kcat value for hypoxanthine removal than did human AAG, whereas the Km values were found to be similar. This indicates that the difference in repair of hypoxanthine could be attributed to an increased turnover capacity of bAag compared with human AAG. No activity toward 8-oxoG, formamidopyrimidine (faPy), or abasic sites was found to be associated with bAag (data not shown).Table IKinetic parameters of base removal of bAag and human AAGEnzymeEthenoadenineInosineKmkcatKmkcatnmmin-1nmmin-1bAag21 ± 30.10 ± 0.065.0 ± 10.053 ± 0.040Aag23 ± 30.13 ± 0.065.3 ± 0.60.005 ± 0.002 Open table in a new tab B. subtilis Aag Can Only Partially Complement the Alkylation Sensitivity of the 3mA DNA Glycosylase-deficient tag alkA Double Mutant of E. coli—The AlkA and the Tag DNA glycosylases of E. coli are both involved in the removal of 3mA, and mutants lacking both enzymes are several orders of magnitude more sensitive to methylating agents than the wild type. To monitor the ability of bAag to replace Tag/AlkA in the repair of alkylated DNA, E. coli strain BK2118 (tag alkA), transformed by the pUC-bAag plasmid, was plated on MMS-containing LB plates (Fig. 5). Surviving colonies were counted and compared with the survival of wild type and non-transformed BK2118. The results showed that expression of bAag yielded ∼80% complementation at 0.1 mm MMS and only 8% at 0.5 mm. Full rescue is obtained with plasmids expressing similar amounts of E. coli AlkA (data not shown). This suggests that bAag cannot fully replace Tag and AlkA in the alkylation repair of E. coli and is consistent with the biochemical characterization showing that bAag has limited capacity for the removal of 3mA. In contrast, it was shown previously that human AAG provides full complementation of alkylation survival of the tag alkA double mutant (15Samson L. Derfler B. Boosalis M. Call K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9127-9131Google Scholar). We have characterized the product of the yxlJ gene in B. subtilis, a homologue of the 3-mA DNA glycosylases found in mammalian cells. Like the mammalian enzymes, bAag is a DNA glycosylase removing several different types of damaged base residues from DNA. To our knowledge, this appears to be the first characterization of a prokaryotic enzyme of this type. AAG homologues are also found in several other (among them pathogenic) bacterial species. Surprisingly, HPLC analysis revealed that removal of the cytotoxic lesions 3mA and 3mG is 10–15 times less efficient for bAag than for human AAG. In contrast, bAag is 10-fold more efficient than human AAG in the excision of the premutagenic adenine deamination product, hypoxanthine. The two enzymes are similar in their affinity toward the cyclic etheno adduct 1,N6-ethenoadenine. It thus appears that the primary function of the B. subtilis AAG enzyme would be to avoid mutagenesis and repair DNA containing deaminated adenine and cyclic etheno adducts rather than to prevent the cytotoxic effects of methylated base residues. This agrees with the presence in B. subtilis of several other 3mA DNA glycosylases like, for example, two AlkA homologues (AlkA and YfjP) that could be primarily responsible for the repair of alkylation damage. The incomplete restoration of alkylation resistance in the E. coli double mutant alkA tag expressing bAag is consistent with this notion and suggests a less important role of this enzyme in the repair of alkylation damage. In contrast, AAG appears to be the only glycosylase present in human cells responsible for base excision repair of alkylation damage. Assuming that the AAG enzymes originate from prokaryotes already possessing other enzymes for alkylation repair, it can be inferred that Aag in mammals has evolved from being enzymes primarily involved in the removal of premutagenic lesions, e.g. cyclic etheno adducts and deaminated adenine, toward enzymes with broader substrate specificity, including cytotoxic alkylation products. Repair of hypoxanthine in E. coli can be initiated by two different enzymes, the functional homologue of AAG DNA glycosylase, AlkA, or a damaged base-specific endonuclease, Nfi, incising the DNA strand two nucleotides 3′ of the lesion (28Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Google Scholar). Nfi appears to be the major activity for repair of hypoxanthine in E. coli as judged from the high nitrite-induced mutation frequency of the nfi mutant (29Guo G.M. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 46-51Google Scholar). Comparison of hypoxanthine removal by different 3mA DNA glycosylases shows that human and rat AAG are 100–300-fold faster than AlkA from E. coli and Mag from S. cerevisiae (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the prokaryotic AAG 3mA DNA glycosylases are even more efficient enzymes in the removal of hypoxanthine than the mammalian AAG and, consequently, the structurally unrelated AlkA family of proteins also. Interestingly, the genome sequence of B. subtilis also reveals the presence of a gene that translates into a protein with homology to Nfi. Studies of this gene function are required to elucidate whether this represents an alternative mechanism for repair of hypoxanthine in B. subtilis. Etheno bridged exocyclic DNA adducts, e.g. 1,N6-ethenoadenine and 3,N4-ethenocytidine, can arise spontaneously in the cell and will also be induced by mutagens that induce lipid peroxidation or directly by other mutagens such as vinyl chloride and urethane (31Nair J. Barbin A. Guichard Y. Bartsch H. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 613-617Google Scholar). Because AAG appears to be the major ethenoadenine DNA glycosylase in mammalian cells, it is possible that bAag also has a role in repair of premutagenic etheno adducts in B. subtilis. Lau et al. (12Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Google Scholar, 32Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Google Scholar) elucidated the molecular basis for recognition and catalytic activity of the human AAG enzyme. They performed structural and mutational analysis to identify amino acids essential for the enzyme's ability to differentiate between normal and damaged bases. Sequence alignment of the human and bAag shows that all amino acids of human AAG involved in recognition and catalysis are conserved in the B. subtilis sequence, except for Tyr in positions 162 and 165, which are both substituted by His in the Bacillus sequence. Site-specific replacement of Tyr-162 or Tyr-165 with Ala reduces efficiency in the repair of alkylated DNA (12Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Google Scholar). Substitution of these residues with His could thus also possibly explain the reduced activity of B. subtilis Aag for alkylated base residues. However, His residues are clearly closer to Tyr than Ala, and more site-specific mutagenesis experiments will be required to confirm this suggestion. The B. subtilis aag gene is localized between a gene coding for a putative catalase and a gene of unknown function. The catalase and bAag are transcribed in opposite directions with putative Shine-Dalgarno AG-rich sequences and AT-rich promoter-like sequences identified upstream of their respective start codons, and their predicted promoter regions are separated by 20 nucleotides (Fig. 2). The close localization of the two genes and the fact that they are both probably involved in a regulated response to (DNA) damage raise the question of a common regulation of the two genes. Several B. subtilis genes are regulated through the B. subtilis variant of the E. coli SOS box, the so-called Din box (33Winterling K.W. Levine A.S. Yasbin R.E. Woodgate R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1698-1703Google Scholar, 34Winterling K.W. Chafin D. Hayes J.J. Sun J. Levine A.S. Yasbin R.E. Woodgate R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2201-2211Google Scholar); however, the upstream sequence of bAag (and the catalase gene as well) did not contain any sequence homologous to the B. subtilis Din box sequence. Nevertheless, it could still be speculated that common regulatory elements might be involved in the expression of aag and the catalase function in B. subtilis. With all the different genome sequences now available, it becomes possible to make conclusions about the genetic complement of DNA repair in different organisms. Clearly, important differences exist also between different bacteria. The B. subtilis genome apparently has many DNA glycosylases for the repair of alkylation damage; however, the genome is apparently lacking an AlkB function, which was recently shown to be required for repair of 1mA and 3mC in E. coli (35Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. Nature. 2002; 419: 178-182Google Scholar, 36Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Google Scholar). The presence of the mammalian type of 3mA DNA glycosylases in some but not in most bacteria also has a functional implication, which we have alluded to in this communication. It also appears important to realize that homologous genes do not have exactly the same function in all species but that the sequence variations might reflect important functional differences."

Nuclear export of v-ErbA occurs through a CRM1-mediated pathway. In contrast, nuclear export of TRα and another isoform, TRβ, is CRM1-independent. To determine which amino acid changes in v-ErbA confer CRM1-dependent nuclear export, we expressed a panel of green and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged mutant and chimeric proteins in mammalian cells. The sensitivity of subcellular trafficking of these mutants to leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of CRM1, was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Our data showed that a nuclear export sequence resides within a 70-amino acid domain in the C-terminal portion of the p10 region of Gag, and in vitro binding assays demonstrated that Gag interacts directly with CRM1. However, a panel of ligand-binding domain mutants of v-ErbA lacking the Gag sequence exhibited greater nuclear localization in the presence of LMB, suggesting that the various amino acid substitutions/deletions may cause a conformation shift, unmasking an additional CRM1-dependent nuclear export sequence. In contrast, the altered DNA-binding domain of the oncoprotein did not contribute to CRM1-dependent nuclear export. Heterokaryon experiments revealed that v-ErbA did not undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling when the CRM1 export pathway was blocked by LMB treatment, suggesting that the ability to follow the export pathway used by TRα has been lost by the oncoprotein during its evolution.

In addition, v-erbA acquired two small deletions in the N and C termini and 13 amino acid substitutions interspersed throughout the DNA-binding domain, hinge region, and ligand-binding domain (2Stunnenberg H.G.

In mammalian and avian cancer cells v-ErbA acts, in part, as a transcriptional repressor of TRα. However, a number of reports have argued against a simple dominant negative function for the oncoprotein (23Damm K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 24Bauer A. Ulrich E. Andersson M. Beug H. von Lindern M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 701-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Instead it has been proposed that v-ErbA contributes to tumor formation by interfering with the action of both liganded and unliganded TRα (25Braliou G.G. Ciana P. Klaassen W. Gandrillon O.

We are interested in understanding the molecular basis behind the oncogenic conversion of TRα into v-ErbA and the mode of action of dominant negative transcription factors in general. The exact mechanism for transcriptional repression by v-ErbA has not yet been determined, but evidence points to competition for DNA binding sites and cofactors and formation of inactive heterodimers (19Yen P.M. Chin W.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1450-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One relatively unexplored mode of oncogenic action is the effect of altered subcellular localization. Regulated nuclear localization of transcription factors can act as a molecular switch to control transcription (31Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 32Gama-Carvalho M. Carmo-Fonseca M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33Ossareh-Nazari B. Gwizdek C. Dargemont C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms regulating nuclear transport of v-ErbA, in particular its nuclear export, may provide a deeper understanding of its oncogenic activity. v-ErbA exhibits differential subcellular localization and nuclear export from its cellular homolog TRα. While TRα shuttles rapidly between the nucleus and cytoplasm but is primarily localized to the nucleus, v-ErbA accumulates in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in the cell. Leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of the export receptor CRM1 (34Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), blocks nuclear export of v-ErbA; LMB treatment results in complete nuclear localization of v-ErbA, indicating that v-ErbA follows a CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of TRα is not blocked by LMB, indicating that TRα exits the nucleus by a CRM1-independent export pathway (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine which amino acid changes in v-ErbA confer CRM1-dependent nuclear export, we tested a panel of v-ErbA mutants and chimeric proteins. Using transient transfection assays, their subcellular trafficking was assessed for sensitivity to LMB. Our data showed that the Gag region of v-ErbA interacts directly with CRM1 and mediates v-ErbA nuclear export. More specifically, we showed that the nuclear export sequence (NES) resides within a 70-amino acid domain in the C-terminal portion of the p10 region of Gag. In contrast, the altered DNA-binding domain of the oncoprotein did not contribute to CRM1-dependent nuclear export, whereas data suggested that the ligand-binding domain of v-ErbA may play some role in mediating CRM1-dependent nuclear export. When the CRM1 export pathway was blocked by LMB treatment, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of v-ErbA was inhibited, suggesting that the ability to follow the export pathway used by TRα has been lost by the oncoprotein during its evolution. Taken together, our findings point to the intriguing possibility that acquisition of altered nuclear export capabilities contributes to the oncogenic properties of v-ErbA. Plasmids—T7-V3 contains the coding region for a fusion protein termed Gag-TRα comprised of TRα with the Gag sequence from v-ErbA fused to amino acid 13 of TRα, thereby deleting the first 12 amino acids of TRα (22Munoz A. Zenke M. Gehring U. Sap J. Beug H. Vennstrom B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). pGEX-KG-v/c/v encodes v/c/v, a chimeric protein in which the DNA-binding domain of v-ErbA was replaced by the DNA-binding domain of TRα (21Chen H. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In pRS-ΔGag-v-ErbA the viral Gag sequence is deleted, but it still possesses the N- and C-terminal deletions and the 13 point mutations that distinguish v-ErbA from TRα (36Shen Q. Subauste J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41018-41027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The ΔGag-v-ErbA mutants (ΔH10, ΔH11A, ΔH11B, L353R, Δ9heptad, Δ20aa, L360R, and D232A) have substitutions or deletions in regions thought to be important in dimerization (36Shen Q. Subauste J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41018-41027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For the construction of expression vectors for the viral Gag domain alone, the gag sequence was isolated from the 5′ end of v-erbA through PCR amplification of that region from a GFP-v-ErbA expression vector (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Gag and v-erbA mutant coding sequences were subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). In addition, the gag sequence from v-erbA was subcloned into pGEM-4Z (Promega, Madison, WI) for in vitro translation assays. Expression vectors for p53-GFP and GFP-TRα and for in vitro translation of TRα and v-ErbA were as described previously (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J.

Biochem. 1997; 67: 184-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). GFP-TRβ was constructed by subcloning the human TRβ cDNA from RSh-TRβ (38Nagl S.B. Nelson C.C. Romaniuk P.J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1522-1532PubMed Google Scholar) into pEGFP-C1. pET-His-CRM1-H, pGST-Ranwt, and pGST-RanQ69L were used for bacterial overexpression of His-tagged full-length human CRM1 (39Askjaer P. Jensen T.H. Nilsson J. Englmeier L. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), GST-tagged wild-type Ran and mutant RanQ69L (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), respectively. To construct YFP-tagged Gag-(1-70) and Gag NES, coding sequences for the first 70 amino acids of Gag and the putative CRM1-dependent NES in the C terminus of Gag (aa 174-244), plus the addition of a stop codon, were subcloned into pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) between the HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites by PCR amplification of these regions from GFP-v-ErbA. To construct YFP-RSVp10, the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) p10 sequence was synthesized by hybridizing two long synthetic oligonucleotides with a 25-bp overlap, the appropriate restriction sites, and a stop codon and then completing the fragment by PCR. The PCR product was subsequently purified from a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, PCR-amplified, and subcloned into pEYFP-C1 between the HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites. YFP-GagΔCRM1 and YFP-v-ErbAΔCRM1 were constructed as follows. The v-ErbAΔCRM1 fragment was made by ligating PCR fragments coding for aa 1-177 and aa 239-640 obtained from expression vectors for GFP-Gag and GFP-v-ErbA, respectively, joined together at a KpnI restriction site. This ligation product was subsequently PCR-amplified into v-ErbAΔNES and GagΔNES with the appropriate primers and then subcloned into pEYFP-C1 between the HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites. The identity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing with an ABI 3100 Avant Automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Transfection and LMB Treatment—Transient transfection assays were performed exactly as described previously (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NIH/3T3 cells were treated with either 10 ng/ml LMB (either from M. Yoshida, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan or from Sigma) or the same volume of absolute EtOH or MeOH (vehicle control). In some trials, EtOH or MeOH was omitted since we have observed no difference in the distribution of GFP-tagged receptors between EtOH- or MeOH-treated and untreated controls. After a 5-h incubation, cells were fixed as described previously (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and mounted either in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) or in Vectashield after staining the DNA with 1 μm TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nucleocytoplasmic distribution was analyzed using an Olympus epifluorescence microscope and a Cooke SensiCam high performance digital black and white camera or a Radiance 2100 laser scanning microscope system (Bio-Rad) mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. Subsequently digital images were pseudocolored using IPLab scientific imaging software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). Analysis of Nucleocytoplasmic Distribution—Transfection experiments were carried out three times for each construct with ∼100 cells analyzed per trial. Scoring of cells was performed blindly without prior knowledge of LMB treatment. Cells were categorized into four groups based on qualitative assessment of subcellular distribution: whole cell or cytoplasmic distribution (N ≤ C), weak nuclear localization (N > C), strong nuclear localization (N >> C), and complete nuclear localization (all N). Log-linear analysis was used to determine the statistical significance of differences in subcellular distribution. Since the cell counts for the deletion/substitution v-ErbA mutants contained multiple zeros in classification categories, these data were compressed to two categories: whole cell distribution and nuclear localization (including weak, strong, and complete nuclear localization). Whenever possible, analysis was carried out using both the four-category and two-category schemes, and the results were compared. Heterokaryon Assays—Heterokaryon assays were performed exactly as described previously (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NIH/3T3 cells were incubated in 10 ng/ml LMB (or an equivalent volume of EtOH or MeOH as a control) in culture medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 2.5 h before fusion with HeLa cells. Following cell fusion, the cells were incubated in LMB (or an equivalent volume of EtOH or MeOH) for 5-10 h at 37 °C. Fixation and staining for DNA and actin were carried out as described previously (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For heterokaryon analysis, shuttling was indicated by the presence of GFP-tagged protein in both the transfected NIH/3T3 and untransfected HeLa nuclei. Pull-down Assays—Direct interaction between CRM1 and either the Gag domain from v-ErbA, v-ErbA, or TRα was examined by His pull-down assays. The His-CRM1 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After induction with 0.5 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C, bacterial cells were harvested and sonicated in B-PER® bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with 500 μg/ml lysozyme. His-CRM1 was purified using TALON™ metal affinity resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of His-CRM1 in eluted samples was confirmed by 8% SDS-PAGE and staining with Simply Blue™ SafeStain (Invitrogen). Radiolabeled Gag, v-ErbA, and TRα were translated in vitro using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) and T7, SP6, or T3 RNA polymerase, respectively. Recombinant wild-type Ran and RanQ69L were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells as GST fusion proteins. After extraction in B-PER reagent, proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and charged with 20 μm GTP as described previously (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Pull-down assays were carried out in the presence of 20 μm GTP and 140 ng of Ran or RanQ69L using the Profound™ pull-down polyhistidine assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described previously (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The presence of Ran in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate from the TnT-coupled transcription/translation system was determined by Western blot analysis and chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The blot of lysate samples was probed with anti-Ran (goat polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:100 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:10,000. Nuclear Export of the Gag Domain of v-ErbA Is Mediated by CRM1—During the course of oncoprotein activation, v-ErbA was fused to a portion of AEV Gag, acquired 13 interspersed amino acid substitutions, and obtained small deletions in the N and C termini (2Stunnenberg H.G. Garcia-Jimenez C. Betz J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1423: F15-F33Google Scholar, 3Sap J. Munoz A. Damm K. Goldberg Y. Ghysdael J. Leutz A. Beug H. Vennstrom B. Nature. 1986; 324: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Our prior studies have shown that while TRα exits the nucleus by a CRM1-independent pathway, the nuclear export of v-ErbA is CRM1-dependent (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to ascertain which sequence differences between v-ErbA and TRα conferred CRM1-dependent nuclear export. The short residence time of TRα in the cytoplasm prohibits study of nuclear export by conventional single cell analysis, but in interspecies heterokaryon assays, the human nuclei act as a trap for any TRα that appears, however transiently, in the shared cytoplasm after export from mouse nuclei. Fig. 2A illustrates CRM1-independent nuclear export of TRα in a heterokaryon system (panels a-d) and extends our earlier findings to another isoform of the thyroid hormone receptor, TRβ (panels e-h). Previously we have demonstrated that N-terminal fusion with GFP is a valid probe for studying subcellular trafficking of TRα and variants (35Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NIH/3T3 (mouse) cells expressing GFP-tagged TRα or TRβ were fused with nonexpressing HeLa (human) cells both in the presence and absence of LMB. In both cases, TRα and TRβ translocated from the mouse nucleus to the human nucleus, indicating that their nuclear export is CRM1-independent. To ensure that the LMB used in our assays was chemically active, we tested the effect of LMB on the shuttling ability of p53, a transcription factor that follows a CRM1-mediated export pathway (40Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). As expected, nuclear export of p53 was sensitive to LMB; in the presence of the drug, p53 remained localized to the mouse nuclei (Fig. 2A, panels k and l), whereas in the absence of LMB, p53-GFP accumulated in the human nuclei of the heterokaryons (panels i and j). To ascertain which sequence differences between v-ErbA and TRα confer CRM1-dependent nuclear export, we first tested whether the retroviral Gag domain of v-ErbA exhibits nuclear export activity. In retroviruses, the complete Gag polyprotein directs the assembly and release of virus particles from the plasma membrane (41Wills J.W. Craven R.C. AIDS. 1991; 5: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Until recently, it was believed that Gag proteins were targeted directly to the plasma membrane after synthesis in the cytoplasm of the host cell; however, it has now been shown that nuclear import and export of the Gag polyprotein are part of the RSV assembly pathway (42Scheifele L.Z. Garbitt R.A. Rhoads J.D. Parent L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3944-3949Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For brevity, in this report we use the term “Gag” to refer to the truncated Gag domain present in v-ErbA as opposed to the complete Gag polyprotein. To characterize the subcellular localization of the AEV Gag domain of v-ErbA, NIH/3T3 cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding GFP-Gag on its own. In this case, because Gag has a predominantly cytoplasmic localization, it is possible to analyze nuclear export properties by conventional single cell analysis instead of using the heterokaryon system. Cells were scored qualitatively for the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of Gag using four categories: whole cell or cytoplasmic distribution (predominantly cytoplasmic or evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, N ≤ C), weak nuclear localization (whole cell distribution but with a distinct accumulation in the nucleus, N > C), strong nuclear localization (predominantly nuclear with faint cytoplasmic fluorescence, N >> C), and complete nuclear localization (all N). Interestingly Gag alone exhibited a subcellular distribution almost indistinguishable from that of v-ErbA (Fig. 2, B, compare panels a and e; C; and D). The majority of cells (82%) exhibited a whole cell or cytoplasmic distribution with a greater accumulation of Gag in the cytoplasm; however, some cells (18%) showed weak nuclear localization of Gag (Fig. 2D). Since some truncated AEV Gag accumulated in the nucleus, this suggested that it is capable of nuclear import either via a signal-mediated pathway or by passive diffusion through the nuclear pore complex. The predominantly cytoplasmic localization, however, also implies the ability to exit the nucleus. To determine whether Gag follows a CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway, we tested the sensitivity of Gag to LMB. Strikingly Gag showed marked sensitivity to LMB. Treatment for 5 h with LMB resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.0001) in nuclear retention of Gag; only 18% of the cells showed weak nuclear localization of Gag in the absence of LMB compared with 59% in the presence of LMB (Fig. 2, B, panel g, and D). However, unlike v-ErbA in which 87% of the cells showed nuclear accumulation in the presence of LMB (Fig. 2, B, panel c, and C), Gag was not completely localized to the nucleus when CRM1 was inhibited (Fig. 2, B, panel g, and D). The continued presence of a cytoplasmic population of Gag (41% of cells) could indicate that nuclear import of the GFP-tagged truncated viral protein alone is less efficient than when it is fused to v-ErbA. However, after 10-h treatment with LMB, there was no further increase in the amount of Gag trapped in the nucleus (data not shown), suggesting that the apparent differential sensitivity to LMB between Gag alone and Gag fused with v-ErbA is not simply a result of altered nuclear import kinetics but rather due to changes i"

The PIC includes a set of general transcription factors (TFIIA, B, D, E, F, and H) and a mediator complex, along with RNA polymerase II (pol II) (1Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

Much less is known about how individual PIC components contribute to transcription regulation in metazoans, which have evolved a greater complexity of stage- and tissue-specific gene control and additional genes that are not present in yeast. The general transcription factor TFIID is of particular interest because it establishes the start site and provides enzymatic activities that may regulate transcription (5Albright S.R. Tjian R.

TFIID is comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) along with ∼14 TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs). TAFIIs interact with core promoter elements and contact a diverse array of upstream transactivators (5Albright S.R. Tjian R.

TAF-1 and TAF-2 together bind directly to the initiator (Inr) element, which encompasses the start site (9Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). TAF-1, the largest TAFII, is also necessary for TFIID stability and possesses histone acetyltransferase, kinase, and ubiquitin conjugating activities (10Wassarman D.A. Sauer F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TAF-1 is unique to TFIID, but many other TAFIIs are also found in the SPT-ADA-GCN5 (SAGA)-related complexes (5Albright S.R. Tjian R.

In S. cerevisiae conditional mutation or shut-off analyses suggest that many individual TAFIIs have surprisingly specific functions (5Albright S.R. Tjian R.

Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that in yeast a major proportion of transcription involves a TAFII-independent form of TFIID and that the TFIID-specific TAFIIs are each required to transcribe only a modest fraction of the genome, although this model remains a subject of investigation and debate (14Komarnitsky P.B. Michel B. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of the majority of yeast genes is prevented by conditional loss of either TAF-9, which is shared between TFIID and SAGA, or of Taf-1 and the SAGA histone acetyltransferase GCN5 simultaneously, suggesting that TFIID and SAGA are redundant at many genes (4Lee T.I.

Although considerable information has been obtained about TAFII functions in yeast, it is a distinct question how TAFIIs contribute to transcription in vivo in metazoans, particularly in the context of the complex processes of tissue development or differentiation. The three-dimensional structure of TFIID is conserved among eukaryotes (15Andel F. Ladurner A.G. Inouye C. Tjian R. Nogales E. Science. 1999; 286: 2153-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Brand M. Leurent C. Mallouh V. Tora L. Schultz P.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3424-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), predicting a similar conservation of function. However, transcription in metazoans involves a more complex interplay between promoters and long range elements, as well as additional PIC components and TAFII isoforms that are not present in yeast (2Hochheimer A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Loss of TAFII function in metazoans has been difficult to study because TAFIIs are expressed both maternally and zygotically, thus complicating interpretation of mutant phenotypes. For example, in Drosophila taf-1 mutants have pleiotropic defects, but the consequences of eliminating both maternally and zygotically expressed TAF-1 have not been determined (18Wassarman D.A. Aoyagi N. Pile L.A. Schlag E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In hamster cells a conditional taf-1 mutation decreased expression of ∼18% of genes and caused apoptosis (19O'Brien T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2456-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a finding that is consistent with yeast data but does not appear to involve complete ablation of TAF-1 function. In the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, it is possible to use RNA interference (RNAi) (20Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11654) Google Scholar) to inhibit both maternal and zygotic expression of C. elegans TAFIIs. If transcription is prevented in the early C. elegans embryo, maternally supplied mRNAs maintain viability until the 100-cell stage, making it feasible to block expression of even essential transcription factors (21Powell-Coffman J.A. Knight J. Wood W.B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, we determined previously that TAF-4 is required for essentially all early embryonic transcription (22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, TAF-5, TAF-9, and TAF-10 were required for significant and comparable fractions of early transcription but appeared to be dispensable at most metazoan-specific promoters (22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Walker A.K. Blackwell T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6181-6186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Each of the TAFIIs we have analyzed is shared between TFIID and SAGA-like complexes, leaving open the question of how broadly TFIID is required in the embryo. This issue is of particular interest because a major fraction of C. elegans embryonic transcription requires the TBP isoform TLF(TRF2), which does not associate with TAFIIs (24Dantonel J.C. Quintin S. Lakatos L. Labouesse M. Tora L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 715-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Kaltenbach L. Horner M.A. Rothman J.H. Mango S.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 705-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Hochheimer A. Zhou S. Zheng S. Holmes M.C. Tjian R. Nature. 2002; 420: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In this study we have determined that TFIID-specific TAF-1 is essential for most transcription in the developing C. elegans embryo. In contrast to the shared TFIID/SAGA TAF-5, -9, or -10, TAF-1 is needed for many metazoan-specific genes to be expressed at appropriate levels. TAF-1 does not appear to be universally essential for early embryonic transcription, however, unlike TAF-4. TAF-2 appears to be required for a similarly extensive fraction of embryonic transcription as TAF-1. We have also obtained evidence for functional overlap between TAF-1 and the C. elegans CBP/p300 ortholog cbp-1. We conclude that in the early C. elegans embryo TFIID and promoter recognition by TAFIIs are important for transcription of most genes, including many that require TLF. C. elegans and Bioinformatics—C. elegans strains were provided to us and maintained as described previously (22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The wild type (WT) strain was N2. TAFIIs are named according to Tora (27Tora L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), a nomenclature different from that described previously for C. elegans TAFIIs (22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). C. elegans taf-1 and taf-2 each reidentified their corresponding human and Drosophila counterparts in GenBank data bases. Alignments were produced by Megalign (DNAStar). Immunostaining and Fluorescence Analysis—Rabbit antisera were raised against the TAF-1 peptide VSQKPHKDENATPVPVKKLVT with an N-terminal Cys added and affinity purified (22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For TAF-1 staining, embryos were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde before treating with methanol. Washes and antibody incubations were performed in PBT (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin) prior to staining. TAF-1 antibody staining was competed by the cognate but not heterologous peptides (not shown). Staining with α-TAF-9, α-TAF-10, α-pol II (pol 3/3) (22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), P-CTD (anti-phospho-Ser-5) (28Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was performed as in Ref. 22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. α-TBP-1 and α-TLF-1 immunostaining was performed as in Ref. 25Kaltenbach L. Horner M.A. Rothman J.H. Mango S.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 705-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar. Staining with the H14 antibody was performed as for H5 and provided results identical to those with the P-CTD antibody. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) analysis, image capture, and manipulation were performed as described by Walker et al. (22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RNAi Analysis—For injection of dsRNA, cDNA fragments for taf-1 (nucleotides 3066-3942 and 4329-4936) and taf-2 (nucleotides 385-1347) were generated by PCR from a C. elegans cDNA library (gift of Marc Vidal). Identical results were obtained from both taf-1 cDNAs as well as from a taf-1 clone (yk6h7) obtained from Yuji Kohara (NIG, Japan). dsRNA synthesis was synthesized in vitro with Megascript (Ambion). Injection and analysis of embryos were performed as described by Walker et al. (22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Simultaneous double RNAi was performed with a 1:1 mixture of dsRNAs. In parallel, a 1:1 dilution of each individual dsRNA with an unrelated dsRNA (glp-1) resulted in appropriate terminal arrest, reporter gene expression, and CTD phosphorylation levels (not shown). For feeding of dsRNA, cDNA fragments for taf-1 (nucleotides 2791-3408) and ama-1 (nucleotides 1254-2259) were inserted into the feeding vector pPD129.36 (gift of Andy Fire). Synchronized L4 larvae were placed on bacteria expressing dsRNA to gfp (pPD128.110, gift of Andy Fire), ama-1, or taf-1 for 36 h. taf-1 and ama-1(RNAi) embryos produced from feeding dsRNA at 36 h had anti-phospho-Ser-2 staining patterns and LET-858::GFP expression similar to injected dsRNA at 24 h (not shown). RT-PCR—N2 hermaphrodites were fed dsRNA for taf-1, ama-1, or gfp (control). Adults were washed five times in phosphate-buffered saline, and embryos were collected by bleaching. After lysing embryos in 0.5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen), RNA was extracted with Tri-Reagent (Sigma). cDNA was produced from 1 μg of control RNA and from equivalent numbers of ama-1 or taf-1(RNAi) embryos (Superscript II, Invitrogen). PCR was performed using HotMix (Eppendorf). Each primer set was tested on cDNA produced from at least two independent RNA preparations. At least three dilutions of cDNA were tested, and multiple cycle numbers were used to assure linearity of reaction. Primers were designed to span at least one intron (sequences available upon request). Immunoblot Analysis—Control, taf-1(RNAi), or ama-1(RNAi) embryos from feeding were collected as for RT-PCR, then lysed by sonication in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol. Proteins were separated on 6.5% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the antibodies indicated in Fig. 5. In this experiment anti-phospho-Ser-5 was H14 and α-pol II was ARNA3 (Research Diagnostics). Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit IgM (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) for anti-phospho-Ser-5 and anti-phospho-Ser-2, goat anti-mouse (Jackson Immunologicals) for α-pol II, and goat anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunologicals) for α-CBP-1. Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). taf-1 Is Essential during Early Embryonic Development—To investigate TFIID functions in the early C. elegans embryo, we inhibited TAF-1 expression by RNAi. C. elegans TAF-1 is significantly related to hTAF-1 throughout its length, including predicted functional domains (Fig. 1A). A specific antiserum detected TAF-1 in all WT embryonic nuclei, in oocytes, and in the adult germ line, indicating that taf-1 is maternally expressed (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Accordingly, taf-1 mRNA levels were only modestly reduced when zygotic transcription was prevented by RNAi knock-down of ama-1, the pol II large subunit (Fig. 3D). In taf-1(RNAi) embryos, nuclear TAF-1 antibody staining was eliminated (Fig. 2), and taf-1 mRNA levels were reduced dramatically (Fig. 3D), indicating that TAF-1 expression was decreased significantly. In contrast, levels of multiple other TAFIIs, TBP, and AMA-1 were similar to WT in taf-1(RNAi) embryos (Fig. 2 and data not shown).Fig. 2Expression of TAFIIs, TBP, and TLF in taf-1(RNAi) embryos.

Representative terminally arrested RNAi embryos were examined by differential interference microscopy and compared with a WT embryo that was about to hatch. ama-1(RNAi) and taf-1(RNAi) embryos each ceased development with 90-100 cells (n = 4). ama-1 encodes the pol II large subunit. B, PIE-1::GFP expression in WT and RNAi embryos, examined by fluorescence microscopy. In taf-1(RNAi) embryos, each aspect of PIE-1::GFP germ line and subcellular localization was indistinguishable from WT, including the presence of PIE-1 in germ line RNA-protein P granules (32Reese K.J. Dunn M.A. Waddle J.A. Seydoux G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). C, shortened E2 cell cycle in taf-1(RNAi) embryos. Lineage analysis of taf-1(RNAi) embryos revealed that their early cell division planes were normal except that the E2 cells (Ea and Ep) divided prematurely. Only the EMS cell lineage is shown. D, depletion of taf-1 mRNA in taf-1(RNAi) embryos. RT-PCR was performed with RNA from control (C), ama-1(RNAi) (A), or taf-1(RNAi) (T) embryos. The moderate decrease in taf-1 mRNA in ama-1(RNAi) embryos is consistent with inhibition of zygotic but not maternal taf-1 expression, but in taf-1(RNAi) embryos both maternal and zygotic expression of taf-1 was largely prevented. In contrast, expression of the strictly maternally expressed gene rsp-5 (39Hill A. Hunter C.P. Tsung B. Tucker-Kellogg G. Brown E.

Rothman J.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interference with maternal and zygotic expression of other TAFIIs or PIC components such as ama-1 and ttb-1 (TFIIB) arrests embryonic development at about 100 cells without signs of differentiation, a phenotype that is characteristic of a broad zygotic transcription defect (21Powell-Coffman J.A. Knight J. Wood W.B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). taf-1(RNAi) embryos arrested development at a similar stage, apparently without differentiation (Fig. 3A). To evaluate maternal RNA storage we monitored early cell divisions and performed parallel experiments in a transgenic strain that expressed a fusion of the maternally derived germ line protein PIE-1 to GFP. Appropriate localization of PIE-1::GFP depends on at least 20 maternal genes (32Reese K.J. Dunn M.A. Waddle J.A. Seydoux G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In taf-1(RNAi) embryos PIE-1::GFP expression and localization patterns were normal at every stage (Fig. 3B; not shown), suggesting that storage of maternal gene products was likely to be intact. Early cell division timing and cleavage planes were also normal in these RNAi embryos, except that the cell cycle period of the two E daughters (E2 cells), which give rise to the endoderm, was decreased by approximately half (Fig. 3C). The last phenotype is characteristic of a broad transcription defect (21Powell-Coffman J.A. Knight J. Wood W.B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that depletion of embryonic TAF-1 does not detectably alter maternal mRNA stores but may significantly impair embryonic mRNA transcription. Severely Reduced pol II CTD Phosphorylation Levels in taf-1(RNAi) Embryos—We investigated how mRNA transcription was affected in taf-1(RNAi) embryos first by analyzing phosphorylation of the pol II large subunit CTD. The CTD consists of multiple repeats that are based upon the consensus YSPTSPS (33Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Polymerase II is initially recruited in an unphosphorylated form, then at the promoter its CTD repeat is phosphorylated on Ser-5 by the TFIIH kinase (28Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2435-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 34Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). During elongation the distribution of CTD phosphorylation shifts to Ser-2 (34Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 35Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), which is phosphorylated by the P-TEFb kinase (31Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 36Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). CTD Ser-5 and Ser-2 phosphorylation can be specifically detected in C. elegans embryonic nuclei by staining with the H14 (or P-CTD) and H5 antibodies, respectively (22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D.

In the C. elegans embryo, the levels and patterns of anti-phospho-Ser-5 and anti-phospho-Ser-2 staining parallel overall transcription activity (22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Walker A.K. Blackwell T.K. J. Biol.

Nuclear staining with these antibodies first appears at the three- to four-cell stage, when new mRNA transcription begins. CTD Ser-2 phosphorylation is detected only in the transcriptionally active somatic cells (Fig. 4, A, C, and D) (37Seydoux G. Dunn M.A. Development. 1997; 124: 2191-2201PubMed Google Scholar). CTD Ser-5 phosphorylation is apparent as a partially punctate nucleoplasmic pattern in interphase somatic nuclei but is limited to two discrete foci in the transcriptionally silent germ line nucleus (Fig. 4, A, B, and D). These germ line foci depend upon the general transcription factor TFIIB and the mediator component RGR-1, suggesting that they require PIC formation (22Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K.

J., and Ferguson, S. J. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 5156–5160). To understand the effects of this change on the structure and dynamics of the protein, hetero-nuclear 15N-edited NMR techniques have been used to characterize this b-type variant. The backbone 15N, 1HN, and 1Hα, and 1Hβ resonances of the protein have been assigned. Analysis of 3JHNα coupling constants, nuclear Overhauser enhancement intensities, and chemical shift index data demonstrates that the four α-helices present in the wild-type protein are retained in the b-type variant. Comparison of the chemical shifts for the b-type and wild-type proteins indicates that the tertiary structures of the two proteins are closely similar. Some subtle differences are, however, observed for residues in the N-terminal region and in the vicinity of the heme-binding pocket. Hydrogen exchange studies show that there are 25 backbone amide protons that exchange very slowly in the b-type variant and confirm that the fluctuations within the b-type protein are of a similar extent to those in the wild-type protein. These data demonstrate the notable retention of the native secondary structure and tertiary fold despite the absence of covalent linkages between the heme group and the protein.

A c-type cytochrome has one or more heme groups attached to a polypeptide chain via thioether bonds formed between the vinyl groups of heme and the two thiol groups of a characteristic CXXCH motif in the protein sequence (1Pettigrew G.W. Moore G.R. Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural, and Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 1-223Google Scholar). This post-translational modification of covalently binding the heme group is not a spontaneous process. It requires a machinery which, surprisingly, differs between different cell types (2Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1998; 23: 103-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A very large number of heme proteins (e.g. the globins and b-type cytochromes) do not have this prosthetic group covalently attached, which raises the fundamental question as to what is gained by the covalent attachment of heme in the c-type cytochromes (3Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Structure. 1999; 7: R281-R290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 4Allen J.W. Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol.

The first success in this direction was the formation of a variant form of an exceedingly stable c-type cytochrome, cytochrome c552, from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus (5Sambongi Y. Uchiyama S. Kobayashi Y. Igarashi Y. Hasegawa J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3355-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Preliminary analysis of the tertiary structure indicated that the protein had not, contrary to some expectations, been grossly perturbed as a consequence of the loss of the thioether bonds (7Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Wain R. Pertinhez T.A. Tomlinson E.J. Hong L. Dobson C.M. Ferguson S.J. Smith L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45813-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, this conclusion could not exclude that the loss of these bonds had caused a significant adjustment of structure, within an overall retained α-helical framework, either locally or throughout the molecule. In order to investigate in detail the structural consequences of losing both the covalent thioether bonds to the heme in forming C10A/C13A HT-c552, we have performed studies on this b-type variant using heteronuclear 15N-edited NMR techniques. Chemical shift, coupling constant, and hydrogen exchange data for C10A/C13A HT-c552 are reported here and are compared with those for the wild-type protein (WT HT-c552) (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y.H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES15N-Labeled Protein—C10A/C13A HT-c552 was expressed from plasmid pEST202 in Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (7Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Labeled protein was grown on minimal medium adapted from M9 with supplements. Each 500-ml flask of minimal medium contained 100 ml of M9 salts, 5 ml of Solution II, 25 ml of 40% glucose, 2 ml of 1 m MgSO4, 2 ml of 0.01 m FeCl3, 2.5 ml of vitamins, and 66.5 ml of water. M9 contained 33.9 g of Na2HPO4, 5.0 g of KH2PO4, 2.5 g of NaCl, and 5.0 g of 15NH4Cl. Solution II contained 0.05 g of CaCl2, 0.05 g of ZnSO4, 0.05 g of MnSO4, 1.2 g of thiamine, 1.25 g of niacin, and 0.015 g of biotin (per 250 ml). Vitamins contained 25 mg of choline, 25 mg of folic acid, 25 mg of pantothenic acid, 25 mg of pyridoxal, and 2.5 mg of riboflavin (per 250 ml). All these chemicals were obtained from Sigma. 500-ml flasks of minimal Oregon medium were inoculated with overnight culture and shaken at 225 rpm for 15 h or until the A600 had reached ∼0.8. At this point isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and δ-aminolevulinic acid (from Sigma) were added to a final concentration of 1 and 0.1 mm, respectively. After a further 15 h of shaking, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were pale pink in color. The expressed cytochrome was purified as described previously (7Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Cleavage of N-terminal Methionine—The N-formyl methionine was not successfully cleaved by the E. coli methionine aminopeptidase during protein synthesis. Therefore, it was removed using the leucine amino peptidase from Aeromonas proteolytica (9Karan E.F. Russell B.S. Bren K.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 1 μg of AAP (purchased from Sigma) was added to 5 mg of HT-c552 in 5 ml of phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The cleavage products and AAP were separated from HT-c552 by gel filtration. CD spectroscopy was used to study the thermostability of C10A/C13A HT-c552 with and without the presence of an N-terminal formyl methionine. The ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored over the temperature range of 20–95 °C with spectra recorded after increments of 5 °C.NMR Experiments—NMR experiments were performed on a 750-MHz spectrometer at the Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences. The NMR samples contained 0.5 mm uniformly 15N-labeled C10A/C13A HT-c552 in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The samples were purged with nitrogen, and the protein was reduced by the addition of a few grains of sodium dithionite. The NMR tubes were then flame-sealed under vacuum. All experiments were collected at 25 °C. Assignments were obtained using three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and TOCSY-HSQC experiments (10Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 11Driscoll P.C. Clore G.M. Marion D. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3542-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Data were collected with sweep widths of 11363.6, 9009.0, and 2500.0 Hz in the F3 (1H), F1 (1H), and F2 (15N) dimensions, respectively. 512, 128, and 32 complex points were collected in F3, F1, and F2, respectively. A mixing time of 150 ms was used in the three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiment and 46 ms in the TOCSY-HSQC experiment. Data were processed using a Gaussian window function in F3 anda60°-shifted sine bell function in F1 and F2. The data were zero-filled once in each dimension. Spectra were referenced in the 1H dimension using the water resonance at 4.75 ppm and in the 15N dimension using the 1H referencing and a 15N/1H γ ratio of 0.101329144. Studies of the hydrogen exchange properties of C10A/C13A HT-c552 were initiated by dissolving 15N-labeled lyophilized protein in 0.5 ml of D2O at pH 7.4. HSQC spectra were collected at 25 °C immediately and 3 days after sample preparation.RESULTSExpression of 15N-Labeled HT-c552—Small scale trials were used to optimize conditions for the production of 15N-labeled C10A/C13A HT-c552. The media used for the trials were the named minimal media, minimal Oregon, minimal +, Celtone, Silantes OD5, and Bioexpress (Cambridge Isotopes Inc.). These media are produced from algae using ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source and carbon dioxide as the sole carbon source. The cells expressed in minimal Oregon and in minimal + media were of a pale pink color, whereas the cells from the minimal, Celtone, Silantes OD5, and Bioexpress media were white and showed no signs of expression of HT-c552. Although the cells from the minimal + and minimal Oregon media showed signs of correct expression from their color, no band for HT-c552 on an SDS gel could be seen after sonication of the cells.Correct synthesis of cytochromes requires the incorporation of a heme moiety into the apoprotein. One explanation for the lack of observable expression of C10A/C13A HT-c552 in the initial trials is that it could be due to the poor supply of heme during expression. This hypothesis was tested by the addition of the heme precursor, δ-aminolevulinic acid, to the growth media. The addition of 0.1 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid in the minimal + and minimal Oregon growth media resulted in a noticeable increase in the intensity of the red color of the cells. The UV-visible spectrum of a suspension of the cells gave maxima at 560, 529, and 425 nm, characteristic of C10A/C13A HT-c552. Expression using the minimal Oregon medium gave the best yields of 15N-labeled C10A/C13A HT-c552 as determined by the absorbance at 560 nm, and this was employed for the production of the protein for the NMR studies.Cleavage of N-terminal Methionine—It has been found previously for WT HT-c552 that the presence of an N-terminal methionine decreases the stability of the protein. The mid-point for the guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding of the wild-type protein is reduced from 4.5 to 4.1 m if the N-terminal methionine is present (9Karan E.F. Russell B.S. Bren K.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of the N-terminal methionine from WT HT-c552 was achieved by the reaction of the protein with the leucine aminopeptidase from A. proteolytica (AAP) (9Karan E.F. Russell B.S. Bren K.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The same method was therefore employed for C10A/C13A HT-c552. 100% cleavage of the N-terminal methionine occurred after 1 h of incubation with AAP, whereas prior to cleavage the protein consisted of 92% methionylated protein as determined by N-terminal sequencing.The stability of cleaved HT-c552 was compared with that of the methionylated protein by thermal denaturation studies using CD spectroscopy (Fig. 1). For both proteins a sharp decrease in the ellipticity at 222 nm was observed between 40 and 60 °C, indicating a significant reduction in secondary structure throughout this range. The transition mid-point (melting temperature) of reduced C10A/C13A HT-c552 is 58.3 °C with the N-terminal methionine cleaved. This value is significantly higher than that of the reduced methionylated protein, 51.4 °C. The cleaved protein was used in the subsequent NMR studies.NMR Resonance Assignments—Sequential assignments for the backbone 15N, HN, Hα, and Hβ resonances of C10A/C13A HT-c552 in the reduced state were performed using three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and TOCSY-HSQC spectra and established methods (12Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 13-161Google Scholar, 13Redfield C. Roberts G.C.K. NMR of Macromolecules: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 71-99Google Scholar). The assignment process was aided by comparison to the resonance assignments for wild-type HT-c552 (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y.H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of C10A/C13A HT-c552 is shown in Fig. 2, with each main chain 1H-15N peak labeled with its sequence assignment. The 1H resonances for the heme group in C10A/C13A HT-c552 have also been assigned. All the assignments for C10A/C13A HT-c552 have been submitted to BioMagRes Bank (accession number BMRB-6033).Fig. 21H-15N HSQC spectrum of reduced C10A/C13A HT-c552, at pH 7.4 and 25 °C, labeled with the resonance assignments. The horizontal lines at the top right of the figure connect the resonances of the Asn and Gln side chains, and the box at the bottom left shows the most downfield shifted backbone and Trp side chain HN resonances.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As in b-type cytochromes, there are two possible orientations with which the heme group can insert into C10A/C13A HT-c552. These differ by a rotation of 180° of the heme about an axis connecting the α-meso and γ-meso positions. For C10A/C13A HT-c552 there is one major set of NMR resonances for the heme group showing that there is one predominant heme orientation. However, in the NMR spectra of some samples another minor set of much weaker heme resonances could be resolved reflecting a variable low population of conformers with the alternative heme orientation (approximate relative intensities of the resonances major:minor is ≥70:≤30).Secondary Structure Identification—The Hα chemical shifts of C10A/C13A HT-c552 were used to predict the secondary structure present in the protein using the chemical shift index method (14Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). C10A/C13A HT-c552 is predicted by this method to contain five α-helices (residues 1–7, 12–16, 19–33, 38–49, and 66–80) and a region of β-sheet (residues 55–57). The short region assigned by the chemical shift index as β-sheet is found in close proximity to the heme group in the wild-type protein structure. Ring current shifts from this group rather than β-sheet secondary structure are likely to be responsible for the downfield Hα chemical shifts in this region.Fig. 3A summary of the NMR data for reduced C10A/C13A HT-c552 at pH 7.4 and 25 °C. The 1Hα chemical shift indices are indicated by + and - symbols. By using the method of Wishart et al. (14Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar), each residue has been assigned a value of +1 or -1 if its 1Hα chemical shift is greater than or less than 0.1 ppm from the random coil chemical shift, respectively. A dense region of -1s indicates the likely presence of an α-helix, and three or more consecutive +1s may indicate a β-sheet region. Residues that have 3JHNα coupling constant values of less than 5 Hz are indicated by open circles, and dNN and dαN show the relative intensities of sequential HN-HN and Hα-HN NOEs, respectively. # shows the residues whose HSQC peaks are present 2 h after the lyophilized protein was dissolved in D2O (HN2h), and * shows the residues whose HSQC peaks are present 72 h after the lyophilized protein was dissolved in D2O (HN3d). At the bottom of the diagram the data for WT HT-c552 are given (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y.H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An x indicates the residues in WT HT-c552 with slowly exchanging amide whose resonances are present 20 h after the protein has been dissolved in D2O at pH 4.8 (HNWT), whereas an h shows the residues that are involved in the four α-helices in WT HT-c552 (SSWT).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the regions of secondary structure predicted using the chemical shift index method, 3JHNα coupling constant measurements have been made, and the intensities of sequential Hα-HN and HN-HN NOEs have been analyzed. These data are summarized in Fig. 3. 3JHNα coupling constant values of less than 5 Hz are seen for residues 2–7, 28–31, 38–44, 46–47, and 66–77 within four of the regions identified as helical from the chemical shift index. These regions also have medium to strong intensity HN-HN NOEs and weaker or absent Hα-HN sequential NOEs. Taken together these data therefore identify four main α-helical regions in C10A/C13A HT-c552 (residues 2–7, 28–31, 38–47, and 66–77). These are in closely similar positions to the helices seen in the wild-type protein (residues 3–7, 27–32, 38–47, and 67–78) (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y.H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The fifth potential helical region for C10A/C13A HT-c552 from the chemical shift index (residues 12–16) only contains one residue with a 3JHNα coupling constant value of less than 5 Hz. Therefore, there is no evidence at this stage for a regular persistent helical conformation in this region. These residues do not adopt a helix in the wild-type structure.Comparison with the Chemical Shifts of Wild-type HT-c552—Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the chemical shifts for the HN, Hα, and Hβ resonances of each residue in WT (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y.H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and C10A/C13A HT-c552. Chemical shift values are very dependent on steric and electronic effects including those arising from both protein secondary and tertiary structure (15Oldfield E. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2002; 53: 349-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Case D.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The detailed comparison of the chemical shift data for the wild-type and mutant proteins therefore provides a sensitive method for establishing the level of similarity between the structures adopted by WT and C10A/C13A HT-c552. Overall, the chemical shifts for C10A/C13A HT-c552 are almost universally 0.12 ppm greater than those determined for the authentic protein. This difference is very similar to that found in the 1H NMR characterization of recombinant WT HT-c552 (9Karan E.F. Russell B.S. Bren K.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The discrepancy has been attributed to variations in chemical shift referencing and solution conditions in the different NMR studies. Therefore, in this work the chemical shifts of Hasegawa et al. (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y.H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) for the wild-type protein have been corrected by 0.12 ppm prior to the comparison.Fig. 4Differences in HN (a), Hα (b), and Hβ (c) chemical shifts observed for reduced WT HT-c552, pH 4.8 at 25 °C (6Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y.H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and reduced C10A/C13A HT-c552 at pH 7.4 and 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As shown in Fig. 4, a very good agreement is observed between the Hα, Hβ, and HN chemical shifts of WT and C10A/C13A HT-c552 (correlation coefficients of 0.999 for Hα, 0.984 for Hβ, and 0.992 for HN) despite a difference of solution pH in the two studies (WT pH 4.8, C10A/C13A, pH 7.4). The higher pH conditions were required for the NMR study of C10A/C13A HT-c552, as this variant is not stable at low pH (7Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The agreement between the chemical shifts of WT and C10A/C13A HT-c552 provides clear evidence for the close similarity of the overall tertiary structure as well as the secondary structure of the two proteins. The similarity is particularly striking for residues that have chemical shift values perturbed by heme ring current effects. This is the case, for example, for Gly-49 Hα (WT 2.98, 1.75 ppm; C10A/C13A 2.97, 1.75 ppm), Val-53 HN (WT 10.26 ppm; C10A/C13A 10.32 ppm), and Ile-76 Hα (WT 2.43 ppm; C10A/C13A 2.42 ppm).Some differences do occur, however, between the chemical shifts of the two proteins. Differences of greater than 0.3 ppm are seen for the Hα chemical shifts of seven residues, the Hβ chemical shifts of six residues, and the HN chemical shifts of nine residues. Nine of the 22 deviations greater than 0.3 ppm come from either the residues that are mutated (Ala-10 and Ala-13), those that are directly adjacent to the mutations in the sequence (Gly-9, Met-11, Ala-12, and His-14), or those that are very close in space to the mutated residues in the wild-type structure (Gly-22). Six of the other differences involve residues that are located in the N-terminal region of the protein (Asn-1, Glu-2, Leu-4, and Ala-5) and suggest that there are some slight changes to the structure or dynamics of this region in C10A/C13A HT-c552. These changes could result, at least in part, from the differing pH conditions of the two NMR studies. In particular, it is possible that salt bridge formation between the side chains of Glu-2 and Lys-5 under the higher pH conditions used for the C10A/C13A HT-c552 NMR work could increase the stability of the N-terminal helix. The other chemical shift deviations greater than 0.3 ppm are seen for Lys-8, Ala-18, Asp-27, Tyr-32, Lys-36, and Ser-51. Asp-27, Tyr-32, and Ser-51 are adjacent to the heme-binding pocket. Small variations in this binding pocket may account for these chemical shift changes. The largest chemical shift difference is seen for the HN of Lys-36. The reason for this difference is not clear. However, as this residue is very exposed, the chemical shift may have been affected by the differences in solution conditions used for the wild-type and mutant NMR studies.Hydrogen Exchange Study of C10A/C13A HT-c552—Studies of the hydrogen exchange properties of C10A/C13A HT-c552 provide a method for probing the dynamics and the extent of backbone fluctuations in the mutant protein (17Clarke J. Itzhaki L.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Englander S.W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 213-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Slowly exchanging backbone amide protons in reduced C10A/C13A HT-c552 were identified by recording an HSQC spectrum immediately after the lyophilized protein was dissolved in D2O and then another spectrum 3 days after the initiation of the reaction. Each HSQC experiment was recorded in 2 h. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 3. For mitochondrial cytochrome c, a conformational change in the iron coordination has been found to occur on hydration of lyophilized protein (19Aviram I. Schejter A. Biopolymers. 1972; 11: 2141-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is possible that a similar change could also occur in HT-c552 and may reduce the hydrogen exchange protection for some residues. This work concentrates, in comparison with the wild-type protein, on the amides that show a high level of protection and therefore have not been significantly affected by this possible change. In C10A/C13A HT-c552 there are 36 slow exchanging amides whose HSQC peaks are present after 2 h and 25 amides whose HSQC peaks are present after 3 days. 20 of the 25 slowly exchanging amides that are present after 3 days are located within the α-helical regions of the protein. The other five residues are in the loop region between helices 3 and 4 and are found in close proximity to the heme group (Fig. 5b).Fig. 5The hydrogen exchange data for WT HT-c552 at pH 4.8 (a) and C10A/C13A HT-c552 at pH 7.4 (b).

The C-terminal domain has a classical helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif that is located at opposite ends of the elongated dimer. Since the distance between the two helix-turn-helix motifs is too great to allow binding to two adjacent major grooves of the 16-bp Mor-binding site, we propose that conformational changes in the protein and DNA will be required for Mor to interact with the DNA.

Bacteriophage Mu is a temperate phage that infects several species of enteric bacteria, including Escherichia coli K-12 (3Symonds N.A. Toussaint A. van de Putte P. Howe M.M. Phage Mu.

Virology. 1990; 174: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The early promoter, Pe, has typical -10 and -35 sequences and is recognized directly by the bacterial RNA polymerase (16Krause H.M. Higgins N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3744-3752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The middle and late promoters have recognizable -10 hexamers but lack the -35 hexamer; transcription from these promoters requires the phage-encoded proteins Mor 1The abbreviations used are: Mor, middle operon regulator protein; TrpR, tryptophan operon repressor; HTH, helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; α-CTD, C-terminal domain of α subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase; σ-CTD, C-terminal domain of σ subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase; TEMED, tetramethylethylenediamine; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; Cm, chloramphenicol; Ap, ampicillin. and C, respectively (17Margolin W.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6641-6650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The middle operon regulator, Mor, is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein composed of 129 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 14.7 kDa (19Mathee K. Howe M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6641-6650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kahmeyer-Gabbe M. Howe M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has an isoelectric point of 6.3 and an acidic N terminus and basic C terminus. The C-terminal region is predicted to contain a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding motif (19Mathee K. Howe M.M. J.

Because there is no amino acid sequence homology between Mor and previously studied transcription factors, Mor and C define a new family of transcription factors that we call the Mor/C family. Mor binds to the middle promoter Pm as a homodimer, recognizing a 16-bp region from -36 to -51 with respect to the transcription start site at +1 (25Artsimovitch I. Howe M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the middle promoter sequence (25Artsimovitch I. Howe M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified an imperfect dyadsymmetry element within the Mor-binding site (Fig. 1B). It also revealed a bias between the two halves of the Morbinding site, showing a greater importance of the down-stream half-site for Mor binding and promoter activity (25Artsimovitch I. Howe M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription activation of the middle promoter by Mor requires the C-terminal domains of both the α (α-CTD) and σ (σ-CTD) subunits of bacterial RNA polymerase (26Artsimovitch I. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Howe M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32343-32348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Binding of Mor and RNA polymerase to the promoter introduces a strand separation or distortion involving promoter positions -32 to -34 in addition to positions -12 to -1 (27Artsimovitch I. Kahmeyer-Gabbe M. Howe M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9408-9413Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it has been proposed that the mechanism for Mor-dependent middle promoter activation involves Mormediated recruitment of RNA polymerase to the promoter and/or isomerization of the closed complex to an open complex through its interaction with the α-CTD and σ-CTD of RNA polymerase (27Artsimovitch I. Kahmeyer-Gabbe M. Howe M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9408-9413Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). In an effort to gain a better understanding of Mor function, we determined the crystal structure of Mor to a resolution of 2.2 Å. The structure reveals an unusual mode of dimerization along with a classical helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. Most interesting, in the structure, the HTH motifs of Mor are located too far apart to interact with the two adjacent major grooves of DNA; thus, conformational changes in Mor may be needed for it to bind to DNA. Because Mor does not share sequence or structural similarities to other characterized proteins, the Mor structure could very well serve as a paradigm for the Mor/C family of proteins. Media, Chemicals, Enzymes, Columns, and Analytical Services— Routine cell growth and protein overexpression were done in LB medium (28Howe M.M. Virology. 1973; 54: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas cultures for β-galactosidase assays were grown in minimal medium with casamino acids (M9CA) (17Margolin W. Rao G. Howe M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2003-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When needed, medium was supplemented with chloramphenicol (Cm) at 25 μg/ml and ampicillin (Ap) at 40 μg/ml. MacConkey lactose plates with 50 g/liter of MacConkey agar (Difco) was used for plate phenotyping. Chloramphenicol was purchased from Sigma, and ampicillin was obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside were from American Bioorganics. Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, TEMED, SDS, ammonium persulfate, and Biospin columns were purchased from Bio-Rad. Chloroform and glycerol were obtained from Fisher, and thiomersal and K2PtCl4 were from Aldrich. Imidazole was purchased from Sigma, and guanidine hydrochloride was from Hampton Research. Seakem- and Nusieve (both genome technology grade)-agarose were from FMC Bioproducts. Talon spin columns used for small scale protein purification were from Clontech, and the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin for large scale preparations was from Qiagen. The Superdex-75 gel filtration column was from Amersham Biosciences. The restriction enzymes HindIII and PstI were from New England Biolabs. The Thermus aquaticus polymerase and T4 DNA ligase were from Roche Applied Science; T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from Promega Corp. Shrimp alkaline phosphatase was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Automated DNA sequencing was performed by the Molecular Resource Center of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Mass spectroscopy and N-terminal protein sequencing were performed by the Hartwell Center for Biotechnology and Bioinformatics of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Protein Purification and Crystallization—Construction of the Mor expression plasmid, pIA69, has been described elsewhere (29Artsimovitch I. Activation of Middle Transcription of the Phage Mu. The University of Tennessee, Memphis1996Google Scholar). The plasmid contains the gene encoding an N-terminal histidine-tagged Mor protein (His-Mor; 17.1 kDa) under the control of a T7 promoter as well as a slightly modified Plac promoter we call PlacSYN (29Artsimovitch I. Activation of Middle Transcription of the Phage Mu. The University of Tennessee, Memphis1996Google Scholar, 30Zhao Z. Effects of Plys Promoter Sequence on Transcription Activation by the C Protein of Bacteriophage Mu. The University of Tennessee, Memphis1999Google Scholar). The His-Mor protein was overexpressed in E. coli strain JM109 DE3 (mcrA Δpro-lac thi gyrA96 endA1 hsdR17 relA1 supE44 recA λDE3/F′ lacIQ pro+; Promega Corp.). An overnight culture (200 ml) of a fresh transformant was transferred to 4 liters of LB medium containing 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol and grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.5–0.6. The cells were induced with 1 mm IPTG for 3 h and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and lysed by sonication. The His-Mor protein was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography (Qiagen). Buffer exchange into the storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and further purification were achieved by gel filtration chromatography in a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences). For crystallization trials, the purified protein was concentrated to 50 mg/ml by using an Amicon YM30 (30-kDa cut-off) membrane filter, which retained the 34.2-kDa His-Mor dimer. Mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing confirmed that the purified protein was histidine-tagged Mor (data not shown). Crystallization was performed by the hanging drop diffusion method (31McPherson A. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. Krieger Publishing Co., Malabar, FL1989Google Scholar). Initial screening was carried out using Hampton Research screens and then refined. His-Mor crystals were obtained at either 4 or 18 °Cby the hanging drop diffusion method using 1.8–2.1 m NaCl as a precipitant in 0.1 m imidazole buffer (pH 7.0–7.2). Guanidine hydrochloride (125 mm) was used as an additive to improve the diffraction quality of the crystals. Because guanidine is a chaotrope, the secondary structure composition of the protein was analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy in the presence and absence of guanidine hydrochloride; no difference was observed between the two samples (data not shown). The crystals belong to space group P3221 with cell dimensions of a = 81.2 Å and c = 44.8 Å. There is one molecule in an asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 52%. Data Collection—Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen using a cryoprotectant solution made of the mother liquor supplemented with glycerol to a final concentration of 40%, and diffraction data were collected in a nitrogen gas stream (100 K). The mercury-derivative crystals were obtained by soaking in mother liquor with 10 mm thiomersal for 3 days at 4 °C. The two-wavelength data using mercury-derivative crystals and one-wavelength native data using a crystal grown in the absence of guanidine were collected at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The wavelengths for the data collection were determined from an x-ray fluorescence scan. We also prepared platinum derivatives by soaking the crystals with 10 mm K2PtCl4 for 3 days at 4 °C, and a single-wavelength data set was collected at the X-12C beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Mercury-derivative and guanidine-free crystals diffracted to respective resolutions of 2.6 and 2.5 Å, whereas platinum-derivative crystals diffracted to 2.0 Å resolution. Mercury-derivative data were processed and scaled using DENZO/SCALEPACK (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar), and the guanidine-free and the platinum-derivative data were processed with HKL2000 (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Ogata C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 494-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) using two-wavelength data sets of mercury derivative; the peak wavelength was at 1.0051 Å, and the inflection wavelength was at 1.0086 Å. The single mercury site was located, and phase refinement was done by using the programs SOLVE and RESOLVE (34Terwilliger T. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Initial phasing and model building was done with mercury-derivative data, and platinum-derivative data were used for subsequent refinement. Model building was done using the program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and refined with XPLOR (37Brunger A.T.

The mercury was bound to Cys61 of Mor, and platinum was bound to His63 and Met116 of Mor. The guanidine-free structure was refined to an Rfree of 0.311 and Rwork of 0.289 in the resolution range of 30–2.5 Å. Although these two heavy atoms were bound to different sites in the protein, conformational differences of the two derivative structures to the guanidine-free native structure were limited to the side chains of heavy atom-bound residues. This finding demonstrates that the two derivative structures basically are the same conformation as the guanidine-free native structure. The highest resolution platinum-derivative structure was used for structural interpretation. The refinement statistics of the platinum-derivative structure are summarized in Table I. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Hydrophobic Core—The construction of the plasmids and bacterial strains used here were described elsewhere (25Artsimovitch I. Howe M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Artsimovitch I. Activation of Middle Transcription of the Phage Mu. The University of Tennessee, Memphis1996Google Scholar). Plasmid pIA69, containing the mor gene with a histidine tag and silent restriction sites, was used as template for the PCR-based mutagenesis and cloning. Each mutagenic primer was designed to introduce multiple mutations at one position and synthesized using an equimolar mixture of desired nucleotides at the targeted position. The two strands were mutagenized in separate PCRs and then used as templates for overlapping PCR. The resulting mutagenized cassette was cloned into pIA69 between the PstI and HindIII sites. The ligation mixture was transformed into strain MH13435 (mcrA Δpro-lac thi gyrA96 endA1 hsdR17 relA1 supE44 recA/F′ lacIQI ΔlacZY pro+/pIA14), with a Pm-lacZ fusion reporter plasmid, pIA14 (25Artsimovitch I. Howe M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and plated on LB plates with Ap and Cm. The resulting colonies were screened on MacConkey lactose agar indicator plates with Ap, Cm, and different concentrations of IPTG (0, 10, 50, 100, and 300 μm). Candidate mutant plasmids were chosen based on the plate phenotypes, and the mutations were identified by automated DNA sequencing. Mutant plasmids were transformed into MH13355 (mcrA Δpro-lac thi gyrA96 endA1 hsdR17 relA1 supE44 recA λDE3/F′ lacIQI ΔlacZY pro+); the λDE3 encodes T7 RNA polymerase for protein overproduction and purification (39Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Crude Extract Preparation—Overnight cultures (2 ml) of MH13355 derivatives containing the mutant (and wild-type control) plasmids were transferred to 100 ml of LB containing Cm. The cells were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.4–0.6 and then induced with 1 mm IPTG for 60 min. After the cells were harvested by centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of buffer M containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and lysed by sonication. The sonicated preparation was subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of buffer M. Samples of the supernatant (24 μl) and pellet (24 μl) were mixed with 6 μlof5× loading dye, boiled, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (40Margolin W. Howe M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1424-1429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) stained with Coomassie Blue (41Wilson C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay (42Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). In Vivo Transactivation Assay—Cells were grown overnight in 2 ml of M9CA medium containing Cm and Ap. A 50-μl sample of the overnight culture was inoculated into 10 ml of M9CA medium with the same antibiotics and grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.4–0.6. A 2-ml sample was removed to serve as an uninduced control, and the remaining culture was induced with 2 mm IPTG for 60 min. Based on the plate phenotype of individual mutants, dilutions of the cells were made using M9CA medium, and the cells were permeabilized by mixing with 10 μl of chloroform and 18.5 μl of 0.1% SDS in a total volume of 100 μl. After incubation for 20 min on ice, 0.5 ml of o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside (0.833 mg/ml) in buffer Z (43Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 28 °C for 20 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 250 μl of 1 m Na2CO3, and spectrophotometer readings were taken at 420 nm for the reaction and 600 nm for the cell density. The β-galactosidase activities were calculated according to Miller's formula (43Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) and normalized relative to that of a wild-type culture assayed in parallel and set to 1000 Miller units. The crystal structure of His-Mor was solved by the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using mercury-derivative crystals, and the refinement was done with the high resolution platinum-derivative data set. The final structure was refined to 2.2 Å resolution with an Rwork value of 26.4% and Rfree value of 24.8%. The asymmetric unit has one molecule. As expected, His-Mor forms a dimer, and the two subunits are related to each other by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis. For the purpose of this discussion, the amino acid residues will be numbered according to their positions in the native protein. Out of the total 129 amino acids in native Mor, 26 residues"
https://openalex.org/W1998396817,"Antibodies provide an excellent system to study the folding and assembly of all β-sheet proteins and to elucidate the hierarchy of intra/inter chain disulfide bonds formation during the folding process of multimeric and multidomain proteins. Here, the folding process of the Fc fragment of the heavy chain of the antibody MAK33 was investigated. The Fc fragment consists of the CH3 and CH2 domains of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, both containing a single S-S bond. The folding process was investigated both in the absence and presence of the folding catalyst protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), monitoring the evolution of intermediates by electrospray mass spectrometry. Moreover, the disulfide bonds present at different times in the folding mixture were identified by mass mapping to determine the hierarchy of disulfide bond formation. The analysis of the uncatalyzed folding showed that the species containing one intramolecular disulfide predominated throughout the entire process, whereas the fully oxidized Fc fragment never accumulated in significant amounts. This result suggests the presence of a kinetic trap during the Fc folding, preventing the one-disulfide-containing species (1S2H) to reach the fully oxidized protein (2S). The assignment of disulfide bonds revealed that 1S2H is a homogeneous species characterized by the presence of a single disulfide bond (Cys-130–Cys-188) belonging to the CH3 domain. When the folding experiments were carried out in the presence of PDI, the completely oxidized species accumulated and predominated at later stages of the process. This species contained the two native S-S bonds of the Fc protein. Our results indicate that the two domains of the Fc fragment fold independently, with a precise hierarchy of disulfide formation in which the disulfide bond, especially, of the CH2 domain requires catalysis by PDI.

Protein folding of disulfide-containing proteins has been studied essentially using small monomeric, one-domain proteins as a model (1Navon A. Ittah V. Scheraga H.A. Haas E.

The analysis of the folding process of multimeric or multidomains proteins containing intra- and interchain disulfide bonds is hampered by several factors including the presence of an increasing number of folding intermediates and the superimposition of different folding events. Antibodies are multimeric proteins consisting of different domains characterized by two antiparallel β-sheets linked by an intradomain disulfide bond (8Huber R. Deisenhofer J. Colman P.M. Matsushima M. Palm W. Nature. 1976; 264: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 9Deisenhofer J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3287-3294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of antibodies is that the intradomain disulfide bond, which connects residues far apart in sequence, is completely buried in the core of the protein. These proteins provide an excellent system to study the folding and assembly of all β-sheet proteins and to elucidate the hierarchy of intra/interchain disulfide bond formation during the folding process of multimeric and multidomain proteins (11Goto Y.

Biol. 1999; 293: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The β-sheet folding is usually much slower than the α-helix formation because amino acid residues, which are far apart in the polypeptide chain, must interact correctly in the three-dimensional space to form stabilizing interactions (16Clark P.L. Liu Z.P. Gierasch L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies on oxidative folding of immunoglobulins were previously carried out on antibody fragments and single antibody domains (11Goto Y. Hamaguchi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1433-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Goto Y. Hamaguchi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 911-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Lilie H. Mc Laughlin S.

Among these, the simplest model system is the non-covalent homodimer formed by the C-terminal domain CH3, containing a single intramolecular disulfide bond. The influence of this disulfide on the structure and stability of CH3 has been described (18Thies M.J.W. Talamo F. Mayer M. Bell S. Ruoppolo M. Marino G. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has been shown that structure formation is required to bring the cysteines into proximity to form the disulfide bond and to shield it from the solvent. Conversely, some degree of structural flexibility is required for redox shuffling and rearrangements (18Thies M.J.W. Talamo F. Mayer M. Bell S. Ruoppolo M. Marino G. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In vivo, native disulfide bond formation can occur via multiple parallel pathways, and there is evidence that a large number of different gene families and redox carriers may play a role in supplying redox equivalents for protein disulfide bond formation (19Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 20Sevier C.S. Cuozzo J.W. Vala A. Aslund F. Kaiser C.A. Nat.

The rate-limiting steps for native disulfide bond formation in proteins like antibodies, which contain multiple disulfides, are late-stage isomerization reactions, where disulfide bond formation is linked to conformational changes in protein substrates. These steps are catalyzed by proteins belonging to the protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) 1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; ESIMS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; MALDIMS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; ESIMS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; MALDIMS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. family, which accelerate formation and reshuffling of disulfide bonds until the native structure is resistant to further rearrangements (22Freedman R.B. Hawkins H.C. Mc Laughlin S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 387-406Google Scholar). It had been shown that in vitro PDI promotes the correct disulfide bond formation in a Fab fragment. Interestingly, the accessibility of the cysteine residues during the folding process seems to be of crucial importance for the efficiency of PDI (13Lilie H. Mc Laughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endoplasmic reticulum-specific chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) acts synergistically with PDI in assisting the folding of the denatured and reduced Fab fragment (23Mayer M. Kies U. Kammermier R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29421-29425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). BiP binds the unfolded immunoglobulin chains and keeps them in a conformation in which cysteine residues are accessible to PDI. Here the folding process of the recombinantly produced Fc fragment of the heavy chain of the murine monoclonal antibody MAK33 directed against the muscle-specific isoform of human creatine kinase was investigated in the absence and in the presence of PDI. The Fc fragment consists of the CH3 and CH2 domains of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, both containing a single S-S bond. The evolution and the relative abundance of intermediates in the folding of the Fc fragment were monitored by electrospray mass spectrometry. The specific disulfide bonds present in the folding mixture at different times were assessed by mass mapping to determine the pathway of disulfide bonds formation in the presence or absence of PDI. The results obtained indicate a precise hierarchy in the formation of disulfide bonds during the folding process and underline the key role exerted by PDI in the folding mechanism of the Fc fragment. Reduced dithiothreitol, EDTA, reduced glutathione, and oxidized glutathione were obtained from Sigma; Tris and iodoacetamide were purchased from Fluka. Endoproteinase Asp-N was acquired from Roche Applied Science. Guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) and cyanogen bromide were from Pierce. All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available. PDI was purified as described (23Mayer M. Kies U. Kammermier R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29421-29425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Fc Fragment—The Fc fragment of MAK33 was cloned into a pQE-based expression vector by standard techniques. For expression, the Escherichia coli strain HB 101 (24Bolivar F. Backman K. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 68: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) containing the repressor plasmid pUBS520 (25Garcia G.M. Mar P.K. Mullin D.A. Walker J.R. Prather N.E. Cell. 1986; 45: 453-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was transformed with the plasmid. The strain was grown in SB ampicillin/kanamycin medium at 37 °C and induced with 1.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A595 of 0.8–1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 20 h later and resuspended in 100 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7, at 4 °C (5 ml/g of wet cells). After lysis in a BasicZ cell disruptor (Constant Systems, Warwick, UK), the soluble fraction was separated from the insoluble fraction by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The Fc fragment was found in the insoluble fraction as inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies were further purified according to standard procedures (Rudolph et al. (26Rudolph R. Böhm G. Lilie H. Jaenicke R. Creighton T.E. Protein Function, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 57-99Google Scholar)). The yield of inclusion bodies was 17% of the wet cell mass. The inclusion body protein was solubilized in 100 mm Tris/HCl, 6 m GdmCl, 100 mm dithioerythritol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, for 2 h at 25 °C. Then the pH value was shifted to pH 2–3, and the solution was centrifuged at 48,000 × g and dialyzed overnight against 4 m GdmCl, pH 2, at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined as described (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Starting from established procedures for antibody refolding (17Buchner J. Rudolph R. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 28Buchner J. Pastan I. Brinkmann U. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), refolding and disulfide bond formation of Fc were optimized. In the final protocol, 4 times 80 μg/ml denatured and reduced Fc were added to the refolding buffer, consisting of 100 mm Tris/HCl, 0.5 m l-arginine, 1 mm GSSG, 1 mm GSH, pH 7.5, at 10 °C. The time between the additions was 2 h. After 150 h, 1.5 m ammonium sulfate was added to the renaturation solution followed by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded on a butyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 100 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1.5 m ammonium sulfate, pH 7. Elution was achieved with a linear gradient from 1.5 to 0 m ammonium sulfate. The Fc-containing fractions were determined by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and applied to a Sephadex 75-pg gel filtration column (Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated with 100 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7. Fc-containing fractions were dialyzed again 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and frozen in aliquots. The purity was confirmed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE. Fc concentrations were determined photometrically ( A1%1cm280nm=1.33). The Fc fragment preparation was further purified by reverse phase HPLC using a Phenomenex C4 column (5 μm, 1 × 25 cm). The elution system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile/2-propanol (2:1 v:v) (solvent B) with a linear gradient of solvent B from 35 to 95% at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The elution was monitored at 220 nm. The intact Fc fragment was recovered and lyophilized. The lyophilized protein was then analyzed by ESIMS. Spectroscopic Characterization of Fc—For spectroscopic characterization samples were dialyzed against 50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl. For denaturation of the oxidized Fc fragment, samples were incubated for 12 h at 20 °C in 50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 6 m GdmCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The intrinsic fluorescence of the Fc fragment was measured in a Fluoromax-2 (Spex, Edison-NJ) fluorimeter at 20 °C. Emission spectra were recorded in the range of 290–440 nm with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and a scanning rate of 5 nm. The spectral bandwidths were 3 nm for excitation and 8 nm for emission. Far UV-circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 20 °C in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Grossumstadt, Germany) with a PTC 343 Peltier unit using a quartz cell with a path length of 1 mm. The spectra were scanned at 20 nm/min over a wavelength range of 195–260 nm. Spectra were corrected for contributions from the buffer. Analytical Gel Filtration—Analysis of folded Fc fragment by size exclusion chromatography HPLC was performed on a PU-1580 system (Jasco) a using Superdex 75 HR column (Amersham Biosciences). The buffer used was 40 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.5. Protein fluorescence was detected using a FP 1520-S fluorescence detector (Jasco) with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and emission at 327 nm. The flow rate was 0.5 ml·min-1. The standard protein used were ribonuclease A, chymotrypsinogen A, ovalbumin, and albumin (Amersham Biosciences). Folding Reactions—Lyophilized Fc fragment was dissolved in water, and the protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) using Fab fragment as the standard. The Fc fragment was reduced and denatured in 4 m GdmCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm dithiothreitol at a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml for 90 min at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. Folding was initiated by diluting the denatured protein 100-fold with vigorous stirring for 10 s into the buffer preincubated at 4 °C containing 1 m l-arginine, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 6 mm GSSG. The final concentration of Fc fragment during folding was, therefore, 50 μg/ml (2.1 μm). The reaction was carried out at 4 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. When the folding was carried out in the presence of PDI, the enzyme was preincubated in the folding buffer containing 1 m l-arginine, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 6 mm GSSG for 10 min at 4 °C. The final PDI concentration in the folding experiment was 0.4 μm. Alkylation of Folding Aliquots—Aliquots of the folding mixture, sampled at appropriate intervals, were alkylated as described (18Thies M.J.W. Talamo F. Mayer M. Bell S. Ruoppolo M. Marino G. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Iodoacetamide was freshly dissolved in 1 m Tris HCl, pH 6.5, containing 10 mm EDTA. During the preparation of the reagents, the solution was protected from light to minimize photolytic production of iodine, a potent oxidizing agent for thiols. The sample was added to an equal volume of a 1 m iodoacetamide solution. Alkylation was performed for 10 s in the dark at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. After 10 s 100 μl of 20% trifluoroacetic acid were added, and the samples were desalted by reverse phase HPLC using a Vydac C4 column (5 μm, 0.46 × 25 cm). The solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile/2-propanol (2:1 v:v) (solvent B). Folding intermediates were eluted with a linear gradient of solvent B from 20 to 95% at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluted proteins were monitored at 220 nm, recovered, directly analyzed by ESIMS, and then lyophilized for subsequent analyses. Identification of Disulfide Bonds in the Folding Intermediates—Carboxyamidomethylated folding intermediates were hydrolyzed with cyanogen bromide and then proteolytically digested with endoproteinase Asp-N. Cyanogen bromide hydrolysis was carried out in 200 μl of 70% trifluoroacetic acid using a 10-fold molar excess of reagent on methionine residues for 18 h at room temperature in the dark. The cyanogen bromide reaction was stopped by adding 10 volumes of cold water and lyophilizing the sample. An aliquot was analyzed by MALDIMS. The rest of the sample was resuspended in water and lyophilized several times. Digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N was then performed on the mixture of peptides obtained from the cyanogen bromide. Asp-N hydrolysis was carried out in 0.8% ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, using 10% acetonitrile as the activator at 37 °C for 18 h with an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 (w:w). Electrospray Mass Analyses—Protein samples were analyzed by ESIMS using a Bio-Q triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source (Micromass, Manchester, UK) or by atmospheric pressure ionization-100 PerkinElmer Life Sciences single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure ionization source (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The samples, desalted by reverse phase HPLC as described, were directly injected into the ion source using a Harvard syringe system at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Data were acquired at 10 s/scan and processed by Mass Lynx software for Bio-Q and BioMultiView1 for atmospheric pressure ionization-100, provided by the manufacturers. Mass scale calibration was performed by means of multiply charged ions from a separate injection of horse heart myoglobin (average molecular mass, 16951.5 Da). Each folding data set represents the mean of three independent folding experiments. The differences between folding experiments performed completely independent of each other were about ±5%. MALDIMS Analyses—Peptide mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. MALDIMS analyses were carried out using a Voyager DE mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystem, Boston, MA). The mass range was calibrated using bovine insulin (average molecular mass 5734.6 Da) and a matrix peak (379.1 Da) as the internal standards. Samples were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 10 pmol/μl; a 1-μl aliquot was applied to a sample slide and allowed to air dry before applying 1 μl of a solution of α-ciano-4-hydroxycinammic acid 10 mg/ml in ethanol, acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid 1:1:1 (v:v:v). The matrix was air-dried before collecting spectra. Mass spectra were generated from the sum of 50 laser shots. Characterization of the Fc Fragment—The Fc fragment of MAK33 was expressed in insoluble form in the cytoplasm of E. coli. The protein was refolded and purified to homogeneity. Analytical gel filtration in combination with SDS-PAGE showed that the Fc fragment is a noncovalent dimer with an apparent mass of 44 kDa. The Fc fragment was characterized by far UV-circular dichroism spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1A, the protein exhibits a spectrum typical for an immunoglobulin domain. The low negative elipticity of -2500 to -3000 Φ with minima at 218 and 229 nm suggest that the protein is β-structured. The minimum at 229 nm may result from the contribution of aromatic amino acids to the CD signal as previously observed for the isolated CH3 domain (18Thies M.J.W. Talamo F. Mayer M. Bell S. Ruoppolo M. Marino G. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As expected, the denatured and reduced protein did not exhibit a CD spectrum with specific minima. The fluorescence spectra of the denatured and reduced Fc fragment show that the fluorescence is quenched in the native state (Fig. 1B). This is a typical feature of antibody domains that results from the positioning of a conserved Trp residue next to the disulfide bond. The shift of the wavelength of maximum fluorescence from 343 to 354 nm upon unfolding and reduction shows that the buried Trp becomes solvent-exposed. Taken together, the spectroscopic data show that Fc is natively folded and oxidized. The recombinant Fc fragment was further purified by reverse phase HPLC just before folding experiments. The HPLC peak corresponding to the Fc fragment was tested by ESIMS. The analysis revealed the presence of a single component exhibiting a molecular mass of 23885.2 ± 2.3 Da, in agreement with the expected value, calculated on the basis of its amino acid sequence (23885.0 Da). The purified samples were then used in the folding experiments. Oxidative Folding of the Fc Fragment—Folding of the Fc fragment from the fully denatured and reduced protein to the native state was carried out at a protein concentration of 50 μg/ml in the presence of a low concentration of guanidinium chloride (40 mm) and 1 m l-arginine, a “labilizing” agent that preferentially destabilizes incorrectly folded or aggregationprone species (28Buchner J. Pastan I. Brinkmann U. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 30Rudolph R. Tschesche H. Modern Methods in Protein and Nucleic Acid Analysis. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1990: 149-171Google Scholar). Aliquots of the folding reactions were withdrawn at different time points, and the intermediates present in solution were trapped by alkylation of the free thiol groups and analyzed by ESIMS to identify the disulfide-bonded species formed. The carboxyamidomethylation reaction used to trap the free SH group increased the molecular mass of the intermediates by a fixed amount, 57 Da for each free SH group, thus allowing the separation by mass of intermediates containing different numbers of disulfide bonds. In addition, ESIMS analysis allowed the determination of the relative abundance of folding intermediates provided that the different components have comparable ionization properties (18Thies M.J.W. Talamo F. Mayer M. Bell S. Ruoppolo M. Marino G. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Ruoppolo M. Moutiez M. Mazzeo M. Pucci P. Menez A. Marino G. Quéméneur E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16060-16068Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the electrospray mass spectrum of the folding mixture after 15 s of incubation in the refolding buffer. Each population of trapped intermediates is characterized by a different number of intramolecular disulfide bonds (indicated as nS), mixed disulfides with the exogenous glutathione (nG), and carboxyamidomethyl groups. The number of carboxyamidomethyl groups corresponds to the number of free thiols present in the folding intermediates and is, therefore, indicated as nH throughout the text. The spectrum revealed the presence of a major component corresponding to the fully reduced species, 4H. A minor protein species carrying a molecule of exogenous glutathione and three free cysteine residues (1G3H) was also detected in the spectrum. The distribution of charged states in electrospray analyses is related to the number and accessibility of ionizable groups on the protein surface (32Chowdhury S.K. Katta V. Chait B.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9012-9013Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 33Loo J.A. Loo R.R. Volseth H.R. Edmonds C.G. Smith R.D. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 62: 693-698Google Scholar, 34Katta V. Chait B.T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 5: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The 4H species showed a distribution of multiple charges with signals centered from 21 to 25 positive charges. The distribution of multiply charged ions displayed by the 1G3H species was similar to that observed for the reduced protein, suggesting a similar open and flexible conformation for this intermediate. The electrospray spectra were acquired at different times of folding reaction and showed the evolution of the intermediates containing different numbers of disulfide bonds. The relative percentage of the different folding intermediates was plotted against time of incubation in Fig. 3A. The reduced species (4H) decreased to a 20% level after 30 min of incubation and slowly disappeared within 5 h. The species containing one intramolecular disulfide and two free cysteines (1S2H) rapidly appeared in the first stages of the reaction and predominated over the whole process. Under these conditions the fully oxidized species (2S) formed only at very low amounts, never reaching levels higher than 15% during the entire folding process. Accordingly, the intermediate containing one S-S bond and one mixed disulfide with glutathione (1S1G1H, the obligatory precursor of the fully oxidized species 2S) was only detected at very low concentrations and remained constant throughout the entire process. Conversely, the 1G3H species formed transiently and rapidly evolved toward the formation of the first intramolecular S-S bond (1S2H). The analysis of the aliquot withdrawn after 24 h of reaction did not show a major change in the relative abundance of intermediates, thus demonstrating that the folding process had reached a steady state after 5 h. Oxidative Folding of the Fc Fragment in the Presence of PDI—To test whether PDI had an influence on the oxidation pathway, the folding of the Fc fragment was carried out in the presence of the catalyst. Fig. 2B shows the electrospray mass spectrum of the intermediates mixture after 24 h of incubation in the presence of PDI. The signals of the fully oxidized species dominated the spectrum, whereas the one disulfide-containing intermediate (1S2H) was detected as a minor component. The 2S species showed a distribution of multiply charged signals ranging from 14 to 19 positive charges. This distribution is quite different from that observed for both the 4H and 1G3H species (see Fig. 2"

Group II chaperonins are found in archaea and the cytoplasm of eukarya and are believed to function like other chaperonins as part of a protein folding system. We report here that human erythrocytes contain the group II chaperonin T-complex polypeptide 1 (TCP-1) and that this complex translocates from the cytoplasm to the cytoskeleton in response to heat treatment in the absence of overt cell damage. Identification as TCP-1 was determined by immunodetection for TCP-1α and corroborated by mass spectroscopy peptide sequencing. Direct visualization by immunofluorescence confirmed peripherally localized TCP-1 in response to heat treatment. Temperatures ranging from 37–50 °C were demonstrated to have distinct kinetic profiles of induced translocation. Heat-induced binding was shown by Triton shell analysis to be specifically associated with the cytoskeletal proteins. Furthermore, the binding was reversible following removal of the stimulatory condition. A stabilizing process is hypothesized based on the known interactions of chaperonins.

Furthermore, the binding was reversible following removal of the stimulatory condition. A stabilizing process is hypothesized based on the known interactions of chaperonins. Most cell types have been shown to have a specific and reproducible response to hyperthermic conditions. Elevated temperature-induced chromosomal puffs were the first observed heat shock responses (1Ritossa F.A. Experientia. 1962; 18: 571-573Crossref Scopus (1511) Google Scholar) and were later determined to represent transcriptional activation of a select group of proteins (2Tissières A. Mitchell H.K. Tracy U.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 84: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Proteins that are characterized by increased production in response to elevated temperatures became known as heat shock proteins (HSPs). 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; 5P8, 5 mm phosphate, pH 8.0; TCP-1, T-complex polypeptide 1. Subsequent research has shown that these proteins may be regulated by many factors, including environmental stress (heat shock, heavy metals, chemicals), pathophysiologic states (fever, inflammation, ischemia), and certain non-stress conditions (growth, differentiation) (3Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of evidence that the major HSPs interact with other proteins, they have been classified as molecular chaperones (4Ellis R.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-Biol. Sci. 1993; 339: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 6Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar). The HSP-60 family, commonly known as chaperonins to reflect their central role in the process of protein folding (6Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar, 7Ellis R.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R137-R139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), are double ring structures composed of multiple 60-kDa subunits and are subdivided into two groups based on sequence and structural information (8Horwich A.L. Willison K.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-Biol. Sci. 1993; 339: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Group I chaperonins are formed as double rings of identical or closely related protein subunits with seven subunits per ring and include HSP-60 from bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Group II chaperonins are formed as double rings of identical or slightly different, but homologous, protein subunits with eight or nine subunits per ring depending on the species. This group of chaperonins includes thermosomes and rosettasomes in archaea and TCP-1 in eukarya. Previous reports demonstrate that in archaea group II chaperonins are composed of heat shock proteins (9Kagawa H.K. Yaoi T. Brocchieri L. McMillan R.A. Alton T. Trent J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas the eukaryotic TCP-1 is composed of 60-kDa proteins that are not heat stress-inducible (10Ursic D. Culbertson M.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 392Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Both archaeal and eukaryal group II chaperonins are isolated from cells as double ring structures, although it has been observed that at least archaeal chaperonins spontaneously assemble into filaments (11Schoehn G. Hayes M. Cliff M. Clarke A.R. Saibil H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which has led to the suggestion that they may play a structural role in vivo (12Trent J.D. Kagawa H.K. Yaoi T. Olle E. Zaluzec N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 5383-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, other functions have been suggested for group II chaperonins, including RNA (13Ruggero D. Ciammaruconi A. Londei P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3471-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and membrane stabilization (14Trent J.D. Kagawa H.K. Yaoi T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has been studying novel stabilization mechanisms for erythrocyte storage and recently reported a process for enhanced stability and recovery of cells following cryopreservation (15Wagner C.T. Martowicz M.L. Livesey S.A. Connor J. Cryobiology. 2002; 45: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We began investigating temperature-induced changes to erythrocyte protein and membrane organization as a consequence of those studies. Mammalian erythrocytes serve as an ideal model system to investigate mechanisms of membrane/cytoskeleton stability and inducible changes therein because mature erythrocytes lack a nucleus and do not synthesize new proteins. Thermotolerance studies of erythrocytes have previously been reported with mixed results. Studies in mammalian erythrocyte systems have shown little or no inducible thermotolerance as detected by osmotic fragility and leakage/hemolysis indices (16Ho K.C. Lin P.S. Radiat. Res. 1991; 125: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17Koter M. Łaski J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1989; 56: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18Joźwiak Z. Pałecz D. Leyko W. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1991; 59: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The degree to which hemolysis occurs as a function of incubation temperature and time is also not firmly established (17Koter M. Łaski J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1989; 56: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Gershfeld N.L. Murayama M. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 101: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Van der Walt J.H. Russell W.J. Br. J. Anaesth. 1978; 50: 815-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Changes in cytoskeletal proteins, principally spectrin extractability and dimer/tetramer ratio, have been reported following incubation (21Gudi S.R. Kumar A. Bhakuni V. Gokhale S.M. Gupta C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Kumar A. Gudi S.R. Gokhale S.M. Bhakuni V. Gupta C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Although functional thermotolerance remains to be firmly established, small quantities of new proteins, presumably of cytoplasmic origin, have been observed in membrane preparations following heating (21Gudi S.R. Kumar A. Bhakuni V. Gokhale S.M. Gupta C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Kumar A. Gudi S.R. Gokhale S.M. Bhakuni V. Gupta C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), including HSP-70 (24Gudi T. Gupta C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21344-21350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to HSP-70, HSP-90 has been identified in mammalian erythrocytes (25Gromov P.S. Celis J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), although their functional roles are not known. These changes may help account for reported alterations in biorheological properties following heat treatment (23Mohandas N. Greenquist A.C. Shohet S.B. Brewer G.J. The Red Cell. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1978: 453-472Google Scholar). We report here that human erythrocytes contain TCP-1 and that this cytoplasmic protein complex translocates to the membrane following heat treatment. This heat-induced membrane interaction is consistent with recent findings that that the archaeal group II chaperonins in Sulfolobus shibatae are also membrane-associated (26Trent J.D. Kagawa H.K. Paavola C. McMillan R.A. Howard J. Jahnke L. Lavine C. Embaye T. Henze C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2003; 100: 15589-15594Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that a membrane-related function for group II chaperonins is widely distributed and evolutionarily conserved. Erythrocyte Handling—Packed erythrocyte units were purchased (Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, Houston, TX) following standard quality control testing. The units were maintained at 4 °C at all times and used within 10 days following donation. In some experiments, erythrocytes were prepared by standard centrifugation procedures (27Brecher M.E. Technical Manual. 14th Ed. American Association of Blood Banks, Bethesda, MD2002: 733-750Google Scholar) from whole blood freshly drawn into acid citrate dextrose anticoagulant following donor consent. All freshly prepared erythrocytes were used within 6 h. Prior to experimental work, the erythrocytes were washed with a buffer solution (50Kregel K.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar mm sodium chloride, 110 mm glucose, 10 mm glutamine, 55 mm mannitol, 2 mm adenine, pH 6.1, 280 mosm) (described in Ref. 28Greenwalt T.J. Rugg N. Dumaswala U.J. Transfusion. 1997; 37: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and adjusted to a working hematocrit of 30%. Heat treatment was performed in a water bath at temperatures from 37–50 °C. Small volumes (less than 5 ml) in polypropylene tubes were used to ensure rapid and uniform temperature changes within the erythrocyte sample. Hemolysis Determination—Cell suspensions were analyzed for erythrocyte number, hematocrit, and total hemoglobin using a Biochem Immunosystems 1099+ hematology analyzer. Free hemoglobin concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using a quantification kit (Sigma) on a cell-free sample isolated by centrifugation. Hemolysis was determined as the ratio of free hemoglobin to total hemoglobin normalized by hematocrit, as described elsewhere (29Wagner C.T. Burnett M.B. Livesey S.A. Connor J. Cryobiology. 2000; 41: 178-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Erythrocyte Protein Preparation—Membrane/cytoskeletal and cytoplasmic proteins were prepared by the formation and isolation of erythrocyte ghosts. Ghosts were formed by hypotonically lysing 1 ml of erythrocyte sample in 30 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffer (5P8; 5 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 μg/ml phenylmethane-sulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0). Following centrifugation at 30,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant (30 ml), containing cytoplasmic proteins, was recovered and saved; the pellet, containing erythrocyte ghosts, was washed three times with fresh ice-cold 5P8 until it was free of hemoglobin. The volume of the ghost sample was adjusted to 1 ml with 5P8. These ghosts were also used to prepare “Triton shells” in some experiments by incubating for 30 min at 4 °C in 20 volumes of Triton buffer (625 mm NaCl, 6.25 mm sodium phosphate, 0.625 mm EGTA, 0.625 dithiothreitol, and 2% Triton X-100), centrifuging as above, washing in ice-cold 5P8 to remove residual Triton buffer, and resuspending in fresh, ice-cold 5P8. 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added to ghost and Triton shell samples, and total protein was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein quantification kit (Pierce). Total protein in the cytoplasmic fraction was not quantified because of the high concentration of hemoglobin. Alternatively, a ratio method was used to determine the appropriate volume for analysis and is described in detail below. Electrophoretic Protein Separation—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using an 11.5% resolving gel. Typically, a membrane aliquot containing 30 μg of membrane protein was loaded per lane. However, analysis of the cytoplasmic fraction was complicated by both the high concentration of hemoglobin and the large volume generated during hypotonic lysis. To allow for quantitative comparative analysis, the volume of the membrane protein aliquot was used to calculate the volume of a cytoplasmic protein aliquot representing one-fourth the number of cells using a volumetric ratio method as shown in Equation 1. cytoplasmic aliquot volume =(membrane aliquot volume1 ml)(30 ml)(0.25)(Eq. 1) The cytoplasmic aliquot was dried for 5 h in a Savant SC110A SpeedVac concentrator at ambient temperature, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in standard gel loading buffer. These membrane and cytoplasmic protein samples represent known numbers of cells and were analyzed side-by-side by SDS-PAGE. The resulting gel was either stained with Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad) or blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. The one-fourth cell number value was used after initial attempts to analyze equivalent cell number aliquots failed due to excessive protein in the cytoplasmic samples fouling the gel. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins of interest were detected by indirect enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Blots containing samples of cytoplasmic proteins were washed with 3% hydrogen peroxide to oxidize hemoglobin prior to primary antibody incubation, thereby preventing a nonspecific luminol reaction during ECL detection. Primary antibodies against human TCP-1α, TCP-1β, and HSP-60 (Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada) were used at 1:3,000 dilution. Species-appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) were used at dilutions between 1:50,000 and 1:80,000. ECL signals were detected on Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences), which were than analyzed by densitometry using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Immunofluorescence Analysis—100 μl of the erythrocyte suspension was mixed with 1 ml of isotonic 2.5% low melting point agarose, poured onto parafilm, and allowed to solidify. A small piece of the solid agarose was wrapped in histology processing paper, placed in a processing cassette, and dehydrated by serial incubation in 70, 80, 95, and 100% (twice) ethanol for 30 min each. The dehydrated sample was cleared twice in chloroform for 40 min each, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (∼4-μm thick), placed on a glass slide, deparaffinized with chloroform for 20 s, and rinsed in deionized water. Slides were blocked with 5% rabbit serum (host species of secondary antibody), incubated with a 1:500 dilution of primary anti-TCP-1α for 2 h, and finally with a 1:5,000 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-rat IgG (Sigma) for 2 h. Fluorescent images were digitally captured from a fluorescent microscope. The interaction of TCP-1α with the erythrocyte membrane/cytoskeleton was observed in response to heat treatment. Immunodetection of TCP-1α in the membrane fraction revealed a significant positive response in heat-treated cells that was absent in non-heat-treated controls (Fig. 1). A sample of the treated erythrocytes was evaluated for hemolysis and yielded less than 1% free hemoglobin, indicating that the temperature incubation did not induce hemoglobin leakage or cell lysis. Membrane-bound TCP-1α in response to heat treatment is cytoplasmic in origin. Cytoplasmic protein analysis demonstrated a strong detection in both control and heat-treated erythrocytes using the described modified Western blotting technique (Fig. 1). Adjusting for the one-fourth cell number ratio and normalizing to cytoplasmic control levels, densitometry analysis revealed a significant reduction in detected band intensity following heat treatment to 72.3% for the figure shown and 69.8% ± 10.2% for all analyses. Similar analysis of heat-treated membrane intensity yielded 19.6% for the figure shown and 19.2% ± 4.3% for all analyses. The heat-treated membrane and cytoplasmic intensities additively account for nearly all of the cytoplasmic control intensity, 91.9% in the figure shown and 89.0% ± 6.8% overall. Finally, erythrocytes made into ghosts prior to heat treatment do not demonstrate a positive TCP-1α signal by Western blotting, whereas the same unit of erythrocytes responded to heat treatment as shown in Fig. 1 (not shown). The results above rely on immunodetection for identification of TCP-1α. Definitive identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectroscopy protein sequencing (Protein Chemistry Core Facility, Columbia University, New York, NY) on an immuno-positive spot selected from a two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel (Kendrick Laboratories, Madison, WI). MALDI analysis was performed blind and confirmed identification as TCP-1α. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of membrane-associated proteins from heat-treated erythrocytes was positive for TCP-1β, and the spatial relationship between TCP-1α and -1β on two-dimensional blots corresponded to previously published results (30Kubota H. Willison K. Gething M.-J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein-folding Catalysts. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 207-211Google Scholar) (see supplemental online material for two-dimensional analysis and additional information). Translocation of TCP-1α from the cytoplasm to the membrane of erythrocytes was found to be both temperature- and time-sensitive. Fig. 2 shows cumulative results of this temperature-time profile. Temperatures greater than 45 °C induced a rapid translocation event and achieved maximal levels after 30 min of incubation. Erythrocytes incubated at 37 and 40 °C showed a slower onset of translocation but did yield evidence of translocation within3hof incubation. Despite the difference in rates observed between temperatures, erythrocytes incubated at all temperatures tested eventually displayed a significant level of translocation as compared with background. Free hemoglobin was measured relative to total hemoglobin to assess potential damage. In all cases, the level of free hemoglobin was less that 1%, indicating no hemoglobin leakage or cell lysis during treatment. The results described above establish a heat-induced translocation of TCP-1α from the erythrocyte cytoplasm to the membrane but depend on adequate separation of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins to distinguish between these two protein reservoirs. An immunofluorescent histological technique was used to demonstrate the translocation event without separating the two protein fractions. Fluorescent detection revealed a diffuse pattern of uniform intensity consistent with general cytoplasmic localization in the control erythrocytes (Fig. 3C). Upon heat treatment, the erythrocytes displayed a pattern of fluorescence observed as a defined ring structure associated with the periphery of the cell (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the heat-treated cells retained a significant level of diffuse uniform cytoplasmic signal, which is consistent with the cytoplasmic results shown in Fig. 1. The translocation of TCP-1α to the membrane protein fraction of heat-treated erythrocytes does not reveal the nature of the interaction with the erythrocyte membrane fraction. To determine this interaction, Triton shells, a subcomponent of erythrocyte ghosts that contains primarily the cytoskeletal proteins, were generated from control and heat-treated erythrocyte ghosts. Total protein from intact ghosts and Triton shells was analyzed by Western blot. Representative results of this experimental series, shown in Fig. 4, demonstrate that the translocated TCP-1α is detectable in both the complete ghost membrane (G) and Triton shell (T) proteins. These data indicate that the translocated TCP-1 complex is specifically linked to the erythrocyte cytoskeleton. Although no hemoglobin leakage or gross hemolysis was observed in response to heat treatment, irreversible translocation of TCP-1α would indicate a low level of damage that may precede other forms of erythrocyte damage. A reversibility experiment was performed to test the persistence of TCP-1α translocation. Heat-treated and untreated control samples were transferred to 37 °C, and membrane proteins were isolated from these samples at various time points. Fig. 5 shows that heat-treated erythrocytes have a significant positive TCP-1α signal that declines in intensity to background levels over the 30 h of this experiment. The control cells showed an increase in intensity during the first 6 h of incubation and a decline, although not complete, during the remainder of the experimental time frame. The pattern observed in the control cells is consistent with the translocation kinetics displayed in Fig. 2. Despite the induced translocation at 37 °C (this response will be addressed under “Discussion”), both control and heat-treated erythrocytes exhibited a reversal of TCP-1α translocation. This reversal was not observed when the control and treated cells were transferred to 4 °C rather than 37 °C (not shown). All of the experimentation reported above was performed using erythrocytes processed according to approved blood bank procedures. Heat treatment-induced translocation was tested in freshly prepared erythrocytes to ensure that these procedures do not influence TCP-1α translocation. Fig. 6 shows total membrane protein analysis and Western blot detection of TCP-1α for untreated and heat-treated erythrocytes from three different donors. Despite slight differences in background levels, all three donors exhibited a strong translocation event in response to heat treatment (Fig. 6B). The total protein Coomassie analysis shows that TCP-1α translocation is not the only translocation event. A 31-kDa protein was confirmed as carbonic anhydrase (both I and II isoforms) by Western blot detection (not shown) and has previously been reported to be bound to erythrocyte membranes (15Wagner C.T. Martowicz M.L. Livesey S.A. Connor J. Cryobiology. 2002; 45: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Kifor G. Toon M.R. Janoshazi A. Solomon A.K. J. Membr.

Martowicz M.L. Livesey S.A. Connor J. Cryobiology. 2002; 45: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The band slightly smaller than carbonic anhydrase that is also present in heat-treated erythrocyte membranes was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and identified as flavin reductase. The TCP-1 complex has previously been isolated from reticulocytes, a circulating nucleated precursor of mature erythrocytes (34Norcum M.T. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1366-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but this report represents the first identification of TCP-1 in the cytosol of human erythrocytes. The dearth of information with respect to heat shock proteins and erythrocytes stems from two factors unique to these cells. First, the prevailing view of erythrocytes is one of a circulating cell passively distributing oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other labile gases based solely on mass transport properties and lacking in much of the cellular biochemistry associated with nucleated cells. Secondly, human erythrocytes lack nuclei and other internal organelles and thus have no mechanism for de novo protein synthesis in response to cellular insult. Because the understood mechanism of the heat shock response involves the synthesis of nascent proteins, erythrocytes by definition cannot have a classical heat shock response. The presence of other heat shock proteins in human erythrocytes, including HSP-70 and HSP-90, has been reported (25Gromov P.S. Celis J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); however, the exact function of these proteins has not yet been defined. Results from erythrocytes of non-human species have led to stabilization hypotheses (21Gudi S.R. Kumar A. Bhakuni V. Gokhale S.M. Gupta C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 35Zarić J. Glišin V. Popović Z. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 178: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In particular, an HSP-70-like protein in Rhesus erythrocyte cytoplasm was shown to translocate to the cytoskeleton at 44 °C, whereas a temperature of 50 °C was necessary to induce translocation of this protein in human erythrocytes (21Gudi S.R. Kumar A. Bhakuni V. Gokhale S.M. Gupta C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the high temperature necessary to induce detectable levels of HSP-70 negates any physiologic relevance. Chaperonins are generally believed to be localized to the cytoplasm. TCP-1 is included in the 60-kDa subunit double ring chaperonin family despite a relatively short, albeit growing (reviewed in Ref. 5Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), list of reported protein interactions. There is further evidence that members of both Group I (36Garduno R.A. Faulkner G.

However, the membrane associations of the Group II TCP-1 chaperonin all occur under native, non-stressed conditions, and in mammalian systems the association has only been observed on membranes of internal organelles (40Creutz C.E.

TCP-1 is generally not considered to be a heat shock protein, although one report briefly mentions inducibility in human cultured cells (43Schena M. Shalon D. Heller R. Chai A. Brown P.O. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). We found no previous reports of thermal-induced TCP-1 association with membranes as we have observed for human erythrocytes. Our results with human erythrocytes demonstrate translocation of TCP-1, as detected by TCP-1α, from the cytoplasm to the membrane in response to a range of elevated temperatures. 20–30% of the total TCP-1 reservoir translocates from the cytoplasm to the membrane (Fig. 1). Approximately 90% of the original cytoplasmic TCP-1 is accounted for by performing an additive analysis of the heat-treated membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. The number of manipulations and semiquantitative nature of the experimental methods preclude achieving a 100% additive level. The extremely high protein concentrations associated with the cytoplasmic fraction contributed to the experimental and analytical complications, such as the lane spreading observed in Fig. 1. Despite these issues, the cytoplasmic reservoir of TCP-1 clearly exceeds the amount of translocation. This finding is consistent with the concept of a fast-acting response mechanism, particularly in cells lacking de novo protein synthesis capabilities. The complex primarily associates with the membrane skeleton based on Triton shell analysis. The proteins in the Triton shell include spectrin, actin, and junctional proteins, any of which could be TCP-1 binding sites. Among cytoskeletal proteins, TCP-1 has been shown to interact with and structurally fold actin and tubulin (44Yaffe M.B. Farr G.W. Miklos D. Horwich A.L. Sternlicht M.L. Sternlicht H. Nature. 1992; 358: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 45Sternlicht H. Farr G.W. Sternlicht M.L. Driscoll J.K. Willison K. Yaffe M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nature. 1999; 402: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and mutants in yeast contain cytoskeletal defects characteristic of malfunctioning actin and tubulin (47Stoldt V. Rademacher F. Kehren V. Ernst J.F. Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 523-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because erythrocytes lack tubulin and other microtubule structures but do contain short actin filaments at crucial cytoskeletal junctions that remain with the Triton shell, actin represents a strong candidate protein for the specific interaction. Physiologic relevance is provided through the combination of two specific results. First, the translocation event was observed at temperatures that fall within the physiologically relevant range (Fig. 2). Second, TCP-1 is released from the membrane when returned to physiologic temperatures in an absence of hemolysis (Fig. 5). The data generated at 40 °C, which represents an achievable fever environment, clearly yielded significant translocation of TCP-1 to the cytoskeleton. The kinetic profile of translocation for heat incubation was also performed at 42 °C. The profile of this temperature was extremely donor-dependent and seemed to fall into a transitional zone between slow (temperatures <42 °C) and rapid (temperatures >42 °C) translocation. This profile was not included in Fig. 2 because of the variability. The ability of cells to achieve thermotolerance, stability at lethal temperatures as a result of prior conditioning at an elevated sub-lethal temperature, correlates well with production of HSPs (48Watson K. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1990; 31: 183-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 49Sanders B.M. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1993; 23: 49-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Despite studies supporting the participation of HSPs in acquired thermotolerance (50Kregel K.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 51Chow K.C.

Science. 1988; 242: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), the exact set of HSPs necessary remains elusive (56Petko L. Lindquist S. Cell. 1986; 45: 885-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 57VanBogelen R.A. Acton M.A. Neidhardt F.C.

The ability of erythrocytes to achieve thermotolerance has yet to be firmly established in published literature. Classic indices of erythrocyte damage generally indicate a loss of functional capabilities in conjunction with any detectable heat-induced protein changes. Koter and Laski (17Koter M. Łaski J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1989; 56: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) demonstrated a level of thermotolerance following preconditioning at 44 °C. However, the thermotolerant cells were significantly damaged compared with non-treated controls with respect to osmotic fragility and hemolysis. Key biorheological properties are also diminished following heating of erythrocytes (23Mohandas N. Greenquist A.C. Shohet S.B. Brewer G.J. The Red Cell. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1978: 453-472Google Scholar, 61Koter M. Cell Biol. Int. 1993; 17: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These biorheological changes may be due to alterations in the cytoskeletal structure, which is demonstrated by decreased spectrin-actin extraction and an increased spectrin dimer-to-tetramer ratio following heat treatment (21Gudi S.R. Kumar A. Bhakuni V. Gokhale S.M. Gupta C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Kumar A. Gudi S.R. Gokhale S.M. Bhakuni V. Gupta C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The majority of these studies were performed at temperatures greater than 42 °C and, therefore, may not represent physiologically relevant events. The work presented here is primarily based on erythrocytes derived from blood banking procedures where the packed cells are stored at 4 °C according to approved methods for transfusion medicine. An analysis of freshly isolated erythrocytes, cells that were never exposed to temperatures less than 37 °C prior to experimentation, exhibited the same translocation event in response to heat treatment. This result in part validates the use of blood bank erythrocytes but does not establish that the blood banking process of storing erythrocytes at 4 °C is non-damaging. In fact, the observed response of blood bank cells to incubation at 37 °C indicates some alteration in the nature of the cells (Fig. 5B). Because the freshly isolated erythrocytes were maintained at 37 °C for the entire duration of the experiment, the resulting control samples, those that never were exposed to higher temperatures, provide insight into basal levels of TCP-1 binding. Despite some degree of donor variability, these control erythrocyte ghost membranes demonstrated that the natural level of bound TCP-1 is extremely low. Thus, the 37 °C results with blood bank erythrocytes showing an induced translocation and reversal are consistent with some level of prior alteration, possibly caused by the initial transfer and storage at 4 °C that has recently been shown to induce a similar TCP-1 translocation (62Wagner C.T. Lu I.Y. Trent J.D. Connor J. Transfusion. 2003; 43: 66A-67ACrossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed heat-induced translocation of unknown low molecular weight proteins (21Gudi S.R. Kumar A. Bhakuni V. Gokhale S.M. Gupta C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Kumar A. Gudi S.R. Gokhale S.M. Bhakuni V. Gupta C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that, based on the identification here and previously (15Wagner C.T. Martowicz M.L. Livesey S.A. Connor J. Cryobiology. 2002; 45: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), are now known to be carbonic anhydrase and flavin reductase. These enzymes are components of the erythrocyte catabolic machinery catalyzing the hydration of carbon dioxide (carbonic anhydrase) and the reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin in the heme degradation pathway (flavin reductase). The critical functions of these enzymes in toxic waste management may provide insight to their membrane-bound role in response to thermal stress. However, whether translocation of these enzymes or TCP-1 interaction with the erythrocyte cytoskeleton confers a level thermotolerance at physiologically relevant temperatures remain important questions for investigation. The translocation of TCP-1 to the human erythrocyte cytoskeleton is similar to observations in the archaeal organism S. shibatae. This extreme thermophile produces abundant 60-kDa HSPs in response to heat shock that form a rosettasome structure homologous to TCP-1. The newly synthesized protein localizes preferentially to the membrane where it exhibits a protective role in cell stabilization (26Trent J.D. Kagawa H.K. Paavola C. McMillan R.A. Howard J. Jahnke L. Lavine C. Embaye T. Henze C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2003; 100: 15589-15594Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The degree of sequence and structural similarity between the archaeal rosettasome and mammalian TCP-1 leads one to consider an evolutionarily conserved stabilizing mechanism in response to cellular insult. The results presented in this study demonstrate a heat-induced translocation event of the cytosolic-based TCP-1 complex to the cytoskeleton in human erythrocytes. Previously, TCP-1 was not considered to be a heat shock protein, based on genetic analysis. However, the results presented here with respect to the heat-induced response should qualify TCP-1 as a heat shock protein. This response was observed to occur at temperatures within physiologically relevant ranges and to be reversible following recovery at 37 °C. Although a functional consequence of translocation is not yet known, these results are consistent with a stabilizing mechanism during the period of stress. Because of the relative simplicity of the erythrocyte compared with nucleated cells, this heat-induced translocation may serve as a model to investigate novel TCP-1 functions.

Others argue that they form in the same manner as stars, through fragmentation and collapse of interstellar clouds. Observations of young brown dwarfs may help distinguish among different scenarios for their formation.
