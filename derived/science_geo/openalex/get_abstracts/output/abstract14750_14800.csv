https://openalex.org/W1976461353,"The sequence complexity of heterogeneous nuclear RNA is sea urchin gastrulas was measured by RNA-driven hybridization reactions with nonrepetitive sea urchin DNA. 28.5% of the sequence complexity of the genome is represented in the nuclear RNA. This amounts to 1.74 X 10(8) nucleotides of diverse sequence, more than 10 times the nucleotide complexity of the polysomal messenger RNA extracted from sea urchin embryos at the same stage. The complex set of nuclear RNA sequences driving this hybridization reaction was shown to be the same as the rapidly labeled hnRNA, using pulse-labeled nuclear RNA as driver."
https://openalex.org/W2022284622,"The amino acid sequence of bovine thymopoietin II is presented. This T cell differentiating hormone of the thymus is a single 49 amino acid polypeptide chain of 5562 daltons. There is microheterogeneity at the C terminus with approximately two thirds of the molecules lacking the C terminal arginine found on the remaining molecules. Determination of the primary structure of thymopoietin II was facilitated by a long automated sequenator run on thymopoietin II coupled to 2-isothlocyanonaphthalene-4,8-disulfonic acid (NITC), tryptic cleavage of maleated thymopoietin II to yield the overlapping C terminal peptide, and efficient manual sequencing of this peptide using benzene extractions to minimize extractive losses of peptide."

This focal attention phenomenon may be related to the observation that one class of tectal unit continues to discharge for a few seconds following a brief stimulus motion. Together with anatomical data of other investigators, results of the present study suggest that self-exciting neural loops within the tectum mediate this type of selective attention."
https://openalex.org/W326211706,"The interaction of a soluble homogeneous preparation of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate apodehydrogenase with phospholipid was studied in terms of restoration of enzymic activity and complex formation. The purified apoenzyme, which is devoid of lipid, is inactive. It is reactivated specifically by the addition of lecithin or mixtures of phospholipids containing lecithin. Mitochondrial phospholipid, i.e. the mixture of phospholipids in mitochondria, reactivates with the highest specific activity (approximately 100 micromol of DPN reduced/min/mg at 37 degrees and with the greatest efficiency (2.5 to 4 mol of lecithin/mol of enzyme subunit). Each of the lecithins of varying chain length and unsaturation reactivated the enzyme, albeit to differing extents and efficiencies. In general, lecithins containing unsaturated fatty acid moieties reactivated better than those containing the comparable saturated lipid. Optimal reactivation can be obtained for the various lecithins when they are microdispersed together with phosphatidylethanolamine. When the lecithins are added microdispersed together with both phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin, maximal efficiency is obtained. Also, PC6:0 and 8:0 reactivate as soluble molecules, so that a phospholipid bilayer is not necessary to reactivate the enzyme. Complex formation was studied using gel exclusion chromatography. It can be shown that each of the phospholipids which reactivate combines with the apoenzyme. Mitochondrial phospholipid, which reactivates the best, binds most effectively; PC8:0, which reactivates with poor efficiency, can be shown to bind with low affinity, and negligible binding occurs at concentrations which do not reactivate the enzyme. Since the apoenzyme is apparently homogeneous and devoid of phospholipid or detergents, it would appear that reactivation does not involve reversal of inhibition such as by removal of a regulatory subunit or detergent from the catalytic subunit. Rather, we conclude that phospholipid is a necessary and integral portion of this enzyme whose active form is a phospholipid-protein complex. The apoenzyme also forms a complex with phosphatidylethanolamine and/or cardiolipin, which do not reactivate enzymic activity. Salt dissociates such complexes in contrast with the lecithin-apoenzyme complex. Binding of phospholipid is a necessary but not sufficient requisite for enzymic activity. The same energies of activation are obtained from Arrhenius plots for the membrane-bound enzyme and for the purified soluble enzyme reactivated with mitochondrial phospholipid or different lecithins. This observation is compatible with the view that the purified enzyme has not been adversely modified in the isolation. Furthermore, essentially the same energies of activation were obtained for saturated lecithins below their transition temperatures and for unsaturated lecithins above their transition temperatures. Hence, there is no indication that a lipid phase transition occurs to influence the activity of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1581152304,"A pyrimidine phosphoribosyltransferase, previously shown to utilize 5-fluorouracil and possibly also uracil and orotate (Reyes, P. (1969) Biochemistry 8, 2057-2062), has been purified about 100-fold from murine leukemia P1534J. Roughly 20% of the original activity was recovered to yield an enzyme preparation with a specific activity of 7.4 mumol of 5-fluorouracil utilized/hour/mg of protein. Disc gel electrophoresis of this preparation revealed the presence of a major band of protein accompanied by several trace contaminants. Emphasis was placed on a study of the substrate specificity of this enzyme. 5-Fluorouracil, uracil, and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase activities purified in parallel during fractionation with ammonium sulfate and protamine sulfate and eluted together from columns of Sephadex tG-150 and DEAE-cellulose. The three phosphoribosyltransferase activities eluted from the Sephadex columns with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 to 60,000. In spite of this coordinate fractionation, preferential losses of orotate activity were experienced during DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Orotate activity continued to behave in a unique manner under other conditions, such as during proteolytic digestion. In the latter case, however, all three activities responded in parallel when digestion took place in the presence of 5mM UMP. The following results provided additional evidence to support the view that all three phosphoribosyltransferase activities may be catalyzed by the same enzyme: (a) the apparent Km for 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P) did not change significantly when enzyme activity was measured with either 5-fluorouracil, uracil, or orotate; (b) 5-fluorouracil and uracil were found to be mutually competitive inhibitors; the effect of 5-fluorouracil on orotate activity was likewise competitive in nature; (c) in the absence of UMP, orotate was a noncompetitive inhibitor of 5-fluorouracil and uracil activities, but in the presence of 5mM UMP it became a competitive inhibitor of both of these activities; (d) 5-fluorouracil and orotate activities co-sedimented in 5 to 20% sucrose gradients (uracil activity was not examined); and (e) a wide variety of normal mouse tissues displayed virtually the same 5-fluorouracil to uracil to orotate activity ratio as found in P1534J enzyme preparations. The apparent Km and Ki values reported in this study indicate that the preferred pyrimidine substrate is orotate. It seems likely, therefore, that this enzyme functions in vivo as an orotate phosphoribosyltransferase. Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase activities (a) eluted together during gel filtration on Sephadex G-150, (b) co-sedimented in 5 to 20% sucrose gradients, (c) remained associated during fractionation with ammonium sulfate and protamine sulfate, and (d) separated into a phosphoribosyltransferase and decarboxylase component when enzyme preparations previously subjected to limited proteolysis by elastase were sedimented in sucrose gradients..."
https://openalex.org/W1560020288,"1. Intact mouse neuroblastoma NS20 cells, in the presence of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase inhibitor, responded to adenosine (200 muM) and 2-chloroadenosine (200 muM) with a 20-fold increase in intracellular cAMP levels. AMP (200 muM) additions caused only a 3.5-fold cAMP level elevation. ATP, ADP, guanosine, cytidine, uridine, and guanine, all at 200 muM, had no effect on the cAMP level of these cells. 2. Homogenate NS20 adenylate cyclase activity was increased 2.5- to 4-fold by addition of 200 muM adenosine, 2-chloroadenosine, 2-hydroxyadenosine, or 8-methylaminoadenosine. Prostaglandin E1 additions (1.4 muM) produced about an 8-fold stimulation of homogenate cyclase activity. The Km of homogenate cyclase activation by adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine was 67.6 and 6.7 muM, respectively. Addition of 7-deazaadenosine, tolazoline, yohimbine, guanosine, cytosine, guanine, 2-deoxy-AMP, and adenine 9-beta-D-xylopyranoside, all at 200 muM were found to be without effect on homogenate NS20 adenylate cyclase. Two classes of inhibitors of homogenate NS20 adenylate cyclase activity were observed. One class, which included AMP, adenine, and theophylline, blocked 2-chloroadenosine but not prostaglandin E1 stimulation of cyclase. Theophylline was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of 2-chloroadenosine, with a Ki of 35 muM. The second class of inhibitors, which included 2'- and 5'-deoxyadenosine, inhibited unstimulated, 2-chloroadenosine and prostaglandin E1-stimulated homogenate cyclase activity to about the same degree. 3. Activation of NS20 homogenate adenylate cyclase by adenosine appears to be noncooperative. 4. The inhibitory action of putative purinergic neurotransmitters is postulated to be due to their effects on adenylate cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2025514540,"The poly(A) sequences at the 3' end of mRNA and nuclear RNA molecules of mouse sarcoma and Chinese hamster cells are subject to an elongation process distinct from de novo synthesis. This process continues in cells treated with a high level of actinomycin D to block transcription. This results in the labeling of the steady-state poly(A) population in the cytoplasm and of unusually long poly(A) segments in the nucleus. In cells incubated with 3H-adenosine in the absence of drug treatment, cytoplasmic steady-state poly(A) segments with short labeled sequences at the 3' end can be detected by their heterogenous size distribution and by measurements of adenosine and AMP released by alkaline hydrolysis. These measurements indicate an average size of 8 residues for the labeled sequences. In the nucleus, a slow elongation of preexisting poly(A) chains can also be detected through measurements of AMP and adenosine. The cytoplasmic elongation process leads to turnover of the 3' end of the poly(A) sequence on mRNA, because of concomitant removal of AMP residues. It is apparently not linked to mRNA translation. The Chinese hamster and mouse sarcoma cells appear to differ markedly with respect to relative extents of poly(A) chain extension and de novo synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1509148981,"D-beta-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase of bovine heart mitochondria has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The membrane-bound enzyme is first released by phospholipase A digestion of the mitochondria. Lithium bromide, 0.4 M, is used to aid release, and dithiothreitol is required to stabilize the enzyme. The membranous material is removed by centrifugation, and the apoenzyme is recovered in the supernatant and precipitated with ammonium sulfate to 50 percent of saturation. The main purification (100-fold) is achieved by selective adsorption and elution on controlled pore glass beads. The purified enzyme has been purified approximately 250-fold from the mitochondria. The purified enzyme is homogeneous as shown by poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate or acid-urea systems; a sharp band is obtained which is equivalent to a subunit molecular weight of 31,500. The apoenzyme is devoid of lipid and is completely inactive as isolated. It can be reactivated by adding aqueous microdispersions of lecithin or phospholipids containing lecithin. The apoenzyme is stable, i.e. it has a half-life of about 450 hours at 0-2 degrees in 0.4 M lithium bromide, containing 5 mM dithiothreitol at pH 7, and is soluble at these conditions, existing mainly as a monomer and dimer in dilute solution. It has a tendency to associate into larger aggregates when the salt concentration is lowered. The enzyme does not have a distinctive amino acid composition as compared with other proteins or soluble dehydrogenases. The purified apodehydrogenase is well suited for study of specific protein-lipid interaction, as well as the molecular basis for the role of phospholipid in this lipid-requiring enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2063134564,"Microtubules, assembled in vitro from tubulin extracted from rabbit brain, were subjected to changes in hydrostatic pressure (200 to 10,000 pounds per square inch) and temperature (37 degrees to 0 degrees C). Increased pressure, like cooling, reversibly depolymerizes microtubules, as measured by changes in either turbidity, birefringence, or the number of microtubules seen in electron micrographs. The characteristic response of brain microtubules in vitro to pressure is similar to that of mitotic spindle microtubules in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1510294511,"To study possible factors in the pathogenesis of the ethanol-induced fatty liver, we investigated the effect of chronic ethanol consumption on the metabolism of fatty acids by isolated hepatic mitochondria. Chronic ethanol consumption resulted in decreased fatty acid oxidation, as evidenced by a reduction in oxygen uptake and CO2 production associated with the oxidation of fatty acids. The State 3 rate of oxygen uptake was depressed to a greater extent than the State 4 or the uncoupler-stimulated rate; the respiratory control ratio was also decreased. Therefore, one site of action of chronic ethanol feeding is on oxidative phosphorylation. The reduction in fatty acid oxidation, in general, is not due to an effect on the activation or translocation of fatty acids into the mitochondria. There was no effect by ethanol feeding on the activity of palmitoyl coenzyme A synthetase, whereas carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity was increased. The use of an artificial system (formazan production) to study beta oxidation in the absence of the electron transport chain is described. In the presence of fluorocitrate, which inhibits citric acid cycle activity, ketogenesis and formazan production were increased by chronic ethanol consumption. Thus beta oxidation to the level of acetyl-CoA is not impaired by chronic ethanol consumption. Total oxidation of fatty acids to CO2 is depressed by chronic ethanol intoxication because of effects on oxidative phosphorylation or the citric acid cycle (or both). Neither nutritional deficiency, cofactor depletion, nor the presence of ethanol in vitro explains these effects. Several of the effects of chronic ethanol consumption on fatty acid oxidation are mimicked by acetaldehyde and acetate, products of ethanol oxidation. Chronic ethanol consumption leads to persistent impairment of mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids to CO2. However, oxidation of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA is not decreased by chronic ethanol consumption."
https://openalex.org/W1515781031,"The action of plasma amine oxidase upon beta-Br-ethylamine beta-Cl-ethylamine, beta-OH-phenylethylamine, and beta-Cl-phenylethylamine was examined. Beta-Br-ethylamine is a substrate and irreversible inactivator of the enzyme. The enzyme becomes covalently labeled by the inactivator. Approximately 2 mol of inactivator are incorporated per mol of enzyme (MW 170,000). The reduced enzyme is not inactivated. The enzyme catalyzes the elimination of HCl from beta-Cl-phenylethylamine to produce phenylacetaldehyde. The rate of the elimination reaction is comparable to the normal oxidative reaction. We conclude that the occurrence of this elimination reaction establishes the ability of the enzyme to catalyze proton abstraction from C-1 of the substrate and that proton abstraction occurs during the catalytic oxidation normally catalyzed by plasma amine oxidase. Beta-Cl-ethylamine is only oxidized to corresponding aldehyde. Beta-OH-phenylethylamine is neither oxidized, nor does elimination occur. It is a competitive inhibitor in the oxidation of benzylamine and in the elimination of HCl from beta-Cl-phenylethylamine."

The amino acid compositions of coat proteins in Pf1 and fd strains are recognized by their different side-chain vibrational frequencies. However, the conformationally sensitive amide frequencies indicate that Pf1 and fd coat proteins have the same α-helical secondary structures. Viral DNA backbones do not exhibit the A-type geometry."
https://openalex.org/W2062915763,"The length and interspersion of reiterated and single-copy DNA sequences in Dictyostelium have been examined. The results indicate that approximately 50-60% of the single-copy sequences in DNA fragments 1500 nucleotides long and 75% of the single-copy sequences in fragments 3000 nucleotides long are linked to short interspersed repeat DNA sequences. The average length of these single-copy sequences is 1500 nucleotides. The length of the reiterated DNA has also been analyzed and shows a bimodal distribution. One half is present in sequences greater than 2000 nucleotides long, while the remainder is present as short fragments 250-450 nucleotides long. These shorter fragments are interspersed with the bulk of the single-copy DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1536772199,"We have used alkyl ether analogs of ethanolamine and choline phospholipids as ligands to purify phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) from Crotalus adamanteus venom by affinity chromatography. One of the affinity columns was prepared with rac-1-(9-carboxy)nonyl-2-hexadecylglycero-3-phosphocholine linked to AH-Sepharose 4B via the carboxyl group. Specific adsorption of phospholipase A2 to this column was achieved in buffer containing Ca2+, and the enzyme was eluted in buffer containing EDTA. The two enzymes from this venom were prepared in good yield (greater than 90%), and were homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Retention of phospholipase A2 did not occur when the initial irrigant was devoid of Ca2+. These results support the compulsory ordered mechanism for this enzyme proposed by Wells ((1972), Biochemistry 11, 1030-1041) on the basis of kinetic considerations. The second affinity support was prepared with 1,2-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine attached through the amine moiety to CH-Sepharose 4B. Specific adsorption of phospholipase A2 to this column did not occur. These data indicate that the phospholipid base group must be accessible to the enzyme for optimal binding, and that modifications in the alkyl side chains are more desirable when designing affinity matrices for purification of enzymes involved in phospholipid metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2161081130,"The circular dichroism spectra of hen egg white lysozyme, and of lysozyme derivatives in which tryptophan residues 62 or 108, or both, are selectively oxidized, have been measured as a function of pH over the range of 200 to 310 nm. Neither Trp-62 nor Trp-108 is principally responsible for the positive rotational strength in the 280 to 300 nm region. The spectrum in the 200 to 230 nm region is nearly the same in the native protein and in the derivatives, and is little affected by binding of saccharide. These results are used to reinterpret the circular dichroism spectra of the lysozymes and alpha-lactalbumins."
https://openalex.org/W1517330945,"A particulate preparation from embryonic chicken brain catalyzed the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine from uridine diphospho-N-acetylgalactosamine to the ganglioside GM3 (hematoside, sialyllactosylceramide). The kinetic properties of the transferase were determined. The product was isolated and on the basis of chemical analysis and chromatographic behavior was shown to be Tay-Sachs ganglioside (GM2). The particulate preparation also utilized N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and some of its derivatives as acceptors, but partial heat inactivation and substrate competition experiments indicated that the two classes of acceptors, hematoside and N-acetylglucosamine, were substrates for different N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases. The enzyme that utilized hematoside showed low but detectable activity with analogues such as lactosylceramide and sialyllactose, but no activity with a wide range of other beta-galactosides and glycosphingolipids. These results are in accord with a proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of the gangliosides and for the patterns of these substances in different cell types and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1553028151,"Incorporation of amino acids into proteins in HeLa cells, virus-transformed 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and mouse plasmacytoma cells is inhibited after the addition of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, an alkylating agent and chymotrypsin-specific protease inhibitor. Addition of this drug to tissue culture cells at concentrations of 20 to 30 mug per ml results in an irreversible inhibition of the incorporation of amino acids into cellular proteins, and a rapid and complete breakdown of polyribosomes. A comparative study examining the effects of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and several known inhibitors of in vivo protein synthesis, with known mechanisms of action, revealed that an optimal concentration of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone: (a) immediately and selectively inhibits initiation of protein synthesis, (b) does not significantly affect normal elongation rates, and (c) does not promote a premature release of nascent peptides. L-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromenthyl ketone may prove to be a useful tool in investigating the initiatior of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells."

https://openalex.org/W1577196115,"When thermal denaturation of conalbumin solutions partially saturated with Fe(III) is observed by differential scanning calorimetry, four endotherms are observed between 40 and 100 degrees. The relative size of these four endotherms is determined by the Fe(III) to conalbumin ration. At a heating rate of 10 degrees/min, in Tris buffer at pH 7.5, observed endotherm temperature maxima and enthalpies of denaturation are: conalbumin, 63 degrees, 320 kcal/mol; intermediate I, 68 degrees, intermediate I, 77 degrees; Fe2-conalbumin, 84 degrees, 630 kcal/mol. These four endotherms are observed over a range of protein concentration from 7 to 100 mg/ml and are unchanged when excess bicarbonate is present. Stoichiometric calculations of both total protein and total iron indicate that each intermediate endotherm results from denaturation of conalbumin molecules containing only one ferric ion. These experimental results are thus consistent with the presence of two different monomeric one-iron conalbumin intermediates. They strongly suggest that the two iron binding sites of conalbumin are not equivalent."

https://openalex.org/W1515493131,"Differential scanning calorimetric experiments show that addition of Al(III) to conalbumin increases its denaturation temperature by 5 degrees, from 60 to 68 degrees. Only one Al(III) bound per conalbumin molecule produces this change in heat stability; additional bound Al(III) does not affect the heat stability. Since Al(III) displaces both Cu(II) bound at the metal binding sites of conalbumin, binding of aluminum takes place at the same metal binding sites. The binding constant for the second Al(III) is at least 100-fold less than that for the binding of the first Al(III), and both are displaced by added iron. The order of increasing heat stability of the metal ion complexes of conalbumin, Cu(II), Al(III), Fe(III), is the order of increasing binding constant for these metal ions."
https://openalex.org/W1534188543,"Nontoxic abrus lectin has been prepared by a new purification procedure. The method is accomplished by 45% saturation ammonium sulfate fractionation from a 5% acetic acid extract of the seeds of Abrus precatorius followed by diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-50 and Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography. The abrus lectin appeared homogeneous as judged by electrophoresis, analytical ultracentrifugation, and isoelectric focusing. The lectin molecule has a weight of 126,000 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium. It is composed of four subunits, of which two pairs have either identical or closely similar molecular sizes (33,800 and 32,200 daltons) as revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The results of amino acid analyses are given; none of the cysteic acid appears to arise from cysteine. An electrofocusing experiment indicated the isoelectric point to be 5.0. Crystals large enough for x-ray investigation were obtained by a vapor diffusion technique. X-ray precession photographs revealed that abrus lectin crystallizes in a tetragonal unit cell of symmetry P41212 and dimensions a = 140 and c = 210 A. The asymmetric unit contains 2 protein molecules of molecular weight 126,000 and has a solvent content of approximately 41% by volume."
https://openalex.org/W1539133207,"125I-concanavalin A (125I-Con A) was found to be equally effective as native Con A in binding to and agglutinating cells of Dictyostelium discoideum, suggesting that iodination of the molecule had no effect on the interaction of the protein with the cell surface. Almost all of the 125I-Con A binding to the cells was inhibited by alpha-methyl glucoside. The binding of 125I-Con A to the cells was extremely rapid, and once bound, the molecule was not readily displaced by prolonged incubation or by the addition of excess native concanavalin A (Con A). In contrast, the 125I-Con A was displaced rapidly from the cell surface by alpha-methyl glucoside. The binding of 125I-Con A to D. discoideum was identical at 22 degrees and 4 degrees, and was unaffected by metabolic inhibitors, suggesting that the protein was not subject to endocytosis. The cell surface Con A binding sites became saturated at high 125I-Con A concentrations. Scatchard plots of the data indicated that growing cells possessed 4 X 10(7) sites/cell, all of equal affinity. Similar plots for phase cells indicated at least two classes of binding sites. A small proportion of the sites had an affinity close to that for the sites on growing cells, but the majority of the sites had a markedly decreased affinity. The total number of binding sites increased only slightly during aggregation to 5.6 X 10(7) sites/cell."
https://openalex.org/W1587661184,"Bovine retinol-retinol-binding protein (RBP) was isolated from serum as a free, uncomplexed protein under experimental conditions in which human, rabbit, and chicken retinol-RBP are present as tight complexes with prealbumin (thyroxine-binding protein). Purified bovine retinol-RBP formed tight complexes with purified human and chicken prealbumin in physiological ionic strength buffers as judged by gel filtration chromatography, hyperchromic effect on the absorption spectrum of retinol-RBP, and changes in the circular dichroism spectrum. Addition of purified human prealbumin to whole bovine serum shifted the elution position of the specific retinol-RBP fluorescence from a gel filtration column, indicating complex formation in the whole bovine serum. It was concluded from this series of experiments that bovine serum lacks a protein with the binding properties of prealbumin and that bovine retinol-RBP has the normal potential binding to human, chicken, and presumably other prealbumins. Bovine retinol-RBP has a molecular weight, amino acid composition, absorption, and fluorescence spectra which are indistinguishable from that of human retinol-RBP, although the magnitude of the optical rotatory strength of the induced circular dichroism signal at 330 nm was 50% larger in the bovine than in the human material (1.65 and 1.1 Debye-Bohr magnetons, respectively). About 12 liters of bovine and human urine were concentrated by pressure dialysis and a search was made for retinol-RBP using gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. No retinol-RBP was found in either of these species. This suggested that if, indeed, bovine retinol-RBP is filtered through the kidney's glomeruli due to small molecular size (molecular weight 21,000), there are efficient mechanisms of tubular reabsorption."

In this communication, we show that this complex is a good activator of the serum complement system. For activation to occur, the univalent hapten must contain the specific group which binds to the antibody, and also the polycationic chain. In addition, activation requires a functional complement-binding region on the intact antibody molecule. The classical pathway appears to be involved since the first, fourth, and second components of complement are markedly depleted when the complement system is activated by this univalent hapten-antibody complex."

Fibroin mRNA stimulated [3-H]alanine incorporation about 3- to 4-fold in the presence of 80 mM K+ and 4 mM Mg-2+. The stimulation was reduced in the presence of 5 times 10-minus 6 to 10-minus 4 M aurintricarboxylic acid, an inhibitor of the initiation of protein synthesis. The cell-free products were heterogeneous in size, including peptides as large as 100,000 daltons. They co-precipitated with carrier fibroin sequences after digestion with trypsin. A large fraction of the polypeptides synthesized in response to fibroin mRNA was precipitated by antiserum directed against amino acid sequences in noncrystalline region polypeptides of fibroin. Furthermore, after digestion with chymotrypsin, a major fraction of the cell-free products specifically co-precipitated with crystalline region sequences of native fibroin. The size and amino acid composition of the fibroin crystalline region polypeptides isolated from the cell-free products were similar to those from native fibroin."

https://openalex.org/W1528266839,"Bovine type M pyruvate kinase, which normally has hyperbolic kinetics with its substrates, was inactivated by treatment with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. The inactivation probably occurs through trinitrophenylation of the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue in or near the ADP binding site. Although 90 to 95% of the enzymatic activity is lost by this treatment, the molecular weight and sedimentation coefficient of the trinitrophenylated enzyme are quite similar to values obtained with the native enzyme. The inactivated, trinitrophenylated type M pyruvate kinase was hybridized in vitro with the native bovine type L enzyme, which has sigmoidal kinetics with phosphoenolpyruvate but can be activated by fructose 1,6-diphosphate to give hyperbolic kinetics. Four enzymatically active species were produced, designated L4, L3M, L2M2, and LM3, according to their subunit composition. L4 and L3M have sigmoidal kinetics with phosphoenolpyruvate and are activated by fructose diphosphate. Little or no sigmoidicity was seen for L2M2, although this species is activated to a moderate degree by fructose diphosphate. LM3 appears to have hyperbolic kinetics and is activated only slightly by fructose diphosphate. The kinetic results obtained with hybrids containing trinitrophenylated type M subunits are quite similar to the results previously reported by Dyson and Cardenas ((1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 8482-8488) using native type M and type L subunits, indicating that the properties of a type L subunit are profoundly affected by the nature of the other subunits present in the tetramer. In fact, type L and type M subunits in a given hybrid seem to have similar kinetic responses toward phosphoenolpyruvate and fructose diphosphate."

This type of progression is associated with pedicle musculature different from that of attached and other free-lying forms, and some diagnostic differences in muscle attachment areas are evident in preservable hard parts."

This material is much more effective than insulin on epididymal fat tissue from these mice. Insulin-like material and insulin are equipotent on the corresponding tissues from lean littermates."
https://openalex.org/W1540510422,"The emission maximum of DPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase in pH 7.07 buffer is shifted from 317 to 324 nm and fluorescence intensity is decreased when the excitation wave-length is varied from 270 to 290 nm; in 0.2 M KOH, where the fluorescence of tyrosyl residues is almost completely quenched, a further substantial decline in quantum yield of protein fluorescence and a red shift of the emission peak to 339 nm occur. The latter should be due mainly to tryptophyl residues. The enzyme contains 9.4 tyrosyl residues per subunit of molecular weight 42,000 determined spectrophotometrically (295 nm) at pH 13, in good agreement with a tyrosine content of 9.7 by amino acid analysis. No more than 1.1 tyrosyl residues per subunit can be detected up to pH 10.6 at 7 degrees upon prolonged incubation. The increase in absorption at 295 nm with increasing pH is related to loss of enzyme activity and results in a red shift of the emission maximum, and decreased fluorescence intensity. Treatment of the enzyme in a Li+-containing buffer at pH 7.5 with an excess of N-acetylimidazole results in (a) modification of 1.1 tyrosyl residues per subunit, (b) a 30% decrease in enzyme activity, (c) a 6-nm red shift in emission maximum, and (d) a decrease in fluorescence intensity. Manganous DL-isocitrate (1.06 mM) prevents the acetylation of the enzyme. Deacetylation of the O-acetylated enzyme by hydroxylamine completely restores the enzyme activity and reverses the spectral changes. The acetylation studies indicate that the reactive tyrosyl residue does not participate directly in catalysis but may be involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the active enzyme center. A net of 1 of the 2 tryptophyl residues per subunit is perturbed immediately by a number of solvents. This perturbation is not affected by manganous isocitrate, whereas exposure of tyrosyl residues occurs only with time and is prevented by the substrate. The perturbation of the tryptophyl residue is accompanied by a red shift of the fluorescence emission maximum. The more exposed tryptophyl residue may contribute to the energy transfer from protein to nucleotides since the quenching of protein fluorescence upon binding of DPN+, DPNH, or ADP by enzyme results in a blue shift of the emission maximum. Manganous DL-isocitrate (1.06 mM) quenches protein fluorescence by 16% without a shift in emission peak and does not affect the relative extent of fluorescence quenching induced by the nucleotides."
