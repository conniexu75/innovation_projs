https://openalex.org/W1963761369,"TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins are candidate signal transducers that associate with the cytoplasmic domains of members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. The role of TRAFs in the TNF-R2 and CD40 signal transduction pathways, which result in the activation of transcription factor NF-kappa B, was investigated. Overexpression of TRAF2, but not TRAF1 or TRAF3, was sufficient to induce NF-kappa B activation. A truncated derivative of TRAF2 lacking an amino-terminal RING finger domain was a dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-kappa B activation mediated by TNF-R2 and CD40. Thus, TRAF2 is a common mediator of TNF-R2 and CD40 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2059155059,"Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized in skeletal muscle by neuronal-type NO synthase (nNOS), which is localized to sarcolemma of fast-twitch fibers. Synthesis of NO in active muscle opposes contractile force. We show that nNOS partitions with skeletal muscle membranes owing to association of nNOS with dystrophin, the protein mutated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The dystrophin complex interacts with an N-terminal domain of nNOS that contains a GLGF motif. mdx mice and humans with DMD evince a selective loss of nNOS protein and catalytic activity from muscle membranes, demonstrating a novel role for dystrophin in localizing a signaling enzyme to the myocyte sarcolemma. Aberrant regulation of nNOS may contribute to preferential degeneration of fast-twitch muscle fibers in DMD."
https://openalex.org/W1977007393,"Endogenously synthesized antigenic determinants are generally presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, whereas exogenous determinants are presented by MHC class II molecules. Here, it is shown that exogenous antigens chaperoned by a heat shock protein can be channeled into the endogenous pathway, presented by MHC class I molecules, and recognized by CD8+ T lymphocytes. This pathway is functional only in a subset of macrophages among the cell types tested. These observations provide a basis for the tumor-specific and virus-specific immunogenicity of cognate heat shock protein preparations and offer a mechanism for the classical phenomenon of cross-priming."

This trisaccharide has been implicated in sperm-zona pellucida adhesive events thought to be essential to fertilization in the mouse. To determine directly if this molecule is required for fertilization, we have generated mice that are deficient in a gene (α1,3GT) encoding the UDP-Gal:β-D-Gal-α1→3Gal-galactosyltransferase enzyme responsible for Galα1→3Gal synthesis and expression. These mice develop normally and exhibit no gross phenotypic abnormalities. The Galα1→3Gal epitope is absent from the vascular endothelium and other tissues in α1,3GT (−/−) adult mice. By contrast, α1,3GT (−/−) mice, like humans, develop naturally occurring anti-α-galactoside antibodies normally absent in wild type mice. Female α1,3GT (−/−) mice yield oocytes that are devoid of the Galα1→3Gal epitope; however, these mice are fully fertile. These observations indicate that the Galα1→3Gal moiety is not essential to sperm-oocyte interactions leading to fertilization or to essentially normal development. They further suggest that α1,3GT (−/−) mice will find utility for exploring approaches to diminish anti-Gal-dependent hyperacute xenograft rejection, which presents a major barrier to the use of porcine and other non-primate organs for xenotransplantation in humans.

Fertilization in mammals involves an adhesive interaction between sperm and the zona pellucida, a glycoprotein-containing shell that surrounds the oocyte. Sperm receptor activity of the murine oocyte resides in the zona pellucida glycoprotein ZP3(1Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M.

Treatment of purified egg ZP3 and ZP3-derived O-linked oligosaccharides with α-galactosidase eliminates sperm receptor activity(6Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These observations have been taken to imply that terminal α-galactosides on ZP3 glycoconjugates are critical for sperm binding activity(6Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6778-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by more recent observations demonstrating that structurally defined bi- and tetraantennary blood group I-related oligosaccharides containing terminal Galα1→3Gal moieties inhibit binding of sperm to eggs in a dose-dependent manner(7Litscher E.S.

In the mouse, at least one UDP-Gal:β-D-Gal-α1→3Gal-galactosyltransferase (α1,3GT) 1The abbreviations used are: α1,3GTUDP-Gal:β-D-Gal-α1→3Gal-galactosyltransferaseESembryonic stem cell(s)BSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateBSIB4B. simplicifolia isolectin B4. is responsible for the synthesis of terminal Galα1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc trisaccharides from common lactosamine-terminated glycoconjugates(8Joziasse D.H.

Mice and other placental mammals express the Galα1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc trisaccharide products of α1,3GT on a variety of glycoproteins and in a variety of tissues(10Galili U. Shohet S.B. Kobrin E.

By contrast, humans, apes, and Old World monkeys lack the ability to synthesize these oligosaccharide moieties, because the genetic homologues of the murine α1,3GT locus are pseudogenes incapable of encoding a functional α1,3GT(12Larsen R.D.

Consequently, these latter species are reciprocally replete with immunoglobulins of all classes directed against terminal Galα1→3Gal epitopes(14Galili U. Rachmilewitz E.A. Peleg A. Flechner I. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 15Galili U. Clark M.R. Shohet S.B. Buehler J. Macher B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). These antibodies are presumed to arise through immunization by environmental antigens similar or identical to the Galα1→3Gal epitope(16Galili U. Mandrell R.E. Hamdeh R.M. Shohet S.B. Griffis J.M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 57: 1730-1737Crossref Google Scholar). In humans these natural antibodies (termed anti-Gal) comprise approximately 1% of circulating IgG, as well as a significant fraction of circulating IgM class antibodies(14Galili U. Rachmilewitz E.A. Peleg A. Flechner I. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 17Sandrin M.S. Vaughan H.A. Dabkowski P.L. McKenzie I.F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anti-Gal antibodies are clinically important in the context of the proposed use of porcine and other non-primate mammalian organs to circumvent the shortage of human organs for transplantation purposes (reviewed in (18Galili U. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 480-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and (19Cooper D.K. Koren E. Oriol R. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 141: 31-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar)). Anti-Gal antibodies serve to initiate hyperacute rejection of xenografts derived from such mammalian species, via complement-mediated cytolytic events involving terminal Galα1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc glycoconjugates expressed by the vascular endothelium of the xenotransplant(20Sandrin M.S. McKenzie I.F.C. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 141: 169-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 21Ye Y. Neethling F.A. Niekrasz M. Koren E. Richards S.V. Martin M. Kosanke S. Oriol R. Cooper D.K.C. Transplantation. 1994; 206: 330-337Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To directly address the role of Galα1→3Gal containing oligosaccharides in fertilization in the mouse, we have used a gene disruption approach in embryonic stem cells (22Bronson S.K. Smithies O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27155-27158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate mice homozygous for a null α1,3GT allele. α1,3GT (−/−) mice are deficient in the expression of Galα1→3Gal epitopes on oocytes but are as fertile as their wild type litter mates, indicating that Galα1→3Gal epitopes are not essential to sperm-oocyte binding in this species. As with humans, apes, and Old World monkeys, α1,3GT (−/−) mice maintain naturally occurring anti-Gal antibodies but are deficient in the expression of Galα1→3Gal epitopes on vascular endothelium and other tissues. These observations imply that the inactivated α1,3GT gene represents the only functional murine α1,3GT locus, and they suggest that the α1,3GT (−/−) mouse may prove useful as a small animal model for studying approaches that can diminish anti-Gal-dependent hyperacute organ transplant rejection. A genomic clone of the α1,3GT locus was isolated from the 129SV mouse strain and restricted with NotI-MluI, and the resulting 12-kilobase fragment was cloned into pGEM-5 (Stratagene). A neomycin resistance cassette, pgkNeo, was inserted into the SalI site within the catalytic domain, and a 500-base pair BstEII-NotI fragment was subsequently removed from a position ~900 base pairs 3′ of the pgkNeo insertion. A thymidine kinase cassette (pgkTK) (23McBurney M.W. Sutherland L.C. Adra B. Leclair B. Rudnicki M.A. Jardine K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 19: 5755-5761Google Scholar) was then inserted into the targeting vector at a position corresponding to the BstEII site. The Neo insertion disrupts the largest coding exon in the α1,3GT gene(8Joziasse D.H. Shaper N.L. Kim D. Van den Eijnden D.H. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5534-5541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); fusion of pgkNeo sequences to this exon yields premature termination codons in all three exonic reading frames. D3 embryonic stem cells (ES) (24Doetschman T.C. Eistetter H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kemler R. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 87: 27-45PubMed Google Scholar) were electroporated and selected by standard methods(25Koller B.H. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8932-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination of the targeting vector with the native allele was detected in individual ES clones by a nested polymerase chain reaction strategy (Fig. 1a, solid arrowheads). Polymerase chain reaction-positive ES clones were expanded and were subjected to extensive restriction analysis by Southern blotting of genomic DNA. ES clones containing a single, homologously integrated targeted allele were used to generate chimeric mice via blastocyst injection, as described previously(26Bradley A. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells. IRL Press, Washington, DC1989: 113-151Google Scholar). Progeny from two ES lines (1G7 and 1F3) were used for subsequent experiments. Chimeric males resulting from ES cell injections were mated with F1(C57BL/6J × DBA/2J) females, to yield heterozygous (α1,3GT +/−) progeny. The F1(129SV × C57BL/6J × DBA/2J) α1,3GT (+/−) littermates were bred to yield F2 α1,3GT (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) progeny. F2 α1,3GT (−/−) females were housed with proven fertile wild type males and control wild type females. F2 α1,3GT (−/−) males were housed with F2 α1,3GT (−/−) female litter mates and wild type control females. Litter sizes were determined based on the number of pups found on the day of birth. Lungs were removed from α1,3GT (+/+) and α1,3GT (−/−) littermates, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin, and 4 μM sections were made. Sections were pretreated with 50 mM NH4Cl and were then treated either with 2 units/ml green coffee bean α-galactosidase (Sigma) or with buffer alone. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. Sections were preblocked with 1% crystalline BSA (Sigma) in PBS, and were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 20 μg/ml antigen affinity-purified anti-Gal(22Bronson S.K. Smithies O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27155-27158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in binding buffer (1% BSA, PBS, and 0.05% Tween 20; Bio-Rad). Slides were washed with Tween/PBS and were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in binding buffer containing 1:100 biotinylated anti-human IgG and IgM (Vector), followed by peroxidase ABC staining (Vector). Rabbit erythrocyte agglutination assays were performed as described previously (14Galili U. Rachmilewitz E.A. Peleg A. Flechner I. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), with the exception that sera were also preincubated with 10 mg of either Synsorb H (Fucα1→2Galβ1→4GlcNAc) or Synsorb 115 (Galα1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc) beads (Chembiomed, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Four-week-old female wild type and α1,3GT (−/−) littermates produced by F1 heterozygous crosses were superovulated, and oocytes were isolated from the oviducts in M2 medium supplemented with 300 μg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma). Oocytes were transferred through serial changes of buffer containing PBS, 0.4% BSA, and were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C in PBS, 0.4% BSA, supplemented with Bandeiraea simplicifolia isolectin B4 (BSIB4)-FITC (10 μg/ml), with or without 20 mM methyl α-galactopyranoside (Sigma). Oocytes were washed, placed in flat-bottomed slide wells, and photographed using confocal microscopy. A targeted disruption of the murine UDP-Gal:β-D-Gal-α1→3Gal-galactosyltransferase (α1,3GT) gene in embryonic stem cells (ES) was completed as shown in Fig. 1a. F1 heterozygous (α1,3GT (+/−)) littermates were intercrossed to yield viable progeny with genotype frequencies (22% (−/−), 50% (+/−), and 28% (+/+)) corresponding to a Mendelian inheritance pattern, indicating that homozygosity for the null α1,3GT allele is compatible with essentially normal intrauterine development. Mice that are homozygous for the null allele do not differ in size or appearance from their wild type litter mates. The major organs of the α1,3GT (−/−) animals are grossly and histologically normal, as are the levels of a variety of serum analytes. Total and differential blood leukocyte counts, red cell counts, and platelet counts are not significantly different between the α1,3GT (−/−) mice and wild type control mice. We used human Galα1→3Gal antibodies to confirm that the α1,3GT (−/−) mice are deficient in Galα1→3Gal expression. In humans, at least 1% of the circulating IgG class antibodies, and substantial amounts of circulating IgM class antibodies, are directed against terminal Galα1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc-containing oligosaccharides(14Galili U. Rachmilewitz E.A. Peleg A. Flechner I. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 17Sandrin M.S. Vaughan H.A. Dabkowski P.L. McKenzie I.F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11391-11395Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). By contrast, human tissues are essentially devoid of Galα1→3Gal epitopes, because a functional α1,3GT locus is apparently not present in humans(12Larsen R.D. Rivera-Marrero C.A. Ernst L.K. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Jabs E.W. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6991-6998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, “naturally occurring” polyclonal antibodies directed against the Galα1→3Gal epitope (27Galili U. Anaraki F. Thall A. Hill-Black C. Radic M. Blood. 1993; 82: 2485-2493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (termed “anti-Gal” antibodies) are presumed to occur as a consequence of continuous immunization by gastrointestinal flora containing glycoconjugates with terminal α-galactoside structures (16Galili U. Mandrell R.E. Hamdeh R.M. Shohet S.B. Griffis J.M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 57: 1730-1737Crossref Google Scholar). As noted previously(10Galili U. Shohet S.B. Kobrin E. Stults C.L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17755-17762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human anti-Gal antibody detects α-galactosidase-susceptible Galα1→3Gal epitopes on a variety of wild type murine cells, including vascular endothelium (Fig. 2, a and b). By contrast, the vascular endothelium of α1,3GT (−/−) mice is devoid of detectable terminal α-galactosides (Fig. 2c). α1,3GT activity, normally present in murine spleen cells, is not detectable in α1,3GT (−/−) splenocytes (data not shown). The reciprocal relationship between the absence of Galα1→3Gal epitopes and the presence of anti-Gal antibody observed in humans and some other primates (12Larsen R.D. Rivera-Marrero C.A. Ernst L.K. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is recapitulated in the α1,3GT (−/−) mice. Sera from α1,3GT (−/−) mice directly agglutinate Galα1→3Gal-positive (14Galili U. Rachmilewitz E.A. Peleg A. Flechner I. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 28Suzuki E. Naiki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) rabbit erythrocytes, whereas sera from α1,3GT (+/+) mice, as expected, do not and thus are devoid of anti-Gal antibody activity. The rabbit erythrocyte hemagglutinating activity present in α1,3GT (−/−) sera can be removed by preincubation of the sera with immobilized synthetic Galα1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc structures, whereas removal of hemagglutinating activity does not occur when the sera are preabsorbed with Fucα1→2Galβ1→ 4GlcNAc structures (Fig. 2d). Sera prepared from α1,3GT (−/−) mice contain antibodies that also bind to murine laminin, a glycoprotein containing terminal α-galactosides(29Arumugham R.G. Hsieh T.C.Y. Tanzer M.L. Lane R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), but do not bind α-galactosidase-treated laminin. By contrast, sera from α1,3GT (+/+) mice do not bind to murine laminin (data not shown). These observations indicate that the α1,3GT (−/−) mice maintain naturally occurring anti-Gal antibodies and indicate that these mice are therefore essentially deficient in the expression of terminal Galα1→3Gal moieties. Studies in vitro indicate that terminal α-galactosides displayed by O-linked glycans on the mouse zona pellucida glycoprotein ZP3 are required for the binding of sperm to the oocyte (2Florman H.M. Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 3Wassarman P.M. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Wassarman P.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These glycoconjugates are easily demonstrated on the zona pellucida of wild type oocytes (Fig. 3b), using a lectin (BSIB4) that specifically recognizes these molecules(30Wood C. Kabat E. Murphy L.A. Goldstein I.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 198: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). By contrast, oocytes obtained from α1,3GT (−/−) females do not stain with this lectin (Fig. 3e). The same result was also observed by staining oocytes with human anti-Gal (data not shown). The loss of the ability to detect oocyte α-galactosides is not due to a blocking effect of maternal anti-Gal immunoglobulins bound to the oocyte, since anti-mouse immunoglobulins did not interact with these oocytes (data not shown). These observations directly demonstrate that the α1,3GT locus determines oocyte expression of terminal α-galactosides. Table 1 summarizes breeding studies completed to determine if fertility is affected by absence of zona pellucida terminal α-galactosides consequent to nullizygosity at the α1,3GT locus. In matings between α1,3GT (−/−) females and fertile wild type males of the same genetic background, we observed fertility rates and litter sizes equivalent to those observed in control matings involving α1,3GT (-/+) and α1,3GT (+/+) females. These observations demonstrate that absence of zona pellucida terminal α-galactosides is compatible with normal fecundity and indicate that terminal α-galactosides do not represent an essential component of the mouse oocyte sperm receptor(s). This conclusion leaves open the possibility that Galβ1→ 4GlcNAc-terminated blood group I-related oligosaccharides capable of blocking sperm-egg binding (7Litscher E.S. Juntunen K. Seppo A. Penttila L.Niemela R. Renkonen O. Wassarman P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) are instead responsible for sperm-egg adhesion during fertilization. Absence of an essential role for terminal Galα1→3Gal structure in fertilization is also consistent with an alternative hypothesis that murine sperm-egg adhesion during fertilization is accomplished through an interaction between terminal N-acetylglucosamine moieties on the oocyte and surface-localized β(1,4)galactosyltransferase on murine spermatids(31Miller D.J.

Early attempts to completely block these interactions in vivo met with limited success(21Ye Y. Neethling F.A. Niekrasz M. Koren E. Richards S.V. Martin M. Kosanke S. Oriol R. Cooper D.K.C. Transplantation. 1994; 206: 330-337Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). More recent work involving transgene-directed overexpression of complement inhibitors in the xenograft has shown substantial promise as a means to mitigate anti-Gal-dependent hyperacute xenograft rejection (32McCurry K.R. Kooyman D.L. Diamond L.E. Byrne G.W. Logan J.S. Platt J.L. Transplantation. 1995; 59: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Currently, Old World monkeys, which are naturally deficient in the Galα1→3Gal epitope but reciprocally replete with circulating anti-Gal antibodies, represent the only available experimental animal recipient for such studies; cost and logistical considerations associated with the care of these large animals can represent a substantial impediment to experimental progress in this area. The α1,3GT (−/−) mice we describe here may represent a useful alternative small animal for this work, since it can be anticipated that the naturally occurring anti-Gal antibodies in an α1,3GT (−/−) murine graft recipient will lead to hyperacute graft rejection of a transplanted organ taken from an α1,3GT (+/+), Galα1→3Gal-positive, but otherwise syngeneic donor mouse.

https://openalex.org/W2028263332,"Patients with the genetic disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT) have mutations in the AT mutated (ATM) gene, which is homologous to TEL1 and the checkpoint gene MEC1. A tel1 deletion mutant, unlike a mec1 deletion, is viable and does not exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. However, increased dosage of TEL1 rescues sensitivity of a mec1 mutant, mec1-1, to DNA-damaging agents and rescues viability of a mec1 disruption. mec1-1 tel1 delta 1 double mutants are synergistically sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, including radiomimetic drugs. These data indicate that TEL1 and MEC1 are functionally related and that functions of the ATM gene are apparently divided between at least two S. cerevisiae homologs."

Using the multistep skin carcinogenesis model, we have directly tested the ability of c-fos-deficient mice to develop cancer. Upon treatment with a tumor promoter, c-fos knockout mice carrying a v-H-ras transgene were able to develop benign tumors with similar kinetics and relative incidence as wild-type animals. However, c-fos-deficient papillomas quickly became very dry and hyperkeratinized, taking on an elongated, horny appearance. While wild-type papillomas eventually progressed into malignant tumors, c-fos-deficient tumors failed to undergo malignant conversion. Experiments in which v-H-ras-expressing keratinocytes were grafted onto nude mice suggest that c-fos-deficient cells have an intrinsic defect that hinders tumorigenesis. These results demonstrate that a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors is required for the development of a malignant tumor."

This tyrosine phosphorylation does not occur when cells attach to polylysine or through antibodies against major histocompatibility complex. It also does not take place when adhesion-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is inhibited with cytochalasin D. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin coincides with tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase during integrin-mediated cell adhesion but is independent of cell adhesion in v-src-transformed cells. The tyrosine-phosphorylated sites in p130Cas and cortactin may serve as binding sites for proteins containing Src homology 2 domains, as is the case with two other integrin-regulated docking proteins, focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. Thus, these results suggest that ligand binding of integrins regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation state of multiple docking proteins. These proteins may mediate anchorage dependence of growth; their misregulation in v-src-transformed and other tumorigenic cells may be responsible for the anchorage independence of such cells.

We show that two recently described signaling molecules, the v-src substrate proteins p130Cas(25Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was supplied by Life Technologies, Inc., fetal calf serum was from Tissue Culture Biologicals (Tulare, CA), and Glutamine Pen-Strep from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). Cytochalasin D was from Sigma. Human plasma fibronectin was obtained from the Finnish Red Cross. Vitronectin was purified from human plasma as previously described (28Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayasghi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Anti-mouse MHC class I H-2 monoclonal antibody was from ATCC, and anti-rat MHC class I RT1A monoclonal antibody was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-α5β1 and anti-αvβ3 antibodies have been described earlier(29Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J.

Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and polyclonal rabbit anti-p130Cas antibody (Cas-2) from Dr. Hisamaru Hirai(25Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-p130Cas antibody, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody py20, monoclonal anti-FAK antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated py20 were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody was from Zymed (South San Francisco, CA). All other reagents were acquired from Sigma. Rat embryo fibroblasts 52 (REF) cells, NIH 3T3 cells, c-src-transfected 3T3 cells, and v-src-transformed 3T3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Prior to experiments, cells were serum-starved for 14 h in DMEM containing 0.3% fetal calf serum in order to avoid inadvertent induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, FAK, and p130Cas by lysophosphatidic acid present in the serum(32Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were also carried out without serum starvation; no differences were found in the results between these two conditions (not shown). Cells were detached by trypsinization followed by washing with soybean trypsin inhibitor. The cells were washed twice with DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and cell suspensions were incubated in DMEM, 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 40 min on a rotator. Cells were then plated onto the dishes coated with various substrates and incubated at 37°C for the indicated times; cells referred as suspended cells under “Results” were held in suspension for an additional 20 min. In some experiments, cytochalasin D (1 μM) was added 10 min prior to plating the cells. Dishes were coated with fibronectin (20 μg/ml), vitronectin (20 μg/ml), affinity-purified anti-α5β1 antibody (10 μg/ml), affinity-purified anti-αvβ3 antibody (10 μg/ml), monoclonal anti-MHC antibodies (10 μg/ml), or polylysine (20 μg/ml) overnight, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h prior to plating the cells. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 50 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Na3VO4, 0.1 unit/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml pepstatin A). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Antibodies were added to lysates containing an equal amount of protein, and samples were rotated at 4°C for 1 h. To precipitate the antibody-antigen complexes, Gammabind-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added to the lysates, and rotation was continued for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates, pelleted by microcentrifuging, were washed three times in wash buffer (=lysis buffer without SDS and deoxycholate). In immunodepletion experiments, the supernatant was subjected to three rounds of precipitation with the anti-FAK and anti-paxillin antibodies, and the supernatant cleared of FAK and paxillin (as determined by immunoblot analysis) was immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine py20 antibody. The pellets were boiled in sample buffer and electrophoresed on 4-12% precast SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (Novex). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were visualized by incubating with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine py20 antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Corp.). To detect FAK, p130Cas, and cortactin, blots were probed with monoclonal FAK, monoclonal p130Cas, and polyclonal anti-cortactin antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and protein A, respectively. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. To investigate tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in response to cell adhesion, REF cells were either kept in suspension or plated on dishes coated with fibronectin for 45 min. As shown in Fig. 1(lanes 1 and 2), cell adhesion to fibronectin resulted in elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 160, 120-130, 115, and 70-85 kDa in molecular mass. NIH 3T3 cells were also tested throughout the study, and similar results were obtained. Unless otherwise indicated, results shown in the figures are those obtained with REF cells. As expected based on the previous reports, one of the phosphorylated proteins in the 120-130-kDa range was found to be FAK (8Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), while one of the 70-85 kDa proteins was identified as paxillin (12Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) (data not shown). When lysates obtained from cells plated on fibronectin were depleted of FAK and paxillin by repeated immunoprecipitations with the appropriate antibodies, bands around 120-130 and 70-85 kDa could still be detected in anti-phosphotyrosine blot, suggesting that multiple proteins in these molecular mass ranges become tyrosine phosphorylated upon cell adhesion and integrin ligand binding (not shown). To investigate the possibility that two v-src substrates, p130Cas(25Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) and cortactin, an 80/85 kDa protein(26Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 27Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), would be among the unidentified phosphoproteins, samples from suspended and adherent REF cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against p130Cas and cortactin, and they were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1 upper panel). When immunoprecipitated from suspended cells, p130Cas and cortactin (lanes 3 and 7) exhibited very low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation. Cell adhesion to polylysine, to which cells can adhere in a nonspecific fashion, had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin (lanes 4 and 8). Similarly, no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed when cells were allowed to adhere on dishes coated with anti-MHC antibodies (not shown). An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in cells plated on fibronectin or on anti-α5β1 antibodies (lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10). The amounts of p130Cas and cortactin were essentially the same in all samples as shown when the same plot was stripped and reprobed with anti-p130Cas and anti-cortactin antibodies (Fig. 1 lower panel). As it has been previously reported, p130Cas was found to migrate as multiple bands, presumably due to differences in post-translational modifications(25Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin was also observed when cells were plated on dishes coated with vitronectin or anti-αvβ3 antibodies (not shown). To study the connection of cortactin and p130Cas phosphorylation with actin filament reorganization, REF cells were allowed to adhere to fibronectin-coated dishes, and tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, cortactin, and FAK was assessed as a function of time (Fig. 2). At the time point zero, all of these proteins seem to contain little phosphotyrosine. After 15 min, most of the cells had adhered to fibronectin, but had not yet fully spread. As shown earlier, at this time FAK phosphorylation had reached maximal levels and seemed to plateau(11Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23439-23442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time course for p130Cas and cortactin phosphorylation was indistinguishable from that of FAK. Thus, the phosphorylation of all these proteins seems to be coincident with cell adhesion, and maximal phosphorylation occurs around the time of cell spreading and actin filament reorganization. To determine whether reorganization of cytoskeleton is necessary for cell adherence to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin, the spreading of cells plated onto a fibronectin substratum was inhibited with cytochalasin D; p130Cas, cortactin, or FAK did not become tyrosine-phosphorylated in the presence of cytochalasin D (Fig. 2). Cytochalasin D treatment has earlier been demonstrated to prevent integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and tensin(24Bockholt S.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 468: 14565-14567Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Both p130Cas and cortactin, as well as FAK, paxillin, and tensin, were originally identified as tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in v-src-transformed cells(33Glenney Jr., J.R. Zokas L. J.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of FAK in v-src transformed cells is independent of cell adhesion (18Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). We tested whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin in anchorage-independent v-src transformed cells requires integrin-mediated signaling and cell adherence to ECM substrata. As shown in Fig. 3 no differences were found in the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin between v-src cells held in suspension or plated on fibronectin, demonstrating that adhesion is not required for tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin in v-src cells. We also tested the adhesion-dependence of p130Cas and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in NIH 3T3 cells which express enhanced levels of c-src(35Shalloway D. Coussens P.M. Yaciuk P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7071-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Overexpression of c-src in NIH 3T3 cells generates in vitro kinase activity levels comparable to those of v-src transformed cells. These cells display morphological characteristics intermediate between those of normal and v-src-transformed NIH 3T3 cells, but overexpression of c-src does not induce transformation of NIH 3T3 cells(35Shalloway D. Coussens P.M. Yaciuk P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7071-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As in the case of normal NIH 3T3 cells, but not of the v-src transformed cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin was dependent on cell adhesion in c-src overexpressing cells (Fig. 3). Several proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cell adhesion and spreading on extracellular substrata. Three of these proteins have previously been identified as FAK, paxillin, and tensin (8Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, we report on elevated phosphotyrosine on two additional proteins, p130Cas and cortactin, as cells adhere to ECM substrates or to immobilized anti-integrin antibodies. We also show that this tyrosine phosphorylation coincides with tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, requires organization of actin cytoskeleton, and is independent of cell adhesion in v-src-transformed cells. p130Cas was originally identified as a highly tyrosine-phosphorylated protein during cellular transformation by v-src(34Kanner S.B.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10588-10595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that forms stable complexes with these oncoproteins. Recent molecular cloning of p130Cas identified it as a novel SH3-containing signaling molecule with a cluster of multiple putative SH2-binding motifs(25Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The unique structure of p130Cas indicates the possible role of p130Cas in assembling signals from multiple SH2-containing molecules, including Src and Crk. Therefore, p130Cas may serve as a docking protein that tethers other proteins to a multicomponent complex, and integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas observed here may function to regulate such protein-protein interactions. Recently, FAK has been shown to interact with Src, Grb2, C-terminal Src kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in an adhesion and/or tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner(15Cobb B.S.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, ligand binding of integrins seems to regulate multiple putative docking proteins that connect to downstream signaling pathways. Cortactin is an 80/85-kDa SH3-domain containing protein, that becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine in v-src-transformed cells and in cells stimulated with certain growth factors(26Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 27Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Cortactin binds to F-actin and is enriched in cortical cell structures such as lamellipodia(27Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that cortactin may be important for microfilament-membrane interactions and that it may also transduce signals from the cell surface to the cytoskeleton(27Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Thus, one possibility is that the integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin observed here may play a role in actin remodeling during cell adhesion to ECM substrata. Previous results, however, indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin does not influence F-actin binding(27Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). It is also possible that, similar to paxillin, FAK and p130Cas, phosphorylation of cortactin may promote the binding of cortactin to cellular proteins containing SH2 domains, allowing cortactin to contribute to the assembly of signaling molecule complexes. Our finding that p130Cas and cortactin become tyrosine-phosphorylated following cell adhesion to ECM substrates, but not to polylysine, is consistent with the tyrosine phosphorylation being mediated by integrins. This is further supported by the observation that cell adhesion to two different anti-integrin antibodies also results in elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin. These findings also suggest that ligand binding to different integrins can activate the same tyrosine kinase(s) (the one(s) responsible for phosphorylating p130Cas and cortactin). In addition to REF and NIH 3T3 cells, we have also analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin in human 293 embryonic kidney carcinoma cell line, and in mouse embryonic and Rat-1 fibroblasts (not shown). Elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in response to cell adhesion was seen in each of the cell lines we have tested so far. However, we have not been able to detect elevated tyrosine phosphorylation levels of cortactin in some of the cell lines tested, including chick embryo fibroblasts and human skin fibroblasts. Whether this truly reflects cell type specificity, or whether there are changes that are below detection limits of our antibodies is not known. We found that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin coincides with tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. It has been reported that paxillin and FAK become coordinately phosphorylated on tyrosine during cell spreading on fibronectin(12Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar), and that paxillin is a substrate for FAK kinase activity in vitro and in vivo(36Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

It remains to be seen whether tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin requires integrin-mediated FAK activation, or whether it is a result of a separate, integrin-activated, but FAK-independent kinase pathway. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and cortactin requires the presence of intact cytoskeleton, since the adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins can be prevented by cytochalasin D treatment. A similar situation has been observed with FAK and tensin(24Bockholt S.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 468: 14565-14567Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Because no direct association between integrins and kinases has been observed, it is possible that kinases associate with integrins through interactions with cytoskeletal complexes induced by the cross-linking of integrins(9Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). Thus, intact, functional cytoskeleton may be required to bring together the various components of this signaling complex, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. While this work was in progress, Petch et al.(46Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported on the adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas. They demonstrated that, as in the case of FAK, paxillin, and tensin, p130Cas is also found in focal contacts. The focal contact colocalization of the proteins connected to integrin signaling emphasizes the role of these sites in the signal transduction from the ECM into the cell. It has recently been demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in v-src-transformed cells is independent of cell adhesion (18Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar), and we show here that this is also the case with p130Cas and cortactin. Based on the apparent correlation between cellular transformation and elevated levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in v-src transformed cells, it is believed that physiologically important Src substrates will be proteins normally involved in the control of cellular proliferation(47Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Op. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Since it seems that a number of v-src substrates are in the integrin signal transduction pathway, it is equally possible that these proteins and integrin signals mediated by them are responsible for anchorage-dependence, which is lost in transformed cells. Identification of protein-protein interactions resulting from integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and characterization of signaling pathways that become activated following these interactions may lead to better understanding of anchorage dependence of growth.

Fyn and Yes, the other members of the Src family present in fibroblasts, were also found to be activated at mitosis. In cells microinjected with a neutralizing antibody specific for Src, Fyn, and Yes (anti-cst.1) during G2, cell division was inhibited by 75 percent. The block occurred before nuclear envelope breakdown. Antibodies specific for phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase α and phospholipase C-γ1 had no effect. Microinjection of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Fyn was also inhibitory. Functional redundancy between members of the Src family was observed; a Src-specific antibody had no effect in NIH 3T3 cells but inhibited cell division in fibroblasts in which the only functional Src family kinase was Src itself. Thus, Src family kinases and proteins associating with their SH2 domains are required for entry into mitosis."

To explore whether PTP1B, a widely expressed, non-receptor-type PTPase, regulates insulin signaling, we used osmotic shock to load rat KRC-7 hepatoma cells with affinity-purified neutralizing antibodies that immunoprecipitate and inactivate the enzymatic activity of recombinant rat PTP1B in vitro. In cells loaded with PTP1B antibody, insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase activity were increased by 42% and 38%, respectively, compared with control cells loaded with preimmune IgG (p < 0.005). In order to characterize the potential site(s) of action of PTP1B in insulin signaling, we also determined that insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation and insulin receptor substrate 1 tyrosine phosphorylation were increased 2.2- and 2.0-fold, respectively, and that insulin-stimulated receptor kinase activity toward an exogenous peptide substrate was increased by 57% in the PTP1B antibody-loaded cells. Osmotic loading did not alter the cellular content of PTP1B protein, suggesting that the antibody acts in the cell by sterically blocking catalytic interactions between PTP1B and its physiological substrates. These studies demonstrate that PTP1B has a role in the negative regulation of insulin signaling and acts, at least in part, directly at the level of the insulin receptor.

INTRODUCTIONAs recent studies have made great advances in our understanding of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation in the cellular insulin action pathway, interest has also grown in the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) 1The abbreviations used are: PTPaseprotein-tyrosine phosphataseDMEMDulbecco's minimal essential mediumIRS-1insulin receptor substrate 1LARleukocyte common antigen-related. in balancing the steady-state level of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins involved in insulin signal transduction(1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Goldstein B.J. Receptor. 1993; 3: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). PTPases can potentially impact on insulin signaling at several levels, including dephosphorylation of the active (autophosphorylated) form of the insulin receptor, which attenuates the receptor kinase activity, and dephosphorylation of the protein-tyrosine residues of insulin receptor substrates such as IRS-1, IRS-2, and Shc, which will modulate postreceptor pathways of insulin action(3Goldstein B.J. LeRoith D. Olefsky J.M. Taylor S.I. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. Lippincott, Philadelphia1995Google Scholar).The PTPases constitute a large superfamily of transmembrane (receptor-type) and intracellular (non-receptor-type) enzymes involved in a variety of regulatory processes(4Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 5Goldstein B.J. Sheterline P. Phospho-protein Phosphatases 1: Tyrosine Phosphatases, Protein Profile. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar). Recent studies exploring the role of individual PTPases in cellular regulation have demonstrated that their effects may be complex, and various PTPase homologs may have positive or negative effects on cell activation, cell growth, or differentiation. For example, CD45, which activates the p56Lck tyrosine kinase by dephosphorylation of a specific phosphotyrosine residue (6Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) and the PTPase Cdc25, which initiates the induction of mitosis by the tyrosine dephosphorylation and activation of p34Cdc2 (7Millar J.B. Russell P. Cell. 1992; 68: 407-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These findings have enhanced our view of the cellular roles of PTPases, in considering not only the identification of PTPases that might impact on various signaling pathways, but also whether the influence of their PTPase activity is stimulatory or inhibitory.Since multiple PTPase enzymes are expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues, there is a need to establish the significance and physiological role of individual PTPases in liver, fat, and muscle tissue. For the insulin signaling pathway, only a few PTPases have been shown to affect insulin action at the receptor or post-receptor sites. In hepatoma cells, using expression of an antisense RNA construct, we have recently demonstrated that the transmembrane PTPase LAR has a negative regulatory effect on insulin receptor autophosphorylation and receptor kinase activity(8Kulas D.T. Zhang W.R. Goldstein B.J. Furlanetto R.W. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2435-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain containing PTPase, SH-PTP2, or Syp, has also been shown by several groups to have a positive effect on post-receptor insulin signaling, although the mechanism and site of interaction with the insulin action pathway has not been identified(9Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T. Maegawa H. Burke Jr., T.R. Roller P.P. Shoelson S.E. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21244-21248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).PTP1B is a particularly important candidate for involvement in insulin signaling since it is an abundant intracellular PTPase that is widely expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues(2Goldstein B.J. Receptor. 1993; 3: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). As the first PTPase to be purified to homogeneity and characterized biochemically, early studies of PTP1B demonstrated that it was able to efficiently dephosphorylate the insulin receptor in vitro(13Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6731-6737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hashimoto N. Zhang W.R. Goldstein B.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, microinjection of a truncated form of PTP1B from human placenta into Xenopus oocytes diminished insulin-stimulated oocyte maturation and S6 peptide phosphorylation(15Tonks N.K. Cicirelli M.F. Diltz C.D. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Cicirelli M.F. Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Weiel J.E. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5514-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the present work, we used an osmotic loading technique to inhibit PTP1B activity in situ with a neutralizing antibody in order to explore its potential role in the regulation of insulin signaling in hepatoma cells. The results demonstrate that PTP1B has an essential role in the negative regulation of insulin signaling and acts by balancing insulin-stimulated kinase activity at the level of the receptor as well as influencing distal components of the insulin action cascade.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsA well-differentiated subline of the H4-EII-C3 rat hepatoma cell line (KRC-7) was kindly provided by Dr. John Koontz (University of Tennessee)(17Koontz J.W. Iwahashi M. Science. 1981; 211: 947-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Prestained molecular size markers were from Bio-Rad. Other materials were obtained as indicated and were of the highest grade available.Osmotic Loading of PTP1B AntibodiesAntiserum to PTP1B was developed by coupling a peptide antigen corresponding to amino acids 42-56 of the rat PTP1B sequence (18Guan K.L. Haun R.S. Watson S.J. Geahlen R.L. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injecting the conjugate subcutaneously into rabbits(19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). After several cycles of boosting, antibody reactive toward PTP1B was immunopurified by adsorption and elution from an affinity column of recombinant full-length rat PTP1B (14Hashimoto N. Zhang W.R. Goldstein B.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad)(19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar).Intracellular loading of PTP1B antibodies or control preimmune rabbit IgG was achieved by promoting uptake of extracellular proteins by incubation in a hypertonic medium, followed by lysis of cytoplasmic pinosomes in a hypotonic solution by the method of Okada and Rechsteiner(20Okada C.Y. Rechsteiner M. Cell. 1982; 29: 33-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent KRC-7 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 10 min in a hypertonic medium containing 0.5 M sucrose, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1000, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and PTP1B antibody or pre-immune rabbit IgG (30 μg/ml) in DMEM buffered with 25 mM HEPES, pH 6.8. The cells were then rapidly rinsed with a hypotonic solution of diluted DMEM:water (6:4) buffered with 25 mM HEPES, pH 6.8, and incubated in the hypotonic medium for 2 min. After rinsing 3 times with normal culture medium, the cells were allowed to recover for 6 h before the assays were performed. Viability of the hepatoma cells was demonstrated by exclusion of 0.4% (w/v) trypan blue dye (Sigma).Immunoblot Analysis of PTP1B Abundance and Insulin-stimulated Protein-tyrosine PhosphorylationAfter recovery from osmotic loading, hepatoma cells were stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 1 min, and the cells were lysed into a buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, with 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 unit/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin at 4°C. The homogenate was cleared by microcentrifugation, and 60 μg of cell lysate protein was fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) in a minigel apparatus (Bio-Rad). In some experiments, cell lysate proteins were then immunoprecipitated wih PTP1B antibody with and without the addition of goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and Trisacryl-Protein A (Pierce), prior to fractionation by gel electrophoresis. For the visualization of insulin receptor and IRS-1 phosphorylation, 7.5% polyacrylamide gels were used.After gel separation, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (0.45-μ pore size) at 100 V for 3 h in buffer containing 20% (v/v) methanol, 25 mM Tris base and 192 mM glycine at pH 8.3. Nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated in blocking buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1% (w/v) ovalbumin, 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide, and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature with rocking. Fresh blocking solution was then applied containing 1.0 μg/ml affinity-purified PTP1B antibody or 1.1 μg/ml anti-Tyr(P) antibodies (22Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with rocking for 2 h. Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min in blotting buffer without antibodies, followed by incubation with 2 μCi of 125I-Protein A (30 mCi/mg) (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Irvine, CA) for 1 h at room temperature followed by 3 additional 10-min washes with blotting buffer. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by direct PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Protein was assayed by the method of Bradford(23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).Insulin Stimulation of DNA SynthesisHepatoma cells were grown to 50-60% confluence and made quiescent by incubation for 48 h in DMEM containing 0.1% (w/v) insulin-free bovine serum albumin. The cells were then loaded with PTP1B antibody or control IgG, allowed to recover for 6 h, and the medium was exchanged for DMEM with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin with or without 100 nM insulin for 1 h. DNA synthesis was then measured by the addition of [3H]thymidine (98 Ci/mmol; Amersham) to 1 μCi/ml for a 1-h incubation(24Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7342-7346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed 3 times with DMEM, 5% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid was added, and the cells were maintained in trichloroacetic acid overnight at 4°C. Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was then recovered by dissolving in 1 M NaOH, neutralizing with 1 M HCl, and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting.Insulin-stimulated Phosphatidylinositol 3′-Kinase ActivityIn vitro phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol was performed in immune complexes as described (25White M.F. Backer J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After recovery from osmotic loading, hepatoma cells were treated with 100 nM insulin for 5 min, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and twice with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and 100 μM Na3VO4, before solubilization in the final wash buffer also containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody overnight at 4°C. Immune complexes were precipitated from the supernatant with Protein A-coupled Trisacryl (Pierce), washed, and resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. After adding 10 μl of 100 mM MnCl2 and 10 μl of 2 μg/μl phosphatidylinositol (sonicated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM EGTA), the phosphorylation reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of 440 μM ATP containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and continued for 10 min at 22°C. The reaction was stopped with 20 μl of 8 N HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3:methanol (1:1), the samples were centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was applied to a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate coated with potassium oxalate. The plates were developed in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and assayed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics).Insulin Receptor Tyrosine Kinase ActivityOsmotically loaded hepatoma cells were stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 5 min and lysed into 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.01% (w/v) aprotinin, and 30 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4°C. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was passed through a wheat germ agglutinin affinity column to partially purify the insulin receptors(26Kasuga M. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Receptor kinase activity was assayed using 100 μl (50 μg of protein) of the affinity column eluate by incubating with [γ-32P]ATP (500 μM, 2 μCi) in the presence of 2.5 mg/ml poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM MgCl2 and 2.5 mM MnCl2(27Grunberger G. Zick Y. Roth J. Gorden P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). After 20 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 3 ml of 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin as carrier. The precipitated proteins were washed in trichloroacetic acid and dissolved in 1 ml of 1 N NaOH, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Tyrosine kinase activity was expressed as picomoles of 32P incorporated per mg of poly(Glu:Tyr) per min per mg of protein.Statistical AnalysisQuantitative data were calculated from the mean ± S.E. for a minimum of 4 separate determinations. Statistical calculations were based on analysis of variance for comparison of more than two groups with Bonferroni's correction for determination of significance. Student's t test was used for comparing two samples.RESULTSPurification and Characterization of PTP1B AntibodiesAnti-peptide PTP1B antibodies were affinity-purified over a column of recombinant rat PTP1B and tested for their reaction specificity with a lysate of KRC-7 cell proteins (Fig. 1). Immunoprecipitation of lysate proteins with the PTP1B antibodies followed by Western blotting of the immunoisolated proteins with the same antibody revealed a single band with an Mr of approximately 50,000, as we have demonstrated for the full-length PTP1B protein expressed in rat tissues(28Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E932-E940PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity-purified antibodies were also able to immunoprecipitate recombinant PTP1B expressed in Escherichia coli. The interaction of the antibody with the enzyme substrate also proved it to be neutralizing in that it completely abolished the in vitro activity of the PTP1B enzyme (data not shown).Cell Viability and Uptake of PTP1B Antibodies following Osmotic LoadingAs assessed by exclusion of trypan blue dye, 70-75% of the cells remained viable following the osmotic loading of either PTP1B antibody or preimmune IgG. Furthermore, the ability of the antibody-loaded cells to perform a variety of metabolic functions including macromolecule synthesis and phosphorylation reactions requiring ATP attests to their viability after the osmotic shock (see below).In order to demonstrate that the PTP1B antibody was taken up by the KRC-7 cells after osmotic loading and was associated with cellular PTP1B protein, cell lysate samples were precipitated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG second antibody and Trisacryl-Protein A and subjected to immunoblotting with the PTP1B antibody (Fig. 2). The second antibody was able to immunoprecipitate the loaded PTP1B antibody still complexed to the enzyme from its intracellular localization only in the cells osmotically loaded with the PTP1B antibody. Since PTP1B was not immunoprecipitated from the cells loaded with the preimmune IgG, the interaction between the loaded antibody and cellular PTP1B protein is shown to be specific and of high affinity and sufficient duration to continue to be present well after the 6-h recovery period.Figure 2:Demonstration of PTP1B antibody uptake by the hepatoma cells after osmotic loading and recovery. Hepatoma cells were loaded with PTP1B antibody (lanes 5-7) or preimmune IgG (lanes 2-4) and allowed to recover. Aliquots of cell lysates (60 μg of protein) were then incubated with Trisacryl-Protein A alone (lanes 2 and 5) or Trisacryl-Protein A and goat anti-rabbit IgG (lanes 3-4 and 6-7). The immunoprecipitated proteins bound to the Trisacryl beads were washed and subjected to gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with the PTP1B antibody. Lane 1 represents control cells not loaded with antibody, from which a 60-μg protein lysate was immunoprecipitated with PTP1B antibody along with Trisacryl-Protein A and the second antibody to quantitate the total amount of PTP1B present in comparison with the PTP1B antibody or IgG-loaded cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Of the total mass of PTP1B in the KRC-7 cells directly precipitated with PTP1B antibody, 70% of the loaded PTP1B antibody-PTP1B enzyme complex is immunoprecipitable with the second antibody and Protein A (Fig. 2). When total protein lysates from the osmotically loaded cells were directly immunoprecipitated with PTP1B antibody and immunoblotted, there was an apparent decrease of 35-40% in amount of immunoprecipitable PTP1B in the cells loaded with the PTP1B antibody (Fig. 1). In order to determine whether the PTP1B antibody loading affected the cellular content of PTP1B, immunoblotting was also performed with aliquots of total cell protein from the loaded cells that were fractionated on gels without prior immunoprecipitation. The content of PTP1B protein in the cells loaded with PTP1B antibody was not decreased, but on average was 10-15% higher than the PTP1B content of the control cells (Fig. 3). Thus, the inability to immunoprecipitate a portion of the PTP1B mass from the cells loaded with PTP1B antibody results from occupancy of PTP1B epitopes by the neutralizing antibody which remains associated with the PTP1B protein in the cells.Figure 3:Quantitation of PTP1B mass in hepatoma cells loaded with PTP1B antibody or rabbit IgG. Hepatoma cells were loaded with PTP1B antibody (lanes 4-6) or preimmune IgG (lanes 1-3) and allowed to recover. Replicate samples of cell lysate protein (60 μg of protein) were then fractionated on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblotting with PTP1B antibody was performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of PTP1B Antibody Loading on Cellular Insulin SignalingThymidine IncorporationAs an effect of insulin on cell growth and mitogenesis, the incorporation of thymidine into DNA was studied in the antibody-loaded KRC-7 cells. In the control cells, thymidine incorporation was stimulated 2.4-fold by 100 nM insulin in serum-free medium (Fig. 4). In the cells loaded with PTP1B antibody, insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation was increased by 42% compared to the control cells (p = 0.002). No significant change in the basal level of thymidine incorporation was observed.Figure 4:Effect of PTP1B antibody loading in hepatoma cells on insulin stimulation of DNA synthesis. Hepatoma cells were loaded with PTP1B antibody or control IgG, allowed to recover for 6 h, and the cells were treated with or without 100 nM insulin for 1 h. DNA synthesis was then measured by adding [3H]thymidine for an additional 1-h incubation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells in individual 35-mm sample wells were washed, and the incorporation of 3H into trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-insoluble material was determined by scintillation counting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activation of Phosphatidylinositol 3′-Kinase ActivityAs a more proximal effect of insulin action, the activated insulin receptor kinase phosphorylates its major intracellular substrate, IRS-1, which in turn promotes the association of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase with IRS-1 and stimulates its enzyme activity(1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After loading of preimmune IgG or PTP1B antibodies, there was no effect on the level of basal phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, which was undetectable in the absence of insulin stimulation (Fig. 5). However, following stimulation of quiescent cells with 100 nM insulin, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase activity was significantly increased by 38% in the PTP1B antibody-loaded cells compared to control (p = 0.0038).Figure 5:Effect of PTP1B antibody loading in hepatoma cells on insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase activity. Hepatoma cells were loaded with PTP1B antibody or control IgG, allowed to recover for 6 h, and the cells were treated with or without 100 nM insulin for 5 min. In vitro phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol was performed in anti-phosphotyrosine immune complexes of the hepatoma cell lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Insulin-stimulated Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Its Receptor and IRS-1In order to determine whether cellular PTP1B directly affects the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, which might initiate its negative influence on post-receptor pathways, we examined insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation, activation of the receptor kinase activity toward an exogenous substrate, and phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the antibody-loaded cells. After osmotic loading, cells were treated with insulin for 1 min, and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies was performed to visualize the protein phosphotyrosine content of the 95-kDa insulin receptor β-subunit and the 180-185-kDa IRS-1 protein. As shown in Fig. 6, addition of insulin rapidly increased the phosphorylation of its receptor and activated the receptor kinase activity, as evidenced by a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Compared to cells loaded with the preimmune IgG, osmotic loading of PTP1B antibodies prior to insulin stimulation resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in insulin receptor phosphorylation (p = 0.02) along with a commensurate 2.0-fold increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation (p = 0.006). No alteration in the basal level of insulin receptor or IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed.Figure 6:Insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation and IRS-1 phosphorylation in hepatoma cells after osmotic loading of control IgG (lanes 1-3) or PTP1B antibody (lanes 4-6). After recovery from osmotic antibody loading, control KRC-7 hepatoma cells without insulin treatment (lanes 1 and 4) and cells treated with 100 nM insulin for 1 min (duplicate samples in lanes 2-3 and 5-6) were extracted into cell lysis buffer, and aliquots of cell protein were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The migration position of IRS-1 (180 kDa) and the insulin receptor β-subunit (95 kDa) is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Insulin-stimulated Receptor Kinase ActivityTo directly assess whether inhibition of cellular PTP1B activity affected the activation of the insulin receptor kinase enzyme, the receptor kinase activity was determined by measuring the phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate, poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1). As shown in Fig. 7, the basal tyrosine kinase activity was slightly higher in the cells loaded with the PTP1B antibody compared to preimmune IgG (34.9 ± 0.8 pmol/mg poly(Glu:Tyr)/min/mg of protein) and PTP1B antibody (42.0 ± 3.2 pmol/mg poly(Glu:Tyr)/min/mg of protein), but the difference was not statistically significant. After insulin stimulation, however, the receptor tyrosine kinase activity was significantly elevated in the PTP1B antibody-loaded cells, 57% higher than the insulin-stimulated kinase activity in the cells loaded with preimmune IgG (p = 0.0006). These results demonstrate that inhibition of PTP1B activity in situ has a direct effect on the activity of the insulin receptor kinase, which is translated into further activation of downstream pathways of insulin signal transduction.Figure 7:Insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of insulin receptors isolated from hepatoma cells osmoti"

Pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with the immunosuppressant rapamycin blocks phosphorylation of four of these sites (Thr229, Thr389, Ser404, and Ser411), whereas phosphorylation proceeds in the remaining three sites (Ser418, Thr421, and Ser424). If rapamycin is added post-serum stimulation, the pattern of phosphorylation is qualitatively similar except that Ser411 is still highly phosphorylated. The inhibitory effect of rapamycin on serum-induced p70s6k activation and the phosphorylation of Thr229, Thr389, Ser404, and Ser411 is rescued by FK506, providing further evidence that the inhibitory effect is exerted through a complex of rapamycin-FKBP12. Wortmannin treatment pre- or post-serum stimulation inhibits phosphorylation of the same set of sites as rapamycin, supporting the argument that both agents act on the same pathway. Likewise, methylxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitors block p70s6k activation and phosphorylation of the same set of sites as wortmannin and rapamycin. However, other agents that raise intracellular cAMP levels have no inhibitory effect, leading to the hypothesis that the inhibitory actions of methylxanthines on p70s6k activity are not through activating protein kinase A but through inhibition of an upstream kinase. Together the results indicate that there are two kinase signaling pathways that must converge to activate p70s6k and that only one of these pathways is sensitive to rapamycin, wortmannin, and methylxanthine inhibition.

In the present study we evaluate the expression and function of PSGL-1 in P-selectin binding to cells of lymphocytic lineage, including T- and B-lymphocytic tumor cell lines, resting peripheral blood T and B cells and stimulated peripheral blood T cell, and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) lines. Our studies show that although the vast majority of lymphocytes express cell surface PSGL-1, they display considerable variability in P-selectin binding; only stimulated peripheral blood T cell and IEL lines show significant binding to P-selectin. The studies reported here further establish that PSGL-1 is the predominant counter-receptor for P-selectin on stimulated T-lymphocytic lines. We hypothesize that PSGL-1 undergoes cell activation-associated post-translational modifications which enable high affinity binding to P-selectin. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe that the activities of certain glycosyltransferases are significantly higher in stimulated T cells than in resting T lymphocytes. The tumor cell lines MOLT-4 (CRL 1582), CEM (TIB 195), THP-1 (TIB 202), HUT 78 (TIB 161), U-937 (CRL 1593), WIL2-NS (CRL 8155), Ramos (CRL 1596), HL-60 (CCL 240), and CCRF-SB (CCL 120) were obtained from the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma).

For the present study, both the T cell and IEL lines were stimulated bi-weekly with fresh irradiated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from either whole blood or from a leukopak, 1 μg/ml purified phytohemagglutinin (Murex Diagnostics, Dartford, United Kingdom), 10 units/ml interleukin 2 (IL-2), and 10 units/ml interleukin 4 (IL-4) in 10% human AB+ serum (BioCell, Rancho Domingo, CA) in RPMI and subsequently fed with IL-2 and IL-4. Cells were analyzed for PSGL-1 expression and P-selectin binding near the end of the proliferative phase of the stimulation cycle. Cell viability was assessed prior to analyses by Trypan Blue (Sigma) exclusion and found to be routinely >95%. PBMC were isolated from heparinized blood of normal donors by centrifugation over a Ficoll/Hypaque (Sigma) density gradient. B cells were enriched by adherence (22Julius M.H. Simpson E.

Short term (7 day) cultures of freshly isolated PBMC were maintained with 10 units/ml of IL-2 and with 0.1% phytohemagglutinin for the first 48 h.

P-selectin binding was detected by incubating cells for 30 min on ice with 4 μg Lecγ1 pre-complexed with protein A-FITC (Zymed, San Francisco, CA) in a 2:1 molar ratio. Parallel samples were incubated with protein A-FITC complexes of huIgG1 at the same molar ratio. All stained cells were fixed in Hanks' balanced salts solution (HBSS) containing 1% formalin and analyzed by FACS. Prior to analyses, the viability of cell samples was assessed by Trypan Blue (Sigma) exclusion. During FACS analysis, dead cells and debris were excluded by appropriate scatter gates. Adhesion assays were performed as described previously (17Larsen G.R. Sako D. Ahern T.J. Shaffer M. Erban J. Sajer S.A. Gibson R.M. Wagner D.D. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11104-11110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Stable CHO-P-selectin cells were plated in 48-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well 24 h prior to assay. Tumor cells, peripheral blood, or intestinal lymphocytes, labeled with BCECF-am (2′,7′,-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and allowed to bind to CHO-P-selectin cells for 10 min in ice-cold HBSS on a rotating platform. Non-adherent cells were washed away, and adherent cells were quantitated using a microplate fluorometer (model 7620, Cambridge Technology Inc. Watertown, MA). In experiments testing the neutralizing activity of polyclonal antibody Rb3026, fluorescent-labeled cells were preincubated with Rb3026 serum or non-immune serum or with affinity purified Rb3026 on ice for 20-30 min, washed, and then added to adherent CHO-P-selectin cells. The effect of the mocarhagin protease was assessed by incubating fluorescent-labeled cells with 5 μg/ml mocarhagin in HBSS containing 2% fetal calf serum and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 20 min at 37°C. The cells were washed in HBSS and presented to adherent CHO-P-selectin cells as described above. RNA was extracted from tumor cell lines and analyzed on Northern blots as described previously(12Sako D. Chang X.J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J.

Nitrocellulose filters were hybridized under stringent conditions with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe for PSGL-1 comprising nucleotides 60-389(12Sako D. Chang X.J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G.

Filters were subsequently stripped and rehybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe for actin. The peripheral blood T cell and IEL lines were metabolically labeled with 1 mCi of methionine (DuPont NEN) per 2 × 107 cells for 4 h in methionine-free MEM (ICN FLOW), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM PIPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 3 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM MgCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM ethylmaleimide, 2 mM benzamidine, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and lysed by sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at low speed (10 min at 500 × g) to remove the nuclear fraction and then at high speed (1 h at 100,000 × g) to isolate the membrane fraction. The high speed pellet was solubilized in 1% Thesit in lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors for 30-45 min on ice and diluted 1:4 with IP buffer (Tris-buffered saline (TBS) pH 8.0, 5 mg/ml BSA, 2 mM CaCl2). Nonspecific binding proteins and P-selectin binding proteins were precipitated from soluble membrane extracts by sequential incubation (24 h at 4°C) with protein A (PA)-Sepharose beads precomplexed with HuIgG1 and Lecγ1, respectively. The Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation, washed twice with IP buffer, twice with IP buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and twice with TBS. Membrane proteins affinity captured by HuIgG1 and Lecγ1 were eluted from the beads with 5 mM EDTA. These eluates were either precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, or reprecipitated with Rb3026 or preimmune IgG precomplexed with PA-Sepharose, or recalcified and reprecipitated with Lecγ1 precomplexed with PA-Sepharose. Two mutants of PSGL-1 with alterations in the PACE consensus sequence were generated from a previously described construct of soluble PSGL-1(pED.sPSGL-1.T7) (12Sako D. Chang X.J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.A. Larsen G.R.

In one construct, a point mutation was introduced at codon 61, substituting an alanine for an arginine and in the other, the recognition site for enterokinase cleavage (DDDDK) was substituted for the PACE cleavage site RDRR. The constructs were validated by DNA sequencing. Cell lysates were prepared from resting peripheral blood T cells and from the stimulated peripheral blood T cell and IEL lines as follows. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 25% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (150 μl/107 cells) on ice for 15 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were stored at −80°C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein assay (Pierce). The α(1,3)-fucosyltransferase assay was performed essentially as described previously(26Potvin B. Kumar R. Howard D.R. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1615-1622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, in a 50-μl reaction volume 30-100 μg of cell lysate protein was incubated with 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mM MnCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 2 nmol of GDP-[14C]fucose (20,000 counts/min/nmol; Sigma) and 1 μmol of the acceptor substrate LacNAc (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold water, applied to a 1-ml column of Dowex 1X4 (Cl-form, Bio-Rad). The radiolabeled product was eluted with 3 ml of water and counted in a scintillation counter. The Core 2 transferase assay was performed as described by Higgins et al.(27Higgins E.A. Siminovitch K.A. Zhuang D. Brockhausen I. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6280-6290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, in a 50-μl reaction volume 30-100 μg of cell lysate protein was incubated in 50 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.7, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, 0.1 M GlcNAc, 10 nmol UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (20,000 counts/min/nmol) and 2 mM βD Gal(1-3) αD-GalNAc-P-nitrophenol (Sigma) as a substrate for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold water and applied to a C18 Sep-pak column (Water-Millipore). The column was washed with 5% acetonitrile and the product eluted with 20% acetonitrile and counted in a scintillation counter. All assays were carried out in duplicate. Control reactions carried no substrate, and specific activity was determined as pmol/min/mg. The expression of PSGL-1 transcripts by lymphocytic cell lines was examined by Northern blot analysis. The 2.5-kilobase PSGL-1 transcript previously detected in myeloid cell lines (HL-60, U-937, and THP-1) (12Sako D. Chang X.J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) is expressed in cells of T-lymphocytic (CEM, MOLT-4, and HUT 78) and B-lymphocytic (Ramos, SB) lineage. A third B cell line WIL2-NS expressed detectable but much lower levels of this 2.5-kilobase transcript, while a human hepatoma line HepG2 did not express detectable PSGL-1 mRNA (Fig. 1). Cell surface expression of PSGL-1 in lymphoid cell lines was assessed using PSL-275, a monoclonal anti-PSGL-1 antibody that was raised against a 15 amino acid peptide of PSGL-1 (Fig. SI). This peptide juxtaposes a PACE cleavage site, defined by the consensus sequence RXRR (19Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1992; 3: 560-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that soluble PSGL-1 (WT) expressed in COS cells could be immunoprecipitated by PSL-275. However, when PACE processing of recombinant PSGL-1 was prevented by either disrupting the consensus sequence with a point mutation (R61) or substituting RDRR with the consensus sequence for enterokinase cleavage (EK), PSL-275 was unable to bind PSGL-1. In contrast, a polyclonal anti-PSGL-1 antibody Rb3026 was able to immunoprecipitate both the wild type and mutant forms of PSGL-1. These data thus show the specificity of PSL-275 for PACE processed PSGL-1. Flow cytometric analysis of PSL-275 binding by lymphocytic cell lines revealed that greater than 90% of T-lymphocytic cells bound PSL-275 although the mean fluorescence intensities varied among the different T cell lines; CEM and MOLT-4 cells were comparable to myeloid cells while HUT 78 was approximately half a log-fold brighter (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the B-lymphocytic cell lines did not appreciably bind PSL-275. Given the specificity of this monoclonal antibody for PACE-cleaved PSGL-1, we speculated that the inability of the B cell lines to bind PSL-275 was due to expression of unprocessed PSGL-1. Indeed, following overnight co-culture of B cell lines with PACE-secreting CHO cells (CHO-PACE SOL; 20), greater than 95% of SB and Ramos bound PSL-275 (Fig. 2C) in amounts comparable to myeloid cells (Fig. 2B), while simultaneous co-culture with the parental cell line CHO-DUKX had no effect on PSL-275 binding. In contrast to Ramos and SB, co-culture of WIL2-NS with CHO-PACE SOL cells only minimally affected PSL-275 binding (Fig. 2C). However, low cell surface expression of PSGL-1 on WIL2-NS is consistent with the low level of PSGL-1 mRNA expressed in this cell line (Fig. 1). The T cell line CEM, which constitutively expresses PSL-275-reactive PSGL-1, was not affected by co-culture with CHO-PACE SOL cells (data not shown). The observation that the majority of lymphoid cell lines constitutively express cell surface PSGL-1 led us to assess the P-selectin binding capacity of these cells. Binding activity of each cell line was measured using both flow cytometry and a cell adhesion assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” FACS analysis revealed that the T cell lines CEM and MOLT-4 bound very low levels of Lecγ1 (soluble P-selectin-IgG chimera), whereas Lecγ1 binding by HUT 78 cells was heterogeneous (Fig. 3A). Lecγ1 was not bound appreciably by B-lymphocytic cell lines (Fig. 3A) even after co-culture with CHO-PACE SOL cells (data not shown). The adherence of lymphocytic tumor cell lines to CHO cells expressing P-selectin corroborated the flow cytometry data (Fig. 3B). Among the lymphocytic cell lines, HUT 78 displayed the most adherence to CHO-P-selectin cells reflecting perhaps the minor population of HUT 78 cells, identified by flow cytometric analysis, that bind higher levels of Lecγ1 (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, all interactions between HUT 78 and P-selectin were much less pronounced than those between myeloid cells and P-selectin even though HUT 78 cells express more PSGL-1 protein (Fig. 2B). Therefore, despite the apparently adequate expression of cell surface PSGL-1, the majority of lymphocytic tumor cell lines display insignificant P-selectin binding activity relative to myeloid cells. Cell surface expression of PSGL-1 protein and P-selectin binding by resting peripheral blood T and B lymphocytes were subsequently examined. Dual parameter flow cytometric analysis of PBMC revealed that PSGL-1 expression on resting p"

Inhibition of Fas-induced cell death by the bcl-2 oncogene has been demonstrated to be only partial. In light of a growing body of evidence for the Abl kinase as a negative regulator of cell death, we sought to determine whether Abl expression could protect against Fas-mediated cell death. To address this question, we utilized two separate strategies. In the first, we expressed human Fas in K562, a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, which constitutively expresses bcr-abl and examined the effects of Fas ligation in these cells. Fas-positive K562 transformants (K562.Fas) were found to be protected against Fas-mediated cell death. However, down-regulation of Bcr-Abl protein levels in K562.Fas cells using antisense oligonucleotides targeted to bcr-abl mRNA rendered these cells highly susceptible to Fas-induced death. In the second approach we utilized a Fas-positive HL-60 cell line, which we transfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Abl. HL-60.v-Ablts transfectants were found to be protected from Fas-induced apoptosis at the permissive but not the restrictive temperature for the Abl kinase. Taken together, these observations identify the Abl kinase as a negative regulator of Fas-mediated cell death. Since Abl was also found to block apoptosis mediated by ceramide, a recently proposed downstream effector of the apoptotic pathway initiated by Fas, we propose that Abl exerts its protective effects downstream of the early Fas-initiated signaling events.

Peach R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). CD80 and CD86 also share T cell costimulatory properties(9Freeman G.J. Boriello F. Hodes R.J. Reiser H.

Nature. 1993; 366: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). However, some kinetic and molecular properties distinguishing the B7 molecules were observed, implying that these molecules have distinct interactions with CD28 and CTLA-4(18Linsley P.S. Greene J.L. Brady W. Bajorath J. Ledbetter J.A. Peach R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Little is known of the molecular details of the interaction between CD80 and CD86 and their counter-receptors. B7 residues critical for interactions with CTLA-4 and CD28 are currently unknown. We report the results of site-directed mutagenesis of the IgV- and IgC-like domains in CD80Ig and CD86Ig and the effects that deletion of the IgC domain of a recombinant CD80Ig has on CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig binding. We demonstrate that residues in both Ig-like domains are critical for binding CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig. Murine anti-CD86 mAb IT2.2 was purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-CD80 mAbs BB1 (IgM) and 104 were kind gifts from Dr. E. Clark, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, and Dr. J. Banchereau, Schering Plough Corp., Dardilly, France, respectively. BB1 (IgG1, anti-CD80) was purchased from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA). Another anti-CD80 mAb, CD80.3, was prepared in our laboratory. BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously and intraperitonealy with human CD80 mIg (18Linsley P.S. Greene J.L. Brady W. Bajorath J. Ledbetter J.A. Peach R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) (~25 μg/site) in complete adjuvant. Secondary and tertiary booster immunizations were administered intraperitonealy in incomplete adjuvant. A final immunization in phosphate-buffered saline was performed 3 days before fusion with murine myeloma Ag8.653. The specificity of CD80.3 was established by binding to immobilized CD80Ig fusion protein and CD80-CHO cells. In competition experiments using flow cytometry and enzyme immunoassays CD80.3 did not block CTLA4Ig or CD28Ig binding to CD80. CTLA4 mIg and CD28 mIg were prepared by PCR-amplification of the extracellular domains of human CTLA-4 and CD28 with primers that allowed fragments to be digested with HindIII and BclI and ligated in frame to a mouse Fc IgG2a cDNA fragment (18Linsley P.S. Greene J.L. Brady W. Bajorath J. Ledbetter J.A. Peach R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) encoded in a HindIII/BglII-cut πLN expression vector. CD80Ig and CD86Ig were prepared in transiently transfected COS cells(17Linsley P.S. Brady W. Grosmaire L. Aruffo A. Damle N.K. Ledbetter J.A. J. Exp.

Immunity. 1994; 1: 793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). CD80VIg, a fusion protein lacking the IgC-like domain of CD80, was prepared using the PCR. cDNA encoding the IgV-like domain was amplified using full-length CD80 as template, a forward primer from the expression vector, and a reverse primer, CTCACCCTCGGGATCCTTGACTGATAACGTCAC, encoding a BamHI restriction site and the final six amino acids of exon 3, corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the CD80 V domain(19Selvakumar S. Mohanraj B.K. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. White P.C. Dupont B. Immunogenetics. 1992; 36: 175Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This PCR fragment was digested with HindIII and BamHI and ligated in frame to a human IgG1 genomic DNA fragment (Eγ1, (20Aruffo A. Dietsch M.T. Wan H. Hellstrom K.E. Hellstrom I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) in the CDM8 expression vector. A control CD80Ig fusion protein having the same IgG1 Fc region (CD80Eγ1) was prepared by a similar method, except the reverse primer used ensured that cDNA encoding the complete extracellular region of CD80 was PCR-amplified. In control experiments, CD80Eγ1 fusion protein had identical receptor binding properties to CD80Ig. CD80VIg and CD80Eγ1 were prepared in transiently transfected COS cells, which were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Media from transfected COS cells were used as a source for Ig fusion proteins. CD80Ig and CD86Ig site-directed mutants were prepared by encoding the desired mutation in overlapping oligonucleotide primers and, using appropriate plasmid cDNA as template, generating the mutants by PCR(21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Other flanking PCR primers used for these reactions were designed to allow the final PCR products to be digested with HindIII and XbaI and ligated into HindIII/XbaI-digested CDM8 vector. PCR conditions were as described previously(22Peach R.J. Bajorath J. Brady W. Leytze G. Greene J. Naemura J. Linsley P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Each mutant was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination/extension reaction to confirm that the desired mutation had been inserted and that secondary mutations had not been introduced. Sequenase reagents were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Quantitation of Ig fusion proteins in culture media was performed as described previously(22Peach R.J. Bajorath J. Brady W. Leytze G. Greene J. Naemura J. Linsley P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Triplicate determinations were made, and replicates differed from the mean by <15%. COS cell culture media containing CD80Ig, CD86Ig, or CD80VIg mutants were assayed for their ability to bind CTLA4 mIg coated on microtiter plates at 0.25 μg/ml for 16 h at 4°C, using assay conditions described previously(22Peach R.J. Bajorath J. Brady W. Leytze G. Greene J. Naemura J. Linsley P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Binding of mutants was compared with wild-type CD80Ig or CD86Ig. Experiments were repeated at least twice. A similar immunoassay was used to measure binding of CD80Ig, CD86Ig, and CD80VIg mutants to CD28 mIg coated on microtiter plates at 10 μg/ml. mAb binding to mutant CD80Ig and CD86Ig was assayed by initially coating microtiter plates with 0.5 μg/ml goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs., Inc., West Chester, PA) for 16 h at 4°C. After blocking, mutant Ig fusion proteins were added at 0.2 μg/ml for 1 h at 22°C. Wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 and increasing amounts of mAb added and incubated at 22°C for 1 h. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was added, and then horseradish peroxidase substrate was added and absorbances were measured(22Peach R.J. Bajorath J. Brady W. Leytze G. Greene J. Naemura J. Linsley P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected with cDNA encoding mutant B7Ig fusion proteins, and 48 h later they were incubated in Cys/Met-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with Tran35S-label (100 μCi, ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) for 16 h. Fusion proteins were harvested from culture media using protein A-Sepharose as described previously (23Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar) and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. A three-dimensional model of the CD80 IgC-like domain was generated by homology modeling (24Bajorath J. Stenkamp R. Aruffo A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) on the basis of the crystal structure of the class 1 β2-microglobulin domain using a previously reported sequence alignment(12Bajorath J. Peach R.J. Linsley P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CD80 and CD86 IgV domain residues were selected for mutagenesis based on sequence alignments, mapping of residues to potentially surface accessible positions, and the premise that sequence conservation between molecules, outside IgSF consensus residues, is of functional significance. Due to the lack of sequence-structure compatibility of regions of CD80 and CD86 to currently known three-dimensional IgSF V domain structures, structural homology criteria could not be applied in the selection of all IgV-like domain residues. Fig. 1shows the alignment of B7 family IgV-like and IgC-like domain sequences. Conserved non-IgSF consensus residues of the IgC domain (except Phe-108), selected here for mutagenesis (described in a later section), were predicted to be surface accessible. In addition to sequence conservation, Fig. 1illustrates a tentative assignment of residues to core β-strands of Ig folds. Assignment of framework β-strands was done on the basis of consensus residues of the IgSF V-set(25Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar), I-set(26Harpaz Y. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and C1-set(25Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Putative assignment of IgV β-strands do not necessarily imply close structural similarity (12Bajorath J. Peach R.J. Linsley P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) since the structural core common to known IgSF folds only includes the four central β-strands B, C, E, and F(27Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 24 CD80 V domain and 10 CD86 V domain residues were selected for mutagenesis. CD80 and CD86 mutants are numbered from the mature NH2 terminus of the respective proteins. Site-directed mutants of soluble Ig fusions of CD80 and CD86 were prepared using PCR oligonucleotide primer-directed mutagenesis. The concentration of each mutant Ig fusion protein in serum-free COS cell culture media was determined by an Ig quantitation assay, and the mutant was tested for its ability to bind CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig in enzyme immunoassays. The structural integrity of mutant fusion proteins was assessed by testing their ability to bind mAbs specific for CD80 (BB-1, IgG; BB-1, IgM; 104; CD80.3), or CD86 (IT2.2) in indirect immunoassays. Failure of mAbs to bind suggested that either the mutations directly disrupted the mAb epitope, or that the mutation had compromised the structural integrity of the molecule. All CD80 IgV domain mutants except V39R, V39A, Y53A, and D60A, bound at least one of the anti-CD80 mAbs at levels ~50-100% of wild-type CD80Ig. Asp-60 is charged and is predicted to map to a loop region between putative β-strands D and E (Fig. 1). Thus, global conformational defects caused by mutagenesis of this residue are unlikely. Since Val-39 and Tyr-53 map to a structurally ambiguous region (Fig. 1), it is less clear whether mutation of these residues would affect conformation of the molecule. All CD86 IgV domain mutants except Y59A bound mAb IT2.2. Tyr-59, like the equivalent Tyr-53 in CD80, maps to a structurally ambiguous region, so the effect of its mutation on conformation of the molecule is difficult to assess. All CD80 and CD86 mutants bound anti-human Fc antibodies indicating the presence of this domain. 35S metabolic labeling of transfected COS cells followed by protein A purification from conditioned media and autoradiography of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, showed that all mutant proteins migrated as Mr~ 70,000 proteins (data not shown). The ability of CD80 V domain mutants to bind immobilized CTLA4Ig was determined by indirect immunoassays. Of the 24 CD80 mutants prepared, nine bound to CTLA4Ig similar to wild-type CD80Ig, while 12 disrupted binding (>10-fold loss, Table 1). Mutations that disrupted binding included fully conserved, partially conserved, and nonconserved residues. Five mutations that disrupted CTLA4Ig binding involved completely conserved residues, Q33A, V39R, V39A, Y53A, and D60A (Table 1). Mutation of another fully conserved residue, L40A, had no effect on CTLA4Ig binding. Four other mutations of residues fully conserved only in CD80 family members, R29A, Y31A, W50A, and K86A, disrupted CTLA4Ig binding (Table 1, Fig. 2A). Other mutations that disrupted CTLA4Ig binding included L25A, M38A, and I49A, none of which are fully conserved (Fig. 1). Ile-67 is a putative IgV fold consensus residue(25Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar), and, as to be expected, its mutagenesis also reduced CTLA4Ig binding (Table 1). Mutagenesis of other residues, for example, Asn-19, Lys-37, and Asn-55 had little effect on receptor binding (Table 1, Fig. 2A).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab These results led to two conclusions. First, the large number of mutations that disrupted receptor binding suggested the presence of an extensive contact area between CD80 and CTLA4Ig. Second, seven of the residues have hydrophobic side chains, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions are important determinants of CTLA-4/CD80 binding. This is consistent with the role of the hydrophobic MYPPPY region in CTLA-4/CD28 binding to CD80(22Peach R.J. Bajorath J. Brady W. Leytze G. Greene J. Naemura J. Linsley P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The finding that eight of the residues that disrupt binding of CD80 are completely conserved or conservatively substituted in the B7 family suggested that the equivalent amino acids in CD86 may also be important for receptor binding. We therefore mutated several conserved and nonconserved residues in the CD86 IgV domain and assessed the ability of the mutants to bind immobilized CTLA4Ig by indirect immunoassays. Of the 10 CD86 mutants prepared, three mutations of rigorously conserved residues, Q35A, V41A, and Y59A, and two mutations of conservatively substituted residues, F33A and H91A (Y31A and K86A in CD80, respectively), disrupted CTLA4Ig binding (>10-fold, Table 1). Mutation of L72A also disrupted receptor binding, but this was probably due to disruption of the structural integrity of the molecule since Leu-72 is an Ig fold consensus residue. These results parallel those obtained for the equivalent CD80 mutants and confirm that CD80 and CD86 utilize conserved residues in their IgV domains for CTLA4Ig binding. However, binding of CD80 and CD86 to CTLA4Ig is not completely equivalent. CD80 and CD86 bind their counter-receptors with different kinetics and bind differently to the CTLA4Ig mutant Y100A(18Linsley P.S. Greene J.L. Brady W. Bajorath J. Ledbetter J.A. Peach R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that CD80 and CD86 differ in their interaction with CTLA4Ig. We have identified three mutations in CD86Ig that had different effects than mutation of the equivalent residues in CD80Ig. D66A in CD86Ig resulted in ~30% of wild-type binding, but the equivalent mutation D60A in CD80Ig completely prevented CTLA4Ig binding (Table 1). CD86Ig mutant H56A had wild-type CTLA4Ig binding activity, while mutagenesis of the equivalent residue in CD80Ig, W50A, resulted in >10-fold loss of binding (Table 1). Finally, the CD86Ig mutation G61N bound CTLA4Ig about one-third of wild-type levels, but substitution of the equivalent residue in CD80Ig (N55A) increased receptor binding relative to wild-type CD80Ig (~1.5-fold, Table 1). These molecular differences may contribute to the different binding properties of CTLA4Ig for CD80 and CD86. We addressed whether residues in the IgV domain of CD80 and CD86, identified as important for CTLA4Ig binding, were also important determinants for CD28Ig binding. The ability of mutants to bind immobilized CD28Ig was assessed by indirect immunoassays. Despite some quantitative differences, mutations that affected CTLA4Ig binding generally had an equivalent effect on CD28Ig binding (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). The results suggest that an overlapping set of residues on CD80 and CD86 determine the binding to both CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig. CD80 residues whose mutagenesis affected CTLA4Ig/CD28Ig binding were mapped on a schematic representation of an IgV fold. The resolution of this schematic is limited by the lack of structural data on the CD80 IgV-like domain (12Bajorath J. Peach R.J. Linsley P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutations that disrupted binding clustered in two groups (Fig. 3). The first group maps to loops at the amino-terminal end of the domain and included Leu-25 and Asn-63, and the charged amino acids Arg-29, Asp-60, and Lys-86. The second group includes Gln-33 and the hydrophobic/aromatic residues Tyr-31, Met-38, Val-39, Met-47, Ile-49, Trp-50, and Tyr-53. These amino acids are located on β-strand C and in the structurally ambiguous region between β-strands C and D. The overall picture suggests that receptor interactions are most likely centered on the GFCC′C″ face of the IgV domain including amino-terminal loop residues. We did not perform extensive mutagenesis of residues on the opposite BED face as most of the conserved amino acids predicted to lie on this face are IgSF consensus residues (Fig. 1). However, mutagenesis of residues that map to the margins of the BED face, N19A, N55A, and L65A, did not destroy receptor binding. Asn-19 and Asn-55 are potential N-linked glycosylation sites as is Asn-64. Since these residues map within the margins of the BED β-sheet face (Fig. 3), attachment of carbohydrate moieties is unlikely to influence receptor binding to the opposite GFCC′C″ face. The GFCC′C″β-sheet face of IgV domains mediate interactions between other IgSF members(28Arulanandam A.R.N. Withka J.M. Wyss D.F. Wagner G. Kister A. Pallai P. Recny M.A. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11613Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Arulanandam A.R.N. Kister A. McGregor M.J. Wyss D.F. Wagner G. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A previous study identified a murine CD80 splice variant, lacking the entire membrane proximal IgC domain, that had altered receptor binding characteristics(30Inobe M. Linsley P.S. Ledbetter J.A. Nagai Y. Tamakoshi M. Uede T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 443Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further assess a potential role for the IgC domain in receptor binding, a human CD80Ig fusion protein lacking this region was prepared using PCR. The CD80 deletion mutant (CD80VIg), harvested from transfected COS cell culture media, migrated under reducing conditions on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a Mr~50,000 compared with the ~70,000 seen for CD80Ig. CD80-specific mAbs all showed greatly reduced binding to CD80VIg, indicating that the presence of the IgC domain was essential to maintain intact mAb epitopes. However, CD80VIg bound CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig with ~2 and ~6% activity relative to wild-type CD80Ig, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table 1). Thus, the presence of the IgC domain of CD80 was necessary for full receptor binding. To assess a potential role for specific amino acids in the IgC domain of CD80Ig in receptor binding, nine highly conserved residues were mutated to alanine (Fig. 1). Eight of these were predicted to be surface accessible(12Bajorath J. Peach R.J. Linsley P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Anti-human Fc antibodies bound to each mutant fusion protein, while CD80-specific mAbs bound to six of nine mutants, the exceptions being F108A, P111A, and I113A. Lack of mAb binding to the F108A mutant probably indicates that this residue contributes to the hydrophobicity of the core of the C domain, since its side chain is predicted to be buried. Pro-111 and Ile-113 are predicted to map to surface accessible positions, suggesting that their mutagenesis may have directly affected the epitopes recognized by each of the anti-CD80 mAbs tested. Mutagenesis of hydrophobic residues, Phe-108, Pro-111, and Ile-113 abolished CTLA4Ig binding, while Q157A, D158A, E162A, and L163 bound to CTLA4Ig at ~6-35% relative to wild-type CD80Ig (Fig. 5A and Table 1). Mutagenesis of Ser-156 and Ser-167 resulted in ~2-3-fold increased binding to CTLA4Ig. Perhaps increased hydrophobicity of this region because of the serine to alanine mutation enhanced receptor binding. The effects of mutagenesis on CD28Ig binding were more dramatic. All mutations, except S156A and S167A, significantly reduced or completely abolished CD28Ig binding (Fig. 5B and Table 1). While deletion of the CD80 IgC domain had a greater effect on binding to CTLA4Ig than CD28Ig, point mutagenesis of residues in the IgC domain had the opposite effect. Thus, some conserved residues in the IgC domain of CD80Ig play an important role in CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig binding. CD80 IgC domain mutants affecting ligand binding were mapped on a three-dimensional model (Fig. 6). Predictions based on this model establish that Gln-157, Asp-158, Glu-162, and Leu-163 spatially cluster in surface accessible positions near the amino-terminal end of the domain in the loop between β-strands D and E and at the beginning of β-strand E. Other residues, (Phe-108, Pro-111, and Ile-113), mapped to β-strand A. Thus, residues important for receptor binding map to the ABED face of the IgC domain, the opposite face from that shown for the IgV domain. Reversed orientation of the two domains would allow the GFCC′C″ face of the IgV domain and the ABED face of the IgC domain to align on one side of the molecule. Such an orientation would be reminiscent of that seen in crystal structures of D1D2 and D3D4 of human and rat CD4 domains(31Wang J. Yan Y. Garrett T.P.J. Liu J. Rodgers D.W. Garlick R.L. Tarr G.E.

Science. 1993; 260: 979Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Five potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the IgC domain (Asn-152, Asn-173, Asn-177, Asn-192, Asn-198), mapped predominantly to the GFC face, opposite the ABED face. Thus, carbohydrate is probably not involved in the CD80-receptor interaction. We have shown that the IgC domain of CD80 exerts considerable influence on CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig binding. Complete absence of the IgC domain in CD80VIg resulted in >10-fold reduced binding to both CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig. Thus, with human CD80, the presence of both the amino-terminal IgV and membrane proximal IgC domains was essential for full binding to CTLA4Ig/CD28Ig. However, several conserved non-IgSF consensus residues in the IgC domain were identified whose mutagenesis completely abolished CTLA4Ig/CD28Ig binding in our assays. Thus, point mutations in the IgC domain had a greater effect on receptor binding than complete removal of the domain. It is possible that mutagenesis of some residues in the IgC domain led to structural defects affecting the whole extracellular region. More likely, however, this implies that the IgC domain participates in the presentation of the receptor binding site."

The results of these studies demonstrated that transcriptional activation requires nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a DNA binding protein, which binds to specific sites on the regulatory regions of the cytokine genes(3Emmel E.A.

Molecular cloning and biochemical studies have provided insights into the actions of NFAT. The approximately 120-kDa NFAT is a member of a gene family whose members appear to contain a Rel homology region, which is important for DNA binding activity. Two members were identified: NFATc was cloned from a human T cell library (7Northrup J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), while NFATp was purified and cloned from murine T cells(8McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T. Verdine G.L. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In addition, several alternatively spliced forms of NFATp were identified(2Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). NFATc and NFATp are approximately 73% identical in the Rel homology region, although they share little similarity outside that domain. In unactivated T cells, NFAT DNA binding activity is localized primarily in the cytosol, and following T cell activation, activity is detected in the nucleus. Nuclear NFAT forms a complex with Fos and Jun, and mutations in NFAT that inhibit binding to these proteins eliminate NFAT-mediated gene transcription. Furthermore, treatment of cells with either CsA or FK506 inhibits the appearance of NFAT binding activity in the nucleus(3Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R.

An understanding of the link between the drugs FK506 and CsA and NFAT has recently started to emerge with the identification of calcineurin (CaN) as a cellular target of the drugs. FK506 and CsA bind to their respective immunophilins, FKBP-12 and cyclophilin A, and the drug-immunophilin complexes bind to and inhibit the activity of CaN, a calmodulin-dependent phosphatase(12Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar, 13Friedman J. Weissman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 799-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a constitutively active form of CaN in T cells renders the cells more resistant to the effects of the drugs, and the ability of a number of FK506 and CsA analogues to inhibit the phosphatase activity of CaN correlates with their ability to inhibit T cell activation(14Liu J. Albers M.W. Wandless T.J. Luam S. Alberg D.G. Belshaw P.J. Cohen P. MacKintosh C. Klee C.B. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3896-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that CaN is not just involved in mediating the actions of FK506 and CsA but that the enzyme plays a role in the physiological pathway of T cell activation. O'Keefe, et al.(15O'Keefe S.J. Tamurai J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in cells transfected with CaN, PMA- and ionophore-stimulated IL-2-driven gene expression was stimulated approximately 2-fold. Furthermore, in cells overexpressing a constitutively active form of CaN, IL-2-driven gene expression was stimulated approximately 150-fold in the presence of PMA alone, indicating that active CaN can replace the usual requirement for ionophore. Similar results were obtained by Clipstone and Crabtree (16Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar), who demonstrated reporter gene activity in CaN-transfected cells at suboptimal concentrations of ionomycin that elicited little or no activity in control cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CaN overexpression augments T cell activation resulting from both calcium and PKC stimulation and suggest that CaN plays a key role in this process. The studies with CsA and FK506 led to the suggestion that NFAT is a CaN substrate, either direct or indirect, in T cells. First, indirect evidence indicates that NFATp is a phosphoprotein. Fractionation of Jurkat cell cytosol demonstrated that NFAT DNA binding activity is detected with proteins in a molecular mass range of 94-116 kDa, suggesting heterogeneity in the size of the NFAT protein (17Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether NFAT phosphorylation could explain the heterogeneity, McCaffrey, et al.(18McCaffrey P.G. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3747-3752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) treated cell extracts enriched for NFAT with alkaline phosphatase. This enzymatic treatment resulted in a shift in NFAT binding activity from the 127-143-kDa molecular weight fraction to a 101-113-kDa fraction, which is consistent with the hypothesis that NFAT is a phosphoprotein. Second, treatment of purified NFAT with purified bovine brain CaN also resulted in a shift in the molecular weight of NFAT, suggesting that NFAT is an in vitro substrate for CaN(19Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner A. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Whether NFAT is a direct CaN substrate in intact cells has not yet been determined, however. In the majority of reported NFAT studies, NFAT DNA binding activity has been the end point usually measured, since relatively little is known about the NFAT protein. However, the recent cloning and expression of NFAT genes has yielded valuable information about the proteins, and direct protein analyses should now be possible. Towards that end, antibodies to NFAT will be important reagents to develop for probing protein structure and function. In the studies reported here, we developed a peptide antibody to NFATp, and we used it to characterize NFATp in cells. We demonstrate directly in 32P labeling experiments that NFATp is a phosphoprotein and that T cell activation results in NFATp dephosphorylation that can be blocked by pretreatment with FK506. Furthermore, we show that dephosphorylation is accompanied by translocation of NFATp protein from the cytosol to the nucleus of cells. FK506 and rapamycin were prepared at the Upjohn Company from fermentation broths of Streptomyces tsukubaenis (Upjohn Culture Collection 11052) and Streptomyces hygroscopicus (Upjohn Collection 5931), respectively. CaN and calmodulin were obtained from Sigma, and PP2a was from UBI. Orthophosphate was obtained from DuPont NEN. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [35S]Methionine and ECL reagents were obtained from Amersham Corp. Tyrosine phosphatase PTP1 was a gift from Dr. John Bleasdale (The Upjohn Company). CaN autoinhibitory peptide (22Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was synthesized at The Upjohn Company. The human T lymphoblastoid cell lines J5D9 and HSB and the murine T lymphoma cell line EL-4 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The murine helper T cell line HT-2 was grown in the medium just described with the addition of 12% rat T-STIM with concanavalin A as a source of IL-2 (Collaborative Biomedical Products), 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were prepared from leukophoresis packs. Cells were centrifuged over Ficoll, and cells at the interface were collected, diluted with RPMI, and pelleted. The cell pellet was suspended in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Nonadherent cells were collected, pelleted, and stored at −70°C. The amino acids CGG were added to the amino terminus of the sequence LSPGAYPTVIQQQTAPSQR corresponding to peptide 25 of NFATp(8McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T. Verdine G.L. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The cysteine residue was coupled to maleimide-activated KLH using the Imject Immunogen Conjugation Kit (Pierce), and rabbits were injected. Sera was tested against purified peptide, and bleeds determined to have the highest titer were affinity-purified by using the Pierce Ag/Ab immobilization kit with Sulfolink coupling gel. The antibody preparation used in the experiments shown here recognized 1 ng of purified peptide at a 1:1000 dilution. Homogenates were prepared from organs dissected from BALB/C mice as described in (20Ho A.M. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Polytron homogenizer. The tissues were homogenized at 0.3 g wet weight/ml in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 μg/ml aprotinin and soybean trypsin inhibitor, 250 μM leupeptin, 10 mM iodoacetamide, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. SDS was added to bring the final concentration to 2%. The sample was heated at 100°C for 10 min and then centrifuged for 10 min in a microfuge. The supernatant was removed, and protein was determined by the microassay method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using reagents from Bio-Rad. Treatment of HT-2 cells (1 × 106 cells/condition) was carried out as described in the figure legends. The cells then were washed in ice-cold PBS and resuspended (2.5 × 106 cells/ml) in buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2 μM leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Cells were centrifuged at 650 × g to pellet the nuclei, and the supernatant was removed. The nuclear pellet was washed in the above buffer minus detergent, and the final pellet was resuspended in Laemmli buffer. The supernatant was recentrifuged to remove any residual nuclei. Equal cell equivalents of soluble and nuclear fractions were electrophoresed on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Western blotting was carried out as described below. Cells were treated (2.5 × 105 cells/condition) as indicated in the figure legends, and control cells received Me2SO as a vehicle. Following treatment, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 40 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM EDTA, and 60 mM sodium pyrophosphate. SDS was added to bring the final concentration to 5%. The sample was boiled for 15 min and electrophoresed on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS. The blot was developed with a 1:500 dilution of affinity-purified NFATp antibody in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 500 mM NaCl and 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of donkey anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h (Amersham Corp.). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with the ECL system. For the phosphotyrosine blot (Fig. 3B), lysate from untreated HT-2 cells or epidermal growth factor-treated A431 cells (300 ng/ml epidermal growth factor for 15 min) were probed with 1 μg/ml 4G10 antibody (UBI), and the blot was developed by ECL. HT-2 cells at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml were grown overnight in growth medium as described above except that the medium contained 2% of the usual phosphate concentration and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The cells were resuspended in fresh medium containing 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were aliquoted at 1.5 × 106 cells/condition, and treatments were carried out as described in the figure legends. The cells were allowed to incorporate radiolabel for a total time of 4 h. After 2.8 h of incubation, FK506 (500 nM) was added for 1 h, followed by ionomycin (2 μM) for an additional 10 min. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 150 mM NaCl) containing 60 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 10 mM EDTA. The sample was precleared with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads for 30 min at 4°C. SDS was added (0.3% final concentration), and 10 μl of affinity-purified antibody was added to the sample for 2 h at 4°C followed by Protein A for 1 h. The Protein A beads were washed three times in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 500 mM NaCl and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, followed by three washes in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 0.3% SDS, followed by a final wash in radioimmune precipitation buffer. The sample was resuspended in Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. The autorad was quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using ImageQuant Software. Unlabeled cells (1.5 × 106 cells/condition) were untreated or stimulated for 10 min with 2 μM ionomycin, immunoprecipitated as described above, and washed five times in assay buffer (40 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM MnCl2). The immunoprecipitate from untreated cells was incubated in assay buffer containing the enzymes and inhibitors as indicated in the Fig. 3A legend in a final volume of 100 μl for 30 min at 30°C. 50 μl of Laemmli buffer was added, the sample was boiled, and the Sepharose beads were pelleted. The supernatant was electrophoresed on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blotting was carried out as above. The phosphatase activity of CaN and PP2A was measured in a total volume of 100 μl containing 40 mM Tris, pH 8.6, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mM MgCl2, 600 μM 4-methylumbelliferryl phosphate and either 25 nM CaN or 0.1 units of PP2A. To measure CaN activity, assays also included 100 nM calmodulin and the presence or absence of 100 μM inhibitory peptide(22Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37°C followed by the addition of 50 μl of stop buffer (300 mM glycine, pH 11.2, containing 15 mM EDTA), and the fluorescence was read at 365/405 nm. Cells were resuspended at 3 × 105 cells/ml for 30 min in growth medium containing 2% of the usual methionine plus 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, in the presence or absence of 2 μM ionomycin. [35S]Methionine was added at 175 μCi/ml for 5 min, and 1.5 × 106 cells were removed for the zero time point. The remainder of the cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in normal growth medium in the presence or absence of 2 μM ionomycin. At the indicated times, aliquots (1.5 × 106 cells) were removed, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with the NFATp antibody as described above. The autorad was quantitated as described above. Cells were resuspended at 6 × 105 cells/ml in low methionine-containing medium plus [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml) and incubated for 18 h. The cells were washed in PBS and resuspended at 3 × 105 cells/ml in normal growth medium containing Me2SO (control), 2 μM ionomycin, or 100 nM FK506 plus 2 μM ionomycin. Cells were pretreated with FK506 5 min prior to the addition of ionomycin. Cells (1.5 × 106) were removed immediately (zero time point) or at the indicated times, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated as described above. Autorads were quantitated as described above and analyzed by linear regression to determine the NFATp half-life. A polyclonal antibody was developed against a peptide from the COOH-terminal domain of NFATp. This peptide is outside the Rel homology domain and is from a unique region of NFATp that is not present in NFATc(7Northrup J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Therefore, this antibody is a specific reagent for characterizing the NFATp protein. Western blot analysis was carried out in order to determine the expression of NFATp in various mouse tissues (Fig. 1A). The highest level of NFATp expression was observed in spleen and thymus tissue. In thymus, the antibody strongly hybridized with proteins in the 110-130-kDa molecular mass range, suggesting protein heterogeneity, while in spleen tissue, reactivity was predominantly against a 110-kDa protein. In both these tissues, reactivity with smaller proteins of 72, 66, and 59 kDa was observed. It is unknown whether these proteins are proteolytic fragments of the larger NFATp protein. However, in competition experiments in which the NFATp peptide was included in the antibody incubation, no reactivity was observed, indicating the specificity of the interactions (lanes 8 and 9). In kidney and liver, there was little or no antibody reactivity against proteins in the 120-kDa range. Cross-reactivity against proteins of 66 and 72 kDa was shared among kidney, spleen, and thymus, although interestingly, in spleen and thymus, reactivity against the 66-kDa protein was predominant, while in kidney, antibody reactivity was greater against the 72-kDa protein, compared with the 66-kDa protein. Expression of NFATp was very low in brain, while in heart no NFATp was detected. The high level of NFATp expression in spleen and thymus is consistent with previous reports demonstrating NFAT DNA binding activity in T cells. Various T cell lines were profiled to investigate whether NFATp levels differ among T cells (Fig. 1B). Peripheral blood lymphocytes had the lowest level of NFATp expression (lane 4). These results could not simply be explained by a lack of reactivity of the murine peptide-derived antibody against human protein, since human T cell Jurkat cells showed significant reactivity with the antibody (lane 1). HSB cells, a human T cell line, also expressed the approximately 140-kDa NFATp (lane 2). In EL-4 cells, a mouse thymoma cell line, NFATp was expressed, but the protein was more heterogeneous, since proteins from 120 to 140 kDa reacted with the antibody (lane 3). HT-2 cells, an IL-2-dependent mouse T cell line, had the highest level of NFATp expression compared with the other cell lines (lane 5). In the experiment shown in Fig. 1B, lysate from 2.5 × 105 HT-2 cells resulted in a comparable or greater signal, compared with the other cell lines, in which 4-fold more cell equivalents (1 × 106) were used. In all of the cell lines, cross-reactivity with a 66-kDa protein was seen, suggesting, as in the tissue samples, that other NFATp protein forms may be expressed. Competition experiments using NFATp peptide and EL-4 or HT-2 cell extracts (lanes 6 and 7) demonstrated that all the reactivity could be competed by excess peptide. No NFAT protein was detected in MOLT-4 cells, a human T cell leukemia line or in NIH 3T3 cell fibroblasts (data not shown). Activation of T cells by treatment with PMA and calcium ionophore stimulates NFAT DNA binding activity(2Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The NFATp antibody was used to investigate directly the effect of T cell activation on NFAT protein levels (Fig. 2A). For these and subsequent experiments, HT-2 cells were used, due to their high level of expression of NFATp. NFATp migrated as an approximately 120-kDa protein in untreated cells. Treatment of the cells with either ionomycin alone (lane 2) or the combination of PMA plus ionomycin (data not shown), resulted in a decrease in the molecular weight of NFATp, suggestive of a proteolytic and/or dephosphorylation event. Identical shifts in the NFATp protein were observed when the cell treatments and lysate preparation were carried out in the presence of a panel of protease inhibitors, including leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (data not shown), suggesting that the mobility shift was not the result of proteolysis. The predominant NFATp protein band in the ionomycin-treated cells was approximately 110 kDa, although the protein was heterogenous in size. Pretreatment of the cells with 500 nM FK506 blocked the ionomycin-induced shift in NFATp (lane 3), suggesting a role for CaN. As a control, cells were pretreated with rapamycin prior to ionomycin treatment. Rapamycin binds to FKBP-12, but unlike FK506, it does not inhibit CaN, nor does it inhibit NFAT DNA binding activity. Rapamycin pretreatment also did not block the NFATp mobility shift induced by ionomycin (lane 4). To determine whether the changes in NFATp mobility were the result of ionomycin-induced dephosphorylation, 32P labeling experiments were carried out (Fig. 2B). Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h followed by treatments similar to those shown in Fig. 2A, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with the NFATp antibody. A similar decrease in molecular weight was observed in the 32P-labeled NFATp following ionomycin treatment as was observed in the Western blot experiments. Quantitation of the 32P autoradiograms showed that ionomycin treatment resulted in an approximately 65% loss in 32P from NFATp (data not shown). Interestingly, ionomycin treatment never resulted in a complete loss of 32P from NFATp, indicating that complete dephosphorylation did not occur. In addition, FK506 inhibited the loss of 32P, while rapamycin had no effect. The results of these experiments demonstrate directly that the shift in molecular weight following ionomycin treatment was the result of NFATp dephosphorylation and that FK506 pretreatment blocked the dephosphorylation. A role for CaN in the ionomycin-stimulated dephosphorylation of NFATp was shown directly in immune complex assays (Fig. 3). NFATp was immunoprecipitated from untreated HT-2 cells, and the immunoprecipitates were washed and incubated with CaN. CaN dephosphorylated NFATpin vitro, as shown by a decrease in the NFATp molecular weight, which was comparable to the molecular weight shift resulting from treatment of cells with ionomycin (compare lanes 2 and 3). CaN contains an autoinhibitory domain in its COOH-terminal domain, and a peptide from this region inhibits CaN dephosphorylation of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase peptide in vitro ((22Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and data not shown). Addition of the autoinhibitory peptide to the immune complex assay blocked the dephosphorylation of NFATp by CaN (lane 4). In contrast, treatment of the precipitated NFATp with another serine/threonine phosphatase, PP2A, resulted in little or no dephosphorylation of NFATp (lane 5), although the enzyme readily dephosphorylated 4-methylumbelliferryl phosphate (data not shown). The tyrosine phosphatase PTP1 also did not dephosphorylate NFATp (lane 7), suggesting that NFATp may not contain phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Consistent with this hypothesis was the observation that there was no reactivity on Western blots of antiphosphotyrosine antibodies with NFATp (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results indicate that NFATp readily serves as an in vitro substrate for CaN. Previous studies demonstrated that activation of T cells is accompanied by an increase in nuclear NFAT DNA binding activity. Using the NFATp antibody, we showed directly the presence of the NFATp protein in the nucleus of stimulated cells (Fig. 4A). In untreated cells, all of the NFATp protein was detected in the low speed supernatant (lane 1). Following a 10-min ionomycin treatment, however, the lower molecular weight, dephosphorylated form of NFATp was predominantly localized to the nuclear fraction (lane 5). Pretreatment of cells with FK506 prior to ionomycin stimulation blocked the dephosphorylation, as previously observed, and also blocked the translocation of NFATp to the nucleus (compare lanes 3 and 6). The time course for NFATp dephosphorylation and nuclear localization was examined in more detail (Fig. 4B). Fractionation of cells immediately following the addition of ionomycin indicated that NFATp dephosphorylation was rapid (lane 4), as shown by the ladder of protein bands. After ionomycin treatment for 10 min, the dephosphorylated NFATp was present in both the low speed supernatant and the nuclear fractions (lane 5), suggesting that NFATp is dephosphorylated in the cytosol, followed by localization of the dephosphorylated form to the nucleus. With increasing time of incubation with ionomycin, dephosphorylated NFATp was present almost exclusively in the nuclear fraction, although a small level of dephosphorylated NFATp was detected in the supernatant throughout the 4-h time course. These results suggest that NFATp is rapidly dephosphorylated and localized to the nucleus following ionomycin treatment and that the dephosphorylated NFATp remains in the nucleus in the continuing presence of ionomycin. A similar localization experiment was carried out with cells pretreated with ionomycin, followed by removal of the ionomycin (Fig. 4C). At the start of the experiment, following a 10 min treatment with ionomycin, essentially all of the NFATp was localized to the nucleus, and the nuclear NFATp was in the lower molecular weight, dephosphorylated form. After 10 min following washout of the ionomycin, NFATp was still in the nuclear fraction, although a low level of the higher molecular weight, phosphorylated form of NFATp was detected in the low speed supernatant. However, at the 30-min time point and beyond, NFATp was localized in the low speed supernatant fraction, with no detectable NFATp in the nucleus. These results suggest that following ionomycin washout, NFATp is recycled from the nucleus back into the cytosol. Furthermore, the NFATp in the low speed supernatant was exclusively in the higher molecular weight, phosphorylated form, suggesting that migration from the nucleus was accompanied by rapid rephosphorylation of NFATp. Loss of NFATp from the nuclear fraction could result from NFATp degradation. To investigate this possibility, [35S]methionine labeling experiments were carried out to measure the half-life of the NFATp protein. Cells were labeled overnight with [35S]methionine and then chased in medium containing unlabeled methionine. The rate of loss of immunoprecipitated NFATp was determined for untreated, ionomycin-treated, and FK506- and ionomycin-treated cells, and is shown as a semi-log plot (Fig. 5A). In untreated cells the t for NFATp was 16.9 ± 0.86 h (mean ± S.E., n = 3), which was similar to the value obtained from cells treated with the combination of FK506 and ionomycin (19.2 ± 3.9 h). Treatment with ionomycin, however, caused a slight decrease in the time required for loss of 50% of the prelabeled NFATp, to 11.9 ± 2.7 h. These results indicate that the loss of NFATp from the nucleus was not the result of degradation of the protein and support the hypothesis that nuclear NFATp reappears in the cytosol following ionomycin removal. During short labeling times, the major NFATp was in the dephosphorylated form (Fig. 5B). However, this form was rapidly chased into the higher molecular weight, phosphorylated form of NFATp, suggesting that phosphorylation of NFATp occurs very rapidly following synthesis. Much of the available information concerning NFAT is the result of studies of NFAT DNA binding activity(1Liu J. Immunol.

More recently, several forms of NFAT have been cloned, and Northern analysis demonstrated that NFAT mRNA levels vary among different tissues and under stimulus conditions(7Northrup J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Investigations with a specific NFATp antibody allowed expansion of these studies to include direct analysis of the NFATp protein. The peptide sequence used to generate the antibody described here is derived from the COOH-terminal region of NFATp, which is not present in NFATc, and thus the antibody differentiates between the two NFAT forms. The NFATp protein was highly expressed in thymus and spleen tissue, which is consistent with mRNA analysis(7Northrup J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). However, Northrup et al.(7Northrup J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) reported that NFATp mRNA levels were similar in brain, heart, thymus, and spleen, while our immunoblotting results (Fig. 1) showed that no NFATp protein was detected in heart tissue, and only very low levels in brain. These results suggest that the presence of NFATp mRNA may not predict the expression of the protein in all tissues or cells. In addition, lower molecular weight proteins reacted with the NFATp antibody, suggesting that other forms of NFATp may exist. Consistent with these results is the report that COOH-terminal splicing variants of NFATp have been cloned(2Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Peptide mapping or purification of the lower molecular weight, cross-reactive proteins is required to determine whether they are related to NFATp. Ionomycin treatment of the HT-2 cells resulted in a significant shift in the molecular weight of NFATp, as shown by immunoblotting analysis. The 32P labeling experiments provided a direct demonstration that NFATp is a phosphoprotein and that the shift in molecular weight resulted from dephosphorylation of NFATp. The dephosphorylation-induced molecular weight mass was approximately 10 kDa and represented an approximately 65% loss in phosphate from the protein. The extent of phosphorylation of NFATp is not known, and the results shown here indicate that dephosphorylation results in a significant change in the mobility of the protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. This result has practical applications, for it allows detection of the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of NFATp using Western blot analysis. The results of the localization experiments suggest that the phosphorylation state of NFATp may be a determinant of its localization within the cell. In untreated cells, NFATp was in the phosphorylated state, and was localized to the low speed supernatant. However, in ionomycin-treated cells, dephosphorylated NFATp was found in the nuclear fraction. Kinetic analysis, shown in Fig. 4, suggests that dephosphorylation occurs prior to nuclear localization, since at the 10-min time point, dephosphorylated NFATp was present in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, while at later time points the dephosphorylated form was exclusively localized to the nucleus. As long as ionomycin was present, NFATp remained both dephosphorylated and in the nucleus. Previous studies demonstrated that NFATp DNA binding activity is localized to the cytosol of untreated T cells, and to the nuclear fraction in stimulated cells(3Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The results shown here demonstrate directly that the shift in DNA binding activity seen by others reflects a change in the cellular location of the NFATp protein. Following ionomycin removal, NFATp reappeared in the cell supernatant fraction, in the higher molecular weight, phosphorylated form. The [35S]methionine labeling experiments demonstrated that NFATp is a relatively stable protein, with a half-life of approximately 17 h in untreated cells and approximately 12 h in ionomycin-treated cells. Thus, the loss of signal from the nucleus following ionomycin removal cannot be explained by degradation of NFATp. These results suggest that NFATp may shuttle in and out of the nucleus, depending on the activation state of the cell as well as the phosphorylation state of the protein. A potential nuclear localization sequence has been identified within the Rel homology region of NFATp(23Li X. Ho S.N. Luna J. Giacalone J. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Crabtree G.R. Francke U. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 68: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). There are a number of potential phosphorylation sites in NFATp, including one within the nuclear localization sequence. One possibility is that activation-induced dephosphorylation of NFATp results in an unmasking of the nuclear localization sequence, leading to nuclear localization of the protein. The immunocomplex assay demonstrated directly that NFATp is a CaN substrate in vitro. Furthermore, the CaN-induced molecular weight shift in NFATp was similar to that resulting from ionomycin treatment of cells. Treatment of intact cells with FK506, a CaN inhibitor, blocks the ionomycin-induced dephosphorylation, which further supports but does not prove the hypothesis that NFATp is a CaN substrate in intact cells. In general, no consensus sequence for dephosphorylation of substrates by CaN has been identified. However, Donella-Deana et al.(24Donella-Deana A. Krinks M.H. Ruzzene M. Klee C. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have demonstrated in phosphopeptide studies that basic residues on the NH2-terminal side of the phosphoamino acid, especially at the −3 position, are positive determinants for dephosphorylation by CaN, while acidic residues on the COOH-terminal side are negative determinants. Because of a lack of a strong consensus sequence, these results and the results of others (25Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Elliott J.I. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20369-20376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26King M.M. Huang C.Y. Chock P.B. Nairn A.C. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Chan K.F. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8080-8083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have led to the suggestion that more complex protein structural determinants also play a role in defining CaN substrate specificity. Taken together, these results suggest that a number of sites within NFATp may be sites for CaN dephosphorylation. Mapping these sites in vitro and comparing them with the sites of dephosphorylation in intact cells is required to establish whether NFATp is a direct substrate for CaN in intact cells. The results of such experiments will define in more detail the exact role of CaN in T cell activation.

INTRODUCTIONIt is generally accepted that the Bcr/Abl protein is responsible for the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 1The abbreviations use are: CMLchronic myeloid leukemiaSH2Src homology region 2SH3Src homology region 3GSTglutathione S-transferaseALLacute lymphoblastic leukemiaGAPGTPase activating proteinGM-CSFgranulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Leukemic cells of such patients have a common molecular defect. This is the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, a hybrid chromosome consisting of fused parts of chromosomes 9 and 22, which produces a chimeric Bcr/Abl protein at the breakpoint on chromosome 22. The Abl segment of this protein has a deregulated tyrosine kinase activity (reviewed in (1Heisterkamp N. Voncken J.-W. van Schaick H. Groffen J. Kirsch I.R.

Substrates of Bcr/Abl which are likely to be important to the leukemogenic process should be expressed in hematopoietic cell types and should be abnormally tyrosine-phosphorylated. The adaptor molecule Crkl meets these criteria(11ten Hoeve J. Arlinghaus R.B. Guo J.Q. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Crkl is clearly expressed in hematopoietic cells but is not constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in bone marrow 2de Jong, R., Haataja, L., Voncken, J. W., Heisterkamp, N., and Groffen, J. (1995) Oncogene, in press. or peripheral blood(11ten Hoeve J. Arlinghaus R.B. Guo J.Q. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J.

In addition, stimulation of neutrophils with GM-CSF, tumor necrosis factor, lipopolysaccharide, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, interleukin 1, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or insulin fails to evoke Crkl tyrosine phosphorylation (12Oda T.

Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 2912-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the CML cell line K562, Crkl is one of the most prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins(14ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.-W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar), and we have shown that it complexes with and is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Bcr/Abl(14ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.-W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, Crkl is only tyrosine-phosphorylated in peripheral blood cells of Ph-positive patients with an active Bcr/Abl protein(11ten Hoeve J. Arlinghaus R.B. Guo J.Q. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Oda T. Heaney C. Hagopian J.R. Okuda K. Griffin J.D. Druker B. J. Biol.

Blood. 1994; 84: 2912-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests a distinctive role for this adaptor in leukemogenesis.Crkl consists of an SH2 and two SH3 domains in the absence of any catalytic domains(15ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). Adaptor proteins are thought to link tyrosine kinases with downstream effectors, and Crkl could be an important mediator of the leukemogenic activity of Bcr/Abl. Since SH2 and SH3 domains serve as docking sites for other proteins, it is critical to identify the binding partners of Crkl in Ph-positive cells. In the current study, we have identified a tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 protein which binds the Crkl SH2 domain but not its SH3 domains. Binding is restricted to cells containing a Bcr/Abl protein and apparently is the result of Bcr/Abl kinase activity. The identification of p120 as p120Cbl, originally isolated as an oncogene associated with myeloid and lymphoid leukemias in mice(16Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse III, H.C.

Crkl-specific antibodies (CH-16) recognizing the spacer region between the Crkl SH3 domains have been described (14ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.-W. Heisterkamp N.

GST-Crkl SH2 was generated by inserting a 360-base pair TaqI-RsaI fragment of a Crkl cDNA into pGEX-2T. GST-Crkl SH3SH3 was obtained by cloning a blunt-ended 630-base pair BsmI fragment into pGEX-3X. GST-fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described(17Smith D.B. Johnson K.S.

Proteins on gels were transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose and visualized with ECL reagents (Amersham). Western blots were incubated with antibodies as described(11ten Hoeve J. Arlinghaus R.B.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSCrkl Binds a p120 in Cells Expressing an Active Bcr/Abl ProteinWe initially compared Crkl protein binding in lysates from NIH 3T3 cells and NIH 3T3 cells stably transformed with BCR/ABL. Nontransfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts contained no clearly detectable proteins binding to the Crkl SH2 domain on Far-Western blots (Fig. 1A, lane 8). However, transfection of these cells with Bcr/Abl P210 led to a marked increase in the total level of cellular phosphotyrosine (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 8 and 9) and the concomitant appearance of proteins of a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa (p120) which bound to Crkl-SH2 (Fig. 1A, lane 9).Ph-positive (expressing P210 or P190) or -negative peripheral blood cells from leukemia patients expressed different tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 1B). Of these, the Crkl-SH2 domain bound almost exclusively to the p120 and only in cells expressing an active Bcr/Abl protein. This included patient samples of Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia expressing Bcr/Abl P190 (Fig. 1A, lane 4) and chronic myeloid leukemia samples expressing Bcr/Abl P210 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3, 6, and 7) (described in (11ten Hoeve J. Arlinghaus R.B. Guo J.Q. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Although the p120 was clearly detected in the Bcr/Abl expressing Ph-positive patient samples, the Crkl SH2 domain failed to detect the p120 in peripheral blood cells of patients not expressing Bcr/Abl (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 5). Similarly, the p120 was detected in involved spleens of BCR/ABL P190 transgenic mice but not in control spleens (not shown). K562, a CML cell line commonly used as a model for Ph-positive leukemia expressing P210, also contained the Crkl-SH2 domain-binding p120 phosphoprotein (Fig. 1A, lane 1).To investigate whether the Crkl protein binds to p120 in vivo, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins which associate with Crkl in K562 were examined. Although some anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (OSI AB-2) detected Crkl as one of the most conspicuous phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in K562(14ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.-W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar), the RC20 antibodies (Signal Transduction) also detected additional prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and had a lower affinity for Crkl (Fig. 2, lane 1). However, only a very limited subset of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins detected in K562 (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 2) were co-precipitated with Crkl. This included P210Bcr/Abl, in agreement with previous results(14ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.-W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar), a group of 70-80-kDa phosphoproteins, and a p120 (Fig. 2, lane 2). We concluded that the tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 protein is uniquely associated with Crkl in Ph-positive cells, and that this is likely to be of relevance to leukemogenesis caused by Bcr/Abl. Therefore, experiments were initiated to identify p120.Figure 2:The Crk-associated p130Cas is not tyrosine-phosphorylated or in complex with Crkl in the CML cell line K562. Lysates of K562 were reacted directly with α-Tyr(P) antibodies (lanes 1 and 3) or with anti-Cas antibodies (lane 5). Extracts of K562 were first immunoprecipitated with α-Crkl (lanes 2 and 7) or α-Cas (lanes 4 and 6) antibodies, then probed with α-Tyr(P) or Cas antibodies as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of the p120The adaptor molecule Crk has a structure and primary sequence similar to that of Crkl(15ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar), and overlap between the binding of Crk and Crkl to proteins on far-Western blots has been described(18Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar). In v-src or v-crk transformed cells, a prominent phosphotyrosine-containing p130 is detected which binds to Crk. This protein, p130Cas, contains various potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites(19Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that the p120 is Cas. However, although p130Cas was clearly expressed in K562 cells (Fig. 2, lane 5) and Cas antibodies were able to efficiently immunoprecipitate Cas from K562 extracts (lane 6), this protein contained no detectable phosphotyrosine (lane 4), nor did it co-immunoprecipitate with Crkl antisera (lane 7).p120RasGAP is another good candidate for p120, since it is tyrosine-phosphorylated in K562 cells(10Druker B. Okuda K. Matulonis U. Salgia R. Roberts T. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, experiments similar to those described for p130Cas failed to positively identify p120RasGAP as the p120 protein (not shown).p120Cbl was originally identified as a retrovirally transduced oncogene which causes pre-B-cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemias in mice(16Langdon W.Y.

Endogenous Cbl is tyrosine-phosphorylated in NIH 3T3 cells expressing v-abl and in K562(5Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), suggesting it as a candidate for p120. p120Cbl had a mobility very similar to that of the p120 immunoprecipitated with two different α-Crkl antisera from K562 (Fig. 3A), and both contained phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3A, top). Immunoblotting of the Crkl precipitates with α-Cbl antisera unambiguously identified the p120 as p120Cbl (Fig. 3A, bottom). Mice transgenic for BCR/ABL P190 reproducibly develop lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma(20Heisterkamp N. Jenster G. ten Hoeve J. Zovich D. Pattengale P.K. Groffen J. Nature. 1990; 344: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated p120Cbl was also co-immunoprecipitated with Crkl antisera from the spleens of leukemic transgenic Bcr/Abl mice (not shown).Figure 3:p120Cbl is in complex with Crkl and represents the 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein band detectable in Crkl immunoprecipitates. A, co-immunoprecipitation of Cbl with Crkl antisera. Lane 1, Western blot of K562 lysate; lanes 2-5, immunoprecipitations from extracts of K562 using Crkl preimmune (lanes 2), α-Crkl CH-16 (lanes 3), α-Crkl crkL (lanes 4), and α-Cbl (lanes 5) antisera. The blots were reacted with the antisera shown to the right of each panel. B, immunodepletion of p120Cbl abrogates the detection of the Crkl-associated 120-kDa phosphoprotein. K562 lysate was subjected to two rounds of α-Cbl immunoprecipitation, and the resulting Cbl-depleted lysate (lane 2) was immunoprecipitated with either α-Crkl (lane 5) or α-Cbl (lane 6), as indicated. For comparison, control K562 lysate (lane 1) was immunoprecipitated with α-Crkl (lane 3) or α-Cbl (lane 4) antisera. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were blotted and incubated with α-Tyr(P) or α-Cbl antibodies, as indicated to the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In similar reciprocal experiments, we could detect Crkl in immunoprecipitates of K562 generated by α-Cbl antibodies, although Crkl co-precipitation was not as efficient as co-precipitation of Cbl by α-Crkl antisera. In addition, these Cbl precipitates also contained Bcr/Abl (data not shown). These results identify Cbl as the p120 protein.To determine if all of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 120-kDa protein band in Crkl immunoprecipitates represents Cbl, K562 lysates were subjected to two rounds of immunoprecipitation with α-Cbl (Fig. 3B). This Cbl-depleted lysate was Western-blotted directly or was immunoprecipitated with α-Crkl or α-Cbl antisera. The two rounds of Cbl precipitation were sufficient to devoid the K562 lysate of tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl (lanes 2 and 6, top and bottom), resulting also in a selective loss of all of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 120-kDa protein detected in the lysate and in the α-Crkl precipitate (lanes 2 and 5, top). From these results we conclude that p120Cbl represents virtually all of the tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 associated with Crkl.Crkl Binds to Cbl Only through Its SH2 DomainTo further confirm the identity of the Crkl SH2-binding p120 detected in Ph-positive cells as Cbl, proteins were immunoprecipitated from K562 with α-Crkl or α-Cbl antisera. When these precipitates were probed with Crkl SH2 on an immunoblot, p120Cbl was clearly and specifically detected (Fig. 4A), whereas blotting to control GST protein detected no specific bands (Fig. 4A, left panel). Crkl SH2 bound only to p120Cbl phosphorylated on tyrosine, as is demonstrated in the far- Western assay shown in Fig. 1, indicating that the SH2 interaction is phosphotyrosine-dependent.Figure 4:The Crkl SH2 but not its SH3 domain stably binds to Cbl in K562. A, far-Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates of Cbl. Lanes 1 and 5 contain K562 total cellular lysates. Proteins immunoprecipitated with control nonspecific antiserum (lanes 2 and 6), α-Crkl CH-16 (lanes 3 and 7), and α-Cbl (lanes 4 and 8) were blotted and reacted with GST (left panel) or GST-Crkl-SH2 as shown. The location of p120Cbl and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Ig) is as indicated. B, binding of Crkl subdomains to Cbl. Extracts in lanes 2-5 were incubated with GST (fusion) proteins as indicated.

This possibility is illustrated by Fyn and Lck, of which both SH2 and SH3 domains bind to Cbl from activated T-cells(21Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test this, bacterially expressed GST-Crkl and GST-Crkl SH2 and SH3 domains were used to pull down proteins from K562 extracts. The Crkl SH2 domain but not the SH3 domains precipitated the tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl p120 protein (Fig. 4B, top and bottom panels) with an efficiency comparable to that of the entire Crkl protein (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 3 and 4). In agreement with previous results, the entire Crkl protein also bound to a P210 protein which was identified as P210Bcr/Abl (not shown), and this interaction was mediated by Crkl SH3 domains (Fig. 4B, lane 5).DISCUSSIONCrkl is one of the most prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Ph-positive patient (11ten Hoeve J. Arlinghaus R.B. Guo J.Q. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transgenic Bcr/Abl mouse material.2 Because it is non-tyrosine-phosphorylated in normal bone marrow, this modification is leukemia-specific, and we are in the process of investigating the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of Crkl on its cellular interactions. The current study demonstrates a second level of Crkl involvement: in Ph-positive leukemia, Crkl is bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl through its SH2 domain.Although the phosphorylation status of Cbl has not been examined in detail in hematopoietic cell types, our results show that it is not constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in peripheral blood cells and are in agreement with results of others(21Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Odai H. Sasaki K. Iwamatsu A. Hanazono Y. Tanaka T. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10800-10805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We therefore suggest that the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in Ph-positive cells is abnormal. Transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl has been demonstrated recently in normal hematopoietic signaling events: T-cell receptor activation of Jurkat cells and GM-CSF and Epo stimulation of UT-7 cells(21Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Odai H. Sasaki K. Iwamatsu A. Hanazono Y. Tanaka T. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10800-10805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This shows that Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation is also part of normal signal transduction pathways.The specific activity of the oncogene v-cbl in causing myeloid leukemias and lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas in mice also is in concordance with a defined normal role for Cbl in hematopoietic signaling. In addition, since removal of a defined region of 17 amino acids from Cbl causes it to become phosphorylated on tyrosine and to transform cells(5Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), a correlation appears to exist between myeloid/lymphoid cell types, Cbl phosphorylation, and leukemogenesis.How does Cbl become phosphorylated? Andoniou et al.(5Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) showed that anti-Abl antiserum is capable of co-precipitating Cbl from K562 but did not show evidence for the mechanism through which this would occur. We have previously shown that Crkl and Bcr/Abl form complexes and demonstrate here that this is mediated through the Crkl SH3 domain. In the current study, we also demonstrate Crkl and Cbl binding through the Crkl SH2 domain. Although it remains a formal possibility that each of these molecules form independent bimolecular complexes with each other (Bcr/Abl + Crkl; Bcr/Abl + Cbl; Crkl + Cbl), we favor a model in which a trimolecular complex involving Bcr/Abl, Crkl, and Cbl is formed. In the most simple version of this model, Crkl is constitutively bound to Bcr/Abl via its SH3 domain. Low level transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl through normal signaling events (e.g. GM-CSF stimulation) would cause an association of Crkl and Cbl and a significant increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl by Bcr/Abl. Because the kinase activity of Bcr/Abl is deregulated, Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation would be constitutively switched on, leading to a long-lasting activation of the signaling pathways normally controlled by cytokines. Interestingly, the results of Odai et al.(22Odai H. Sasaki K. Iwamatsu A. Hanazono Y. Tanaka T. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10800-10805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) suggest that the GM-CSF signal transduction pathway in which Cbl appears to be involved is distinct from that of Ras.Although some models of Bcr/Abl-associated leukemogenesis invoke several distinct signaling pathways, it remains very well possible that only a single pathway leads to leukemogenesis in vivo. The similarities between the types of malignancies associated with Bcr/Abl and v-cbl in animal models suggests that the pathways of these oncogenes converge, a possibility which can be currently investigated in complementation studies. INTRODUCTIONIt is generally accepted that the Bcr/Abl protein is responsible for the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 1The abbreviations use are: CMLchronic myeloid leukemiaSH2Src homology region 2SH3Src homology region 3GSTglutathione S-transferaseALLacute lymphoblastic leukemiaGAPGTPase activating proteinGM-CSFgranulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Leukemic cells of such patients have a common molecular defect. This is the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, a hybrid chromosome consisting of fused parts of chromosomes 9 and 22, which produces a chimeric Bcr/Abl protein at the breakpoint on chromosome 22. The Abl segment of this protein has a deregulated tyrosine kinase activity (reviewed in (1Heisterkamp N. Voncken J.-W. van Schaick H. Groffen J. Kirsch I.R.

Integrin beta 1C (beta 1S) is an alternatively spliced variant of integrin beta 1 with a specific cytoplasmic domain and is expressed in several human tissues. Human beta 1c transiently expressed in mouse 10T1/2 fibroblasts showed a diffuse pattern of cell surface staining, whereas beta1 localized to focal adhesions. Moderate concentrations of beta 1C had no effect on actin stress fibers or focal adhesions, but markedly inhibited DNA synthesis. Inhibition by beta 1C mapped to the late G1 phase of the cell cycle, near the G1-S boundary.

https://openalex.org/W2025610536,"P-glycoprotein consists of two homologous halves, each composed of a transmembrane domain and a nucleotide-binding domain. In order to understand how the domains interact in P-glycoprotein, we expressed each domain as a separate polypeptide and tested for associations using coimmunoprecipitation assays. We found that the interactions between the two halves of P-glycoprotein were mediated through associations between the two transmembrane domains as well as through the nucleotide-binding domains. In addition, the nucleotide-binding domain also associated with the transmembrane domain in each half of the molecule. By contrast, we could not detect any association either between the first nucleotide-binding domain and the second transmembrane domain, or between the second nucleotide-binding domain and the first transmembrane domain. We then tested whether individual domains associated with molecular chaperones, since biogenesis of P-glycoprotein appears to involve the chaperones calnexin and Hsc70. We found that calnexin associated only with the transmembrane domains, while Hsc70 associated only with the nucleotide-binding domains. These results suggest that noncovalent interaction between the domains of P-glycoprotein can contribute to structure and function of P-glycoprotein and that chaperones may participate in the folding of each domain.

These results suggest that noncovalent interaction between the domains of P-glycoprotein can contribute to structure and function of P-glycoprotein and that chaperones may participate in the folding of each domain. P-glycoprotein, the product of the human MDR1 gene, is an energy-dependent transport protein which interacts with a wide variety of hydrophobic cytotoxic agents that do not have a common structure or intracellular target (see reviews by Roninson(1991) and Gottesman and Pastan(1993)). The protein is clinically important since it contributes to the phenomenon of multidrug resistance during chemotherapy of human cancers (see reviews by Endicott and Ling(1989), Van der Bliek and Borst(1992), and Gottesman and Pastan(1993)). P-glycoprotein consists of 1280 amino acids organized in two tandem repeats of 610 amino acids, joined by a linker region of 60 amino acids (Chen et al., 1986). Each repeat consists of an NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain containing six potential transmembrane sequences followed by a hydrophilic domain containing a nucleotide binding site. Studies on the topology suggest that each transmembrane domain (TMD) 1The abbreviations used are: TMDtransmembrane domainTMD1NH2-terminal TMD (residues 1 to 379) which contains the first six transmembrane segmentsTMD2COOH-terminal TMD (residues 681-1025) which contains the last six transmembrane segmentsMDRmultidrug resistancePBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNBFnucleotide-binding domainntnucleotide. consists of six membrane-spanning helices (Loo and Clarke, 1995). Genetic (Choi et al., 1988; Gros et al., 1991; Devine et al., 1992; Loo and Clarke, 1993a, 1993b, 1994a) and biochemical analyses (Bruggemann et al., 1989, 1992; Greenberger, 1993; Zhang et al., 1995a) indicate that residues within the TMD contribute to drug binding. The hydrophilic domains containing the consensus nucleotide binding folds (NBF) have been found to bind ATP (Azzaria et al., 1989; Baubichon-Cortay et al., 1994). transmembrane domain NH2-terminal TMD (residues 1 to 379) which contains the first six transmembrane segments COOH-terminal TMD (residues 681-1025) which contains the last six transmembrane segments multidrug resistance phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nucleotide-binding domain nucleotide. Functional studies suggest that different domains of P-glycoprotein must interact with each other for transport to occur. It has been demonstrated that ATPase activity is stimulated in the presence of drug substrates (Ambudkar et al., 1992; Sarkadi et al., 1992; Sharom et al., 1993; Al-Shawi and Senior, 1993; Shapiro and Ling, 1994). Coupling of ATPase activity to drug binding involves interactions between both homologous halves of the molecule since no drug-stimulated ATPase activity was observed when each half was expressed as a separate polypeptide (Loo and Clarke, 1994b). The physical basis for interactions between domains is not known. Such interactions have been shown to be critical for function in bacterial ABC transporters, where individual domains are composed of separate polypeptides. In the histidine permease, for example, noncovalent interactions between all four domains were required to form a functional complex (Kerppola et al., 1991). In this study, we tested whether there are physical interactions between specific domains of P-glycoprotein by expressing each domain as a separate polypeptide and using coimmunoprecipitation assays. In addition, we tested whether chaperones may participate in the folding of the individual domains as there is evidence that they play a role in biosynthesis of the enzyme (Loo and Clarke, 1994c). We found that interactions between the homologous halves of the molecule are mediated by association between the TMDs as well as between NBFs. Specific associations were also observed between TMDs and NBFs. In addition, the molecular chaperone calnexin is involved in the folding of the TMDs, whereas Hsc70 participates in the folding of NBFs. The cDNAs coding for either the NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal half-molecules of P-glycoprotein and containing the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 were generated as described previously (Loo and Clarke, 1994b). To generate the NH2-terminal half-molecule of P-glycoprotein lacking the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52, the full-length MDR1-A52 cDNA in Bluescript vector (Stratagene), pBSGMDR1-A52, was linearized with HindIII (nt 2041), filled in with Klenow fragment and the vector fragment religated to generate pBSGMDR1ΔCOOH. In order to express TMD1 (residues 1-379) containing the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52, pBSGMDR1-A52 was digested with BstBI (nt 1133) and HindIII (nt 3843), filled-in with Klenow and the vector fragment ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The cDNA coding for TMD2 (residues 681-1025) and containing the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 was created by digesting the cDNA coding for the COOH-terminal half-molecule of P-glycoprotein, pBSMDR1A52ΔNH2 (Loo and Clarke, 1994b) with StuI (nt 3072) and EcoRV (nt 3849), and ligation of the vector fragment. The cDNA coding for NBF1-A52 was obtained by ligating the cDNAs coding for residues 1-16 (EcoRI (nt −76) to DraI (nt 48)), residues 388-529 (SspI (nt 1159) to ApaI (nt 1582)) and the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 (ApaI (nt 1582) to XhoI (nt 4061)). The ApaI to XhoI fragment containing the A52 epitopes was isolated from pBSGMDR1A52ΔCOOH (Loo and Clarke, 1994b). The fragment coding for NBF1-A52 was subcloned into pMT21. In some experiments, NBF1 lacking the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 was needed. The cDNA coding for NBF1 was obtained by ligating the cDNA coding for residues 1-16 with that coding for residues 388-682 (SspI (nt 1159) to XhoI (nt 4061)) isolated from pBSGMDR1ΔCOOH. The cDNA coding for NBF2-A52 was constructed by ligating the fragment coding for residues 1025 to 1311 (StuI (nt 3072) to XhoI (nt 4061) to pBSGMDR1A52ΔNH2 which had been linearized with HindIII, filled-in with Klenow fragment, followed by digestion with XhoI. In some instances, NBF2 was fused to calbindin D-28K. Fusion of NBF2 to calbindin (residues 19 to 261) (Parmentier et al., 1987) allowed us to differentiate NBF2 from TMD2 in SDS-PAGE. The fragments coding for each domain of P-glycoprotein were subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the expression vector, pMT21 and the nucleotide sequence confirmed by sequencing (Sanger et al., 1977). Forty hours after transfection of HEK 293 cells (10-cm diameter dish) with the desired cDNAs (Loo and Clarke, 1993a), the cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1% (w/v) digitonin, 10 mM iodoacetamide, 1% (v/v) aprotinin, 50 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and the lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 15 μg of affinity-purified rabbit anti-calnexin antibody (Loo and Clarke, 1994c), 5 μg of affinity-purified rabbit anti-NBF1 (against residues 439-640) (Charuk et al., 1994), 2 μg of monoclonal antibody against calbindin D-28K (Sigma), 10 μg of rat monoclonal antibody against Hsc70 (StressGen), or 2 μg with monoclonal antibody A52 as described previously (Loo and Clarke, 1994c). The immune complexes were collected by addition of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B or protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (for anti-Hsc70) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and washed four times with buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) digitonin. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pharmacia). Expression and Glycosylation- Fig. 1 shows the four domains of P-glycoprotein and the composition of the constructs used to express each domain as a separate polypeptide. In most cases, the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 was added at the COOH terminus of each construct to facilitate identification of the expressed mutant proteins, as well as for immunoprecipitation. We have previously found that the addition of an epitope tag to the full-length protein (Loo and Clarke, 1993a), or to either half-molecule forms of P-glycoprotein did not inhibit function (Loo and Clarke, 1994b). Fig. 2 shows an immunoblot of whole cell extracts of HEK 293 cells expressing various domains of P-glycoprotein. Cells transfected with the cDNAs coding for the NH2-terminal (NBF1) and COOH-terminal (NBF2) nucleotide-binding domains, expressed polypeptides with apparent masses of 41 and 35 kDa, respectively, which are comparable to their predicted sizes. By contrast, both the NH2-terminal (TMD1) and the COOH-terminal (TMD2) transmembrane domains had apparent masses that were smaller than that predicted from their cDNA when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. TMD1 had an apparent mass of 39 kDa (unglycosylated, see below), compared to its predicted size of 44 kDa, while TMD2 had an apparent mass of 35 kDa, which is smaller that its predicted size of 40 kDa. The discrepancies in the apparent masses of the transmembrane domains is probably due to incomplete denaturation, since the samples were not heated after solubilization in SDS sample buffer. Heating of these samples, but not NBF1 or NBF2, caused aggregation of these polypeptides such that they remained in the stacking gel. To determine if the expressed domains were inserted into membranes of HEK 293 cells, membranes were prepared from cells transfected with the cDNA coding for each domain and then treated with sodium carbonate. Carbonate extraction of membranes removes all but integral membrane proteins (Fujiki et al., 1982). It was found that wild-type P-glycoprotein-A52 and the TMD1 and TMD2 polypeptides were almost exclusively recovered in the pellet fractions, whereas NBF1 and NBF2 were present only in the supernatant fractions (data not shown). These results suggest that both TMD1 and TMD2 contain signals necessary for insertion into the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Human MDR1 contains three glycosylated sites in the first extracellular loop (Schinkel et al., 1993). Accordingly, we tested the sensitivity of the domain polypeptides to endoglycosidase H digestion. Fig. 2 shows that the apparent molecular mass of TMD1 decreased from 46 kDa to approximately 39 kDa following endoglycosidase H treatment. By contrast, the TMD2, NBF1, or NBF2 were not sensitive to endoglycosidase H (Fig. 2) or N-glycanase F digestion (data not shown). These results suggest that only TMD1 was core-glycosylated and likely resides in the endoplasmic reticulum of transfected cells. To test for associations between domains, coimmunoprecipitation assays were carried out on cell extracts prepared from cells which were cotransfected with cDNAs coding for various domains of P-glycoprotein. To confirm that this was a valid approach, we first assayed for association between the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal half-molecules of P-glycoprotein. In a previous study, it was found that drug-stimulatable ATPase activity was restored when both half-molecules were expressed together in the same cell (Loo and Clarke, 1994a), indicating that both halves can functionally interact. In this coimmunoprecipitation assay, a COOH-terminal half-molecule containing an epitope tag for monoclonal antibody A52 was used, while the NH2-terminal half molecule lacked this tag. Fig. 3A shows that the NH2-terminal half-molecule could only be recovered by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal A52 when coexpressed with the COOH-terminal half-molecule containing the A52 epitope tag. These results indicate that restoration of drug-stimulatable ATPase activity is due to physical association between the two half-molecules. To identify the regions of interaction between the two halves of P-glycoprotein, we coexpressed the various domains (Fig. 1) of P-glycoprotein followed by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. Fig. 3B shows that TMD2 was recovered in the immune complex using an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against NBF1, when coexpressed with the NH2-terminal half-molecule. In the absence of the NH2-terminal half-molecule, however, the antibody did not immunoprecipitate TMD2 (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that one possible site of interaction between the two half-molecules of P-glycoprotein is through the transmembrane domains. To determine whether the cytoplasmic domains were also responsible for association of the two halves of P-glycoprotein, we coexpressed NBF1 containing an epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 together with NBF2 which had been fused to calbindin D-28K. Fig. 2 shows that TMD2 and NBF2 containing the A52 tags have approximately the same mass in SDS-PAGE. By fusing NBF2 to calbindin, the molecular mass of NBF2 is increased by approximately 25 kDa (see below), allowing it to be distinguished from TMD2 in SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3C shows that NBF2-calbindin could be recovered with monoclonal antibody A52, only in the presence of NBF1. Similarly, when NBF1 is coexpressed with NBF2-calbindin and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody against calbindin, NBF1 could also be immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that interaction between the two nucleotide-binding domains could also contribute to physical association between the two half-molecules of P-glycoprotein. Another potentially important association in P-glycoprotein is through association of the nucleotide-binding domains with the transmembrane domains. The observation that ATPase activity is stimulated by drug binding suggests a functional interaction between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. Fig. 3D shows that, when NBF1 was coexpressed with either TMD1 or TMD2 and immunoprecipitated with antibody against NBF1, only TMD1 was coimmunoprecipitated. One possible explanation that TMD2 was not coimmunoprecipitated was that it was not expressed in the cells. We confirmed, however, that both NBF1 and TMD2 were indeed coexpressed by performing an immunoblot analysis on a sample of cells transfected with the cDNAs coding for both domains prior to immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 4). These results suggest that NBF1 can associate with TMD1 but not with TMD2. Similarly, we attempted to identify associations of NBF2 with the transmembrane domains. Fig. 3E shows that there was association of NBF2 with TMD2 but not with TMD1. The large amount of immunoreactive material of apparent mass between 50 and 100 kDa is due to reaction of the anti-mouse secondary antibody with the mouse monoclonal antibody (anti-calbindin D) that was used during the immunoprecipitation. The immunoblot in Fig. 3E was exposed to film for a very short period of time compared to that in Fig. 4, to prevent masking of any signal by the immunoreactive material of 50-100 kDa. Therefore, the presence of a signal (Fig. 3E, lanes 2 and 4, respectively), suggests that these are significant associations. Extraction of cells with SDS (Fig. 4) or with digitonin (data not shown) resulted in the majority of TMD1 as well as the other domains being present in the soluble fraction. These results show that there are physical interactions between the transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains in each half of P-glycoprotein. We have previously demonstrated that the molecular chaperone calnexin associates with P-glycoprotein (Loo and Clarke, 1994c). Another class of chaperones which has been found to associate with ABC transporters are the Hsc/Hsp70 proteins. Yang et al.(1993) reported that this chaperone transiently associated with immature or mutant forms of the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator. In a previous attempt (Loo and Clarke, 1994c), we were unable to detect an association of Hsc/Hsp70 with P-glycoprotein expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, using a monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) which cross-reacts with both constitutive and inducible forms of this protein. We now show that, by using a different monoclonal antibody that is specific for the constitutive form of Hsc70 (StressGen), an association between P-glycoprotein and Hsc70 could be demonstrated. As shown in Fig. 5B, a monoclonal antibody to Hsc70 coimmunoprecipitated only the immature form of P-glycoprotein (150 kDa). Similarly, the antibody also immunoprecipitated an improperly processed mutant (Pro709→ Gly) of P-glycoprotein (Fig. 5B). Immunoprecipitation of cell extracts with antibody to P-glycoprotein-A52 also resulted in the recovery of Hsc70 from cells transfected with cDNAs coding for wild-type or mutant Pro709→ Gly P-glycoprotein (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the molecular chaperone Hsc70 may also participate in the folding or quality control mechanism of P-glycoprotein biogenesis and that the various domains of P-glycoprotein may interact with specific chaperones during this process. Accordingly, coimmunoprecipitation assays were carried out to test for associations of the molecular chaperones calnexin and Hsc70 with the half-molecules, TMD, and NBF domains of P-glycoprotein. Fig. 6 shows that Hsc70 associates with both half-molecules of P-glycoprotein. This association is likely mediated through physical interaction with the nucleotide-binding domains since it was found that Hsc70 was present in the immune complexes from cells transfected with cDNAs coding for NBF1 or NBF2 and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52, but not in the immune complexes from cells expressing TMD1 or TMD2. In addition, immunoprecipitation with anti-Hsc70 antibodies showed that NBF1 or NBF2 were recovered in the immune complexes but not TMD1 or TMD2 (Fig. 7). The SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum was included as a control because it already contains the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52, and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in transfected mammalian cells (Maruyama et al., 1989). No Hsc70 was detected in the immune complexes from cells transfected with the cDNA coding for SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52 (Fig. 6). These results suggest that Hsc70 associations are specific.Figure 7:Domains of P-glycoprotein immunoprecipitated with Hsc70. HEK 293 cells expressing the various domains of P-glycoprotein and containing the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 or vector alone (Control) were solubilized with 1% (w/v) digitonin and the supernatant fraction immunoprecipitated with anti-Hsc70 monoclonal antibody. The immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody A52. The position of NBF1 and NBF2 are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A similar approach was used to test for association of calnexin with each domain of P-glycoprotein. Fig. 8 shows that calnexin also associates with both half-molecules. The association with P-glycoprotein appears to be mediated through the transmembrane domains, since it was detected only in the immune complexes of the TMD1 and TMD2 but not in those of the nucleotide-binding domains. Similarly, when cell extracts of transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin antibodies, followed by detection with monoclonal antibody A52, only the transmembrane domains were recovered (Fig. 9). The association also appeared to be specific since no detectable calnexin was found in the immune complexes from cells transfected with the cDNA coding for SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase (Fig. 8). These results show that calnexin associates with transmembrane domains, whereas Hsc70 associates with the nucleotide binding domains.Figure 9:Domains of P-glycoprotein immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin antibodies. HEK 293 cells expressing vector alone, or expressing individual domains of P-glycoprotein containing the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52, were solubilized with 1% (w/v) digitonin and the supernatant fractions immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified anti-calnexin antibody. The immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody A52. The positions of antibody (Ab) and the transmembrane domains (TMD1, TMD2) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Potential problems in a coimmunoprecipitation approach to study protein interactions are nonspecific associations and aggregation after lysis of the cells. To overcome these problems, incubations in the presence of antibody were for short periods (2 h). In addition, controls containing only one domain were run in parallel (Fig. 3). In each case, nonspecific aggregation was not observed. Indeed, we found that the associations between domains decreased with longer incubation periods (18 h). The associations were specific since there were no associations between NBF1 and TMD2 or between NBF2 and TMD1. Similarly, no associations were found between SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase and either NBF1, NBF2 or the NH2-half molecule (data not shown). These results indicate that there are specific noncovalent associations between the various domains of P-glycoprotein. An association between the two transmembrane domains was expected based on the results of photolabeling studies on P-glycoprotein. P-glycoprotein labeled with photoactive drug analogs followed by protease digestion revealed that the labeled fragments were from transmembrane domains from both homologous halves of P-glycoprotein (Bruggemann et al., 1989; 1992; Greenberger et al., 1991; Greenberger, 1993). About 50% of the label was found in each half of the molecule. In the presence of vinblastine, labeling of both halves was inhibited to a similar extent (Bruggemann et al., 1992). These results suggest that the labeling site is formed by both transmembrane domains. An association between the nucleotide-binding domains, however, was rather surprising since there is no evidence of cooperativity in the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein (Shapiro and Ling, 1994). Both nucleotide-binding domains appear to be capable of hydrolytic activity since low levels of ATPase activity could be detected when each half of P-glycoprotein was expressed as an individual polypeptides (Loo and Clarke, 1994b). An association was also observed between the nucleotide-binding domains and the transmembrane domains. These interactions may be especially important for coupling of ATPase activity to drug binding, and could be mediated through the large cytoplasmic loops connecting the transmembrane segments. A number of mutations have been identified in these loops which alter the drug resistance profiles conferred by P-glycoprotein (Choi et al., 1988; Currier et al., 1992; Loo and Clarke, 1994a) and alter the pattern of coupling of drug binding to ATPase activity (Rao, 1995). Associations among residues within the four domains provide a mechanism for coupling of drug binding to ATPase activity, which is likely to be a key feature of drug transport. Biosynthesis of the individual domains appears to be mediated through interactions of molecular chaperones. Association of calnexin with TMD1 is not surprising since this chaperone transiently associates with a wide variety of glycosylated proteins that are exported or targeted to the cell surface (reviewed by Bergeron et al.(1994)). TMD2, however, was also found to associate with calnexin, although we found no evidence that this domain was glycosylated. Other unglycosylated proteins have been identified which interact with calnexin, such as the nonglycosylated ɛ-subunit of the T-cell receptor (Rajagopalan et al., 1994). In addition, calnexin remains bound to the class I major histocompatibility complex molecules after removal of oligosaccharides by endoglycosidase H. Initiation of binding by calnexin to the class I complex, however, was recently shown to require the presence of oligosaccharides (Zhang et al., 1995b). Apparently calnexin recognizes both carbohydrate and protein determinants of selected proteins. The molecular chaperone Hsc70 specifically associated with the nucleotide-binding domains. This class of chaperones has been implicated in stabilizing newly synthesized polypeptides, in mediating assembly of multimeric protein complexes, and in facilitating translocation of polypeptides across membranes (see reviews by Gething and Sambrook(1992), McKay(1993), and Becker and Craig(1994). Although members of the Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone family are highly conserved, they show common and divergent specificities (Fourie et al., 1994). In general, they bind to a segment of the protein containing at least 7 residues that include large hydrophobic and basic amino acids with few or no acidic residues. The binding motif is best described as HyXHyXHyXHy, where Hy is a large hydrophobic or aromatic amino acid and X is any amino acid. There are several candidate regions in the nucleotide-binding domains of P-glycoprotein. For example, potential regions involved in interacting with Hsc/Hsp70 include residues 397-403 (VHFSYPS) in NBF1 and residues 1040-1046 (VVFNYPT) in the corresponding region of NBF2. Association of each domain with at least one molecular chaperone suggests that folding of P-glycoprotein is carefully monitored for fidelity. This may account for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum of a large number of mutant P-glycoproteins in which only a single amino acid has been substituted (Loo and Clarke, 1993a, 1993b, 1994a, 1995). 2T.

https://openalex.org/W2007436659,"CD20, a non-glycosylated cell-surface protein expressed exclusively on B lymphocytes, is one of a family of 4-pass transmembrane molecules that also includes the β chain of the high affinity receptor for IgE. The precise function of CD20 is unknown, although in vitro effects of CD20-specific antibodies on resting B cells indicate that it is able to transduce an extracellular signal affecting the G0/G1 cell cycle transition. Previous studies have demonstrated that CD20-initiated intracellular signals involve tyrosine kinase activation and that CD20 is tightly associated with both serine and tyrosine kinases. Here, analysis of CD20-associated molecules has revealed that CD20 is associated with the Src family tyrosine kinases p56/53lyn, p56lck, and p59fyn and with 75/80-kDa proteins phosphorylated in vivo on tyrosine residues. Mutagenesis of CD20 was performed to define regions of CD20 involved in intermolecular interactions. Mutants were analyzed in the human T lymphoblastoid cell line Molt-4, in which ectopically expressed wild-type CD20 associated with p59fyn, p56lck, and 75/80-kDa phosphoproteins. Deletion of major portions of the cytoplasmic regions of CD20 did not abolish its association with either p75/80 or tyrosine kinases. The interaction between CD20 and the Src-related kinases is therefore likely to be independent of CD20 cytoplasmic domains and may occur indirectly.

Growth and differentiation of B lymphocytes occurs primarily in the follicles and germinal centers of the spleen and lymph nodes and depends not only on contact with specific antigen but also upon co-stimulatory signals derived from accessory cell surface molecules. Accessory signals may be mediated by soluble factors such as IL-4 or by intercellular receptor-ligand interactions, such as the interaction between CD40 on B cells and its ligand on the surface of activated T cells(1Gold M.R.

Tyrosine kinase activation is a critical early component of signal transduction pathways initiated by the engagement of several cell surface receptors, including the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), CD19, and CD40(1Gold M.R. DeFranco A.L. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 221-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These receptors lack intrinsic kinase activity but are functionally, and in some cases physically, associated with non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Several tyrosine kinases expressed in B cells have been implicated in signal transduction events. Specifically, p72syk and the Src family members p53/56lyn, p59fyn, p55blk and p56lck have been found in association with the BCR complex, where they are thought to be involved in antigen-stimulated signal transduction(21Yamanashi Y.

Lyn and Lck have also been reported to associate with the CD19 complex(24Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B. Dibirdik I. Myers D.E. Tuel-Ahlgren L. Bolen J.B. J. Biol.

Tyrosine kinases can associate with the cytoplasmic regions of cell-surface molecules by several mechanisms. In this study, we sought to identify the tyrosine kinases associated with CD20 and to localize the site of interaction. We found specific association of Lyn, Fyn, and Lck tyrosine kinases with CD20, whereas no association with Blk, Btk, or Syk was observed. CD20 also coprecipitated a ~75/80-kDa doublet that was phosphorylated in vivo on tyrosine residues. When transfected into the human T lymphoblastoid line Molt-4, CD20 associated with Lck and Fyn, the only Src family kinases detected in these cells, and also with ~75-80-kDa proteins, suggesting that p75/80 or a closely related molecule is also expressed in T cells. Deletion of 49 of the 51 amino acids, which constitute the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail, and 45 of the ~85 amino acids of the carboxyl tail did not affect the ability of CD20 to associate with either p75/80 or PTK in Molt-4 cells. Deletion of an additional 37 residues at the carboxyl terminus or deletion of 8 of the 13 amino acids in the internal loop compromised the ability to detect CD20 at the cell surface. Despite the low level of surface CD20 expression caused by these deletions, CD20-associated kinase activity was detected. These results demonstrate that the majority of the cytoplasmic residues in CD20 are not required for its association with Src family kinases and suggest that the association is mediated by an additional molecule. p75/80 was coprecipitated by antibodies against Fyn, Lyn and, to a lesser extent, Lck, from CD20 complexes following their elution in 1% SDS, suggesting that p75/80 is tightly associated with these tyrosine kinases and may mediate their interaction with CD20. Monoclonal antibodies 2H7 (IgG2b, anti-CD20), G28.1 (IgG1, anti-CD37), and LB-2 (IgG2b, anti-CD54) have been described(9Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. Holly R.C. Dinndorf P.A. Shu G.

Precipitation of protein-tyrosine kinases was performed as above except that 2 μl of antiserum was added to cell lysates and mixed overnight at 4°C before adding protein A-Sepharose. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and then once in phosphate-buffered saline before addition of 30 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, separated on 8.5% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore). The filters were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin, incubated with antiserum, and then followed by washing, detection with protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and development by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham). Prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were run on each gel. Bands were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak X-OMAT film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immune complexes precipitated from cell lysates with protein A-Sepharose beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, twice in kinase buffer (20 mM Pipes, pH 7.2, 5 mM MnCl2, and 5 mM MgCl2), and resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham). Reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 15 min and then were stopped by the addition of 3 μl of 0.5 M EDTA. Samples were washed with lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, and run on 8.5% SDS-PAGE gels. For reprecipitation experiments, 125 μl of 1% SDS in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, was added to samples following the in vitro kinase reaction. Samples were heated to 95°C for 10 min, diluted to 0.1% SDS with lysis buffer, and cleared with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Repligen Corp.) for 1 h. Antisera (2 μl) or mAb (2 μg) was mixed with the samples for 16 h on ice, and then 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added for 1 h. Samples were then washed with lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, and run on 8.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Bands were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak X-OMAT film. Unless otherwise noted, exposures were at −70°C with intensifying screens. Deletions of the putative cytoplasmic tails and the internal loop region of CD20 was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction using the primer pairs listed in Table 1 and the CD20.6 cDNA template obtained from Dr. Ivan Stamenkovic (Charleston, MA). CD20.6 cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). To delete the amino-terminal, an internal unique EcoRI site at position 451 of the CD20 cDNA was used in combination with XhoI in the multiple cloning site of pBluescript to remove the 5′-end of CD20.6 cDNA. This region was then replaced with the XhoI-EcoRI-digested polymerase chain reaction product derived from primer pairs shown in Table 1. Similarly, to delete the carboxyl tail, the EcoRI site was used in combination with NotI in pBluescript to remove the 3′-end of CD20.6 cDNA. This region was then replaced with the EcoRI-NotI- or EcoRI-AflII-digested polymerase chain reaction product derived from primer pairs shown (Table 1). Deletion of 8 of the 13 amino acids constituting the putative internal loop was accomplished by replacing the XhoI-EcoRI fragment of CD20.6 cDNA with the digested polymerase chain reaction product from primer pairs shown. In this case the 3′-primer included sequence spanning the loop region but with bases encoding amino acids 107 through 114 deleted. The sequence of each construct was confirmed by dideoxy-DNA sequencing (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). All constructs were subcloned into the BCMGSneo mammalian expression vector(29Karasuyama H. Kudo A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 969-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab 4 × 106 Molt-4 cells were mixed with 20 μg of DNA and electroporated at 250 V and 500 microfarads across a 0.4-cm electrode chamber using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added at 0.8 mg/ml after 2 days, and individual clones were screened for CD20 expression after 3-4 weeks. Cells (~105) were suspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 2% horse serum, 0.01% sodium azide with 0.1 μg of 2H7, 1F5, or isotype-matched control mAb left on ice for 20 min, washed once, and resuspended for 20 min on ice with 100 μl of dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL). After washing, cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.01% azide and analyzed on a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson). CD20 was precipitated from lysates of the Raji human B cell line using mAb 2H7 and then subjected to an in vitro phosphorylation reaction in the presence of 32P-labeled γ-ATP and enolase, an exogenous substrate. Phosphorylated species of 50-60 kDa and 75-80 kDa were detected (Fig. 1A), shown previously by phosphoamino acid analysis to include phosphotyrosine(20Deans J.P. Schieven G.L. Shu G.L. Valentine M.A. Gilliland L.A. Aruffo A. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4494-4504PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, enolase was phosphorylated but not in control samples lacking CD20 mAb (Fig. 1A, lane 1), establishing that the kinase activity observed in CD20 precipitates was due to specifically precipitated kinase(s). Since anti-CD20 mAb 2H7 does not precipitate CD20 when added directly to cell lysates, the antibody was bound to whole cells prior to lysis. To investigate the possibility that the association of kinases with CD20 was induced by binding of 2H7 antibody to CD20 on intact cells, two types of experiments were performed. First, the effect of binding 2H7 mAb to the cells at physiologic temperatures versus ice-cold temperatures was compared: No difference in CD20-associated kinase activity was observed when antibody was bound at 37°C versus 0°C (Fig. 1B). Second, the B1 mAb, which is capable of binding to CD20 in detergent lysates as well as on intact cells(12Oettgen H.C. Bayard P.J. Van Ewijk W. Nadler J.M. Terhorst C.P. Hybridoma. 1983; 2: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Tedder T.F. McIntyre G. Schlossman S.F. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was used to determine if kinase activity could be precipitated with CD20 after cell lysis. B1 does not precipitate as much kinase activity from cells as does 2H7 for reasons that are not clear at present; however, B1 coprecipitated kinase activity from both cell lysates and whole cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that kinase activity was associated with CD20 prior to the addition of antibody. Additional proteins were observed in the kinase assay following CD20 precipitation from cell lysates when compared to precipitation from the cell surface (Fig. 1 C). To determine if CD20 is associated with proteins that are tyrosine phosphorylated in vivo, CD20 complexes were isolated from Raji cells, and the constituent proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. At least two bands in the range of 50-60 kDa were distinct from the heavy chain of the 2H7 mAb (Fig. 2, compare lanes 3 and 4). Proteins that migrated as a broad smear of 75-80 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 3) could be seen as two distinct bands in some experiments (Fig. 2B, lane 4). When two bands were visible, the lower one was always more heavily tyrosine phosphorylated as determined by reactivity with anti-phosphotyrosine. For comparison, Fig. 2B also shows immunoprecipitation of the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase. Immunoblotting of the filter shown in Fig. 2B with an antiserum against the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase demonstrated that the lowest of the major bands in lane 2 represented p85 (data not shown). No reactivity of anti-p85 with CD20-associated proteins was observed. Since most known tyrosine kinases can autophosphorylate, the CD20-associated PTK would most likely be represented by one or more of the bands observed following kinase assays performed on CD20 immune complexes. Candidate PTKs fall into 3 groups: p72syk/ZAP70; p77btk/itk, and the Src family (50-60 kDa)(31Bolen J.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2025-2031PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, ZAP70 and Itk were considered to be unlikely candidates on the basis of their low to undetectable expression in B lymphocytes(31Bolen J.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2025-2031PubMed Google Scholar). To test for the presence of Syk in CD20 complexes, filters containing mAb 2H7- or anti-Syk-precipitated proteins were probed with anti-Syk antiserum (Fig. 3A), then stripped and reprobed with anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3B). The results showed that although Syk is present in the B cells examined, CD20 immune precipitates contained no detectable Syk, and CD20-associated p75/80 migrated slightly slower than Syk (Fig. 3B). The second candidate kinase in the 75-80-kDa size range is Btk. Btk was expressed in Raji cells, as shown in Fig. 3, C and D, but anti-Btk did not detect p75/80 in immunoblots of 2H7 precipitates (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, Btk was not recovered from in vitro phosphorylated CD20 immune complexes (Fig. 3E). Thus, p75/80 did not appear to be either Syk or Btk. Several members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases are expressed in B cells and in B cell lines(32Mustelin T. Burn P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine which of these kinases were expressed in the Raji cell line, cell lysates were screened for the presence of Blk, Fyn, Hck, Lck, Lyn, and Yes by precipitation of each PTK using its specific antibody, followed by an in vitro kinase assay. The results showed that Raji cells express Blk, Lck, Lyn, and Fyn kinases (Fig. 4A). To determine which, if any, of these PTK were associated with CD20, 2H7 immunoprecipitates were first phosphorylated in an in vitro kinase reaction and then released from the Sepharose beads by boiling in 1% SDS and subjected to reprecipitation with antibodies against Blk, Lck, Lyn, and Fyn. The results demonstrated the presence of Lyn, Lck, and Fyn, but not blk, in the CD20 complex (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, p75/80 was also reprecipitated by Lyn and Fyn antisera and to a lesser extent by anti-Lck, despite prior disruption of the CD20 complex in 1% SDS. The presence of Lyn accounted for most of the PTK activity in the CD20 complex. The proportion of total cellular Lyn that coprecipitated with CD20 was estimated to be 3-5%, as determined by comparing the cpm associated with Lyn following reprecipitation from the CD20 complex, with that following direct precipitation of Lyn. This estimate is likely to be low due to partial loss of CD20-associated components during isolation of the complex and because the efficiency of reprecipitation of Lyn may be less than 100%. In control experiments, only 18-24% of Lyn precipitated by anti-Lyn was reprecipitated by the same antibody. Thus, the proportion of total cellular Lyn that is associated with CD20 could be 12-20% or more. To try and determine the site(s) of interaction between CD20 and associated kinases, we first needed to identify a cell line in which CD20, expressed ectopically by transfection, associated with Src-related tyrosine kinases. Attempts to express human CD20 in the murine B cell lines WEHI 231 and BAL 17 resulted in very low levels of expression of the protein at the cell surface, as determined by the ability of anti-human CD20 antibodies to bind to the transfected cells. However, in the human T lymphoblastoid cell line Molt-4, transfected CD20 was expressed at a level that was similar to that found in the B lymphoblastoid cell line, Raji. CD20 was precipitated from the cell surface of independently derived transfected Molt-4 clones and subjected to in vitro kinase assays; ATP was incorporated into 50-60- and 75-80-kDa proteins (Fig. 5A). Phosphoamino acid analyses demonstrated that all of the radioactive phosphate was coupled to tyrosine (data not shown). Molt-4 cells do not express p56/53lck but do express p59fyn and p56lck (data not shown), as is typical for T cells(31Bolen J.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2025-2031PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mustelin T. Burn P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both p59fyn and p56lck were recovered from the in vitro phosphorylated CD20 complexes (Fig. 5B), with Lck accounting for most of the PTK activity. A minor proportion of p75/80 coprecipitated with p59fyn and p56lck as previously observed in Raji cells. In some experiments, for example in Fig. 5B, lane 2, additional CD20-associated proteins were observed between 25 and 40 kDa and were reprecipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine. Src family kinases associate with the cytoplasmic regions of other transmembrane proteins by various means, including interactions involving Cys residues in the case of CD4 and CD8, with an acidic region in IL-2Rβ, and via ITAMs and proline-rich regions recognized by SH2 and SH3 domains, respectively(33Rudd C.E. Janssen O. Prasad K.V. Raab M. da Silva A. Telfer J.C. Yamamoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 239-266PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Hence, it was of interest to determine which cytoplasmic region of CD20 may be responsible for the observed association with Src family kinases. Each of the three cytoplasmic domains of CD20 was deleted in turn, and the deleted forms of CD20 were expressed by transfection in Molt-4 T cells. The amino-terminal tail was deleted, leaving three amino acids to anchor the first TM domain (NΔ50, Table 2). NΔ50 was expressed well on the surface of Molt-4 cells (Fig. 6). The internal loop region consists of 13 amino acids; 8 central residues were deleted, leaving 5 residues to anchor the 2nd and 3rd TM domains (ILΔ106-115, Table 2). This deletion impaired the expression of CD20 but was detectable at approximately 100-fold lower level than transfected wild-type CD20 (Fig. 6). The precise length of the carboxyl cytoplasmic tail is unclear. Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plots predict that the first cytoplasmic amino acid is Gln204 or Glu205(16Einfeld D.A. Brown J.P. Valentine M.A. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar); however, Glu205 is followed by a stretch of seven hydrophobic residues. The beginning of the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal region is therefore not clearly defined and may be 85 or 93 residues in length. The carboxyl tail was deleted at three sites. First, a deletion was made immediately upstream of acidic and proline-rich regions (residues 259-276 and 280-283, see Table 2) considered to be potential sites for kinase association. Second, CΔ222 deleted 75 residues, leaving either 10 or ~18 amino acids in the cytoplasm, depending on the precise location of TM4. CΔ222, like the internal loop deletion ILΔ106-115, was poorly expressed at ~100-fold lower level than wild-type CD20 (Fig. 6). A third carboxyl tail deletion was made terminating at Glu215. However, the expression of CΔ215 was undetectable at the cell surface (Fig. 6). As deletions at both sites (222 and 215) resulted in poor or no expression of CD20, the sequence between Gln204 and Thr252 may be important for either transport of CD20 to the cell surface or maintenance of the overall structure. The term “expression” as used here refers to expression of the epitope detected by mAb 2H7. In the case of the CΔ215 deletion, it is possible that only the 2H7 epitope was lost; however, a secon"

This is reminiscent of the response to stress of acute phase proteins. We have previously demonstrated that serum factors from rats with acute pancreatitis, but not from healthy rats, could induce endogenous PAP I gene expression in the acinar cell line AR-42J (Dusetti, N., Mallo, G., Dagorn, J.-C., Iovanna, J. L. (1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 204, 238-243). In the present work, we have evaluated the influence of several mediators of inflammation on rat PAP I gene transcription in these cells. Tumor necrosis factor α induced an increase in PAP I mRNA expression, and interferon γ caused an even greater increase in PAP I mRNA level. These stimulations were antagonized by dexamethasone. Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, or dexamethasone alone were ineffective. Combinations of IL-1 with IL-6 or dexamethasone were also ineffective. IL-6 and dexamethasone together induced a marked stimulation of PAP I gene transcription, and this effect was slightly attenuated by IL-1. To analyze the cis-regulatory elements responsible for the induction of transcription, we fused a 1.2-kilobase segment of the rat PAP I promoter to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene as reporter. The resultant chimeric DNA was transfected into AR-42J cells. Addition of IL-6 or dexamethasone was ineffective, whereas their mixture increased the CAT activity 12 times. Progressive deletions of the PAP I promoter were then fused to the CAT gene, and the constructs were transfected to AR-42J cells. A 12-fold increase in CAT activity was seen upon IL-6/dexamethasone treatment with constructs containing more than 274 base pairs upstream from the cap site. In that region, two sequences are similar to the canonical IL-6 response element. Site-directed mutagenesis of these regions strongly decreased induction, showing that they were functional. PAP I should therefore be classified among acute phase proteins of class 2, whose expression is increased by IL-6 acting in combination with glucocorticoids.

https://openalex.org/W1999319565,"The suprabasal keratin 6 (K6) is remarkable among the keratins as, in addition to being constitutively expressed in different stratified epithelia, it is induced in epidermis under hyperproliferative conditions, such as benign or malignant tumors, psoriasis, and wound healing. In addition, this keratin is also induced in skin treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or retinoic acid (RA). These characteristics make the study of K6 regulatory elements an especially interesting issue, in particular because these elements could be useful in designing gene constructs for the therapy of skin diseases. We have analyzed by mobility shift and footprinting experiments the cell type-specific enhancer of the bovine K6β gene (Blessing, M., Jorcano, J. L., and Franke, W. W.(1989) EMBO J. 8, 117-126) and have identified an AP-2-like element, two AP-1 elements (one of them composite), and a retinoic acid-responsive element (RARE). Mutagenesis experiments and cotransfections with retinoic acid receptors show that the RARE mediates enhancer activation by RA. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays show that under normal culture conditions, the AP-1 element retains most of the enhancer transcriptional activity, while the RARE and AP-2 are weakly active. However, following RA treatment, the AP-1 element is repressed and the RARE is activated, resulting in an overall stimulation of the enhancer by RA in the BMGE+H cells used in our study.

To identify such factors for Ng-CAM, the neuron-glia CAM, constructs containing portions of the 5′ end of the Ng-CAM gene were examined for activity after transfection into N2A neuroblastoma and NIH3T3 cells. Positive regulatory elements active in both cell types included an Ng-CAM proximal promoter with SP1 and cAMP response element motifs extending 447 base pairs upstream of a single RNA start site and a region within the first exon corresponding to 5′-untranslated sequences. Negative regulatory elements included five neuron-restrictive silencer elements (NRSEs) and a binding site for Pax gene products in a 305-base pair segment of the first intron. Constructs containing the promoter together with the entire first intron were active in N2A cells but were silenced in NIH3T3 cells. This silencer activity was mapped to the NRSEs. In contrast, the Pax motif inhibited activity of Ng-CAM constructs in both cell types.

Molecules of this Ng-CAM subfamily are expressed prominently in axonal pathways in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system and are involved in neurite fasciculation and outgrowth. Each of these neural CAMs has a characteristic spatial and temporal expression pattern during neural morphogenesis but the factors that restrict expression of Ng-CAM and other neural CAM genes to particular populations of neural cells are not well understood. cell adhesion molecule neuron-restrictive silencer elements chloramphenicol acetyltransferase glutathione S-transferase cAMP response element. To define the sequences of DNA responsible for place-dependent expression of CAMs, we have focused on signals from homeobox and Pax gene products(15Jones F.S. Prediger E.A. Bittner D.A.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20683-20686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During neural development, a number of transcriptional regulators encoded by the homeobox and Pax gene families appear in defined expression patterns along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes of the embryo that correlate with the patterns of a variety of CAMs. Moreover, mutations in Pax genes are known to alter the programs of neural differentiation and migration, processes that are influenced by the activity of neural CAMs. For example, mutations in Pax-6 and Pax-3 genes lead to developmental defects of the nervous system as shown, respectively, in small eye and splotch mutant mice(20Chalepakis G. Stoykova A. Wijnholds J. Tremblay P. Gruss P. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 1367-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Some of these defects appear to be caused by aberrant neuronal migration(21Moase C.E. Trasler D.G. Development. 1991; 113: 1049-1058PubMed Google Scholar, 22Matsuo T. Osumi-Yamashita N. Noji S.

Nature Gen. 1993; 3: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), a process normally modulated by neural CAMs. To examine the factors regulating Ng-CAM expression, we have isolated genomic clones containing the 5′ end of the Ng-CAM gene, characterized its proximal promoter, and located two regulatory regions within a 305-base pair segment of the first intron. One region of the first intron was found to contain five neuron-restrictive silencer elements (NRSEs) which extinguished expression of the Ng-CAM gene in a fibroblast cell line, but not a neuroepithelial cell line. Another region contained GTTCC and ATTA sequences characteristic of binding sites for Pax proteins. This Pax motif was found to bind Pax-3 in gel mobility shift experiments; such binding was disrupted when specific mutations were introduced in the ATTA sequence within the Pax motif. In transfection experiments with both NIH3T3 and N2A cells, this Pax motif was found to be a negative regulator of Ng-CAM gene expression independent of the silencing imposed by NRSEs. Our studies suggest that the NRSEs and Pax motif may play critical roles in the place-dependent expression of Ng-CAM in the nervous system. A chicken genomic DNA library in the cosmid vector pWE15 (Clontech) was screened using a 400-base pair 32P-labeled EcoRI-BstXI fragment derived from the 5′ end of the Ng-CAM cDNA sequence(3Burgoon M.P. Grumet M. Mauro V. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A single cosmid clone (Cos-Ng) was isolated. Sequencing of the 2536-base pair segment of Ng-CAM genomic DNA was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) (23Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar) and the data were compiled using the GCG package (University of Wisconsin). The NRSEs and the Pax motif were not revealed in conventional data base searches, but were found after analysis of Ng-CAM constructs in transfection experiments. Ng-CAM NRSEs were aligned with the consensus NRSE sequence (24Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) using the fasta algorithm(25Pearson W.R. Lipman Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9325) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were made using a 392 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Chatsworth, CA). The transcription start site was determined through a combination of primer extension and RNase protection analyses. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 12 day embryonic chick brains using the Fast Track mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). For primer extension, 4 μg of Poly(A)+ RNA was hybridized to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide designated oNg-7, derived from the antisense strand of the first exon of the Ng-CAM gene (Fig. 2, from position +185 to +166). Primer extension was performed using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc.) at 42°C for 1 h. RNase protection analysis was performed using the RPA II kit (Ambion). The template for the RNA probe was made by polymerase chain reaction from the genomic DNA. The downstream primer used for the amplification was Ng-7/T3-, an oligonucleotide identical in sequence to oNg-7, but also containing the T3 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5′ end. The upstream primer used in the polymerase chain reaction was an oligonucleotide designated oNg-6, derived from the sense strand of the Ng-CAM genomic sequence (Fig. 3, position −172 to −156). A labeled RNA probe was synthesized from the template using T3 RNA polymerase and [32P]UTP. Template DNA was then digested with RNase-free DNase. Two fmol of probe in elution buffer was mixed with 1 μg of Poly(A)+ RNA from 12 day embryonic chick brains and hybridized at 45°C for 16 h. RNase protection analysis was performed using different dilutions of RNase to determine the optimal conditions for cleavage. The products of both primer extension and RNase protection analysis were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Reporter gene plasmids were constructed in the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene vector pCAT-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) and pBluescript-II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and are shown schematically in Fig. 3. Ng447 and Ng447/182 plasmids were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA segments spanning the regions between −447 and +61 and −447 and +182, respectively, and were inserted into the pCAT basic vector (Promega). The Ng4, Ng1.5, and Ng200 plasmids containing 4 kilobases, 1.5 kilobases, and 200 base pairs of Ng-CAM gene 5′-flanking sequence, respectively, were made by insertion of appropriate restriction fragments into the pCAT-basic vector. The Ng447+I construct was made by insertion of a 2536-base pair BamHI-PvuII fragment into pBluescript and the CAT gene was inserted into the KpnI site immediately downstream. The constructs SgBsp, EE, EA, ES, and AS constructs containing internal deletions of the first intron were prepared by excision of SgrAI-BspMI, EcoRV-EcoRV, EcoRV-AatII, EcoRV-SmaI, and AatII-SmaI restriction fragments, respectively, from the Ng447+I construct followed by religation. Synthetic NRSE/Ng-CAM promoter constructs SS and SAS were prepared by insertion of the Ng-CAM NRSEs (the region between +1388 and +1566) in either orientation upstream of the promoter in the Ng447 construct. Mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% newborn calf serum. 2 × 105 cells were seeded onto 6-well 60-mm tissue culture plates (Corning) and grown until 50% confluency was attained. Each well of cells was transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA, in a mixture containing 6 μl of lipofectamine reagent in 1 ml of Opti-MEM media (Life Technologies, Inc.). The plasmid RSV-βgal (0.5 μg) was co-transfected in all experiments and served as an internal control to normalize the transfection efficiencies between different cell types and experiments. The Opti-MEM media was replaced after 6 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the appropriate serum. Cells were incubated for an additional 48-72 h, collected, and resuspended in 150 μl of 0.25 M Tris, pH 7.5. Cell extracts were prepared by freezing and thawing. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed using the Fluoreporter lacZ/galactosidase quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Levels of activity were measured using the Cytofluor 2350 fluorescence measurement system (Millipore). Cell extracts were assayed for CAT activity as described(26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Levels of CAT activity were quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The values for CAT activities reported for various Ng-CAM constructs were derived from at least four separate experiments performed in duplicate. Within such experiments, the activity levels for a given construct varied no more than 5%. Nuclear extracts were prepared from NIH3T3 and N2A cells as described previously(26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). The mouse Pax-3 cDNA (kindly provided by G. Chalepakis and P. Gruss of the Max-Planck Institute, Gottingen, Germany) was inserted into the pGEX-2T vector. GST and GST/Pax-3 fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli NM522 cells and purified as described previously(17Holst B.D. Goomer R.S. Wood I.C. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22245-22252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA fragment corresponding to the +82 to +182 region of the Ng-CAM gene was prepared by restriction endonuclease cleavage with SgrAI and BspMI. A 178-base pair DNA fragment containing the five NRSEs was prepared by excision of a HindIII fragment from the SS construct. The Pax motif probe was prepared by annealing 5 pmol of complementary oligonucleotides derived from the Pax motif of the Ng-CAM gene (+1679 to +1708). All probes were labeled using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I [32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) (DuPont NEN)(27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and purified by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. For binding reactions involving nuclear extracts, 5 fmol (approximately 20,000 cpm) of either +82/+182 or NRSE probe was mixed with 10 μg of protein from either NIH3T3 or N2A cells in a buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, 200 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 ng/ml poly(dI-dC) with 10 μg of bovine serum albumin. Competitors (either 10- or 100-fold excess of cold +82/+182 or NRSE DNAs) were included in some binding reactions. Binding components were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE buffer at 400 V for 2 h at 4°C. For binding reactions involving the Pax-3 fusion protein, 200,000 cpm of probe was incubated with 0.5, 2.5, or 5 μg of GST/Pax-3 fusion protein. Binding reactions were performed in a volume of 20 μl containing 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6.5% glycerol, 90 mM KCl, and 0.2 mM dithiothreitol. Bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml) and sheared salmon sperm DNA (100 ng) were added to each binding reaction to reduce nonspecific binding. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer at 200 V at 4°C. Gels were dried and exposed to film at −70°C. A cosmid clone (designated Cos-Ng) was isolated after screening with a 32P-labeled 400-base pair EcoRI-BstXI fragment derived from the 5′ end of the Ng-CAM cDNA sequence(3Burgoon M.P. Grumet M. Mauro V. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cos-Ng contained an insert approximately 20 kilobases in length. The borders for the first seven exons and introns were located by restriction mapping and Southern blotting and their sequences were determined using oligonucleotide primers derived from the Ng-CAM cDNA sequence (Fig. 1). To determine the site of transcription initiation within the Ng-CAM gene, we performed primer extension and RNase protection analyses of Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from chick brain tissue at embryonic day 12. Extension of an antisense oligonucleotide primer (oNg-7) yielded a single radiolabeled band of 185 nucleotides in length (data not shown). Two prominent bands were observed in an RNase protection experiment using a radiolabeled RNA probe corresponding to the region from −300 to +185. Because the primer extension and the largest RNase protection products had termini at exactly the same upstream base pair in the genomic sequence, the nucleotide at this position was designated +1, the start of transcription initiation (see Fig. 2). The DNA sequence of a 2536-base pair segment of the 5′ end of the Ng-CAM gene including the 5′-flanking sequence, the first exon, the first intron, and the second exon was determined (Fig. 2). This sequence has been deposited in GenBank under accession number U31086. Several potential regulatory motifs were found in the 5′-flanking region immediately adjacent to and upstream of the RNA start site. They included two consensus binding sites for the SP1 transcription factor (28Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Nature. 1985; 316: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) located at −124 and −15 as well as a consensus cyclic AMP response element (CRE), located at −255, which is known to bind members of the CREB family of transcription factors(29Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). After analyses of deletion constructs in transfection experiments, additional elements were located in a 178-base pair segment of the first intron (+1388 to +1566) that included five copies of a sequence similar to that of the NRSE. Further analysis also uncovered a 30-base pair element (+1679 to +1708) similar to that of a binding site for Pax gene products(20Chalepakis G. Stoykova A. Wijnholds J. Tremblay P. Gruss P. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 1367-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Chalepakis G. Fritsch R. Fickenscher H. Deutsch V. Goulding M. Gruss P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8355-8361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This Ng-CAM Pax motif contains GTTCC and ATTA core sequences characteristic of a target sequence recognized by those Pax proteins that contain two independent DNA binding domains, paired domain and a homeodomain(20Chalepakis G. Stoykova A. Wijnholds J. Tremblay P. Gruss P. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 1367-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 32Chalepakis G. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12745-12749Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To locate the regions important for regulation of the Ng-CAM gene, 14 different reporter constructs were prepared and tested in transient transfection experiments in two mouse cell lines, N2A neuroblastoma cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts. N2A cells express a number of neural CAMs including N-CAM and L1, a property suggesting that they may be well suited for assaying the expression of Ng-CAM constructs. NIH3T3 fibroblasts were selected as cells in which Ng-CAM constructs were expected to show little or no activity. The various Ng-CAM reporter constructs and observed CAT activities in N2A and NIH3T3 cells are summarized in Fig. 3. Five reporter constructs containing different lengths of 5′-flanking sequence (see Fig. 3, constructs Ng4, Ng1.5, Ng447, Ng200, Ng447/182) were constitutively active in both NIH3T3 and N2A cells. The Ng447 construct, containing 447 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequence and 61 base pairs of the first exon, was approximately 2-fold more active than Ng4 and Ng1.5 in N2A cells, but not in NIH3T3 cells. The proximal promoter region within this construct contained two consensus binding sites for the SP1 transcription factor and a CRE. The Ng200 construct, in which the promoter region between −447 and −200 containing the CRE sequence was deleted, showed 3-fold less activity in both NIH3T3 and N2A cells than the Ng447 construct. This result indicated that regulatory elements between −200 and −447 are required for basal promoter activity. The promoterless CAT vector, pCAT-Basic (Bas) showed little, if any, activity in both cell types. A construct designated Ng447/182, containing the entire first exon was approximately 2-fold more active than the Ng447 construct in both NIH3T3 and N2A cells. These data suggested that the segment between +61 and +182 is a positive regulatory region of the Ng-CAM gene. A construct designated Ng447+I, containing the Ng-CAM proximal promoter together with the entire first exon, first intron, and a portion of the second exon was active in N2A cells but was completely silent in NIH3T3 cells. This finding suggested that sequences within the first intron of the Ng-CAM gene were capable of silencing the gene in non-neuronal cells. To pinpoint the sequences that silenced Ng-CAM gene expression in NIH3T3 cells, we examined various constructs having deletions of segments of the first intron of the Ng-CAM gene for loss of silencing in transfection experiments. Constructs with deletions of the NRSEs were tested in both NIH3T3 and N2A cells (Fig. 3). The Ng-CAM NRSEs show a high degree of similarity with the NRSE consensus sequence, but they are all in the orientation of the reverse complement from that found in the other genes (Fig. 4). Two constructs, designated EE and EA, which eliminated NRSEs1-4 and NRSEs1-5, respectively, showed an increase in activity (i.e. loss of silencer activity) as compared to the 447+I construct. The same deletion constructs showed only a slight increase in activity in N2A cells. To examine whether the NRSEs were sufficient for silencing of the Ng-CAM proximal promoter, constructs were prepared in which the five NRSEs were placed upstream of the Ng447 region of the Ng-CAM gene linked to a CAT reporter. Two constructs were prepared in which the NRSEs were present either in the orientation normally found in the gene (SAS) or in the opposite orientation (SS). The SAS and SS constructs were both silent in NIH3T3 cells, showing CAT activities that were comparable to the Ng447+I and pCAT-Basic constructs (Fig. 3). However, in N2A cells, the SAS and SS constructs were highly active and showed no reduction of Ng-CAM proximal promoter activity. These studies suggest that, while the NRSEs are sufficient to silence Ng-CAM promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells, they do not show silencing in N2A cells. To test whether the Pax motif had an effect on Ng-CAM expression, three constructs were prepared and examined for activity (Fig. 3). A construct designated AS, having a 145-base pair deletion which removed the Pax motif, showed increased activity (i.e. a release from silencing) as compared to the Ng447+I construct. The AS deletion showed a release from silencing in both NIH3T3 and N2A cells (Fig. 3, compare AS to Ng447+I). The same effects were observed in a construct in which the GTTCC and ATTA sequences within the Ng-CAM Pax motif were deleted (see the construct designated Pax, Fig. 3). A construct designated ES, in which both the NRSEs and the Pax motif were removed was more active than all other deletion constructs in NIH3T3 cells. The effects of the NRSEs and the Pax region were additive, i.e. the level of activity from the ES construct was approximately equal to the sum of activities from the EA and AS constructs. The combined data suggest that, in some contexts, the NRSEs and the Pax motif may act together to regulate expression of the Ng-CAM gene. To examine whether nuclear protein factors could bind to the various regulatory regions of the Ng-CAM gene, we conducted a series of gel mobility shift experiments using two segments of the Ng-CAM gene shown in these studies to be important for regulation in cellular co-transfection experiments: 1) the +82/+182 region, and 2) the NRSE region. Using the +82/+182 probe, a DNA-protein complex was detected using nuclear extracts prepared from both NIH3T3 and N2A cells (Fig. 5, panels A and B, lane 2). Formation of these complexes was inhibited when an excess of cold +82/+182 competitor was added (Fig. 5, panels A and B, lanes 3 and 4), but not when an excess of cold NRSE competitor was added (Fig. 5, panels A and B, lanes 5 and 6) to binding reactions. Binding experiments using the NRSE region as probe detected a clear cut DNA-protein complex with nuclear extracts prepared from NIH3T3 cells and a slight, but detectable complex with proteins from N2A cells (Fig. 5, panels C and D, lane 2). Formation of the NRSE-protein complex (particularly evident in NIH3T3 cells) was inhibited with an excess of cold NRSE competitor (Fig. 5C, lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, the +82/+182 segment did not compete for the formation of the NRSE-protein complex (Fig. 5, panels A-D, lanes 5 and 6). Similar competition experiments performed in N2A cells showed no diminution of the faint signal, regardless of the competitor used (Fig. 5D, compare the band intensities in lanes 5 and 6 with those in lanes 2, 3, and 4). These results suggested that proteins that bind to the NRSE are much more abundant in NIH3T3 cells than in N2A cells. Furthermore, the nuclear proteins bound by the +82/+182 and the NRSE regions of the Ng-CAM gene appear to be different. To date, no target gene containing a binding sequence for Pax-3 has been identified in vertebrates. To determine whether the Pax motif in the first intron of the Ng-CAM gene could bind directly to Pax-3, we prepared a GST/Pax-3 fusion protein in bacteria. We tested this protein in gel mobility shift experiments for binding to the Ng-CAM Pax motif and to variants of this motif containing substitutions in the base pairs important for recognition of the DNA binding moieties of Pax proteins. Pax-3 was chosen for these experiments for two reasons. First, Pax-3 is known to be expressed during periods of neuronal differentiation and migration that coincide with Ng-CAM expression by postmitotic neurons(20Chalepakis G. Stoykova A. Wijnholds J.

Its cDNA has been cloned from cucumber seedlings (Sano, S., and Asada, K.(1994) Plant Cell Physiol. 35, 425-437), and a plasmid was constructed in the present study that allowed a high level expression in Escherichia coli of the cDNA-encoding MDA reductase using the T7 RNA polymerase expression system.

INTRODUCTIONSince the first isolation of ascorbate (AsA) 1The abbreviations used are: AsAascorbateDTNB5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)IPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactosideMDAmonodehydroascorbate radicalpCMBp-chloromercuribenzoateMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidbis-tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. from Hungarian red pepper (Svirbery and Szent-Györgyi, 1933), it has been established that AsA functions as an antioxidant and protects cells from oxidative stress. The level of AsA in plant cells, as postulated from its initial isolation from plant tissues, is high as compared to that in mammalian cells, and an AsA-specific peroxidase scavenges hydrogen peroxide. In mammalian cells, by contrast, a selenium-containing glutathione peroxidase plays a major role (Asada, 1992). When AsA acts as an antioxidant in cells, in most cases, monodehydroascorbate radicals (MDA) are produced as the primary oxidation product. AsA peroxidase in plants generates MDA when it scavenges hydrogen peroxide (Hossain et al., 1984), as do guaiacol peroxidases such as horseradish peroxidase (Yamazaki and Piette, 1961). Superoxide and hydroxyl radicals oxidize AsA to MDA. Other organic oxidizing radicals, such as tocopherol chromanoxy, carbon-centered, aminooxy, peroxy, and phenoxy radicals, are generated under oxidative stress and generate MDA via their interactions with AsA (Bielski, 1982). The glutathione thiol radical is produced by the interaction of GSH with various radicals (Winterbourn, 1993), and it generates MDA as a result of its reaction with AsA (Forni et al., 1983). Thus, the MDA radical functions as a “sink” for radicals and active species of oxygen that are generated in cells under oxidative stress. In addition, MDA is generated via the autooxidation of AsA (Scarpa et al., 1983) and via the spontaneous oxidation of AsA by electron carriers such as cytochrome c, cytochrome b5, and cytochrome b561. Furthermore, MDA is produced during the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by AsA oxidase (Yamazaki and Piette, 1961), thyroid peroxidase (Nakamura and Ohtaki, 1993), and dopamine β-monooxygenase (Dhariwal et al., 1991). De-epoxidation of violaxanthine to zeaxanthine in chloroplasts seems to be associated with a photoprotective function, and MDA is very probably generated in this reaction since AsA is required for the de-epoxidation reaction (Yamamoto et al., 1972).To maintain the antioxidant activity of AsA, the regeneration of AsA from MDA is obviously indispensable. For example, in leaf cells, AsA is found at or above 10 mM in chloroplasts. However, from rates of the photoproduction of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, it can be calculated that the AsA in chloroplasts is consumed within 80 s if no system in regeneration of AsA is operative in illuminated chloroplasts (Asada, 1994). Furthermore, several enzymes are inactivated by MDA (Davison et al., 1986, Harwood et al., 1986), and the toxicity of AsA to cells (Stich et al., 1976) might be attributable to MDA. Thus, it is essential to maintain a low steady state concentration of the MDA radical in cells.The NADPH-dependent activity for regeneration of AsA from MDA has been found in mammalian tissue, but the enzyme that catalyzes the regeneration has not been yet purified. Cytochrome b561 and cytochrome b5 reductase can reduce MDA (Iyanagi and Yamazaki, 1969; Nishino and Ito, 1986; Njus and Kelly, 1993), but the reactivity of MDA with reduced cytochrome b5 reductase is several orders of magnitude lower than that of plant MDA reductase (Kobayashi et al., 1991). The activity for the reduction of MDA, with NAD(P)H as the electron donor, has been found in plants, and it is not only in chloroplasts (Hossain et al., 1984) but also in nonphotosynthetic tissues (Arrigoni et al., 1981; Bowditch and Donaldson, 1990) and in algae (Shigeoka et al., 1987; Miyake et al., 1991). It has also been demonstrated that the photoreduced ferredoxin in photosystem I of chloroplast thylakoids can reduce MDA at a high rate (≈107M-1 s-1), which would contribute to the regeneration of AsA in the thylakoidal system for scavenging of hydrogen peroxide (Miyake and Asada, 1994).MDA reductase is the first known enzyme that uses an organic radical as the substrate, and it catalyzes the following reaction: 2MDA + NAD(P)H + H+→ 2AsA + NAD(P)+.The enzyme has been purified from cucumber fruits (Hossain and Asada, 1985), soybean root nodules (Dalton et al., 1992), and potato tubers (Borraccino et al., 1986), and it has been characterized to be an FAD-enzyme with a molecular mass of 47 kDa. We have cloned cDNA for a cytosolic isozyme of MDA reductase from cucumber, and the entire sequence of its amino acid residues has been predicted from the nucleotide sequence. The sequence includes FAD and NAD(P) binding domains but exhibits only limited homology, in terms of amino acid sequence, to other flavoenzymes, even those from plants. It exhibits a greater homology to flavoenzymes from prokaryotes, such as putidaredoxin reductase and rubredoxin reductase (Sano and Asada, 1994). The sequence of amino acid residues of MDA reductase from pea has been deduced from its cDNA, and it also shows limited homology to other flavoenzymes (Murthy and Zilinskas, 1994). Thus, the unusual nature of MDA reductase is emphasized by its substrate, an organic radical, and also by the absence of similar flavoenzymes in mammalian and fungi.For further characterization of the molecular properties of this enzyme, we established a system for high expression of native MDA reductase of cucumber in Escherichia coli. The coding region of the cDNA for the cytosolic isozyme of MDA reductase was inserted into a plasmid under the control of the T7 promoter, and the MDA reductase produced in E. coli was purified. The present communication describes the high expression of MDA reductase in E. coli, and purification and characterization of molecular properties of the enzyme.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of the Expression PlasmidPlasmid pCMR31KS+ was derived from pBluescript II KS+ by insertion of the cDNA for cucumber MDA reductase, as described previously (Sano and Asada, 1994). The cDNA insert has two NcoI sites, one of which includes the first Met codon of the open reading frame. The plasmid was digested with NotI and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and dNTPs. The resultant linear DNA (14 μg) was partially digested with 10 units of NcoI at 37°C for 15 min and was separated with agarose-gel electrophoresis to purify the 1.3-kilobase fragment of the cDNA digested only at NcoI site including the authentic initiation codon.pET-8c (Studier et al., 1990), in which a unique NcoI site contains the first codon of the φ10 gene adjacent to a T7 promoter, was used as the plasmid vector. pET-8c was digested with BamHI and blunt-ended by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase and dNTPs. It was digested with NcoI and dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase.Two DNA fragments described above had one NcoI cohesive end and one blunt end each and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. After transformation of competent E. coli DH5α cells with the ligated DNA, plasmid DNA from ampicillin-resistant colonies was prepared and examined by restriction digestion to confirm that the construction was correct. The expression plasmid is referred to as pET-CMR (Fig. 1).Bacterial Culture for Production of Cucumber MDA ReductaseCells of E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Studier et al., 1990), which contains a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the lacUV5 promoter, were transformed with pET-CMR and inoculated into LB medium that contained 50 μg ml-1 ampicillin. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside (IPTG) (1 mM) was added to the culture medium 2 h after the start of the incubation at 37°C, when OD550 was between 0.1 and 0.2, and the bacteria were grown for various additional times at 37°C.Preparation of the Bacterial Extract for AnalysisFor analysis of whole cells, pelleted cells obtained by centrifugation from 1 ml of culture were suspended in 100 μl of the loading buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and boiled for 3 min. For analysis of the soluble fraction, cells were suspended in one-tenth volume of extraction buffer (0.2 M HEPES-NaOH, pH 6.8, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM EDTA) and sonicated twice by a Branson sonifier with a microtip at 3 Å for 5 s with 1-min cooling intervals on ice. The sonicated cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was used as the soluble fraction.Purification of MDA Reductase That Was Highly Expressed in E. coliE. coli (strain BL21 (DE3)) cells that had been transformed with pET-CMR were grown in 20 ml of the LB medium that contained 50 μg ml-1 ampicillin. After cells had reached late-logarithmic phase, the starter culture was inoculated to 2 liters of the same medium. After a 12-h incubation at 37°C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with the extraction buffer, and stored at −20°C. The frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in 200 ml of the extraction medium that contained 10 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The suspended cells were disrupted with a French pressure cell operated at about 500 kg cm-2. The disrupted cells were sonicated four times with a Branson sonifier with a standard tip at 10 Å for 20 s at 50% duty, with 1-min cooling intervals on ice, to disperse nucleic acids. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate (40-80% saturation). The precipitated proteins were dissolved in 50 ml of the buffer A (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mM EDTA) that contained ammonium sulfate at 40% saturation. The enzyme solution was loaded on a column of TSKgel Butyl-Toyopearl 650 (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan; 26 mm inside diameter × 300 mm) that had been equilibrated with buffer A plus ammonium sulfate at 40% saturation. After washing of the column with 2 volumes of the equilibration medium, a 450-ml linear gradient from 40% to 0% saturation with ammonium sulfate in buffer A was applied. Peak fractions containing MDA reductase were pooled and dialyzed four times against three liters of buffer B (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mM EDTA).The dialyzed enzyme was then applied to a column of Q Sepharose High Performance 26/10 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that had been equilibrated with buffer B. After extensive washing of the column with buffer B, the enzyme was eluted by a 150-ml linear gradient from 0 to 0.2 M KCl in buffer B. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and equilibrated with buffer B by ultrafiltration through a PM-10 membrane filter (Amicon). Above column chromatographies were performed with a fast-protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden).CrystallizationCrystals were grown by the hanging drop method in plastic cell culture plates with siliconized coverslips. Each droplet contained 2 μl of a solution of MDA reductase (12 mg ml-1) in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6, and 2 μl of Crystal Screen precipitant (Hampton Research, Riverside, CA). Each droplet was hung over a 0.7-ml reservoir of the corresponding precipitants. The cell culture plates were incubated at 17°C.Western BlottingProteins in bacterial extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF Protein Sequencing Membrane, Bio-Rad). The membrane was reacted with the first antibody (raised in rabbit against MDA reductase purified from cucumber fruits) and then with the second antibody (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody raised in goat against rabbit IgG; Jackson Immunoresearch). After washing, color was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium.Assays of Enzyme and ProteinThe activity of MDA reductase was measured as described by Hossain and Asada(1985). One unit of MDA reductase was defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidizes 1 μmol of NADH min-1 in the presence of 3 μM MDA, generated by the AsA-AsA oxidase system. Concentrations of protein were determined with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 using bovine serum albumin as the standard, as described by Bradford(1976). The concentration of purified MDA reductase was determined on the assumption that its absorption coefficient at 450 nm is 9.63 mM-1 cm-1 (Hossain and Asada, 1985).Stopped-flow AnalysisMDA reductase and NADH, both in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH at pH 7.8, were rapidly mixed in a Union Giken stopped-flow rapid reaction analyzer (model RA-401, Osaka, Japan) in a 2-mm reaction cell. The reduction of the FAD of MDA reductase by NADH was followed by monitoring the decrease in the absorbance at 452.9 nm after rapid mixing.Determination of Thiol GroupsTo block the thiol groups of MDA reductase (37.3 nmol in 1 ml of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6), the enzyme was incubated with 55.5 nmol of p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB). The number of exposed thiol groups in the native enzyme was determined from the increase in absorbance at 410 nm upon the addition of 0.1 mM 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to 14 nmol of MDA reductase in 1 ml of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6 (Ellman, 1959). The total number of thiol groups per molecule of the enzyme was determined by incubation of the enzyme in 0.5% (w/v) SDS. The absorption coefficient at 410 nm of 3-carboxy-4-nitrothiophenolate, which is the product of the reaction of DTNB with a thiol group, was assumed to be 13,600 M-1 cm-1 (Ellman, 1959).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONExpression of Recombinant MDA Reductase in E. coli and Its PurificationThe proteins from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, cultured in LB medium, were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. A distinct band of protein with the molecular mass predicted from the open reading frame of the cDNA (47 kDa) was detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (data not shown) in the lanes that correspond to the cells that harbored pET-CMR and confirmed to be MDA reductase by Western blotting in the extracts from cultures incubated both in the presence and the absence of IPTG (Fig. 2). Thus, T7 RNA polymerase was expressed in a leaky manner without induction by IPTG, and it transcribed the cDNA for MDA reductase on the plasmid. Fragmentation of MDA reductase probably by proteases may have occurred in E. coli both in the presence and absence of IPTG when the cells were cultured for more than 2 h (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Detection of MDA reductase of cucumber by Western blotting with antibody against MDA reductase from cucumber fruits after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The E. coli cells from 1 ml of culture at 37°C were suspended in 100 μl of loading buffer for electrophoresis and boiled for 3 min. The extract of whole cells (2 μl) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lanes 1-3, bacteria without plasmids; lanes 4-6, bacteria that harbored pET-CMR; lanes 1 and 4, incubated for 2 h without IPTG; lanes 2 and 5, incubated for 4 h without IPTG; lanes 3 and 5, incubated for 2 h without IPTG and for an additional 2 h in the presence of 1 mM IPTG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A soluble fraction from the cells transformed with pET-CMR, prepared after incubation for various times in LB medium in the presence and absence of IPTG, catalyzed the NADH-dependent reduction of MDA, but that from cells without the plasmid did not. Although the amount of MDA reductase expressed in E. coli cells in response to IPTG was larger than that in noninduced cells, as determined by Western analysis, higher activity of MDA reductase was found in the soluble fraction when cells were incubated in LB medium for 12 h without the induction by IPTG than after induction by IPTG (data not shown). A larger fraction of the MDA reductase protein, expressed in the induced cells, might have formed insoluble inclusion bodies in the latter case. We observed the maximal activity of MDA reductase under the culture conditions described under “Materials and Methods.”A soluble extract of E. coli cells that harbored pET-CMR and had been cultured in LB medium at 37°C for 12 h without induction has a specific activity of about 40 units mg of protein-1, which was about 80-fold higher than that in extracts of cucumber fruits. MDA reductase accounted for nearly 20% of the soluble protein in the E. coli cells. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a simple procedure with a yield of about 45 mg from 2 liters of culture, as summarized in Table 1. The analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme gave a molecular mass of 47 kDa, as expected from the open reading frame of the cDNA (Sano and Asada, 1994), and the specific activity of the purified enzyme was similar to that of MDA reductase purified from cucumber fruits (Hossain and Asada, 1985). The purified enzyme was stable for at least 6 months when stored at −85°C in 10 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mM EDTA. Recombinant MDA reductase crystallized as yellow needles in a precipitant that contained 0.2 M calcium acetate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 over the course of 2 weeks (Fig. 3).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 3:Crystals of MDA reductase of cucumber highly expressed in E. coli. Bar represents 200 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Spectral and Redox PropertiesThe purified recombinant MDA reductase showed an absorption spectrum in the visible region very similar to that of the enzyme purified from cucumber fruits (Hossain and Asada, 1985) (Fig. 4), but the absorbance of a shoulder at 476 nm was higher, and a slight blue shift of the absorption peaks of flavin (442 and 476 nm) was seen as compared with the spectrum of the enzyme from cucumber fruits (447.3 and 475 nm). The anaerobic addition of 0.96 mol of NADH per mol of the enzyme-bound FAD yielded the spectrum of the fully reduced enzyme, as reported by Hossain and Asada(1985), without formation of a stable semiquinone or intermediate (Fig. 4). Thus, the enzyme accepts two electrons from NADH per molecule of the enzyme-bound FAD, indicating that the FAD is the only redox group associated with the enzyme. The reduced enzyme existed as a charge-transfer complex between NAD+ and reduced flavin, since its spectrum has a characteristic flat region from 500 to 700 nm.Figure 4:Anaerobic titration of recombinant MDA reductase with NADH. Oxidized MDA reductase (62.6 nmol) in 1 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, was rendered anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with argon in an optical cell used for anaerobic titration (Iyanagi et al., 1974). Nitrogen was passed at a low rate through the gas lock that protected the cell unit from air, and the enzyme was titrated with 5 mM NADH in the same buffer with a gas-tight Hamilton microsyringe. The absorption spectra from the top to the bottom correspond to those of the enzyme after the addition of 0, 0.16, 0.32, 0.48, 0.64, 0.80, and 0.96 eq of NADH relative to the enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The fully reduced enzyme was then back-titrated with the MDA radical, which was continuously generated by the AsA-AsA oxidase system (Fig. 5). The reduced enzyme was completely oxidized when 2.18 mol of MDA radicals were generated per mol of MDA reductase. During the oxidation process, the absorption spectrum of the semiquinone form could not be detected, although a blue-shifted peak of the oxidized flavin around 370 nm was observed at an early stage of the oxidation.Figure 5:Back-titration of reduced recombinant MDA reductase with the MDA radical. Oxidized MDA reductase (50.3 nmol) in 1 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, that contained 0.5 mM AsA (spectrum 1), was first reduced with 1.01 molar eq of NADH (spectrum 2). The reduced enzyme was then titrated with the MDA radical, which was generated by the reaction catalyzed with 5 microunits of AsA oxidase at 5 nmol min-1 under aerobic conditions, and absorption spectra were recorded 4 min, 8 min, 12 min, 16 min, and 20 min after the addition of AsA oxidase. Finally, 22 min after the addition of AsA oxidase, when the accumulated production of MDA had reached 110 nmol, MDA reductase had the same spectrum as the oxidized enzyme (spectrum 1). Scanning time: 100 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Spectrum of the Flavosemiquinone FormFlavoenzymes reduced by two electrons are oxidized by electron acceptors via a semiquinone form (Strittmatter, 1965). Most flavoenzymes form either a blue or a red semiquinone independently of the external pH with the exception of glucose oxidase (Massey and Palmer, 1966). The blue semiquinone reflects a hydrogen bond between an amino acid residue and N-5 of the flavin, and the red semiquinone reflects one between an amino acid residue and N(1)-C(2)-O of the flavin (Massey and Hemmerich, 1980).The electron acceptor of MDA reductase is the MDA radical, and the NADH-reduced enzyme should be oxidized via two successive oxidations by two MDA radicals. Therefore, the semiquinone form of the enzyme should be formed as an intermediate, but static titration of the reduced enzyme did not allow us to show a spectrum of the semiquinone. Flavoproteins can be reduced by illumination under anaerobic conditions in the presence of EDTA as the electron donor (Massey and Palmer, 1966). The semiquinone form is stabilized by binding of NAD+ as a catalytic intermediate, as shown for ferredoxin-NADP reductase (Keirns and Wang, 1972), adrenodoxin reductase (Kitagawa et al., 1982), and cytochrome b5 reductase (Iyanagi, 1977). The spectrum of the NADH-reduced MDA reductase indicates the formation of a stable charge-transfer complex (Fig. 4), as in the case of cytochrome b5 reductase (Iyanagi, 1977). Therefore, photoreduction of MDA reductase was performed in the presence of NAD+ at a molar ratio of 1:1 with the enzyme under anaerobic conditions using EDTA as the electron donor. During illumination, a new spectrum with a peak at 370 nm and a flat absorption in the long-wavelength region was generated (Fig. 6). This spectrum is characteristic of NAD+-bound, red semiquinone forms in flavoenzymes of the dehydrogenase-oxidase group (Massey and Hemmerich, 1980). Thus, the NAD+ bound semiquinone, which can infer the spectrum change at an early stage of oxidation of the reduced enzyme by MDA (Fig. 5).Figure 6:Photoreduction of recombinant MDA reductase under anaerobic conditions in the presence of EDTA. MDA reductase (74.7 nmol) in 1 ml of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6, that contained 50 mM EDTA and 75 μM NAD+ was rendered anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with argon, and it was illuminated with a 650-watt tungsten lamp at 10°C. The absorption spectra of the photoreduced enzyme were recorded at the indicated times after the start of illumination.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thiol GroupsMDA reductase is inhibited by thiol-modifying reagents (Hossain and Asada, 1985, Borraccino et al., 1986, Dalton et al., 1992, Murthy and Zilinskas, 1994) and it contains two Cys residues, at positions 69 and 198, of the enzyme from cucumber and also from pea (Sano and Asada, 1994, Murthy and Zilinskas, 1994). The addition of DTNB to the recombinant MDA reductase caused rapid and slow increases in absorbance at 410 nm, which corresponded to 0.63 and 1.4 mol of thiol groups per mol of enzyme 10 min and 5 h after the addition of DTNB, respectively. Thus, one thiol group in the native enzyme reacted rapidly with DTNB, but the remaining one reacted only slowly. By contrast, when the enzyme was incubated with DTNB in 0.5% (w/v) SDS for 10 min, an increase in absorbance at 410 nm occurred that corresponded to 1.8 mol of thiol groups per mol of enzyme, as expected from the predicted sequence. Thus, the two Cys residues predicted from the cDNA (Cys-69 and −198) do not form a disulfide bridge.Preincubation of recombinant MDA reductase with 1.5 mol eq of pCMB for 10 min inhibited the reduction of FAD by NADH, as determined by the decrease in absorbance at 450 nm (Fig. 7), as is the case for the enzyme purified from cucumber fruits (Hossain and Asada, 1985). Thus, one Cys residue seems to participate in the reduction of the enzyme-FAD by NADH. Neither of the two Cys residues in MDA reductase is conserved in other flavin-containing oxidoreductases (Sano and Asada, 1994), and it is not known which Cys residue reacts rapidly with thiol reagents and participates in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the FAD. Cys-198 of the enzyme from cucumber is located near the putative NADH binding domain (Sano and Asada, 1994) and could participate in electron transfer between NADH and the enzyme-FAD.Figure 7:Blockage of the transfer of electron from NADH to recombinant MDA reductase-FAD by preincubation of the enzyme with pCMB. The spectra of the recombinant MDA reductase (37.3 nmol) were recorded in 1 ml of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6, under aerobic conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1983262447,"The acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) gene contains two distinct promoters, denoted PI and PII. PI is responsible for the generation of class I ACC mRNAs which are induced in a tissue-specific manner under lipogenic conditions. PII generates class II ACC mRNAs which are expressed constitutively. During 30A5 preadipocyte differentiation, both promoters are activated; the preadipocytes must be pretreated with cAMP for this activation to occur. In this report, we present evidence that CAAT enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBP-β) is induced and involved in the PI activation by cAMP. Expression of the reporter gene under the control of the PI promoter is activated within 3 h after treatment of 30A5 cells with a cyclic AMP analogue, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, in association with the accumulation of C/EBP-β mRNA and protein. These accumulations were inhibited in the presence of H8, a protein kinase inhibitor; H8 also inhibited activation of PI by cAMP. However, the induction of reporter gene expression and the increase of C/EBP-β mRNA by cAMP were not affected by treatment with tumor necrosis factor α, which completely inhibited the accumulation of C/EBP-α mRNA. Overexpression of C/EBP-β by transfection with the C/EBP-β gene led to increased binding of C/EBP-β to DNA and partial PI activation. cAMP did not affect the amount of C/EBP-β binding to the DNA but did promote phosphorylation of C/EBP-β and PI activation. As in the case of C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β bound to the CCAAT box of the PI promoter. These results indicate that cAMP not only induces, but also activates, bound C/EBP-β through phosphorylation for PI activation. Our studies also indicate that cAMP induces C/EBP-α. C/EBP-β induction, however, precedes that of C/EBP-α. The acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) gene contains two distinct promoters, denoted PI and PII.

The induction conditions for differentiation are pretreatment of the cells at confluence with dexamethasone and insulin for 3 days, followed by incubation in basal medium containing insulin alone. Under these conditions, about 80% of the cells become laden with fat droplets by day 7 or 8(1Pape M.E. Kim K.-H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).

Pretreatment of the cells can be omitted if the cells are kept in the same medium for 5 days, so that some nutrients become limited; these conditions also allow the cells to differentiate upon incubation in medium containing insulin. During the nutrient limitation of 30A5 cells, the intracellular level of cAMP increases to a level comparable to cAMP and IBMX concentrations used in the pretreatment(3Park K. Kim K.-H. J. Biol.

Previously, we classified those mRNA species transcribed from PI as class I ACC mRNAs, whereas those transcribed from PII were designated class II mRNAs. Stimulated lipogenic conditions lead to induction of the class I ACC mRNAs in the liver(5Lopez-Casillas F. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7176-7184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, induction of PI promoter expression occurs during differentiation of 30A5 preadipocytes into adipocytes(4Tae H.-J. Luo X. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, together with others(5Lopez-Casillas F. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7176-7184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we suggested that PI is an inducible promoter under stimulated lipogenic conditions, whereas PII is constitutively expressed(5Lopez-Casillas F. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7176-7184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent report we showed that accumulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBP-α) mRNA occurred in close association with the PI gene products during the differentiation of 30A5 preadipocytes(4Tae H.-J. Luo X. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that C/EBP-α binds to a specific sequence, GCAAT, in the PI promoter and that binding allowed the expression of PI which was otherwise repressed(4Tae H.-J. Luo X. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that cAMP treatment of 30A5 cells activates both C/EBP-α and C/EBP-β gene expression, which lead to PI activation. However, in the case of C/EBP-β, increased binding of C/EBP-β to the CAAT box alone is not sufficient to activate PI unless the bound C/EBP-β is phosphorylated and activated by cAMP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCommercial products were obtained as follows.

The plasmids pMSV-C/EBP-α and pMSV-C/EBP-β, which contain the full length of the rat C/EBP-α or β coding sequences under the control of murine sarcoma virus LTR, were generous gifts from Dr. Z. Cao and Dr. S. L. McKnight. Antibodies against the peptides of C/EBP-α were a generous gift from Dr. P. Cornelius and Dr. M. D. Lane. Antibodies against the peptides of C/EBP-β were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Construction of a Chimeric Gene of the PI Promoter and CAT Gene Coding Region and Generation of Deletion MutantsA 1144-bp fragment flanking the 5′-end of exon 1 of the ACC gene (including 136 bp of exon 1) was inserted in front of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene of pUC-CAT3 by use of the XbaI site(7Luo X. Park K. Lopez-Casillas F. Kim K.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4042-4046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This construct is designated pPI-CAT0 (Fig. 1). 5′-Deletion mutants of the PI promoter from pPI-CAT0 were generated by using exonuclease III and S1 nuclease(3Park K. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12249-12256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clones with different degrees of deletion were selected, and the exact sites of deletion were determined by dideoxy nucleotide sequence analysis(8Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52361) Google Scholar). The two deletion mutants (pPI-CAT2 and pPI-CAT5) are shown in Fig. 1. For pPI-997/CAT, a 997-bp fragment flanking the 5′ end of exon 1 of the ACC gene (−1008 to −12) was inserted upstream of the CAT gene of pUC-CAT3. pPI-D/CAT was constructed by restriction enzyme digestion of a 997-bp fragment (−1008 to −12) of PI promoter and ligation of the digested fragments in front of the CAT gene at the XbaI site of pUC-CAT3. pPI-TATA was constructed by insertion of a synthesized DNA fragment representing the fragment from −34 to −12 of PI in front of the CAT gene at the XbaI site of pUC-CAT3. To create a 5-base deletion mutant, pPI-997/CAT(mut), the 997-bp fragment was subcloned in pBluescript KS+ and mutation was carried out by the Kunkel method (9Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar) using the primer 5′-CTGACCTTCATTAT↓ GGAATCTTGCCTTTCG-3′. 209 indicates the position of the 5-base deletion (-67GCAAT-63). The mutated 997-bp fragment was then inserted in front of the CAT gene of pUC-CAT3. The pPII-CAT22 construct was described previously(10Luo X. Kim K.-H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3249-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).DNA-mediated Cell Transfection and CAT AssayMouse 30A5 preadipocytes were cultured in 100-mm Petri dishes to about 80% confluence in Eagle's basal medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transfectants were obtained as described previously(3Park K. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12249-12256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after adding DNA precipitates to the culture plates, cells were split and fed with media containing G418. After cells had been incubated for 10-14 days, about 300 G418-resistant colonies were pooled as stable clones. CAT assays were performed as described by Gorman et al.(11Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar).Preparation of Nuclear Extracts from 30A5 CellsNuclear extracts were prepared basically according to the method of Dignam et al.(12Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1476-1489Crossref Scopus (9143) Google Scholar) from 30A5 preadipocytes that had been incubated with or without 0.1 mM 8-CPT cAMP and 0.5 mM IBMX at confluence for a specified period as indicated. All the subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C. Cells were harvested in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/plate by spinning for 10 min in a clinical centrifuge at 2000 rpm. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 times the pellet volume of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF) and kept on ice for 10 min. The cell resuspension was centrifuged in a clinical centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in 2 times the pellet volume of buffer A. Cells were homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer with a B pestle until the cells were broken (about 10 strokes). A crude nuclear pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm in a Sorvall centrifuge (SS-34) for 20 min at 4°C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in one pellet volume of buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF). Nuclei were broken by using a Dounce homogenizer with a B pestle (about 10 strokes). The nuclear suspension was stirred for 30 min and then centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm in an SS-34 centrifuge. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF). The final nuclear extract was obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. Nuclear extracts were divided into aliquots, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Two to three milligrams of nuclear proteins were routinely obtained from 108 cells. All buffers contained protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin and pepstatin and 2 μg/ml leupeptin).DNase I FootprintingDNase I footprinting analysis was performed according to Dynan and Tjian (13Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A 20-μg sample of nuclear protein from 30A5 cells was incubated with approximately 1.5 × 104 cpm of the 32P-labeled DNA probe at room temperature for 15 min in 50 μl of a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The reaction mixture was then subjected to DNase I (0.2-1 unit) treatment at room temperature for 1 min. After the reaction, the samples were extracted and analyzed by 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Mobility Shift DNA-binding AssayThe 30-bp oligonucleotide (5′CTTCATTATGCAATGGAATCTTGCCTTTCG-3′) was end-labeled using [γ-32P] ATP and T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase(14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Typical binding conditions were the same as the footprinting assay except that the total volume was 20 μl. For the competition experiment, a molar excess of unlabeled DNA fragment was added to the binding mixture. For the supershift assay with antiserum, 2 μl of antiserum or preimmune serum was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 10 to 15 min prior to adding labeled probes. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the reaction mixtures were directly subjected to electrophoresis in a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mM Tris base, 190 mM glycine, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.5). The gel was then fixed with a mixture of 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed.Preparation of Total Cellular RNA from 30A5 CellsTotal RNA from 30A5 preadipocytes or differentiated adipocytes was prepared by the AGPC method as described by Chomczynski et al.(15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 ml of solution D (4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate pH 7.0, 0.5% sarcosyl, and 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to each plate, and cells were scraped and transferred into a tube. 0.2 ml of 2 M sodium acetate, 2 ml of phenol, and 0.4 ml of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol mixture (49:1) were added to each tube. After vortexing, the mixture was kept for 15 min on ice before centrifugation in an HB-4 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The aqueous phase was transferred into a new tube and an equal volume of isopropanol was added. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, the pellet was dissolved in 0.3 ml of solution D and 0.3 ml of isopropanol was added. After spinning in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, total RNA precipitate was washed with 75% ethanol, dried briefly and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water.Northern Blot Hybridization15 μg of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde/agarose gels as described(14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). RNA was then transferred onto nylon membranes and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes(16Konieczny S.F. Drobes B.L. Menke S.L. Taparowsky E.J. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar). Filters were prehybridized in 0.5 M Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 0.7% SDS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 μg/ml yeast torular RNA at 65°C for 4 h. Heat-denatured and nick-translated DNA probes (106 cpm/ml) were added to the hybridization bags, and incubation was continued for 18 h at 65°C. Following hybridization, filters were washed in 250 ml of 40 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA, 5% SDS, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 70°C for 1 h and then in 40 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS at 70°C for 30 min. Finally, the filters were rinsed in 250 ml of 0.5 M Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, at room temperature and air-dried before exposure to Kodak XAR film. 1060 bp of the NcoI fragment of C/EBP-α (17Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) was used for detection of C/EBP-α mRNA and 1500 bp of the EcoRI/BamHI fragment of C/EBP-β for detection of C/EBP-β mRNA(18Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled using a labeling kit from Life Technologies, Inc.Western Blot AnalysisNuclear fraction was prepared by the procedures described above for DNase I footprinting and mobility shift DNA-binding assay. The cytoplasmic fraction was prepared from the supernatant fraction after the nuclear fraction was separated by centrifugation and concentrated by spinning the supernatant in a microconcentrator (Amicon) for 2 h at 4°C. The cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions (30 μg) were mixed with an equal volume of SDS-sample buffer, heated to 100°C for 5 min, and fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose filters using mini trans-blot equipment. The filters were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (1 h) and 10% bovine serum (1 h) and probed with C/EBP-β antibody (C/EBP-β (Δ198), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoreactive C/EBP-β protein was visualized by anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and Sigma Fast(TM) system following the procedure recommended by the supplier.Determination of C/EBP-β PhosphorylationTo 250 μl of nuclear extract in buffer C (1 μg/μl), Triton X-100 (1 μl), and a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (50 μl) were added and incubated for 4 h. Following this incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant (250 μl) was transferred to an Eppendorf tube, anti-C/EBP-β (10 μl) was added, and the mixture was incubated, with shaking, for 2 h before 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added. The mixture was incubated for another 4 h, and the precipitate was obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The precipitate was then washed three times with buffer I (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS, pH 7.5). The washed pellet was cleaned once more with buffer I without Triton X-100 and SDS. Bound C/EBP-β was eluted by washing twice with 25 μl of the elution buffer (0.5% SDS, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Thirty μl of the eluate was then mixed with 10 μl of the sample buffer, and proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation level was determined through Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-phosphoserine antibody. To examine the specificity of the phosphoserine antibody, 80 μg (80 μl) of nuclear extract was incubated with and without 20 units (20 μl) of alkaline phosphatase at room temperature for 30 min. The treated nuclear extracts were incubated with 20 μl of C/EBP-β antibody to precipitate C/EBP-β. C/EBP-β in the immunoprecipitate was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and then to Western blot analysis using antibodies against C/EBP-β or phosphoserine.RESULTScAMP Activation of PI ExpressionAs discussed in the Introduction, cAMP pretreatment of 30A5 cells is required for insulin to induce ACC and cell differentiation(3Park K. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12249-12256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells treated with 8-CPT cAMP and IBMX at confluence become shiny, but do not differentiate morphologically and do not accumulate lipid droplets until 8-CPT cAMP and IBMX are removed. Following the addition of insulin after the removal of 8-CPT cAMP and IBMX, cells start to accumulate lipid drops and become morphologically differentiated adipocytes by day 4. There is no identifiable consensus sequence for the cAMP-responsive elements (19Roesler W.J. Vanderbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhu Z. Andrisani O.M. Pot D. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6550-6556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the 1 kilobase pair of the PI promoter. In order to locate the site of cAMP action on PI expression, we constructed a chimeric gene containing PI and the bacterial CAT gene. Diagrammatic representations of some of the relevant plasmids are seen in Fig. 1. To identify those cells with cAMP-responsive elements in the plasmids, the cells were treated with or without cAMP and the expression of the CAT activities were determined. Fig. 1 also shows the basal promoter activities and those activated by cAMP.The induction of CAT activity by cAMP occurred only with those cells containing the plasmids with the CCAAT box sequence. For example, cAMP routinely induced CAT activities 20-30-fold over those in the absence of cAMP in the case of pPI-CAT0, pPI-CAT2, pPI-CAT5; and 40-80-fold in the case of pPI-997/CAT and pPI-D/CAT. The CAT expressions of cells with pPI-TATA (PI sequence from −34 to −12), which contain no CCAAT box, were hardly affected by the addition of 8-CPT cAMP and IBMX. The CAT expression of pPI-997/CAT(mut), in which a 5-bp sequence of the CCAAT box from pPI-997/CAT was deleted, also showed no effect of cAMP on the induction of CAT activity, although the basal promoter activity increased about 3-fold as observed previously(4Tae H.-J. Luo X. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, cAMP had no effect on cells containing the plasmid pPII-CAT22. This plasmid contains a small piece of the PII sequence, which shows promoter activity by itself but contains no CCAAT box. These results suggested that the CCAAT box sequence of the PI promoter is involved in the stimulation of PI promoter expression by cAMP.Protein Factors Binding to the CCAAT Box Region of PITo determine whether there are any nuclear binding proteins for the CCAAT box region, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed using the DNA fragment from −303 to −12 of PI and nuclear extracts from 30A5 cells incubated with or without 8-CPT cAMP, and IBMX at confluence for 48 h (Fig. 2). The nuclear extract from 30A5 cells treated with 8-CPT cAMP and IBMX was found to protect the probe around the CCAAT box sequence from DNase I digestion. The protected sequence is around −71 to −47 (5′-TTATGCAATGGAATCTTGCCTTTCG-3′) including a CCAAT box, which is also protected from DNase I digestion by C/EBP-α(4Tae H.-J. Luo X. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, when the DNA fragment of −303 to −12, in which 5 bp of the CCAAT box sequence (GCAAT) were deleted, was used for DNase I footprinting analysis with nuclear extract from 30A5 cells incubated with or without 8-CPT cAMP and IBMX, this mutated probe did not show any protected region regardless of the origin of the nuclear extract. These results agree with our conclusion based on studies using the deletion mutants that the GCAAT sequence of the PI promoter is a cAMP-responsive element.Figure 2:DNase I footprinting of PI with nuclear extracts from 30A5 cells. The following DNAs were used: A, PI fragment (−303 and −12 bases) prepared from pPI-997/CAT; B, PI fragment (−303 and −12) from which the 5-bp GCAAT of the CCAAT box were deleted. This DNA fragment was prepared from pPI-997/CAT(mut). The plasmids were digested with BamHI and labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 DNA kinase. One end-labeled fragment was prepared by digestion with NspI. 20 μg of nuclear extract from 30A5 cells that had been incubated with (lane 4) or without (lane 3) 100 μM cAMP and 500 μM IBMX for 48 h or 20 μg of bovine serum albumin (lanes 1 and 2), were incubated with 1.5 × 104 cpm of the 32P-labeled DNA probe. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to DNase I (0.2-1 unit) treatment at room temperature for 1 min. After terminating the reaction, samples were extracted and analyzed in 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels by electrophoresis and autoradiography. The protected region is shown at the left side of ladders with the sequences. The 5-bp deleted region is indicated by a small box between the ladders of the A and B digestion patterns. Dotted lines note corresponding regions between the two probes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to identify the binding factor(s), 30 base pair oligonucleotides, spanning this protected region, were synthesized and mobility shift DNA-binding assays were performed. The 30-base pair fragment generated 3 bands (Fig. 3, lane 1). All these bands were competed out in the presence of excess amounts of non-labeled probes, but not by either the mutated sequence, in which the AA of the GCAAT sequence in the CCAAT box was substituted for by GG, or an unrelated DNA sequence, a 30-base pair fragment from PII (data not shown; see also (4Tae H.-J. Luo X. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Therefore, these three bands (B1, B2, and B3) appear to be specific to this 30-bp DNA fragment containing the GCAAT sequence.Figure 3:Supershift assay. 10 μg of nuclear extract from confluent 30A5 cells that had been incubated without (lanes 1-4) or with (lanes 5-8) 100 μM 8-CPT cAMP and 500 μM IBMX for 48 h were then incubated with anti-C/EBP-α (lanes 2 and 6), anti-C/EBP-β (lanes 3, and 7), anti-AP2 (lanes 4 and 8), or without antibody (lanes 1 and 5) prior to addition of the labeled 30-bp DNA fragment (−76 to −47) of PI. Then the mixtures were incubated further with the labeled 30-bp DNA fragment (1.5 × 104 cpm). B1, B2, and B3 indicate shifted bands of the 30-bp DNA fragment with nuclear extracts. Star indicates the supershifted band with anti-C/EBP-α or anti-C/EBP-β.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)C/EBP-α and C/EBP-β Binding to PIIn order to identify the factors that bind to this DNA fragment of PI, supershift assays were performed by using anti-C/EBP-α and anti-C/EBP-β (Fig. 3). The band B1 is shifted by the presence of anti-C/EBP-α, establishing that B1 is due to C/EBP-α binding to the DNA (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 6). On the other hand, bands B2 and B3 are supershifted by anti-C/EBP-β (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 7), indicating that bands B2 and B3 are generated by C/EBP-β in nuclear extracts of 30A5 cells. None of these bands is supershifted with anti-AP2 (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 8). In addition, the bin"

Peptide bond formation, at the Nα terminus in peptide 1-21, was obtained with acetyluracil and acetylpseudouridine, but not with acetyluridine.

X-ray crystallographic analysis definitively established N-1 as the site of acetylation in acetyluracil.

In Crithidia fasciculata, kDNA consists of about 5,000 DNA minicircles (2.5 kilobase pairs each) and about 50 DNA maxicircles (37 kilobase pairs each) interlocked topologically to form a huge DNA network (for review, see (1Ray D.S.

A single gap of 6-10 nucleotides remains in the newly synthesized light strand at the UMS site (13Ntambi J.M. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5574-5579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is repaired only after replication of the minicircles and their reattachment to the network have been completed(8Perez-Morga D. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Discontinuous synthesis of the lagging heavy strand (H-strand) starts when its origin, containing the conserved hexamer sequence, is exposed by the advancing replication fork. Highly gapped and nicked nascent H-strands are generated. We have previously reported on the recognition of UMS by a unique sequence-specific single-stranded DNA binding protein from C. fasciculata(17Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Kapeller I. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6891-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and on the isolation and analysis of the UMSBP-encoding cDNA(18Abeliovich H. Tzfati Y. Shlomai J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7766-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the polypeptide, predicted from the cDNA, is 116 residues long and contains five Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys (CCHC)-type zinc finger motifs. CCHC-type zinc finger motifs have been found in one or two copies in the retroviral nucleocapsid proteins and their Gag precursors (19Henderson L.E. Copeland T.D. Sowder R.C. Smythers G.W.

It has been suggested that this type of zinc finger is involved in binding of single-stranded nucleic acids(20Summers M.F. J. Cell.

These studies have revealed a very compact and well-defined structure, stabilized by coordination of the three cysteines and the histidine residue to the zinc ion and by extensive internal hydrogen bonding. Here we describe the purification to apparent homogeneity of UMSBP from C. fasciculata cell extracts and the physical characteristics and specific nucleic acid binding properties of the protein. Finally we discuss the sequence and structure conservation of CCHC-type zinc finger motifs from UMSBP and other cellular proteins in reference to the structure and nucleic acid binding properties of the homologous retroviral motif. Synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides were prepared by an Applied Biosystems oligonucleotide synthesizer at the Bletterman Laboratory of the Interdepartmental Division, Faculty of Medicine, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Synthetic ribo-oligonucleotide (5′-GGGGUUGGUGUA-3′) was prepared by New England Biolabs. Poly(dI-dC)•poly(dI-dC) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Phenyl-Sepharose was purchased from Sigma; hydroxyapatite was from Bio-Rad; and chromatofocusing resin (PBE®) and buffers (Polybuffer®) were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Radioactive nucleotides were purchased from DuPont NEN, polynucleotide kinase from New England Biolabs, and protein size markers from Sigma and Amersham Corp. Two hundred liters of C. fasciculata culture was grown at 29°C in a 250-liter industrial fermentor with 100 rpm stirring and air flow rate of 0.6 volumes/medium volume/min. Growth medium, optimized for C. fasciculata (Dr. S. Braun, the Department of Biological Chemistry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem) contained (per liter): 18 g of N-(Z)-amine B (Sheffield Products), 4.5 g of yeast extract (Biolife), 4.5 g of NaCl, 9 g of glucose, 0.2 ml of antifoam reagent polypropylene glycol (P-2000, Sigma), 100 mg of streptomycin sulfate, 105 units of penicillin (Teva, Israel), and 20 mg of hemin (Sigma). Cells were harvested during logarithmic growth phase (0.5-1.0 × 108 cells/ml) by centrifugation at 14,000 × g in a Sharpless centrifuge, and washed with 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 100 mg/ml sucrose (enzyme grade, Schwartz/Mann). Cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −75°C. 7 g of this cell paste was used for the preparation of UMSBP described here. Analyses were carried out as described previously(17Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Kapeller I. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6891-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The 10-μl standard reaction mixture contained: 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)•poly(dI-dC), and 0.2 ng of 32P-5′-labeled 12-mer UMS H-strand (UMS-H12; GGGGTTGGTGTA). UMSBP was added to the amounts indicated. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 0-30°C for 15 min and electrophoresed in an 8% native polyacrylamide gel (1:32, bisacrylamide/acrylamide) in TAE buffer (6.7 mM Tris acetate, 3.3 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). Electrophoresis was conducted at 4°C and 16 V/cm for 1.25 h. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films (Agfa Curix RP2 or Kodak X-Omat AR). Protein-DNA complexes were quantified either by excision of the radioactive bands and counting them in a scintillation counter or by exposing the dried gels to an imaging plate (BAS-IIIs, Fuji) and analyzing it by a Bio Imaging Analyzer (model BAS1000, Fuji). One unit of UMSBP is defined as the amount of protein required for binding of 1 fmol of UMS H-strand DNA probe under the standard mobility-shift assay conditions(17Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Kapeller I. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6891-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein samples were mixed with loading buffer to final concentrations of: 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.85, 4% (w/v) SDS, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mM EDTA. Samples were incubated at 45°C for 30 min, loaded alongside protein molecular weight markers (“Rainbow” prestained low molecular weight, Amersham Corp.; SDS-17S and SDS-70L, Sigma) onto a polyacrylamide gel (16.5% T, 3% C separating gel; 10% T, 3% C spacer gel; 4% T, 3% C stacking gel), electrophoresed following the procedure of Schagger and Von Jagow(29Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar), and silver-stained. UMSBP (Fraction VIIb) was filtered through a gel filtration G3000 SW HPLC column (0.75 × 60 cm; LKB) that was dipped in ice. The column was equilibrated and washed with 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions of 200 μl were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 2.38 × 104 units of UMSBP (Fraction VIIb) were centrifuged with 10 units of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (5.6 S, 109 kDa), 150 μg of human hemoglobin (4.13 S, 64.5 kDa), 10 units (32 μg) of horseradish peroxidase (3.85 S, 40 kDa), and 150 μg of horse cytochrome C (2.1 S, 12 kDa). The 20-μl sample was layered onto a 5-ml 10-30% (v/v) linear glycerol gradient containing 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT, and was centrifuged at 49,000 rpm and 2°C for 39 h in a Kontron TST 55 rotor. 155-μl fractions were collected dropwise from the bottom of the tube and assayed for the presence of the different proteins as follows: UMSBP was assayed by the standard mobility-shift assay; cytochrome C and hemoglobin following A405; DNA polymerase I by nick-translation assay modified from the method of Richardson et al.(30Richardson C.C. Schildkraut C.L. Aposhian H.V. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 222-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and peroxidase activity following the increase at A405 resulted from the oxidation of pyrogallol to purpurogallin, as recommended by the manufacturer (Sigma). Measurements of equilibrium binding constants for the interactions of purified UMSBP with various DNA and RNA probes were carried out as described by Fried and Crothers (31Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and Liu-Johnson et al.(32Liu-Johnson H.-N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out under the standard mobility-shift assay conditions, by serial dilution of both UMSBP and the oligonucleotide probe while keeping their molar ratios constant. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30°C. Quantification of protein-DNA complexes was carried out using a Bio Imaging Analyzer, as described above. Data were analyzed as described by Liu-Johnson et al.(32Liu-Johnson H.-N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), plotting (1 - r)(α - r)/rversus 1/[DNA], where r is the fraction of the DNA that is in the protein-DNA complex band, [DNA] is the total concentration of the DNA added, and α is the unknown but constant ratio of active protein to total DNA. The equation is solved by searching for an α value that will yield the best line passing through the origin. The slope reciprocal yields the binding constant (K). Protein was determined following the method of Bradford(33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. For the stoichiometry experiment, UMSBP concentration was quantified from the amino acid analysis of the protein, carried out at the amino acid analysis laboratory, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. Protein sequences were analyzed using the Genetics Computer Group software package(1991), Madison, Wisconsin. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to monitor and quantify the specific binding of UMSBP to the UMS H-strand(17Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Kapeller I. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6891-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). C. fasciculata UMSBP was purified approximately 5,000-fold over the cleared cell lysate (Fraction I) to apparent homogeneity, with an overall yield of about 5% (Table 1). The procedure yields 18.7 μg of pure UMSBP from 7 g of C. fasciculata wet cell paste (2 × 1011 cells).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The cleared cell lysate was fractionated by ammonium sulfate and then subjected to hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and adsorption chromatography on hydroxyapatite. The following chromatofocusing step separated two forms of UMSBP (Table 1, Fractions VIa and VIb) with estimated pI values of 7.25 and 6.25, respectively, and an apparent polypeptide mass of 12.6 and 13.7 kDa (under denaturing and reducing conditions) (Fig. 1). The partial sequencing of the shorter polypeptide chain by Edman degradation has revealed the absence of 11 amino acid residues at the protein N terminus compared with the sequence of the cDNA ORF(18Abeliovich H. Tzfati Y. Shlomai J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7766-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The identity of the longer polypeptide was verified by peptide mapping of the two polypeptide chains (not shown). Only the longer polypeptide was observed and co-chromatographed with UMS-binding activity at the purification steps prior to the chromatofocusing (Fraction VI). We presume that the shorter polypeptide, which has a significantly lower binding affinity to UMS DNA (not shown), is a degradation product of the full-length protein, formed at this stage of the procedure. The final chromatography on hydroxyapatite was carried out separately for the two forms of the protein, recovering approximately 7% (Fractions VIIa) and 5% (Fraction VIIb) of the overall UMS-binding activity measured in the cell lysates. However, a minor fraction of the shorter polypeptide is still present in the final UMSBP preparation (Fraction VIIb). Apparently homogenous UMSBP preparations were stable for at least one year at −75°C, in the presence of 2 mM Mg2+ ions. Some of the physical properties of C. fasciculata UMSBP are summarized in Table 2. The purified protein migrates in SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a polypeptide band of 13.7 kDa (Fig. 1). This 13.7-kDa polypeptide chain co-fractionated with the specific UMS binding activity upon chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose (Fraction III) and hydroxyapatite (Fraction V), chromatofocusing (Fraction VI), G3000 SW HPLC gel filtration (Fig. 2) and glycerol gradient sedimentation (Fig. 3). The apparent protomer mass, as measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is similar to the one calculated on the basis of the UMSBP encoding cDNA(18Abeliovich H. Tzfati Y. Shlomai J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7766-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Gel filtration data yielded a Stokes radius of 28 Å, as calculated by the method of Siegel and Monty (34Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). A sedimentation coefficient of 2.37 S was measured in a 10-30% (v/v) glycerol gradient (Fig. 3), following the method of Martin and Ames(35Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol.

On the basis of the protein activity in cell extracts, the apparent molecular weight, and the specific activity of the pure protein, we estimate the presence of approximately 12,000 UMSBP molecules/Crithidia cell. Generation of UMSBP•DNA complexes, as monitored by the mobility shift assay, is greatly enhanced in the presence of bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Chelation of divalent cations by EDTA prevents the formation of protein-DNA complexes, indicating the possible involvement of metal ions in the putative zinc fingers. Optimal binding activity is observed at 60 mM KCl. Higher concentrations of monovalent ions are inhibitory, with 50% inhibition observed in the presence of 200 mM KCl or 150 mM NaCl. Glycerol concentrations up to 50% (v/v) enhance complex stability upon electrophoresis in native polyacrylamide gels. Optimal electrophoresis temperature is at the range of 2-5°C. At temperatures higher than 8°C, dissociation of protein-DNA complexes during electrophoresis is fast and results in smeared bands. Raising the polyacrylamide gel concentration from 4 to 8% stabilizes protein-DNA complexes and reduces their dissociation, presumably due to caging effect (36Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 37Cann J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17032-17040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown (17Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Kapeller I. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6891-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) the specific binding of UMSBP to a G-rich single-stranded sequence. The equilibrium binding constant measured for the interaction of UMSBP with a 12-mer oligonucleotide comprising the H-strand sequence of UMS, is 2.5 × 109M-1 (Fig. 4). A similar (2.6 × 109M-1) equilibrium binding constant was measured with a 40-mer oligonucleotide that consists of the H-strand of UMS and its flanking sequences at the origin region of the C. fasciculata kDNA minicircle (Fig. 4). This observation indicates that neighboring sequences flanking UMS at the minicircle origin site, in their single-stranded conformation, have no significant effect on the binding of UMSBP. G-rich sequences similar to UMS, such as those of eukaryotic telomere termini, retroviral RNA genome dimerization site, gene regulatory elements, and immunoglobulins switch regions, form in vitro special four-stranded (quadruplex) DNA structures. These structures, known as G-quartets or G4-DNA, are stabilized by Hoogsteen base pairing (38Sundquist W.I. Klug A. Nature. 1989; 342: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 39Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R.

Several proteins that have been discovered recently, bind specifically these special conformations(43Weisman-Shomer P. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3306-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Walsh K. Gualberto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13714-13718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the specific binding of UMSBP to a G-rich ligand that may potentially form a four-stranded structure, we have explored the possibility that such a conformation is recognized by the protein. Since we could not detect stable quadruplexes formed in vitro by the 12-mer UMS H-strand oligonucleotide, we have used for this purpose a similar oligonucleotide containing the repeated Tetrahymena telomeric sequence 5′-GGGGTTGGGGTT-3′. UMSBP binds tightly to this telomeric sequence (Fig. 4 and (17Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Kapeller I. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6891-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). This oligonucleotide adopts two different DNA conformations that migrate as two different bands upon electrophoresis in a native polyacrylamide gel. The lower mobility band corresponds to the quadruplex structure, which is composed of two oligonucleotide molecules in a fold-back conformation(38Sundquist W.I. Klug A. Nature. 1989; 342: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 45Guo Q. Lu M. Kallenbach N.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3596-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), while the higher mobility band represents the monomeric structure. Mobility-shift analyses (Fig. 5) clearly demonstrate that UMSBP binds only the higher mobility monomeric molecules, but not the lower mobility four-stranded dimers. On the basis of its encoding cDNA(18Abeliovich H. Tzfati Y. Shlomai J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7766-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), UMSBP contains five CCHC-type zinc finger motifs. Thus, the native UMSBP homodimer isolated from C. fasciculata may contain a total of 10 such zinc finger structures. The functional role of each of these potential zinc fingers is yet to be studied. However, understanding the specific UMSBP•UMS interactions requires an accurate estimation of the stoichiometry of the protein and DNA reactants in this specific nucleoprotein complex. No binding of a dimeric DNA ligand (such as G4-DNA) by UMSBP could be observed (Fig. 5). However, we have further explored the possibility that a single UMSBP molecule may bind simultaneously more than one UMS site. To address this question, we have used two DNA ligands that contain the 12-mer UMS sequence but differ in their length. The oligonucleotide UMS-H12 contains only the 12-mer H-strand of UMS, while the 40-mer UMS-H40 contains the UMS 12-mer and its flanking sequence at the minicircle H-strand. Whereas both DNA ligands are tightly bound by UMSBP (equilibrium binding constants measured for the two protein-DNA interactions were almost identical (Fig. 4)), the two protein-DNA complexes differ in their electrophoretic mobility in native polyacrylamide gels. If UMSBP binds only one UMS site, then two types of protein-DNA complexes could be expected: UMSBP•(UMS-H12) and UMSBP•(UMS-H40). However, if the complex contains two UMS elements, then three types of complexes may be expected: UMSBP•(UMS-H12)2, UMSBP•(UMS-H40)2, as well as UMSBP•(UMS-H12)1•(UMS-H40)1. Fig. 6describes the results of such an experiment in which the oligonucleotides UMS-H12 and UMS-H40 were mixed together at various molar ratios as indicated, heat denatured in order to disrupt any pre-existing higher order structures, and used as radioactive probes in an electrophoretic mobility shift experiment with UMSBP. Reciprocal titration of one species of UMS•DNA over the other at the various molar ratios, yields only two types of protein-DNA complexes. No additional species of protein-DNA complexes could be detected, indicating that only one DNA molecule is present in the UMSBP•UMS complex. To determine the precise number of UMSBP monomers that bind a single UMS element in the complex, we have conducted a mobility-shift electrophoresis analysis of the protein-DNA complexes using an 35S-labeled UMSBP and 32P-5′-labeled UMS DNA. We have measured a value of 2.1 UMSBP-monomer/UMS site (Fig. 7), indicating the apparent binding of two UMSBP monomers t"

One of the endothelial-associated ligands for L-selectin is GlyCAM-1, a mucin-like glycoprotein, which presents novel sulfated, sialylated and fucosylated O-glycans. In order to understand the generation of these glycans, we have examined the biosynthesis of GlyCAM-1 in lymph node organ culture. Using peptide-specific antibodies, lectins, and recombinant L-selectin, we detected the following species of GlyCAM-1: unglycosylated (<28 kDa); modified with GalNAc only (28-33 kDa); modified with sialic acid, fucose, and sulfate but lacking L-selectin reactivity (40-50 kDa); and mature (L-selectin-reactive) ligand (50-60 kDa). Pulse-chase labeling at 15°C suggested that GalNAc is added in a pre-Golgi compartment. Treatment with brefeldin A almost completely blocked sulfation, indicating that this modification occurs in the trans-Golgi network. Two distinct sialylation events occurred in the presence of brefeldin A, while fucosylation was partially blocked. We conclude that sialylation precedes both fucosylation and sulfation during biosynthesis. This ordering will help to identify the critical acceptor structures recognized by lymph node glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases.

The level of nitrite accumulation, which is an index of NO synthesis, was comparable to that observed with interferon-γ.

At slightly higher α2M concentrations, [3H]thymidine incorporation was inhibited. All of these activities were counteracted nearly completely when the iNOS competitive inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine was included. By in situ nick translation, native α2M and α2M-MA increased the percentage of cells with detectable single strand chromatin nicks from 4 to 12 and 17%, respectively.

In this work, we examined whether tyrosines 333 and/or 338 in GHR are phosphorylated by JAK2 in response to GH. Tyrosines 333 and 338 in rat full-length (GHR1-638) and truncated (GHR1-454) receptor were replaced with phenylalanines and the mutated GHRs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.

The best characterized properties of the proteasome are its multiple endopeptidase activities (Arrigo et al., 1988; Wilk and Orlowski, 1983). The 20 S proteasome is considered to be the enzymatic core of a larger complex, with a molecular mass of about 1500 kDa, which digests ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in an ATP-dependent fashion (Hough et al., 1987; Eytan et al., 1989; Driscoll and Goldberg, 1990; Peters et al., 1993). Furthermore, there is evidence for the involvement of the 20 S proteasome in the generation of the major histocompatibility complex class I binding peptides (Ortiz-Navarrete et al., 1991; Martinez and Monaco, 1991). We and others have demonstrated that proteasomes can interfere with protein synthesis in vitro (Horsch et al., 1989; Kühn et al., 1990). While no inhibition was observed with globin mRNA and cellular mRNAs of HeLa cells, the translation of TMV-RNA and mRNA isolated from adenovirusinfected HeLa cells was impeded (Horsch et al., 1989). Recent work of our laboratory indicates that proteasome prevents the formation of 80 S initiation complexes but not the early phase of initiation (Homma et al. 1994). In addition, we have shown that proteasomes associated with tobacco mosaic virus RNA and poly(A)+ mRNA from adenovirus-infected cells (Horsch et al., 1990). To elucidate these points in particular, we have analyzed the relations between the proteasomes and TMV-RNA more closely. Our results demonstrate that proteasomes hydrolyze TMV-RNA creating well defined fragments and we show that integrity of the proteasomal complex is not necessary for RNase activity. The preparation of the post-mitochondrial supernatant has been described (Tomek et al., 1990). The post-mitochondrial supernatant was layered over 10 ml of 30% (w/w) sucrose in centrifugation buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 200 mM saccharose) and centrifuged to sediment ribosomes and polyribosomes (Beckmann rotor Ti 45, 42,000 rpm, 2 h, 4°C). To separate the cytoplasmic proteins, post-polyribosomal supernatants were sedimented again through 10 ml of 30% (w/w) sucrose. After centrifugation (Beckmann rotor Ti 45, 42,000 rpm, 19 h, 4°C) the pellets of post-ribosomal particles were resuspended in TBK 300 and approximately 1,500 A280 units were applied to 100 ml of a Q-Sepharose fast flow anionic exchanger in a C26/40 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with TBK buffer containing 300 mM KCl. Particles eluted by a step gradient to 600 mM KCl were concentrated by ultracentrifugation (Beckmann Ti 45, 42,000 rpm, 19 h, 4°C). Sediments were resuspended and applied to a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) Mono Q column (HR 5/5 Pharmacia) equilibrated in TBK 50. A linear salt gradient up to 600 mM KCl was formed. Proteasomes were eluted at 390 mM and further purified by gel filtration on a FPLC Superose 6 column (HR 10/30 Pharmacia-LKB) equilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 480 mM KCl (TBK 480) as described by Tomek et al.(1990). Proteins and particles were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration). Electrophoresis of proteins was on one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGE according to Laemmli(1970)). Molecular mass markers were: phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa), and lactalbumin (14 kDa). Purified TMV-RNA of Nicotiana rustica was purchased from DSM Braunschweig (Germany). The quantity of proteasomes was determined by the Bio-Rad assay. TMV-RNA was incubated with proteasomes at 37°C. The volume of each assay was 200 μl. Incubation buffers were adapted to the buffers which we used for the purification of proteasomes on Superose 6 and Mono Q columns. Thus proteasomes eluted in TBK 480 were diluted 1+3 with low salt buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl2, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Final salt concentrations were identical with TBK 120. Proteasomes eluted in detergent buffer were adjusted to 3 mM MgCl2 and 120 mM KCl with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 mM MgCl2, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 240 mM KCl (dilution 1:1). Final salt concentrations were identical with TBK 120 + 0.25% Sarkosyl. TMV-RNA, rabbit globin mRNA (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 S rRNA (Boehringer Mannheim) were labeled in vitro with 32P at the 3′ end. Labeling was carried out with [32P]pCp in a reaction catalyzed by T4 RNA ligase according to Peattie(1979). The digests of TMV-RNA were extracted from enzymatic assays with chloroform/phenol (Perry et al., 1972) and precipitated with 2.5 volumes ethanol + 0.3 M sodium acetate. RNA was analyzed on MOPS-agarose gels containing formaldehyde according to Sambrook et al.(1989). Fractions of proteasomes eluted from Superose 6 columns were incubated with 0.5% Sarkosyl and chromatographed again on Superose 6 equilibrated in detergent buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Sarkosyl, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Alternatively the fractions were incubated with crystalline urea (final concentration 6 M) and further applied to a Superose 6 column equilibrated in urea buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 M urea, 60 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Eluted peak fractions were dialyzed overnight against TBK 120. Purified proteasomes (500 ng) were incubated with 5 μg of micrococcus nuclease for 2 min at 37°C in the presence of 3 mM CaCl2. After that 5 mM EGTA was added to block the nuclease activity of this enzyme. The objective of this work was to show that proteasomes harbor a specific RNase activity. For this approach, proteasomes were isolated by FPLC. Fig. 1 shows that proteasomes eluted from Superose 6 columns as one sharp peak of absorbance, corresponding to their characteristic molecular mass of about 700 kDa. No other particles or proteins were observed. Subsequently eluted particles were analyzed by Laemmli PAGE (Fig. 1, inset). All proteins visualized by Coomassie Blue banded in a range of 19-35 kDa, corresponding to the characteristic subunit pattern of purified proteasomes. As a source of mRNA, we used tobacco mosaic virus RNA which was tested recently with proteasomes in cell free translation systems (Homma et al., 1994). TMV-RNA is a polycistronic messenger with an apparent molecular mass of about 2000 kDa. It separates well from proteasomes which elute at about 700 kDa from gel filtration columns. To demonstrate the degradation of TMV-RNA, in a first series of investigations, we checked our apparatus and solutions to ensure that they were free of RNase activity. For this approach, we incubated TMV-RNA at 37°C in buffers we used for digestion. Then we applied the assays on Superose 6 columns we used for the purification of proteasomes and the analysis of the digests. As demonstrated in Fig. 2A there was no visible degradation of TMV-RNA after these procedures. After 10 min of incubation in TBK 120 with an approximately 4-fold excess (molar ratio) of proteasomes, 88% of TMV-RNA was degraded comparing the peaks of absorbance before and after digestion (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, there was no visible erosion of the sharp peak of absorbance of TMV-RNA, which would be typical for a random degradation in the presence of exonucleases or nonspecific RNase activity. Other experiments showed that proteasomal RNase activity is rather sensitive. When a suspension of proteasomes was treated for 10 min at 100°C, RNase activity was completely abolished. Repeated freezing and thawing led to the same effect. In addition, TMV-RNA was not degraded in the absence of Mg2+. The question arose as to whether RNase activity was indeed an integral part of proteasomes. To address this question, we wanted to know if RNase activity follows proteasome distribution during purification. For these experiments we incubated fractions eluted from the different columns we used for purification with TMV-RNA for 10 min at 37°C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The presence of proteasomes was determined by Laemmli PAGE (Fig. 3, bottom). Our experiments revealed at least two maxima of RNase activity (Fig. 3, top). The first eluted exactly with the most prominent peak of absorbance containing pure proteasomes (Fig. 3, top, fractions 23 and 24). The second maximum of RNase activity was found in fraction 27, containing proteins in the molecular range of 50-150 kDa and proteasomal proteins as minor components. Fractions 23 and 24 were pooled and further purified by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column (Fig. 4). Proteasomes eluted with one sharp peak of absorbance in fraction 11 (Fig. 4, top), corresponding to a molecular mass of about 700 kDa as we have determined earlier with marker proteins; no other peaks were observed. In this case, RNase activity coeluted exactly with the elution volume of proteasomes and Laemmli PAGE confirmed the purity of proteasomes (Fig. 4, bottom). It was possible that proteasomes might still be contaminated by proteins, with similar molecular weights as proteasomal proteins, which remain unspecifically attached to the surface of the genuine complex. Such proteins can be eliminated with buffers containing Sarkosyl. We have shown that proteasomes resisted this rather strong detergent and they sedimented in sucrose gradients according to their characteristic 19 S value (Schmid et al., 1984). Under these conditions, ribosomes and mRNP complexes dissociated completely in RNA and protein components. We incubated proteasomes purified by Superose 6 chromatography in detergent buffer containing 0.5% Sarkosyl and subjected the particles again to gel filtration. Proteasomes eluted with the same molecular weight (data not shown), and their protein composition did not change during this procedure (Fig. 5, lane 3). Then we tested detergent washed proteasomes for RNase activity. After 10 min of incubation in TBK 120 + 0.25% Sarkosyl with an approximately 12-fold excess (molar ratio) of proteasomes, 76% of TMV-RNA was degraded (Fig. 6B). However, the cleavage reaction was slightly inhibited under these conditions.Figure 6:Degradation of TMV-RNA by proteasomes exposed to 0.5% Sarkosyl. Fraction 11 (Fig. 4) from Superose 6 columns containing pure proteasomes (0.8-1 A280/ml) was incubated with 0.5% Sarkosyl (final concentration) and applied again to a Superose 6 column equilibrated in detergent buffer. Eluted peak fractions were diluted 1:1 with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 mM MgCl2, 240 mM KCl, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and incubated with TMV-RNA for 10 min at 37°C. Then the total assay (200 μl) was immediately analyzed by chromatography on a Superose 6 column equilibrated in TBK 120. A, 7.5 μg of TMV-RNA incubated without proteasomes in TBK 120 + 0.25% Sarkosyl. B, 7.5 μg of TMV-RNA incubated with 30 μg of proteasomes in TBK 120 + 0.25% Sarkosyl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alternatively we used high concentrations of urea to wash purified proteasomes eluted from Superose 6 columns. For this approach, proteasomes were exposed to Tris buffer containing 6 M urea and again subjected to gel filtration on Superose 6 column in the presence of 6 M urea. In this case the molecular weight of the genuine complex changed, the most prominent peak eluted later in fraction 13, which indicated that proteasomes lost some proteins during this procedure (Fig. 7). Indeed the protein composition of urea washed proteasomes was different compared to untreated or Sarkosyl washed complexes (Fig. 5, lane 1). However, RNase activity remained associated with the washed subcomplex (Fig. 8). Further dissociation of the subcomplex and subsequent chromatography in the presence of urea revealed that proteasomal RNase activity is associated with at least one distinct proteasomal subunit (preliminary results not shown). In addition, we preincubated proteasomes with Micrococcus nuclease to destroy any copurifing RNA species which might modify proteasomal RNase activity. However, TMV-RNA hydrolysis was not affected by this procedure. Summarizing, all these results clearly showed that RNase activity is an integral part of proteasomes.Figure 8:Degradation of TMV-RNA by proteasomes exposed to 6 M urea. A suspension of proteasomes in TBK 480 (1 A280/ml) was incubated with crystalline urea (final concentration 6 M) and loaded on a Superose 6 column equilibrated in urea buffer. After elution with the same buffer fraction 13 (Fig. 7) was dialyzed overnight against TBK 120. TMV-RNA (4 μg) was added to 200 μl of the dialyzed fraction and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Subsequently the total assay was analyzed by chromatography on Superose 6 equilibrated in TBK 120. A, 4 μg of TMV-RNA incubated without proteasomes in TBK 120. B, 4 μg of TMV-RNA incubated with 5 μg of urea-washed proteasomes in TBK 120.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate the specificity of the nuclease activity of proteasomes, we analyzed the digests of TMV-RNA by electrophoresis on MOPS-agarose gels. For this approach, TMV-RNA was labeled at the 3′ end with pCp. Starting from the 3′ end of TMV-RNA, we identified at least 5 well defined fragments which cover a length of about 500 nucleotides, they accumulated after different times of digestion or quantity of proteasomes in the assay. We could not detect fragments smaller than 120 nucleotides (Fig. 9A). 5 S rRNA was not digested by proteasomes (Fig. 9B). However, this RNA was cleaved by T1 RNase. In this case all processed fragments migrated at the front of the gel. Also globin mRNA resisted to proteasomal RNase activity (Fig. 9B, lane 8), which correlates well to our recently published in vitro translation experiments which will be discussed below. In this report we demonstrate that proteasomes harbor specific RNase activity. We have shown that TMV-RNA is an ideal substrate to analyze and quantify the cleavage reaction and we supply several lines of evidence that nuclease activity is an integral part of proteasomes. Degradation of TMV-RNA was not random, liberating mononucleotides or very small oligonucleotides, which suggests that proteasomes have endonuclease activity. Most interestingly the cleavage reaction was rather RNA specific since 5 S rRNA and globin mRNA were not digested by proteasomes. These results gave further evidence that proteasomes are able to discriminate between different mRNAs and we postulate that proteasomes are also involved in the control of translation. Intensive experimental efforts have led to identification and characterization of transcriptionally regulatory mechanisms; however, there exists little precise evidence for the control of gene expression at the level of translation. The best studied example is the translation regulation of ferritin mRNA. It was shown that cytoplasmic ferritin mRNA underwent a redistribution from an inactive free mRNP pool to translationally active polyribosomal mRNPs, after iron induction (White and Munro, 1988). This mechanism is controlled by a cis-acting element in the 5′ leader region of ferritin mRNA which associates strongly with a transacting element, a 90-kDa protein, in the absence of iron (Walden et al., 1989; Aziz and Munro, 1987). Several years ago, it was shown that free mRNA bound to transacting proteins (free mRNPs) are blocked for translation, while deproteinized mRNA stimulated protein synthesis in cell free systems (Schmid et al., 1983a, 1983b; Imaizumi-Scherrer et al., 1982; Vincent et al., 1983). Several reports support the idea that there is a close relationship between proteasomes and untranslatable free mRNPs (Schmid et al., 1984; Martins de Sa et al., 1986). We and others have shown that free mRNPs migrate with proteasomes in subribosomal fractions of HeLa cells and erythroblasts. Interestingly, proteasomes always appear linked with the free mRNP particles when low salt conditions were used throughout purification (Schmid et al., 1984; Martins de Sa et al., 1986; Nothwang et al., 1992a, 1992b). In addition, previously we have shown that proteasomes associated in vitro with TMV-RNA and mRNA from adenovirus-infected cells, and Bey et al.(1993) have demonstrated that the 27-kDa protein, an α-type subunit of proteasomes, has one distinct mRNA binding domain. A widely accepted argument for a possible relationship among proteasomes and RNA is the presence of small RNA molecules in pure preparations of proteasomes (Arrigo et al., 1985; Martins de Sa et al., 1986). The amount of RNA detected in proteasomes varies, it is not stoichiometric (Pühler et al., 1992) and the RNA is very heterogenous in size and sequence (Skilton et al., 1991; Nothwang et al., 1992b; Martins de Sa et al., 1986; Gaedik, 1988). 2M-N. Pouch, F. Petit, J. Buri, Y. Briand, and H-P. Schmid, unpublished results. These data reflect that proteasomal RNAs could be interpreted as residual parts of larger RNAs. This correlates well with the following observations. Proteasomal RNAs were reported to have 5′-P and 3′-OH termini (Schmid et al., 1984; Martins de Sa et al., 1986) and we found that proteasomal RNase activity creates TMV fragments which we easily could label at the 3′ end with [32P]pCp but not with [γ-32P]ATP at the 5′ end. This is in good agreement with a model for mRNA decay which describes that endonucleases initiate mRNA decay by cleaving mRNAs at specific sites to provide exposed 3′-OH termini (Yajnik and Godson 1993). If proteasomes associated with a given mRNA, they should influence in some way the translation of this mRNA. Interestingly, the in vitro synthesis of mRNA from adenovirus-infected HeLa cells and the translation of polycistronic TMV-RNA was impeded in the presence of proteasomes, while translation of HeLa mRNA and globin mRNA was not affected under the same conditions (Horsch et al., 1989; Homma et al., 1994). In addition very recent work of our laboratory has shown that translation of TMV-RNA was very sensitive to catalytic amounts of proteasomes. Proteasomes interfere with initiation of protein synthesis, and block the formation of 80 S initiation complexes (Homma et al., 1994). However, this cannot be explained simply by the proteolytic activity of proteasomes since mRNAs from HeLa cells were readily translated and the in vitro synthesized proteins were not degraded by proteasomes (Homma et al., 1994; Horsch et al., 1989). All these data favor the hypothesis that proteasomes are involved in translation control by degradation of distinct free mRNAs containing specific sequences or secondary structures. There could be signals for degradation of RNAs which are recognized by proteasomes and we assume that the degradation process is rather selective. In eukaryotic cells there is only little evidence about the nature and function of RNases which are involved in a selective control of proteins synthesis. However, in some prokaryotic model systems it was shown that protein synthesis is regulated by a selective decay of a coding sequence within a polycistronic mRNA (Brawerman, 1987; Belasco et al., 1985; Burton et al., 1983). The selectivity in mRNA decay is ensured by site specific endonucleases like RNase E which is also involved in mRNA processing and the processing of 9 S rRNA into 5 S rRNA (Yajnik and Godson, 1993; Mudd and Higgins, 1993). Indeed there exists some parallels between proteasomes and such RNases: the proteasomal RNase activity we describe in this paper led to a cleavage pattern typical for endonucleases, and proteasomes are able to discriminate between RNAs (see our results and Horsch et al.(1989, 1990)). Interestingly RNase activity of proteasomes has been proposed earlier, based on the observation that fractions containing proteasomes hydrolyzed 18 S rRNA and purified proteasomes were shown to be involved in the processing of pre-tRNA (Tsukahara et al., 1989; Castano et al., 1986). However, the later observation was challenged recently by Doria et al.(1991), and others have reported that they did not degrade soluble yeast RNA (Kühn et al., 1990). These contradictory results demonstrate again that RNase activity of proteasomes is rather specific. Clearly, much work is needed to map the cleavage sites on TMV-RNA. Currently we are studing the factors which modulate the RNase activity of proteasomes. Furthermore, these investigations have to be extended to other RNA species to demonstrate how proteasomes discriminate between RNAs. Taken together, the multienzymatic properties expressed in vitro and in vivo suggest that proteasomes are multifunctional complexes, which participate in the pathways of intracellular protein breakdown and RNA metabolism.

HePTP mRNA was present only in RBL-2H3 mast cells, the YAC-1 T cell line, and the thymus in Northern blots. Moreover, the protein became tyrosine phosphorylated upon aggregation of the FcɛRI in RBL-2H3 cells. This phosphorylation was Ca2+-dependent and accordingly would be considered a “late” event in the activation process. Thus, HePTP may be involved in the signaling cascade initiated by IgE receptor aggregation. Two degenerate primers were designed based on common sequences in the catalytic domains of several PTP ((His/Asp)-Phe-Trp-(Arg/Lys/Leu/Glu)-Met-(Val/Cys/Ile)-Trp-(Glu/Gly) to Val-His-Cys-Ser-Ala-Gly-(Val/Ile)-Gly)(29Streuli M.

RBL-2H3 cell cDNA, prepared as described previously (30Nishikata H. Oliver C. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 862-870PubMed Google Scholar), served as template in PCR reactions. The PCR products were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the sequences of both strands were determined by automated sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). The HePTP PCR product was used to screen a previously characterized RBL-2H3 cell cDNA λgt11 library(30Nishikata H. Oliver C. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 862-870PubMed Google Scholar). Positive plaques were purified, their inserts were subcloned in pBluescript SK, and the sequence of both strands was determined by automated sequencing. The 5′-end was generated using the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends system of Life Technologies, Inc. Poly(A)+ RNA from RBL-2H3 cells and the PTP gene-specific primer 5′-TAGAGTCCAGCGTGTA-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 367-352 in the rat PTP were used. The rapid amplification of cDNA ends products were subcloned into pBluescript SK and sequenced on both strands by automated sequence analysis. A rat PTP-specific peptide comprising amino acids 121-134 (SKDRYKTILPNPQS) with a cysteine residue at the carboxyl end was synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes (Emeryville, CA). Antibodies were generated in rabbits as described previously(15Benhamou M. Ryba N.J.P. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23318-23324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some affinity-purified anti-PTP antibodies were biotinylated using NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Whole cell lysates from both nonstimulated and activated RBL-2H3 cells were used as described previously(20Swaim W.D. Minoguchi K. Oliver C. Hamawy M.M. Kihara H. Stephan V. Berenstein E.H.

Blots were probed with 100 ng/ml biotinylated anti-rat HePTP and 10 pg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce). Immunofluorescence microscopy was as described previously (20Swaim W.D. Minoguchi K. Oliver C. Hamawy M.M. Kihara H. Stephan V. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

RBL-2H3 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures as described previously(31Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). For activation, 150-mm diameter Petri dishes were seeded with 1.2-2 × 107 cells. After overnight culture, the cell monolayers were washed twice with 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. The cells were then incubated at 37°C for 10 min unless otherwise indicated in 10 ml of Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's salts containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), and 0.03 μg/ml anti-FcɛRI monoclonal antibody BC4; 0.5 μM calcium ionophore A23187; or 40 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The supernatants were removed and assayed for histamine by automated analysis(32Siraganian R.P. Hook W.A. Rose N.R. Friedman H. Fahey J.L. Manual of Clinical Laboratory Immunology. 3rd Ed. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1986: 675-684Google Scholar). After activation, the monolayers were washed once with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (concentrations as in lysis buffer), solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (3% Brij 96, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 90 milliunits/ml aprotinin). Postnuclear lysates were precleared 1 h at 4°C with protein A-agarose, and proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4°C for 1 h with 5 μg of affinity purified anti-rat HePTP antibodies bound to protein A-agarose. The beads were washed 7 times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Brij 96, protease inhibitors, and protein A-agarose beads were from Sigma. Whole cell lysates and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4-20% linear gradient gels (Novex) under reducing conditions. Separated proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon) and blocked by overnight incubation in 4% protease-free bovine serum albumin (Intergen). For detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, membranes were probed with 40 ng/ml anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY-20 coupled to horseradish peroxidase (ICN). Signals were detected by chemiluminescence using a Renaissance kit (DuPont NEN) and Kodak X-Omat radiographic film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Membranes were then stripped of antibodies according to the protocol of the Amersham ECL kit and reprobed for PTP with 100 ng/ml biotinylated anti-rat HePTP IgG followed by 10 pg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce). Part of the catalytic domain of rat HePTP was amplified from RBL-2H3 cell cDNA using reverse transcriptase-based PCR and degenerate oligonucleotide primers. The amplified product was used to screen an RBL-2H3 cDNA λgt11 library. Out of 5 × 105 plaques surveyed, 5 hybridized to the probe. The 5 clones yielded similar sized cDNA, one of which was completely sequenced on both strands. Because the 5′-end (nucleotides 1-226) of the rat HePTP cDNA was missing, the remaining four clones, the RBL-2H3 cell λgt11 library, and a rat spleen library were all screened by PCR using phage-specific and HePTP-specific primers. However, no new products were found. Therefore, the 5′-end was generated using the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. The whole cDNA sequence obtained contains a single open reading frame encoding a putative protein 359 amino acids in length (Fig. 1). The presumptive initiation codon (nucleotides 107-109) is surrounded by a consensus Kozak sequence and is preceded by stop codons in all three reading frames. The rat and human sequences (27Zanke B.

By Northern blotting, rat HePTP was found to be restricted in its distribution to T cells and RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Northern blot analysis of HePTP mRNA expression in cultured cell lines and rat tissues. Northern blotting of 30 μg/lane total RNA was with a 180-base pair fragment (nucleotides 227-406) from the 5′-noncatalytic domain of the coding sequence. Samples were derived from: YAC-1 mouse T cell line (1), RBL-2H3 cells (2), hindbrain (3), olfactory bulb (4), cerebellum (5), frontal lobe (6), liver (7), thymus (8), spleen (9), kidney (10), heart (11), testis (12), lung (13).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if RBL-2H3 cells expressed the HePTP protein, cell lysates were separated by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. The rat HePTP had a molecular mass of ~40 kDa and an isoelectric point of ~6.9 (Fig. 3), in agreement with values predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence also suggested that the phosphatase was a cytosolic protein. Therefore, we examined its subcellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4). In unstimulated RBL-2H3 cells, the protein was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, with little if any appearing at the plasma membrane or in the nucleus (Fig. 4B). However, after stimulation through the high affinity IgE receptors, the cells spread (Fig. 4D) and it became apparent that the phosphatase was localized to globular-shaped subcellular compartments (Fig. 4E). As the immunofluorescent globules were more abundant than the secretory granules, it is unlikely that HePTP is present in secretory granules.Figure 4:Immunofluorescence localization of HePTP in resting and activated RBL-2H3 mast cells. RBL-2H3 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well tissue culture dishes. Following methanol permeabilization, the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml normal rabbit IgG (A and C) or affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat HePTP IgG (B, D, and E). Unstimulated RBL-2H3 cells (A and B) are characteristically rounded with a bipolar shape. After activation (C-E), they spread out along the substratum and take on a more fibroblast-like appearance. HePTP is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, but it is not found either in the nucleus or at the cell surface (B, D, and E). After cell activation, HePTP localizes to globular-shaped subcellular compartments. Original magnification of panels A-D is 40×, of panel E is 60×.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A prominent feature of signaling in RBL-2H3 cells is the phosphorylation of numerous proteins on tyrosine residues. To determine if rat HePTP also became tyrosine-phosphorylated in IgE receptor-activated cells, HePTP was immunoprecipitated from resting and from stimulated cells, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, HePTP was at best only weakly tyrosine phosphorylated in nonactivated cells. By contrast, after FcɛRI aggregation, HePTP underwent time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Phosphorylation was detectable by 1 min, peaked at 5-10 min, and declined thereafter. It did, however, remain detectable up to 60 min, the longest time point tested. Because rat HePTP became tyrosine-phosphorylated upon FcɛRI aggregation, it was possible that the phosphatase might interact with the receptor or one of the receptor-associated proteins. However, in immunoblotting experiments, we could not detect any HePTP in immunoprecipitates of Lyn, Syk, or of the IgE receptors, and conversely, we found no evidence of Lyn, Syk or of the IgE receptor subunits in HePTP immunoprecipitates. Thus, although HePTP is tyrosine-phosphorylated by receptor aggregation, it does not appear to physically associate with either Lyn, Syk, or the IgE receptors. Some proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine very early after IgE receptor aggregation, and others are phosphorylated only after a rise in intracellular Ca2+ and/or after activation of protein kinase C(9Benhamou M. Stephan V. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7310-7314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Benhamou M. Siraganian R.P. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 195-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. Cell. Signal. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments therefore examined the relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation of the HePTP, Ca2+ influx, and activation of protein kinase C. Stimulation with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was as effective as FcɛRI cross-linking at inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of HePTP (Fig. 6). In contrast, direct activation of protein kinase C by the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate failed to do so (Fig. 6). Therefore, an increase in intracellular calcium but not PKC activation can directly stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of HePTP. To more fully explore the role of extracellular calcium in the FcɛRI- and ionophore-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HePTP, RBL-2H3 cells were first rinsed and then activated in Ca2+-free media containing EDTA (Fig. 7, lanes 4-6). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, tyrosine phosphorylation of HePTP was substantially diminished when compared with controls (lanes 6 and 3). However, because some tyrosine-phosphorylated HePTP was still detected after receptor aggregation or after ionophore stimulation in Ca2+-free media (lanes 5 and 6), the small rise in intracellular Ca2+ due to release from intracellular compartments probably contributed the requisite divalent ions. Identical results were obtained when the concentration of EDTA in the wash and incubation media was 40 μM or 4 mM. Thus, FcɛRI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of HePTP is a Ca2+-dependent process and is one of the late signaling events. The cDNA we isolated is the rat equivalent of the human PTP HePTP or LC-PTP(27Zanke B. Suzuki H. Kishihara K. Mizzen L. Minden M. Pawson T. Mak T.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Adachi M. Sekiya M. Isobe M. Kumura Y. Ogita Z.I. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Yachi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). While the two human sequences are nearly identical, they do differ in one major respect: the location of the presumptive translation initiation codon. The cDNA sequence of LC-PTP, which was confirmed by genomic cloning, suggests an open reading frame that begins at nucleotide 105 (LC-PTP numbering). In contrast, the cDNA sequence reported for human HePTP is lacking a cytosine at nucleotide 115 (LC-PTP numbering), a position within the putative coding sequence. The cDNA sequence that we present here suggests that the translation initiation codon of rat HePTP is the same as that of human LC-PTP. Thus, it may be that the cDNA library clone from which the human HePTP sequence was obtained contained a deletion. By Northern blotting, human HePTP was detected in T cells and B cells (27Zanke B. Suzuki H. Kishihara K. Mizzen L. Minden M. Pawson T. Mak T.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Adachi M. Sekiya M. Isobe M. Kumura Y. Ogita Z.I. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Yachi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, we also found the rat equivalent of this PTP to be selectively expressed and now extend the list of cell types to include RBL-2H3 mast cells. It is interesting to note that T cells, B cells, and mast cells comprise a limited set of cells that express on their surfaces multisubunit immune response receptors(35Keegan A.D. Paul W.E. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 63-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Perhaps HePTP functions in a receptor-dependent manner in each of these cell types. The cytochemical distribution of rat HePTP is intriguing; it localizes to globular or elongated cytoplasmic elements. This suggests that the enzyme is compartmentalized to an organelle or to some subcellular specializations. We speculate that the NH2-terminal noncatalytic domain of HePTP may play a role in targeting the enzyme to its intracellular locales. PTP1B (36Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G.

A. 1994; 91: 7477-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) are other cytosolic PTP that contain amino-terminal sequences with homology to proteins that associate with the cytoskeleton. This has lead some to conjecture that these or other such PTP may be involved in focal adhesions(41Mauro L.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although the amino terminus of HePTP does not share homology with cytoskeleton-associated proteins, we nonetheless examined adherent RBL-2H3 cells for colocalization of the enzyme to sites of cellular attachment to the substratum. By laser confocal microscopy, HePTP did not accumulate along the basal (adherent) surface of RBL-2H3 cells. 4M. Swieter, E. H. Berenstein, W. D. Swaim, and R. P. Siraganian, unpublished results. Thus, it is unlikely that HePTP is associated with focal adhesion sites in these cells. The signaling process initiated by FcɛRI aggregation involves tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins. Here we report that FcɛRI aggregation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatase, HePTP. The results suggest that the FcɛRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HePTP is dependent on an elevation in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. First, cells activated through the IgE receptors in media lacking Ca2+ showed a dramatic diminution in the level of HePTP tyrosine phosphorylation. The residual low level of HePTP phosphorylation seen under these conditions may be attributed to the relatively small amount of calcium stored within intracellular compartments and released upon cell stimulation(42Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). Second, triggering of the cells with Ca2+ ionophore in either calcium containing or calcium-free media mimicked the results obtained by aggregating the FcɛRI. Thus, elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentrations are needed for the tyrosine phosphorylation of HePTP. The rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration that results from receptor engagement in many cell types is accompanied by activation of protein kinase C(42Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). Optimal tyrosine phosphorylation of some mast cell proteins, such as the focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) and the cytoskeletal protein paxillin, require both protein kinase C activation and influx of extracellular calcium (16Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hamawy M.M. Swaim W.D. Minoguchi K. de Feijter A.W. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4655-4662PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the present experiments, direct activation of protein kinase C with 40 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate failed to elicit HePTP phosphorylation. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of HePTP can occur independent of protein kinase C activation. The requirement for calcium mobilization in the tyrosine phosphorylation of HePTP indicates that it occurs late in the signaling cascade(43Benhamou M. Stephan V. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7310-7314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That is, it is preceded by other events including tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-~1, Lyn, and Syk. The time course experiments showing that HePTP became tyrosine phosphorylated between 1 and 5 min after FcɛRI aggregation also bear this out. The SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, Syp (also referred to as PTP1-D or SH-PTP2), was shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor activation(44Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 45Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). It was also constitutively tryrosine-phosphorylated in cells transformed with v-Src(44Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Src family of kinases may be involved in phosphorylating the PTP. Lyn is a Src family tyrosine kinase found in abundance in RBL-2H3 cells; it coimmunoprecipitates with the FcɛRI, and is believed to be critically important in the IgE receptor-mediated signal transduction process(10Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 21Jouvin M.H.E. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Vallé A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, we found no evidence that Lyn and HePTP interacted. Likewise, we found no evidence for an association between HePTP and the other FcɛRI-associated protein-tyrosine kinase, Syk. Because protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is a prominent feature of signaling through the IgE receptor in mast cells and basophils, protein-tyrosine phosphatases must play an important regulatory role. We have identified the rat equivalent of HePTP in RBL-2H3 cells, shown that it localizes to a cytoplasmic compartment, that it becomes tyrosine phosphorylated as a result of IgE receptor aggregation, and that this phosphorylation is dependent on Ca2+. These results strongly suggest that HePTP may be involved in the IgE receptor-mediated signaling cascade in these cells. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W1964049279,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) regulates numerous biological events, including T lymphocyte proliferation. Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R)-mediated signaling is triggered by ligand-induced heterodimerization of the IL-2R beta and gamma c subunits, which results in the activation of signaling intermediates that are associated with either IL-2R beta or gamma c. Previous mutagenesis studies of the IL-2R beta cytoplasmic tail demonstrated that the partially conserved box 1 and box 2 motifs and specific tyrosine residues are critical for growth signaling. By deletion and alanine scanning mutagenesis, another set of residues that are critical for IL-2R-mediated signaling has now been identified. These residues lie within the divergent 35-amino acid region separating box 1 and box 2. The role of this receptor subregion in early phases of IL-2R signaling was evaluated using BA/F3 stable cell lines expressing three functionally impaired mutants from this region. All three cell lines displayed substantially diminished growth responsiveness to IL-2. Receptor-mediated STAT factor activation, IL-2R beta phosphorylation, and Janus kinase activation were also markedly impaired. These findings indicate that this variable spacer region, which we have termed the V-box, is essential for the initiation of IL-2R-mediated signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W1970718771,"We recently reported that interleukin-3 (IL-3) stimulation of the murine IL-3-responsive cell line, B6SUtA1, results in the rapid phosphorylation of the beta subunit of the IL-3 receptor (IL-3R), not only on tyrosine residues but on serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) residues as well. Since this occurred even at 4 degrees C, it suggested that a Ser/Thr-specific kinase might be closely associated with the IL-3R. To test this possibility, IL-3R complexes were isolated with anti-IL-3R (alpha IL-3R) antibodies, and in vitro phosphorylation studies were undertaken. These revealed the presence of a 110-kDa protein that was heavily phosphorylated in vitro on serine and threonine residues and that bound selectively to gamma-ATP-Sepharose beads. Moreover, this protein, which was not the 110-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, was tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-3 and was specifically labeled in vitro with azido-[32P]ATP. These data, together with in vitro kinase inhibitor studies, suggest that an as yet uncharacterized H7- and staurosporine-sensitive 110-kDa Ser/Thr kinase may be constitutively associated with the IL-3R and activated following IL-3 stimulation. A comparison of IL-3R and erythropoietin receptor complexes suggests that this 110-kDa protein may be preferentially associated with the IL-3R."
