https://openalex.org/W2108994842,"The genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorder involves the interplay of common and rare variants and their impact on hundreds of genes. Using exome sequencing, here we show that analysis of rare coding variation in 3,871 autism cases and 9,937 ancestry-matched or parental controls implicates 22 autosomal genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, plus a set of 107 autosomal genes strongly enriched for those likely to affect risk (FDR < 0.30). These 107 genes, which show unusual evolutionary constraint against mutations, incur de novo loss-of-function mutations in over 5% of autistic subjects. Many of the genes implicated encode proteins for synaptic formation, transcriptional regulation and chromatin-remodelling pathways. These include voltage-gated ion channels regulating the propagation of action potentials, pacemaking and excitability–transcription coupling, as well as histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodellers—most prominently those that mediate post-translational lysine methylation/demethylation modifications of histones. Whole-exome sequencing in a large autism study identifies over 100 autosomal genes that are likely to affect risk for the disorder; these genes, which show unusual evolutionary constraint against mutations, carry de novo loss-of-function mutations in over 5% of autistic subjects and many function in synaptic, transcriptional and chromatin-remodelling pathways. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a broad group of brain development disorders, including autism, childhood disintegrative disorder and Asperger's syndrome, characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, repetitive behaviour and restricted interests. Two groups reporting in this issue of Nature have used large-scale whole-exome sequencing to examine the contribution of inherited and germline de novo mutations to ASD risk. Silvia De Rubeis et al. analysed DNA samples from 3,871 autism cases and 9,937 ancestry-matched or parental controls and identify more than 100 autosomal genes that are likely to affect risk for the disease. De novo loss-of-function mutations were detected in more than 5% of autistic subjects. Many of the associated gene products appear to function in synaptic, transcriptional, and chromatin remodelling pathways. Ivan Iossifov et al. sequenced exomes from more than 2,500 families, each with one child with ASD. They identify 27 high-confidence gene targets and estimate that 13% of de novo missense mutations and 43% of de novo 'likely gene-disrupting' (LGD) mutations contribute to 12% and 9% of diagnoses, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2008627757,"Whole exome sequencing has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding the genetic architecture of human disease. Here we apply it to more than 2,500 simplex families, each having a child with an autistic spectrum disorder. By comparing affected to unaffected siblings, we show that 13% of de novo missense mutations and 43% of de novo likely gene-disrupting (LGD) mutations contribute to 12% and 9% of diagnoses, respectively. Including copy number variants, coding de novo mutations contribute to about 30% of all simplex and 45% of female diagnoses. Almost all LGD mutations occur opposite wild-type alleles. LGD targets in affected females significantly overlap the targets in males of lower intelligence quotient (IQ), but neither overlaps significantly with targets in males of higher IQ. We estimate that LGD mutation in about 400 genes can contribute to the joint class of affected females and males of lower IQ, with an overlapping and similar number of genes vulnerable to contributory missense mutation. LGD targets in the joint class overlap with published targets for intellectual disability and schizophrenia, and are enriched for chromatin modifiers, FMRP-associated genes and embryonically expressed genes. Most of the significance for the latter comes from affected females."

https://openalex.org/W2056198580,"Genome-wide association studies have identified loci underlying human diseases, but the causal nucleotide changes and mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we developed a fine-mapping algorithm to identify candidate causal variants for 21 autoimmune diseases from genotyping data. We integrated these predictions with transcription and cis-regulatory element annotations, derived by mapping RNA and chromatin in primary immune cells, including resting and stimulated CD4(+) T-cell subsets, regulatory T cells, CD8(+) T cells, B cells, and monocytes. We find that ∼90% of causal variants are non-coding, with ∼60% mapping to immune-cell enhancers, many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe enhancer-associated RNA upon immune stimulation. Causal variants tend to occur near binding sites for master regulators of immune differentiation and stimulus-dependent gene activation, but only 10-20% directly alter recognizable transcription factor binding motifs. Rather, most non-coding risk variants, including those that alter gene expression, affect non-canonical sequence determinants not well-explained by current gene regulatory models."

https://openalex.org/W2054186703,"The in vitro generation, from pluripotent stem cells, of three-dimensional human gastric organoids (hGOs) that contain a physiological gastric epithelium comprising both progenitor and differentiated cell types, and have expected functional characteristics is described, as is modelling the pathophysiological response of the human stomach to Helicobacter pylori using these hGOs. James Wells and colleagues describe the generation of three-dimensional human gastric organoids (hGOs) in vitro using human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells as starting material. The hGOs contain a physiological gastric epithelium that comprises both progenitor and differentiated cell types, and have expected functional characteristics. The authors then use their hGOs to model the pathophysiological response of human stomach to the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. This new in vitro system might be helpful to elucidate the mechanisms underlying human stomach development and disease. Gastric diseases, including peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer, affect 10% of the world’s population and are largely due to chronic Helicobacter pylori infection1,2,3. Species differences in embryonic development and architecture of the adult stomach make animal models suboptimal for studying human stomach organogenesis and pathogenesis4, and there is no experimental model of normal human gastric mucosa. Here we report the de novo generation of three-dimensional human gastric tissue in vitro through the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. We show that temporal manipulation of the FGF, WNT, BMP, retinoic acid and EGF signalling pathways and three-dimensional growth are sufficient to generate human gastric organoids (hGOs). Developing hGOs progressed through molecular and morphogenetic stages that were nearly identical to the developing antrum of the mouse stomach. Organoids formed primitive gastric gland- and pit-like domains, proliferative zones containing LGR5-expressing cells, surface and antral mucous cells, and a diversity of gastric endocrine cells. We used hGO cultures to identify novel signalling mechanisms that regulate early endoderm patterning and gastric endocrine cell differentiation upstream of the transcription factor NEUROG3. Using hGOs to model pathogenesis of human disease, we found that H. pylori infection resulted in rapid association of the virulence factor CagA with the c-Met receptor, activation of signalling and induction of epithelial proliferation. Together, these studies describe a new and robust in vitro system for elucidating the mechanisms underlying human stomach development and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2122730216,"T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3, also known as HAVCR2) is an activation-induced inhibitory molecule involved in tolerance and shown to induce T-cell exhaustion in chronic viral infection and cancers. Under some conditions, TIM-3 expression has also been shown to be stimulatory. Considering that TIM-3, like cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1), is being targeted for cancer immunotherapy, it is important to identify the circumstances under which TIM-3 can inhibit and activate T-cell responses. Here we show that TIM-3 is co-expressed and forms a heterodimer with carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), another well-known molecule expressed on activated T cells and involved in T-cell inhibition. Biochemical, biophysical and X-ray crystallography studies show that the membrane-distal immunoglobulin-variable (IgV)-like amino-terminal domain of each is crucial to these interactions. The presence of CEACAM1 endows TIM-3 with inhibitory function. CEACAM1 facilitates the maturation and cell surface expression of TIM-3 by forming a heterodimeric interaction in cis through the highly related membrane-distal N-terminal domains of each molecule. CEACAM1 and TIM-3 also bind in trans through their N-terminal domains. Both cis and trans interactions between CEACAM1 and TIM-3 determine the tolerance-inducing function of TIM-3. In a mouse adoptive transfer colitis model, CEACAM1-deficient T cells are hyper-inflammatory with reduced cell surface expression of TIM-3 and regulatory cytokines, and this is restored by T-cell-specific CEACAM1 expression. During chronic viral infection and in a tumour environment, CEACAM1 and TIM-3 mark exhausted T cells. Co-blockade of CEACAM1 and TIM-3 leads to enhancement of anti-tumour immune responses with improved elimination of tumours in mouse colorectal cancer models. Thus, CEACAM1 serves as a heterophilic ligand for TIM-3 that is required for its ability to mediate T-cell inhibition, and this interaction has a crucial role in regulating autoimmunity and anti-tumour immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1996563138,"Whole-exome sequencing is used to compare the mutational landscape of adenomas from three mouse models of non-small-cell lung cancer, induced either by exposure to carcinogens or by genetic mutation of Kras; the results reveal that the two types of tumour have different mutational profiles and adopt different routes to tumour development. Allan Balmain and colleagues use whole-exome sequencing to compare the mutational landscape of adenomas from three mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer, induced by exposure to the carcinogens methyl-nitrosourea (MNU) and urethane, or by genetic activation of Kras (KrasLA2). Although the MNU-induced and KrasLA2 tumours carried the same initiating Kras mutation, MNU tumours also carry numerous non-synonymous point mutations. At the same time, KrasLA2 tumours carried numerous copy number alterations. This suggests that carcinogen-induced and genetically engineered models adopt different routes to tumour development. The results argue for a major role of germline Kras status in mutation selection during initiation. Collectively, these data demonstrate the utility of carcinogen models for understanding the complex mutation spectra seen in human cancers. Next-generation sequencing of human tumours has refined our understanding of the mutational processes operative in cancer initiation and progression, yet major questions remain regarding the factors that induce driver mutations and the processes that shape mutation selection during tumorigenesis. Here we performed whole-exome sequencing on adenomas from three mouse models of non-small-cell lung cancer, which were induced either by exposure to carcinogens (methyl-nitrosourea (MNU) and urethane) or by genetic activation of Kras (KrasLA2). Although the MNU-induced tumours carried exactly the same initiating mutation in Kras as seen in the KrasLA2 model (G12D), MNU tumours had an average of 192 non-synonymous, somatic single-nucleotide variants, compared with only six in tumours from the KrasLA2 model. By contrast, the KrasLA2 tumours exhibited a significantly higher level of aneuploidy and copy number alterations compared with the carcinogen-induced tumours, suggesting that carcinogen-induced and genetically engineered models lead to tumour development through different routes. The wild-type allele of Kras has been shown to act as a tumour suppressor in mouse models of non-small-cell lung cancer. We demonstrate that urethane-induced tumours from wild-type mice carry mostly (94%) Kras Q61R mutations, whereas those from Kras heterozygous animals carry mostly (92%) Kras Q61L mutations, indicating a major role for germline Kras status in mutation selection during initiation. The exome-wide mutation spectra in carcinogen-induced tumours overwhelmingly display signatures of the initiating carcinogen, while adenocarcinomas acquire additional C > T mutations at CpG sites. These data provide a basis for understanding results from human tumour genome sequencing, which has identified two broad categories of tumours based on the relative frequency of single-nucleotide variations and copy number alterations1, and underline the importance of carcinogen models for understanding the complex mutation spectra seen in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2070424221,"Lantibiotics are a class of peptide antibiotics that contain one or more thioether bonds. The lantibiotic nisin is an antimicrobial peptide that is widely used as a food preservative to combat food-borne pathogens. Nisin contains dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine residues that are formed by the dehydration of Ser/Thr by the lantibiotic dehydratase NisB (ref. 2). Recent biochemical studies revealed that NisB glutamylates Ser/Thr side chains as part of the dehydration process. However, the molecular mechanism by which NisB uses glutamate to catalyse dehydration remains unresolved. Here we show that this process involves glutamyl-tRNA(Glu) to activate Ser/Thr residues. In addition, the 2.9-Å crystal structure of NisB in complex with its substrate peptide NisA reveals the presence of two separate domains that catalyse the Ser/Thr glutamylation and glutamate elimination steps. The co-crystal structure also provides insights into substrate recognition by lantibiotic dehydratases. Our findings demonstrate an unexpected role for aminoacyl-tRNA in the formation of dehydroamino acids in lantibiotics, and serve as a basis for the functional characterization of the many lantibiotic-like dehydratases involved in the biosynthesis of other classes of natural products."
https://openalex.org/W2033627831,"The hot, X-ray-emitting intracluster medium (ICM) is the dominant baryonic constituent of clusters of galaxies. In the cores of many clusters, radiative energy losses from the ICM occur on timescales significantly shorter than the age of the system. Unchecked, this cooling would lead to massive accumulations of cold gas and vigorous star formation, in contradiction to observations. Various sources of energy capable of compensating these cooling losses have been proposed, the most promising being heating by the supermassive black holes in the central galaxies through inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma. Regardless of the original source of energy, the question of how this energy is transferred to the ICM has remained open. Here we present a plausible solution to this question based on deep Chandra X-ray observatory data and a new data-analysis method that enables us to evaluate directly the ICM heating rate due to the dissipation of turbulence. We find that turbulent heating is sufficient to offset radiative cooling and indeed appears to balance it locally at each radius - it might therefore be the key element in resolving the gas cooling problem in cluster cores and, more universally, in atmospheres of X-ray gas-rich systems."
https://openalex.org/W2059453813,"A detailed analysis of Arabidopsis leaf tissues using two new versatile techniques reveals that within vasculature tissue circadian clocks have characteristics distinct from those in other tissues, and that the vasculature clocks affect circadian clock regulation in other tissues; indicating that plants, like mammals, have a dual clock system. Biological circadian clock systems help many organisms to adapt their physiological activities to daily and seasonal environmental changes. In mammals, circadian clock systems have a dual nature, whereby a group of brain neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus acts as the central dominant clock, regulating local clocks in peripheral tissues. In contrast, it has long been thought that plant circadian rhythms are equivalent in all cells. Motomu Endo et al. now provide evidence that plants also have a dual-clock system. Through a detailed analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana leaf tissues using two new versatile techniques, the authors find that within the vasculature tissue the clocks have characteristics distinct from those in other tissues, and that the vasculature clocks affect circadian clock regulation in other tissues. Many organisms rely on a circadian clock system to adapt to daily and seasonal environmental changes. The mammalian circadian clock consists of a central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus that has tightly coupled neurons and synchronizes other clocks in peripheral tissues1,2. Plants also have a circadian clock, but plant circadian clock function has long been assumed to be uncoupled3. Only a few studies have been able to show weak, local coupling among cells4,5,6,7. Here, by implementing two novel techniques, we have performed a comprehensive tissue-specific analysis of leaf tissues, and show that the vasculature and mesophyll clocks asymmetrically regulate each other in Arabidopsis. The circadian clock in the vasculature has characteristics distinct from other tissues, cycles robustly without environmental cues, and affects circadian clock regulation in other tissues. Furthermore, we found that vasculature-enriched genes that are rhythmically expressed are preferentially expressed in the evening, whereas rhythmic mesophyll-enriched genes tend to be expressed in the morning. Our results set the stage for a deeper understanding of how the vasculature circadian clock in plants regulates key physiological responses such as flowering time."
https://openalex.org/W2103990390,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) represents a unique principle of oxidative degradation of recalcitrant insoluble polysaccharides. Used in combination with hydrolytic enzymes, LPMO appears to constitute a significant factor of the efficiency of enzymatic biomass depolymerization. LPMO activity on different cellulose substrates has been shown from the slow release of oxidized oligosaccharides into solution, but an immediate and direct demonstration of the enzyme action on the cellulose surface is lacking. Specificity of LPMO for degrading ordered crystalline and unordered amorphous cellulose material of the substrate surface is also unknown. We show by fluorescence dye adsorption analyzed with confocal laser scanning microscopy that a LPMO (from Neurospora crassa) introduces carboxyl groups primarily in surface-exposed crystalline areas of the cellulosic substrate. Using time-resolved in situ atomic force microscopy we further demonstrate that cellulose nano-fibrils exposed on the surface are degraded into shorter and thinner insoluble fragments. Also using atomic force microscopy, we show that prior action of LPMO enables cellulases to attack otherwise highly resistant crystalline substrate areas and that it promotes an overall faster and more complete surface degradation. Overall, this study reveals key characteristics of LPMO action on the cellulose surface and suggests the effects of substrate morphology on the synergy between LPMO and hydrolytic enzymes in cellulose depolymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2094013515,"β2-adrenergic receptor–mediated cAMP signaling from internal compartments is more effective compared to the plasma membrane in regulating a distinct set of genes, demonstrating a functional significance for the spatial separation of cAMP signaling. G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are well known to signal via cyclic AMP (cAMP) production at the plasma membrane, but it is now clear that various GPCRs also signal after internalization. Apart from its temporal impact through prolonging the cellular response, we wondered whether the endosome-initiated signal encodes any discrete spatial information. Using the β2-adrenoceptor (β2-AR) as a model, we show that endocytosis is required for the full repertoire of downstream cAMP-dependent transcriptional control. Next, we describe an orthogonal optogenetic approach to definitively establish that the location of cAMP production is indeed the critical variable determining the transcriptional response. Finally, our results suggest that this spatial encoding scheme helps cells functionally discriminate chemically distinct β2-AR ligands according to differences in their ability to promote receptor endocytosis. These findings reveal a discrete principle for achieving cellular signaling specificity based on endosome-mediated spatial encoding of intracellular second messenger production and ′location-aware′ downstream transcriptional control."
https://openalex.org/W2045158993,"Site-specific gene addition can allow stable transgene expression for gene therapy. When possible, this is preferred over the use of promiscuously integrating vectors, which are sometimes associated with clonal expansion and oncogenesis. Site-specific endonucleases that can induce high rates of targeted genome editing are finding increasing applications in biological discovery and gene therapy. However, two safety concerns persist: endonuclease-associated adverse effects, both on-target and off-target; and oncogene activation caused by promoter integration, even without nucleases. Here we perform recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated promoterless gene targeting without nucleases and demonstrate amelioration of the bleeding diathesis in haemophilia B mice. In particular, we target a promoterless human coagulation factor IX (F9) gene to the liver-expressed mouse albumin (Alb) locus. F9 is targeted, along with a preceding 2A-peptide coding sequence, to be integrated just upstream to the Alb stop codon. While F9 is fused to Alb at the DNA and RNA levels, two separate proteins are synthesized by way of ribosomal skipping. Thus, F9 expression is linked to robust hepatic albumin expression without disrupting it. We injected an AAV8-F9 vector into neonatal and adult mice and achieved on-target integration into ∼0.5% of the albumin alleles in hepatocytes. We established that F9 was produced only from on-target integration, and ribosomal skipping was highly efficient. Stable F9 plasma levels at 7-20% of normal were obtained, and treated F9-deficient mice had normal coagulation times. In conclusion, transgene integration as a 2A-fusion to a highly expressed endogenous gene may obviate the requirement for nucleases and/or vector-borne promoters. This method may allow for safe and efficacious gene targeting in both infants and adults by greatly diminishing off-target effects while still providing therapeutic levels of expression from integration."
https://openalex.org/W1966647250,"Establishing the hippocampal cellular ensemble that represents an animal's environment involves the emergence and disappearance of place fields in specific CA1 pyramidal neurons, and the acquisition of different spatial firing properties across the active population. While such firing flexibility and diversity have been linked to spatial memory, attention and task performance, the cellular and network origin of these place cell features is unknown. Basic integrate-and-fire models of place firing propose that such features result solely from varying inputs to place cells, but recent studies suggest instead that place cells themselves may play an active role through regenerative dendritic events. However, owing to the difficulty of performing functional recordings from place cell dendrites, no direct evidence of regenerative dendritic events exists, leaving any possible connection to place coding unknown. Using multi-plane two-photon calcium imaging of CA1 place cell somata, axons and dendrites in mice navigating a virtual environment, here we show that regenerative dendritic events do exist in place cells of behaving mice, and, surprisingly, their prevalence throughout the arbour is highly spatiotemporally variable. Furthermore, we show that the prevalence of such events predicts the spatial precision and persistence or disappearance of place fields. This suggests that the dynamics of spiking throughout the dendritic arbour may play a key role in forming the hippocampal representation of space."

In this crowdsourcing competition, competitors developed algorithms for the prediction of disease progression of 1,822 ALS patients from standardized, anonymized phase 2/3 clinical trials. The two best algorithms outperformed a method designed by the challenge organizers as well as predictions by ALS clinicians. We estimate that using both winning algorithms in future trial designs could reduce the required number of patients by at least 20%. The DREAM-Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life challenge also identified several potential nonstandard predictors of disease progression including uric acid, creatinine and surprisingly, blood pressure, shedding light on ALS pathobiology. This analysis reveals the potential of a crowdsourcing competition that uses clinical trial data for accelerating ALS research and development."
https://openalex.org/W2109737895,"Colobines are a unique group of Old World monkeys that principally eat leaves and seeds rather than fruits and insects. We report the sequencing at 146× coverage, de novo assembly and analyses of the genome of a male golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) and resequencing at 30× coverage of three related species (Rhinopithecus bieti, Rhinopithecus brelichi and Rhinopithecus strykeri). Comparative analyses showed that Asian colobines have an enhanced ability to derive energy from fatty acids and to degrade xenobiotics. We found evidence for functional evolution in the colobine RNASE1 gene, encoding a key secretory RNase that digests the high concentrations of bacterial RNA derived from symbiotic microflora. Demographic reconstructions indicated that the profile of ancient effective population sizes for R. roxellana more closely resembles that of giant panda rather than its congeners. These findings offer new insights into the dietary adaptations and evolutionary history of colobine primates."

https://openalex.org/W2092812546,"Ten eleven translocation (TET) enzymes catalyse the oxidative reactions of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to promote the demethylation process. The reaction intermediate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) has been shown to be abundant in embryonic stem cells and tissues but strongly depleted in human cancers. Genetic mutations of TET2 gene were associated with leukaemia, whereas TET1 downregulation has been shown to promote malignancy in breast cancer. Here we report that TET1 is downregulated in colon tumours from the initial stage. TET1 silencing in primary epithelial colon cells increase their cellular proliferation while its re-expression in colon cancer cells inhibits their proliferation and the growth of tumour xenografts even at later stages. We found that TET1 binds to the promoter of the DKK gene inhibitors of the WNT signalling to maintain them hypomethylated. Downregulation of TET1 during colon cancer initiation leads to repression, by DNA methylation, the promoters of the inhibitors of the WNT pathway resulting in a constitutive activation of the WNT pathway. Thus the DNA hydroxymethylation mediated by TET1 controlling the WNT signalling is a key player of tumour growth. These results provide new insights for understanding how tumours escape cellular controls."
https://openalex.org/W2018347789,"Alternative splicing of the gene encoding VEGF-A under ischemic conditions generates an antiangiogenic isoform of the protein that impairs revascularization under conditions of metabolic dysfunction in mice, and this isoform is found at elevated levels in patients with peripheral artery disease. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) generates tissue ischemia through arterial occlusions and insufficient collateral vessel formation. Vascular insufficiency in PAD occurs despite higher circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)1,2, a key regulator of angiogenesis. Here we show that clinical PAD is associated with elevated levels of an antiangiogenic VEGF-A splice isoform (VEGF-A165b) and a corresponding reduction in levels of the proangiogenic VEGF-A165a splice isoform. In mice, VEGF-A165b expression was upregulated by conditions associated with impaired limb revascularization, including leptin deficiency, diet-induced obesity, genetic ablation of the secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (Sfrp5) adipokine and transgenic overexpression of Wnt5a in myeloid cells. In a mouse model of PAD, delivery of VEGF-A165b inhibited revascularization of ischemic hind limbs, whereas treatment with an isoform-specific neutralizing antibody reversed impaired revascularization caused by metabolic dysfunction or perturbations in the Wnt5a-Sfrp5 regulatory system. These results indicate that inflammation-driven expression of the antiangiogenic VEGF-A isoform can contribute to impaired collateralization in ischemic cardiovascular disease."

https://openalex.org/W2130922853,"Thirty years ago it was shown that the non-enzymatic, template-directed polymerization of activated mononucleotides proceeds readily in a homochiral system, but is severely inhibited by the presence of the opposing enantiomer. This finding poses a severe challenge for the spontaneous emergence of RNA-based life, and has led to the suggestion that either RNA was preceded by some other genetic polymer that is not subject to chiral inhibition or chiral symmetry was broken through chemical processes before the origin of RNA-based life. Once an RNA enzyme arose that could catalyse the polymerization of RNA, it would have been possible to distinguish among the two enantiomers, enabling RNA replication and RNA-based evolution to occur. It is commonly thought that the earliest RNA polymerase and its substrates would have been of the same handedness, but this is not necessarily the case. Replicating D- and L-RNA molecules may have emerged together, based on the ability of structured RNAs of one handedness to catalyse the templated polymerization of activated mononucleotides of the opposite handedness. Here we develop such a cross-chiral RNA polymerase, using in vitro evolution starting from a population of random-sequence RNAs. The D-RNA enzyme, consisting of 83 nucleotides, catalyses the joining of L-mono- or oligonucleotide substrates on a complementary L-RNA template, and similar behaviour occurs for the L-enzyme with D-substrates and a D-template. Chiral inhibition is avoided because the 10(6)-fold rate acceleration of the enzyme only pertains to cross-chiral substrates. The enzyme's activity is sufficient to generate full-length copies of its enantiomer through the templated joining of 11 component oligonucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1986639355,"Although surgery remains the mainstay of curative treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), many patients still have high chance to experience disease relapse. It is therefore imperative to identify prognostic markers that can help predict the clinical outcomes of CRC. Aberrant microRNA expression holds great potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for CRC. Here we aimed to investigate clinical potential of miR-34a-5p as a prognostic marker for CRC recurrence and its functional significance. First, we validated that miR-34a-5p was downregulated in CRC tumour tissues (P<0.05). The expression level of tissue miR-34a-5p was then evaluated in two independent cohorts of 268 CRC patients. miR-34a-5p expression was positively correlated with disease-free survival in two independent cohorts (cohort I: n=205, P<0.001; cohort II: n=63, P=0.006). Moreover, the expression of miR-34a-5p was an independent prognostic factor for CRC recurrence by multivariate analysis (P<0.001 for cohort I, P=0.007 for cohort II). Ectopic expression of miR-34a-5p in p53 wild-type colon cancer cell HCT116 significantly inhibited cell growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. miR-34a-5p induced cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and p53 transcription activity in HCT116 cells, but not in the HCT116 p53 knockout (p53(-/-)) cells. miR-34a-5p significantly suppressed the HCT116 growth in vivo, whereas it showed no effect on the HCT116 p53(-/-) xenograft, indicating that the growth-inhibiting effect by miR-34a-5p was dependent on p53. In addition, the expression level of miR-34a-5p in patients with p53-positive expression was higher than that in patients with p53-negative expression (P<0.01). In conclusion, miR-34a-5p inhibits recurrence of CRC through inhibiting cell growth, migration and invasion, inducing cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2026257781,"Active DNA demethylation in mammals involves TET-mediated iterative oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC)/5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and subsequent excision repair of highly oxidized cytosine bases 5-formylcytosine (5fC)/5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). However, quantitative and high-resolution analysis of active DNA demethylation activity remains challenging. Here, we describe M.SssI methylase-assisted bisulfite sequencing (MAB-seq), a method that directly maps 5fC/5caC at single-base resolution. Genome-wide MAB-seq allows systematic identification of 5fC/5caC in Tdg-depleted embryonic stem cells, thereby generating a base-resolution map of active DNA demethylome. A comparison of 5fC/5caC and 5hmC distribution maps indicates that catalytic processivity of TET enzymes correlates with local chromatin accessibility. MAB-seq also reveals strong strand asymmetry of active demethylation within palindromic CpGs. Integrating MAB-seq with other base-resolution mapping methods enables quantitative measurement of cytosine modification states at key transitioning steps of the active DNA demethylation cascade and reveals a regulatory role of 5fC/5caC excision repair in this step-wise process."
https://openalex.org/W2122612768,"Primate inferotemporal cortex is subdivided into domains for biologically important categories, such as faces, bodies and scenes, as well as domains for culturally entrained categories, such as text or buildings.

To ask what determines the locations of such domains, we intensively trained seven juvenile monkeys to recognize three distinct sets of shapes. After training, the monkeys developed regions that were selectively responsive to each trained set. The location of each specialization was similar across monkeys, despite differences in training order. This indicates that the location of training effects does not depend on function or expertise, but rather on some kind of proto-organization. We explore the possibility that this proto-organization is retinotopic or shape-based."

Here Yifan Cheng and colleagues report the 8.2 Å resolution electron cryomicroscopy structure of TmrAB, a 135 kDa heterodimeric ABC transport protein, in a nucleotide-free, inward-facing conformation. The structure shows that the cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains of this ABC transporter are in contact with each other. Comparison with the structures of other ABC transporters in various states suggest that the cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains slide and rotate during the transition from the inward-facing to the outward-facing conformation. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters translocate substrates across cell membranes, using energy harnessed from ATP binding and hydrolysis at their nucleotide-binding domains1,2. ABC exporters are present both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with examples implicated in multidrug resistance of pathogens and cancer cells, as well as in many human diseases3,4. TmrAB is a heterodimeric ABC exporter from the thermophilic Gram-negative eubacterium Thermus thermophilus; it is homologous to various multidrug transporters and contains one degenerate site with a non-catalytic residue next to the Walker B motif5. Here we report a subnanometre-resolution structure of detergent-solubilized TmrAB in a nucleotide-free, inward-facing conformation by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. The reconstructions clearly resolve characteristic features of ABC transporters, including helices in the transmembrane domain and nucleotide-binding domains. A cavity in the transmembrane domain is accessible laterally from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane as well as from the cytoplasm, indicating that the transporter lies in an inward-facing open conformation. The two nucleotide-binding domains remain in contact via their carboxy-terminal helices. Furthermore, comparison between our structure and the crystal structures of other ABC transporters suggests a possible trajectory of conformational changes that involves a sliding and rotating motion between the two nucleotide-binding domains during the transition from the inward-facing to outward-facing conformations."

https://openalex.org/W2073135856,"The scaffolding protein ankyrin-G is required for Na(+) channel clustering at axon initial segments. It is also considered essential for Na(+) channel clustering at nodes of Ranvier to facilitate fast and efficient action potential propagation. However, notwithstanding these widely accepted roles, we show here that ankyrin-G is dispensable for nodal Na(+) channel clustering in vivo. Unexpectedly, in the absence of ankyrin-G, erythrocyte ankyrin (ankyrin-R) and its binding partner βI spectrin substitute for and rescue nodal Na(+) channel clustering. In addition, channel clustering is also rescued after loss of nodal βIV spectrin by βI spectrin and ankyrin-R. In mice lacking both ankyrin-G and ankyrin-R, Na(+) channels fail to cluster at nodes. Thus, ankyrin R-βI spectrin protein complexes function as secondary reserve Na(+) channel clustering machinery, and two independent ankyrin-spectrin protein complexes exist in myelinated axons to cluster Na(+) channels at nodes of Ranvier."
https://openalex.org/W2069700766,"In this study, the authors show that the scaffolding proteins ankyrin B and ankyrin G are expressed by Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, respectively, and are enriched on the glial membrane at paranodal junctions where they interact with neurofascin 155. In addition, they find that ankyrins in oligodendrocytes have key roles in rapid and efficient paranode formation in the CNS. Neuron-glia interactions establish functional membrane domains along myelinated axons. These include nodes of Ranvier, paranodal axoglial junctions and juxtaparanodes. Paranodal junctions are the largest vertebrate junctional adhesion complex, and they are essential for rapid saltatory conduction and contribute to assembly and maintenance of nodes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying paranodal junction assembly are poorly understood. Ankyrins are cytoskeletal scaffolds traditionally associated with Na+ channel clustering in neurons and are important for membrane domain establishment and maintenance in many cell types. Here we show that ankyrin-B, expressed by Schwann cells, and ankyrin-G, expressed by oligodendrocytes, are highly enriched at the glial side of paranodal junctions where they interact with the essential glial junctional component neurofascin 155. Conditional knockout of ankyrins in oligodendrocytes disrupts paranodal junction assembly and delays nerve conduction during early development in mice. Thus, glial ankyrins function as major scaffolds that facilitate early and efficient paranodal junction assembly in the developing CNS."

Detailed structural analysis of neural circuits requires nanometer resolution, which can be obtained with serial-section electron microscopy. However, this technique remains challenging for reconstructing molecularly defined synapses. We used a genetically encoded synaptic marker for electron microscopy (GESEM) based on intra-vesicular generation of electron-dense labeling in axonal boutons. This approach allowed the identification of synapses from Cre recombinase-expressing or GAL4-expressing neurons in the mouse and fly with excellent preservation of ultrastructure. We applied this tool to visualize long-range connectivity of AGRP and POMC neurons in the mouse, two molecularly defined hypothalamic populations that are important for feeding behavior. Combining selective ultrastructural reconstruction of neuropil with functional and viral circuit mapping, we characterized some basic features of circuit organization for axon projections of these cell types. Our findings demonstrate that GESEM labeling enables long-range connectomics with molecularly defined cell types."

https://openalex.org/W2057619131,"Functional interpretation of genomic variation is critical to understanding human disease, but it remains difficult to predict the effects of specific mutations on protein interaction networks and the phenotypes they regulate. We describe an analytical framework based on multiscale statistical mechanics that integrates genomic and biophysical data to model the human SH2-phosphoprotein network in normal and cancer cells. We apply our approach to data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and test model predictions experimentally. We find that mutations mapping to phosphoproteins often create new interactions but that mutations altering SH2 domains result almost exclusively in loss of interactions. Some of these mutations eliminate all interactions, but many cause more selective loss, thereby rewiring specific edges in highly connected subnetworks. Moreover, idiosyncratic mutations appear to be as functionally consequential as recurrent mutations. By synthesizing genomic, structural and biochemical data, our framework represents a new approach to the interpretation of genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2004353424,"A classical nova occurs when material accreting onto the surface of a white dwarf in a close binary system ignites in a thermonuclear runaway. Complex structures observed in the ejecta at late stages could result from interactions with the companion during the common envelope phase. Alternatively, the explosion could be intrinsically bipolar, resulting from a localized ignition on the surface of the white dwarf or as a consequence of rotational distortion. Studying the structure of novae during the earliest phases is challenging because of the high spatial resolution needed to measure their small sizes. Here we report near-infrared interferometric measurements of the angular size of Nova Delphini 2013, starting from one day after the explosion and continuing with extensive time coverage during the first 43 days. Changes in the apparent expansion rate can be explained by an explosion model consisting of an optically thick core surrounded by a diffuse envelope. The optical depth of the ejected material changes as it expands. We detect an ellipticity in the light distribution, suggesting a prolate or bipolar structure that develops as early as the second day. Combining the angular expansion rate with radial velocity measurements, we derive a geometric distance to the nova of 4.54 +/- 0.59 kpc from the Sun."
https://openalex.org/W2080407374,"Antiestrogen resistance is a major problem in breast cancer treatment. Therefore, the search for new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for antiestrogen resistance is crucial. In this study, we performed a kinase inhibitor screen on antiestrogen responsive MCF-7 cells and a panel of MCF-7-derived tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant cell lines. Our focus was to identify common and distinct molecular mechanisms involved in tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant cell growth. We identified 18 inhibitors, of which the majority was common for both tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant cell lines. Two compounds, WP1130 and JNJ-7706621, exhibiting prominent preferential growth inhibition of antiestrogen-resistant cell lines, were selected for further studies. WP1130, a deubiquitinase inhibitor, induced caspase-mediated cell death in both tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant cell lines by destabilization of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Mcl-1 expression was found upregulated in the antiestrogen-resistant cell lines and depletion of Mcl-1 in resistant cells caused decreased viability. JNJ-7706621, a dual Aurora kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, specifically inhibited growth and caused G2 phase cell cycle arrest of the tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. Knockdown studies showed that Aurora kinase A is essential for growth of the tamoxifen-resistant cells and inhibition of Aurora kinase A resensitized tamoxifen-resistant cells to tamoxifen treatment. Preferential growth inhibition by WP1130 and JNJ-7706621 was also found in T47D-derived tamoxifen-resistant cell lines, pointing at Mcl-1 and Aurora kinase A as potential treatment targets. In addition, tumor samples from 244 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen showed that higher expression level of Aurora kinase A was significantly associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival, demonstrating the potential of Aurora kinase A as a biomarker for tamoxifen resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2081102630,"Prenylated flavonoids are attractive specialized metabolites with a wide range of biological activities and are distributed in several plant families. The prenylation catalyzed by prenyltransferases represents a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of the flavonoid skeleton in the biosynthesis of natural prenylated flavonoids and contributes to the structural diversity and biological activities of these compounds. To date, all identified plant flavonoid prenyltransferases (FPTs) have been identified in Leguminosae. In the present study two new FPTs, Morus alba isoliquiritigenin 3'-dimethylallyltransferase (MaIDT) and Cudrania tricuspidata isoliquiritigenin 3'-dimethylallyltransferase (CtIDT), were identified from moraceous plants M. alba and C. tricuspidata, respectively. MaIDT and CtIDT shared low levels of homology with the leguminous FPTs. MaIDT and CtIDT are predicted to be membrane-bound proteins with predicted transit peptides, seven transmembrane regions, and conserved functional domains that are similar to other homogentisate prenyltransferases. Recombinant MaIDT and CtIDT were able to regioselectively introduce dimethylallyl diphosphate into the A ring of three flavonoids with different skeleton types (chalcones, isoflavones, and flavones). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MaIDT and CtIDT are distantly related to their homologs in Leguminosae, which suggests that FPTs in Moraceae and Leguminosae might have evolved independently. MaIDT and CtIDT represent the first two non-Leguminosae FPTs to be identified in plants and could thus lead to the identification of additional evolutionarily varied FPTs in other non-Leguminosae plants and could elucidate the biosyntheses of prenylated flavonoids in various plants. Furthermore, MaIDT and CtIDT might be used for regiospecific prenylation of flavonoids to produce bioactive compounds for potential therapeutic applications due to their high efficiency and catalytic promiscuity."

https://openalex.org/W2071884298,"Cryptococcosis is an infectious disease caused by pathogenic fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. The ceramide structure (methyl-d18:2/h18:0) of C. neoformans glucosylceramide (GlcCer) is characteristic and strongly related to its pathogenicity. We recently identified endoglycoceramidase-related protein 1 (EGCrP1) as a glucocerebrosidase in C. neoformans and showed that it was involved in the quality control of GlcCer by eliminating immature GlcCer during the synthesis of GlcCer (Ishibashi, Y., Ikeda, K., Sakaguchi, K., Okino, N., Taguchi, R., and Ito, M. (2012) Quality control of fungus-specific glucosylceramide in Cryptococcus neoformans by endoglycoceramidase-related protein 1 (EGCrP1). J. Biol. Chem. 287, 368-381). We herein identified and characterized EGCrP2, a homologue of EGCrP1, as the enzyme responsible for sterylglucoside catabolism in C. neoformans. In contrast to EGCrP1, which is specific to GlcCer, EGCrP2 hydrolyzed various β-glucosides, including GlcCer, cholesteryl-β-glucoside, ergosteryl-β-glucoside, sitosteryl-β-glucoside, and para-nitrophenyl-β-glucoside, but not α-glucosides or β-galactosides, under acidic conditions. Disruption of the EGCrP2 gene (egcrp2) resulted in the accumulation of a glycolipid, the structure of which was determined following purification to ergosteryl-3β-glucoside, a major sterylglucoside in fungi, by mass spectrometric and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. This glycolipid accumulated in vacuoles and EGCrP2 was detected in vacuole-enriched fraction. These results indicated that EGCrP2 was involved in the catabolism of ergosteryl-β-glucoside in the vacuoles of C. neoformans. Distinct growth arrest, a dysfunction in cell budding, and an abnormal vacuole morphology were detected in the egcrp2-disrupted mutants, suggesting that EGCrP2 may be a promising target for anti-cryptococcal drugs. EGCrP2, classified into glycohydrolase family 5, is the first steryl-β-glucosidase identified as well as a missing link in sterylglucoside metabolism in fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2093850295,"Branching morphogenesis is thought to be governed by epithelial-stromal interactions, but the mechanisms underlying specification of branch location remain largely unknown. Prompted by the striking absence of Hedgehog (Hh) response at the sites of nascent buds in regenerating tubules of the adult prostate, we investigated the role of Hh signalling in adult prostate branching morphogenesis. We find that pathway activity is localized to stromal cells, and that its attenuation by genetic or pharmacologic manipulation leads to increased branching. Decreased pathway activity correlates with increased stromal production of hepatocyte growth factor (Hgf), and we show that Hgf induces epithelial tubule branching. Regulation of Hgf expression by Hh signalling is indirect, mediated by Hh-induced expression of the microRNAs miR-26a and miR-26b, which in turn downregulate expression of Hgf. Prostate tubule branching thus may be initiated from regions of low Hh pathway activity, with implications for the prostatic hyperplasia commonly observed in late adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2020914546,"MCPH1, also known as BRIT1, has recently been identified as a novel key regulatory gene of the DNA damage response pathway. MCPH1 is located on human chromosome 8p23.1, where human cancers frequently show loss of heterozygosity. As such, MCPH1 is aberrantly expressed in many malignancies, including breast and ovarian cancers, and the function of MCPH1 has been implicated in tumor suppression. However, it remains poorly understood whether MCPH1 deficiency leads to tumorigenesis. Here we generated and studied both Mcph1(-/-) and Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice; we showed that Mcph1(-/-) mice developed tumors with long latency, and that primary lymphoma developed significantly earlier in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice than in Mcph11(+/+)p53(-/-) and Mcph1(+/-)p53(-/-) mice. The Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) lymphomas and derived murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were both more sensitive to irradiation. Mcph1 deficiency resulted in remarkably increased chromosome and chromatid breaks in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) lymphomas and MEFs, as determined by metaphase spread assay and spectral karyotyping analysis. In addition, Mcph1 deficiency significantly enhanced aneuploidy as well as abnormal centrosome multiplication in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) cells. Meanwhile, Mcph1 deficiency impaired double strand break (DSB) repair in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) MEFs as demonstrated by neutral Comet assay. Compared with Mcph1(+/+)p53(-/-) MEFs, homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining activities were significantly decreased in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) MEFs. Notably, reconstituted MCPH1 rescued the defects of DSB repair and alleviated chromosomal aberrations in Mcph1(-/-)p53(-/-) MEFs. Taken together, our data demonstrate MCPH1 deficiency promotes genomic instability and increases cancer susceptibility. Our study using knockout mouse models provides convincing genetic evidence that MCPH1 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene. Its deficiency leading to defective DNA repair in tumors can be used to develop novel targeted cancer therapies in the future."

Stable Foxp3 expression in the progeny of Treg cells is ensured by a positive feedback loop comprising the CNS2 (also known as TSDR) region in the Foxp3 gene locus, the Cbfβ-Runx1 transcription factor, and Foxp3 itself, in which CNS2, Cbfβ-Runx1, and Foxp3 bind to each other to form a transcription complex (7.Williams L.M.

Treg cells lacking CNS2, Cbfβ, or Runx1 gradually lose or down-regulate Foxp3 expression, indicating that defects in this positive feedback loop promote Treg cell instability (21.Rudra D. Egawa T. Chong M.M. Treuting P. Littman D.R. Rudensky A.Y. Runx-CBFβ complexes control expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 in regulatory T cells.Nat.

Role of conserved non-coding DNA elements in the Foxp3 gene in regulatory T-cell fate.Nature. 2010; 463: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The formation of this feedback loop is largely dependent on the methylation status of the CNS2 region and the DNA binding activity of the Cbfβ-Runx1-Foxp3 complex. Demethylated CNS2 in Treg cells favors the recruitment of the Cbfβ-Runx1-Foxp3 complex to CNS2, whereas methylated CNS2 in conventional T cells and TGF-β-induced Treg cells does not (22.Zheng Y. Josefowicz S. Chaudhry A. Peng X.P. Forbush K. Rudensky A.Y. Role of conserved non-coding DNA elements in the Foxp3 gene in regulatory T-cell fate.Nature. 2010; 463: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the DNA methyltransferase family promotes Treg cell instability by increasing the level of CpG methylation in the CNS2 region (18.Lal G. Zhang N. van der Touw W. Ding Y. Ju W. Bottinger E.P. Reid S.P. Levy D.E. Bromberg J.S. Epigenetic regulation of Foxp3 expression in regulatory T cells by DNA methylation.J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Attenuating the DNA binding activity of Foxp3 potentially breaks the CNS2-Cbfβ-Runx1-Foxp3 feedback loop, resulting in Treg cell instability. As a transcription factor, Foxp3 binds target gene loci through its forkhead/winged helix (FKH) domain, which is critical to Foxp3 function. Of great significance, most IPEX patients carry genetic mutations in the FKH domain (25.Barzaghi F. Passerini L. Bacchetta R. Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, x-linked syndrome: a paradigm of immunodeficiency with autoimmunity.Front. Immunol. 2012; 3: 211Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To explore the links among cell-intrinsic signaling pathways, the DNA binding activity of Foxp3, and Treg cell instability, we performed an unbiased screen for kinases that modulate the DNA binding activity of Foxp3 using a novel luciferase-based reporter system. We found that activation of the COT/Tpl2-MEK-ERK signaling pathway inhibited the DNA binding activity of Foxp3 and promoted Treg cell instability in vivo. Our results support the hypothesis that external inflammatory signals modulate Treg cell stability through the COT/Tpl2-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, which provides a potential target for therapeutic intervention to treat autoimmune diseases and optimize human Treg cell therapy. DNA elements with six tandem copies of an optimized FOXP3 binding motif (5′-gtaaacaagagtaaacaagtcacgatcgcaaggtaaacaagacaacacgattgtaaacaagtccgaattccaaggtaaacaagagtaaaca-3′) or five tandem copies of the Gal4DB binding motif (5′-cggagtactgtcctccgagcggagtactgtcctccgac tcgagcggagtactgtcctccgatcggagtactgtcctccgcgaattccggagtactgtcctccg-3′) were inserted into the NheI/BglII sites of the vector pGL3-promoter (Promega) to generate pFOXP3Luc or pGal4Luc, respectively. Plasmid pVP16-FL (full-length) was engineered by inserting a recombinant fragment, VP16-FOXP3, that contains the activation domain of herpes simplex virion protein 16 (VP16) and full-length human FOXP3 into the NotI/SalI sites of p3×FLAGcmv7.1 (Sigma). On the basis of pVP16-FL, other plasmids encoding truncated and/or mutated versions of VP16-FOXP3 or VP16-Gal4 were generated. Recombinant fragments HA-FOXP3DelN (amino acids 1–181 truncated), VP16-DelN, and VP16-Gal4 were also cloned into the NotI/SalI sites of pMSCV-IRES-Thy1.1. A library of 192 human kinases and kinase-related ORFs with a myristoylation sequence and FLAG epitope tag was obtained from Addgene (Addgene collection 1000000012) (26.Boehm J.S. Zhao J.J. Yao J.

To characterize the reporter system, 48-well tissue culture plates were seeded with 1 × 105 HEK293T cells/well 6 h before transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Type A DNA mixtures (p3×FLAGcmv7.1-based construct:pFOXP3Luc:pRL-TK = 75:25:1) were introduced into HEK293T cells according to the specifications of the manufacturers. Similarly, type B DNA mixtures (kinase construct:pMSCV-VP16-DelN:pFOXP3Luc:pRL-TK = 45:45:10:1) were prepared for the screening of the kinase library and the following experiments. U0126 was added to the cell culture 6 h after transfection at final concentrations of 0, 20, and 40 μm. pLEX-DUSP6 was cotransfected with COT constructs at a ratio of 2. The dose effects of kinase were analyzed by serial dilution of the kinase construct in the type B DNA mixtures. For all of the experiments described above, empty vectors, GAL4-derived constructs, or EGFP constructs were used for control groups. Cells were washed with 1× PBS and lysed with 1× passive lysis buffer 24 h post-transfection (Promega, catalog no. E1941). Dual luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega, catalog no. E1960) and GloMax®20/20 luminometers according to the specifications of the manufacturers. Experiments were conducted in triplicate. Data were normalized to control groups. Differences in relative light units or fold activation were analyzed for statistical significance using unpaired Student's t test. To test the DNA binding activity of various versions of FOXP3, 6-well tissue culture plates were seeded with 4 × 105 HEK293T cells/well 6 h before transfection. The p3×FLAGcmv7.1-based constructs were introduced into HEK293T cells according to the specifications of the manufacturers. Similarly, DNA mixtures (kinase construct:pVP16-DelN = 2:1) were introduced into HEK293T cells. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed with 1× PBS and lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors (Beyotime, China, catalog no. P0013F). The expression of versions of FOXP3 protein in cell lysates was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies. Properly diluted lysates were incubated with 10 μg of poly deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid (Sigma) and 40 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) coated with 5′-biotinylated FOXP3 binding oligonucleotide (5′-CAAGGTAAACAAGAGTAA ACAAAGTC-3′) overnight at 4 °C on a roller. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of ice-cold wash buffer (1× PBS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), resuspended in 40 μl of SDS sample loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. The protein degradation assay was performed by introducing mixtures (kinase construct:pMSCV-HA-FOXP3DelN = 1:1) into HEK293T cells. Cycloheximide (200 μg/ml, Sigma) was added to the cell culture 24 h after transfection. Following incubation for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h, cells were harvested and lysed for Western blotting assays using anti-HA and anti-β-actin antibodies. Foxp3-GFP-Cre×R26-loxp-stop-loxp-YFP (termed TregYFP in this study) reporter mice were crossed with wild-type C57BL/6 mice to create a mixed NOD×B6 background (13.Zhou X. Bailey-Bucktrout S.L.

All mice were housed and bred under the same environmental conditions at the Beijing Laboratory Animal Research Center in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals established by the Beijing Association for Laboratory Animal Science. All animal procedures were conducted according to the regulations of the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences Research Ethics Committee. The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Axillary and inguinal lymph node (pLN) cells from TregYFP mice were activated by plate-bound anti-CD3 (2 μg/ml/day) and anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml/day) for 5 days in the presence of 200 units/ml IL-2. COT inhibitor (CAS 871307-18-5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or U0126 (Sigma) was added to the cell culture medium at day 2 to a final concentration of 5 μm. Foxp3 protein expression was assessed at day 5 using a Foxp3 staining kit (eBioscience). The retrovirus vector LMP-Thy1.1 was engineered by inserting the Thy1.1 ORF into the NcoI/SalI sites of MSCV-LTRmiR30-PIG (Open Biosystems). A double-stranded DNA cassette that targets the coding region of mouse Cot was cloned into LMP-Thy1.1 according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Retrovirus production was performed as described previously (29.Ivanov I.I. McKenzie B.S. Zhou L. Tadokoro C.E. Lepelley A. Lafaille J.J. Cua D.J. Littman D.R.

Pooled splenocytes and pLN cells from TregYFP mice were activated by plate-coated anti-CD3/CD28 for 2 days in the presence of 200 units/ml IL-2 before FACS for YFP+ cells. Sorted YFP+ cells were then infected with retrovirus and continued to be stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 for 3 days in the presence of 1000 units/ml IL-2 before intracellular Foxp3 staining. Labeled anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD8 (53–6.7), anti-CD25 (PC61), anti-CD45R (RA3–6B2), anti-CD44 (IM7), anti-CD62L (MEL14), anti-Foxp3 (FJK-16s), anti-Helios (22F6), anti-IL-2 (JES6–5H4), and anti-IFN-γ (XMG1.2) antibodies and specific isotype-matched control antibodies were from BD Biosciences or eBioscience. For cytokine analysis, cells were incubated for 3–4 h at 37 °C with 0.5 mm ionomycin, 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and 3 mm monensin. Cells with YFP or GFP expression were prefixed in 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 2 min, fixed, made permeable using a Foxp3 staining kit (eBioscience), and stained for intracellular proteins. The stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer followed by data analysis using FlowJo software. Eight- to twelve-week-old mice were immunized subcutaneously at four sites (50 μl/site) with 200 μl of emulsified complete Freund adjuvant (Sigma) supplemented with 4 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Difco) and 300 μg of MOG35–55 peptide (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYR-NK, ChinaPeptides, China) and received intraperitoneal injections of 2 × 109 heat-killed Bordetella pertussis organisms (Beijing Tiantan Biological products Co., Ltd.) at the time of immunization and 48 h later. Clinical disease was assessed by the scoring of hind limb paralysis as follows: no signs, 0; flaccid tail, 1; hind limb weakness, 2; partial hind limb paralysis, 3; complete hind limb paralysis, 4; and moribund mouse, 5. To study the DNA binding activity of FOXP3, we developed a novel luciferase-based reporter system (FOXP3Luc) in HEK293T cells. Briefly, FOXP3Luc consists of a reporter plasmid containing six tandem copies of an optimized FOXP3-binding DNA motif inserted upstream of the SV40-Luc cassette (pFOXP3Luc), a vector expressing full-length or truncated FOXP3 fused to the FLAG-tagged VP16 activation domain, and pRL-TK as an internal control (Fig. 1A). Theoretically, the VP16 domain can recruit additional transcriptional activators to enhance the transcription of the SV40-Luc gene upon FOXP3 binding to target sites through its FKH domain (30.Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. GAL4-VP16 is an unusually potent transcriptional activator.Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). We first verified the function of the VP16 domain and the specificity of the FOXP3-binding elements by comparing the functions of different versions of FOXP3 in FOXP3Luc. Compared with the vector control, FOXP3FL (full-length) and FOXP3DelN (amino acids 1–181 truncated) had negligible effects on the readout of FOXP3Luc, whereas VP16-FL and VP16-DelN strikingly elevated the activity (∼3- and ∼30-fold, respectively) (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the optimized FOXP3-binding elements acted as specific targets of FOXP3 (but not the Gal4 DNA binding domain) in HEK293T cells, as shown by VP16-Gal4, which could not enhance the transcription of luciferase. It was striking that deletion of the N-terminal FOXP3 repressor domain (amino acids 1–181) increased the DNA binding activity of the FKH domain, which is consistent with gel shift findings reported previously (31.Koh K.P. Sundrud M.S. Rao A. Domain requirements and sequence specificity of DNA binding for the forkhead transcription factor FOXP3.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Next we compared the DNA binding activities of VP16-DelN variants harboring different IPEX mutations. Compared with wild-type VP16-DelN, the F324L mutation had little effect on the function of VP16-DelN in FOXP3Luc. The A384T mutation caused a mild reduction in activity, and the M370I, F371C, F373A, and R397W mutations caused severe reductions, indicating that FOXP3Luc recapitulates the function of the FOXP3 FKH domain with high sensitivity and fidelity (Fig. 1C). Finally, to directly prove that FOXPLuc can indicate the DNA binding activity of FOXP3, we performed a DNA pulldown assay using streptavidin-agarose beads coated with 5′-biotinylated FOXP3-binding oligonucleotide. We found that VP16-Gal4 could not be detected in the pulldown products, whereas wild-type VP16-DelN yielded a strong signal in the same assay, indicating that VP16-DelN can specifically bind the 5′-biotinylated FOXP3-binding oligonucleotide. VP16-FL was poorly enriched by the beads, in line with its low activity in FOXP3Luc. Further, VP16-F324L showed comparable DNA binding activity to wild-type VP16-DelN, whereas the DNA binding activity of the VP16-M370I, VP16-F371C, VP16-F373A, and VP16-R397W mutants was severely attenuated. Moreover, VP16-A384T had moderately attenuated DNA binding activity (Fig. 1D). Taken together, the results of the DNA pulldown assays were consistent with the FOXP3Luc assay. Therefore, we suggest that FOXP3Luc can reliably represent the DNA binding ability of FOXP3. Similarly, we successfully constructed a Gal4Luc system, which had no mutual interference with FOXP3Luc (data not shown). To investigate the cell-intrinsic signaling network linked to Treg cell instability, it is reasonable to study kinases that participate in diverse cellular signal transduction pathways. Therefore, we performed an unbiased screen for kinases that modulate the DNA binding activity of FOXP3 by utilizing a myr-kinase l"
https://openalex.org/W2022985192,"The polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyMT) is an oncogene that activates the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src, and physically interacts with Taz (WWTR1). Taz is a pro-oncogenic transcription coactivator of the Tead transcription factors. The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway activates the kinase Lats, which phosphorylates Taz, leading to its nuclear exclusion and blunting Tead coactivation. We found that Taz was required for transformation by PyMT, but counter-intuitively, Taz was exclusively cytoplasmic in the presence of PyMT. We demonstrate that in the presence of PyMT, wild-type Taz was phosphorylated by Lats, in a Src-dependent manner. Consistently, a Lats refractory Taz mutant did not undergo cytoplasmic retention by PyMT. We show that Yap, the Taz paralog, and Shp2 phosphatase were nuclear excluded as well. Our findings describe a noncanonical activation of Lats, and an unprecedented Tead-independent role for Taz and Yap in viral-mediated oncogenesis."
