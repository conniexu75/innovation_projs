https://openalex.org/W2026517167,"Ecosystems and other self-organizing systems develop system designs and mathematics that reinforce energy use, characteristically with alternate pulsing of production and consumption, increasingly recognized as the new paradigm. Insights from the energetics of ecological food chains suggest the need to redefine work, distinguishing kinds of energy with a new quantity, the transformity (energy of one type required per unit of another). Transformities may be used as an energy-scaling factor for the hierarchies of the universe including information. Solar transformities in the biosphere, expressed as solar emjoules per joule, range from one for solar insolation to trillions for categories of shared information. Resource contributions multiplied by their transformities provide a scientifically based value system for human service, environmental mitigation, foreign trade equity, public policy alternatives, and economic vitality."
https://openalex.org/W2067964664,"Although carbon has been subjected to far more study than all other elements put together, the buckminsterfullerene hollow-cage structure, recently proposed to account for the exceptional stability of the C(60) cluster, has shed a totally new and revealing light on several important aspects of carbon's chemical and physical properties that were quite unsuspected and others that were not previously well understood. Most significant is the discovery that C(60) appears to form spontaneously, and this has particularly important implications for particle formation in combustion and in space as well as for the chemistry of polyaromatic compounds. The intriguing revelation that 12 pentagonal ""defects"" convert a planar hexagonal array of any size into a quasi-icosahedral cage explains why some intrinsically planar materials form quasi-crystalline particles, as appears to occur in the case of soot. Although the novel structural proposal has still to be unequivocally confirmed, this article pays particular attention to the way in which it provides convincing explanations of puzzling observations in several fields, so lending credence to the structure proposed for C(60)."

https://openalex.org/W2029201381,"Measurements of the dissociation pressure of carbon dioxide hydrate show that this hydrate (CO(2) . 6H(2)O) is stable relative to solid CO(2) and water ice at temperatures above about 121 degrees K. Since this hydrate forms from finely divided ice and gaseous CO(2) in several hours at 150 degrees K, it is likely to be present in the martian ice cap. The ice cap can consist of water ice, water ice + CO(2) hydrate, or CO(2) hydrate + solid CO(2), but not water ice + solid CO(2)."
https://openalex.org/W2085433148,"The evolution of worker behavior in the social insects is usually explained by kin selection: although workers do not produce offspring, they do reproduce their genes by aiding the reproduction of relatives. The most difficult case for kin selection theory would be species in which workers are fully capable of reproducing but instead opt to rear brood of low relatedness. These conditions are perhaps best fulfilled by the swarm-founding wasps because they have little caste differentiation and their colonies usually have multiple queens, which should lower relatedness. Estimates of within-colony relatedness for three species in this group confirm that it is sometimes (but not always) very low. Inbreeding is negligible in these species, so the hypothesis that inbreeding may raise relatedness is not supported. The maintenance of worker behavior in such species is a significant challenge for kin selection theory."
https://openalex.org/W1984332778,"Four strains of anaerobic nitrogen-fixing, cellulose-fermenting bacteria were isolated in pure culture from freshwater mud and soil. Nitrogenase activity was demonstrated in these strains and also in several previously described anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria isolated from various natural environments. These are the first anaerobic bacteria known to use cellulose as an energy source for nitrogen fixation. Because cellulose is a plant polysaccharide that abounds in nature, these results raise the possibility that nitrogen-fixing, cellulose-fermenting bacteria may be widespread and thus play a major role in carbon and nitrogen cycling."
https://openalex.org/W2089927521,"A fourth specimen of Archaeopteryx (cf. lithographica), the oldest known fossil bird, was recently found in the collections of the Teyler Museum in the Netherlands. Unique preservation of the horny sheaths of the manus claws provides new evidence that may be relevant to the question of the origins of avian flight. Tentative interpretation suggests a cursorial rather than arboreal origin."
https://openalex.org/W2038597220,"Four core and soil samples from Apollo 12 are enriched in a number of trace elements of meteoritic origin to virtually the same degree as Apollo 11 soil. An average meteoritic influx rate of about 4 x 10(-9) gram per square centimeter per year thus seems to be valid for the entire moon. A sample from a light gray, coarse-grained layer in the core resembles lunar basalts in composition, but is enriched by factors of 10(4) to 10(5) in bismuth and cadmium."

https://openalex.org/W2034475591,"The planet Mercury was observed before, during, and after the inferior conjunctions of 29 September 1969 and 9 May 1970 at wavelengths of 3.75, 4.75, 8.6, and 12 microns. The average dark-side temperature is 111 degrees +/- 3 degrees K. The thermal inertia of the surface required to fit this temperature is close to that for the moon and indicates that Mercury and the moon have very similar top surface layers."
https://openalex.org/W2006932525,"Laser-selective demagnetization (LSD) enables the determination of the magnetic moment associated with individual mineral grains in thin sections of rock. Small volumes can be demagnetize with laser pulses directed through the optics of a microscope, permitting resolution of remanence components in individual mineral grains. LSD of mafic granulite samples revealed two paleomagnetic directional components of opposite polarity: one resided in coarse magnetite, the other in ilmenohematite-hemoilmenite exsolution intergrowths and fine magnetite indusions in clinopyroxene. These directions are consistent with those inferred from bulk demagnetization techniques, but LSD permits direct identification of the remanence carriers. The ability to discriminate magnetization components in different generations of a single mineral and to define intergrain magnetic moment distributions are significant advantages of LSD."
https://openalex.org/W2048643132,Wide-angle photography of Barnard's Loop Nebula suggests that the nebular emission is much less intense in the 1230- to 2100-angstrom spectral region than in the 2200- to 3200-angstrom near-ultraviolet region. This contrast may be due to differences in the absorption or scattering properties of the interstellar grains in these two wavelength regions.
