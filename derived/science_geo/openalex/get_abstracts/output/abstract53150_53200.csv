https://openalex.org/W1615913434,"The capacity of the mitochondrial fraction from gastrocnemius muscle to oxidize pyruvate doubled in rats subjected to a strenuous program of treadmill running. Succinate dehydrogenase, reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide dehydrogenase, DPNH cytochrome c reductase, succinate oxidase, and cytochrome oxidase activities, expressed per g of muscle, increased approximately 2-fold in hind limb muscles in response to the training. The concentration of cytochrome c was also increased 2-fold, suggesting that the rise in respiratory enzyme activity was due to an increase in enzyme protein. The total protein content of the mitochondrial fraction increased approximately 60%. These changes in the concentration of cytochrome c and total mitochondrial protein are of special interest because they suggest that exercise could serve as a useful tool for studying the biosynthesis of mitochondrial proteins. Mild exercise, such as that used in previous studies, was found to have no effect on the level of succinate dehydrogenase in muscle, suggesting that the failure of earlier studies to show an increase in respiratory enzyme activity resulted from the use of an insufficient exercise stimulus. Mitochondria from muscles of the exercised animals exhibited a high level of respiratory control and tightly coupled oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, the increase in electron transport capacity was associated with a concomitant rise in the capacity to produce adenosine triphosphate. This adaptation may partially account for the increase in aerobic work capacity that occurs with regularly performed, prolonged exercise."
https://openalex.org/W1482133448,"A spectrophotometric assay is described for staphylococcal nuclease, based on the increase in absorbance at 260 mµ which accompanies deoxyribonucleic acid and RNA hydrolysis. Initial velocities are proportional to enzyme concentration over a 70-fold range. The enzyme has greater affinity for DNA than for RNA, and activity is greater with heat-denatured DNA than with native DNA. No inhibitory products accumulate during the reaction. The enzyme is stable at pH values as low as 0.1, and in a concentration of 0.15 mg per ml there is no loss of activity after boiling (20 min). Dilute solutions are protected from heat inactivation by a mixture of albumin and Ca++ as well as by denatured DNA. The optimum pH for RNase and DNase activities is between 9 and 10, depending on the Ca++ concentration. At higher pH values, less Ca++ is required. The inhibitory effect of high Ca++ concentrations is more pronounced at higher pH values. Considerable DNase but no RNase activity results if Ca++ is replaced by Sr++, while Fe++ and Cu++ cause minimal activation. A number of heavy metal cations inhibit DNase and RNase activities competitively with Ca++; Hg++, Zn++, and Cd++ are the most potent of these. Activities resulting from combinations of DNA and RNA with Ca++ or Sr++ suggest that these substrates are hydrolyzed by the same or closely related regions on the enzyme. Enzyme activity toward DNA and RNA is strongly inhibited by 5'-phosphoryl (not by 2'- or 3'-phosphoryl) derivatives of deoxyadenylic, adenylic, and deoxythymidylic acids, and deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate is the most potent inhibitor. High activity is obtained with polyadenylic acid compared to polyuridylic acid, polycytidylic acid, and RNA. These findings are consistent with the known action of the enzyme (cleavage of the 5'-phosphoryl ester bond), and suggest that the differential activity toward DNA and RNA results at least in part from differences in the affinity toward the constituent bases of these nucleic acids."
https://openalex.org/W1501725220,"Abstract The high speed supernatant of rat testis homogenate contains an enzyme system which converts glucose 6-phosphate to myo-inositol. Although no additions are required to show this activity, heating of the preparation for 2 min at 60° is necessary to destroy a phosphatase which rapidly hydrolyzes glucose-6-P; glucose is not converted to inositol in this system. Alternatively, (NH4)2SO4 fractionation will remove the interfering phosphatase from the preparation, which after dialysis requires diphosphopyridine nucleotide and Mg++ for the formation of inositol from glucose-6-P. Omission of Mg++ results in the accumulation of a compound which has been isolated in crystalline form and identified as d-myo-inositol-1-P; no inositol is formed in the absence of Mg++. In the presence of Mg++, the ester, when put back in the system, is hydrolyzed to inositol and inorganic phosphate, showing the intermediate role of d-myo-inositol-1-P; the phosphatase responsible for this reaction is highly specific for equatorial cyclitol phosphates and 2'-adenylic acid and has been found in all rat tissues studied. The inertness of this enzyme toward glucose-6-P permits its use as a reagent in the assay of the diphosphopyridine nucleotide-dependent glucose-6-P cyclase, found in greatest abundance in testis. An investigation of the several functional units within the testis has shown that the major portion of testicular inositol is synthesized in the seminiferous tubules."
https://openalex.org/W1545382267,"Abstract Digestion of bovine glomerular basement membranes with purified collagenase resulted in the solubilization of over 90% of the carbohydrate and peptide portions. After further digestion of the solubilized material with Pronase, the carbohydrate units, with only a few amino acid residues attached, were isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Characterization of the glycopeptides separated by these fractionation procedures indicated the presence in the basement membrane of two distinct types of carbohydrate units. One type is a disaccharide unit containing glucose and galactose, while the second type is a heteropolysaccharide consisting of galactose, mannose, hexosamines, sialic acids, and fucose, with an average molecular weight of 3500. The carbohydrate of the basement membrane appears to be equally distributed between these two types of units. There are approximately 10 disaccharide units for every heteropolysaccharide unit in the membrane. The carbohydrate-peptide linkage of the disaccharide unit was shown to be a glycosidic linkage involving the hydroxyl group of hydroxylysine, whereas the attachment of the heteropolysaccharide unit to the peptide most likely involves asparagine. Periodate oxidation studies indicated that approximately 70% of the hydroxylysine residues of the basement membrane are involved in the linkage of the disaccharide unit."
https://openalex.org/W1569566110,"Abstract A procedure is described by which free brown fat cells can be obtained from the dorsal interscapular brown fat of rats. The brown fat cells accounted for less than 25% of the cells present in the intact tissue. The ratio of triglyceride to nitrogen in brown fat cells was about 10% of that in white fat cells. Growth hormone and 9α-fluoro-11β, 17α,21-trihydroxy-16α-methyl-1,4-pregnadien-3,20-dione (dexamethasone) did not accelerate brown fat cell lipolysis. The response of brown fat cells to adrenocorticotrophic hormone was less marked than that of white fat cells. However, the dose-response curve for stimulation by epinephrine of glycerol or fatty acid release in brown fat cells was similar to that observed in white fat cells. Epinephrine markedly stimulated oxygen consumption by brown fat cells. The Qoo2 for brown fat cells (based on lipid-free dry weight) was greater than 100 in the presence of epinephrine. Brown fat cells utilized considerably more free glycerol for re-esterification of fatty acids than did white fat cells. The conversion of labeled glycerol to carbon dioxide and fatty acid by brown fat cells was much greater than that by white fat cells and was unaffected by insulin. The metabolism of glucose by brown fat cells increased progressively over an 8-hour incubation period and was not inhibited by dexamethasone. Insulin accelerated the metabolism of glucose by brown fat cells and also decreased the stimulation of both fatty acid and glycerol release by epinephrine in either the presence or absence of glucose. Epinephrine increased glucose conversion to glyceride glycerol only in the presence of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1504677789,"Abstract The reaction of ferrimyoglobin with H2O2 was investigated by a combination of spectrophotometric and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and enzymic assay of of hydroperoxide by the cytochrome c peroxidase system. On the addition of an excess of H2O2 to ferrimyoglobin, approximately 1.5 moles of H2O2 were consumed per mole of the ferrimyoglobin peroxide compound formed, and the remaining H2O2 was slowly decomposed in the presence of the peroxide compound. George and Irvine's conclusion was confirmed that the peroxide compound retains only 1 oxidizing equivalent per hemin unit. Available evidence was consistent with the reaction mechanism of Equations 1, 2, and 3 (see text). Transient free radicals were formed not only during the active formation of the peroxide compound but also during the decomposition of hydroperoxide in the presence of the peroxide compound. Rate constants associated with the peroxide compound were compared with those of Complex ES (the peroxide compound) of cytochrome c peroxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1567706026,"The binding of iron to transferrin has been studied by electron paramagnetic resonance and optical absorption spectroscopy and by measurements of proton magnetic relaxation rates under conditions in which carbon dioxide (and therefore bicarbonate) is excluded. Even in the absence of bicarbonate, specific binding of Fe3+ to transferrin may occur. Nitrilotriacetate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and oxalate were found capable of replacing bicarbonate to form colored complexes with iron and transferrin. Since the nitrilotriacetate and oxalate complexes, in particular, have optical absorption spectra similar to those of the usual iron-transferrin-bicarbonate complex, their recognition depends on correlating electron paramagnetic resonance and optical studies. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the iron-transferrin-nitrilotriacetate complex consists of a line, 30 gauss in width, centered near the apparent g value, 4.25, whereas the oxalate complex shows a broad absorption, from 700 to 1400 gauss. In contrast, the bicarbonate complex has a spectrum centered near the apparent g value, 4.22, with a total width of 120 gauss. This spectrum is not influenced by changes in pH in the range, 6.1 to 10.5. Of a number of metal-complexing agents tested, only those with 2 or more carboxyl groups were found capable of replacing bicarbonate to form ternary complexes with transferrin and iron. Azide and thiocyanate were found ineffective, while a 100-fold excess of cyanide did not perturb the spectrascopic properties of iron-transferrin-bicarbonate. These findings suggest that bicarbonate is not simply coordinated to iron in iron-transferrin-bicarbonate. This view is corroborated by proton relaxation rate measurements, which show little change between iron-transferrin and iron-transferrin-bicarbonate. Cu2+ was also found to bind specifically to apotransferrin in the absence of bicarbonate, as evidenced by the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the Cu2+-transferrin complex, which is quite different from the spectrum of the Cu2+-transferrin-bicarbonate complex. Ternary complex formation among Fe3+, transferrin, and chelate was observed almost immediately after addition of the ferric chelates to apotransferrin in air. On standing in the presence of an excess of bicarbonate these complexes were gradually replaced, the time depending on the chelate, by the bicarbonate complex. It appears likely, then, that the initial and rapid step in the formation of iron-transferrin-bicarbonate is the formation of the ternary complex, iron-transferrin-chelate, while the slow reaction entails displacement of the chelate by bicarbonate."
https://openalex.org/W1986062079,"Herpesvirus was present in secretory glands and frequently in tears of rabbits with recurrent herpetic keratitis even in the absence of corneal lesions. In normal people, herpesvirus could be cultured from saliva and tears. Chronic virus multiplication in structures such as the lacrimal and salivary glands, rather than latency, may cause recurrent herpetic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1514660234,"Abstract Diamine oxidase was prepared from pig kidney by a procedure involving heat denaturation at 60°, ammonium sulfate fractionation, pH precipitation, column electrophoresis, and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The procedure gave 3200-fold purification over the crude kidney cortex homogenate. The purified enzyme was homogeneous by the criteria of gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Some preparations showed a slower component of about 10%. The purified enzyme was pink-yellow and showed two absorption maxima, at 405 and 480 mµ. The latter absorption was diminished by addition of substrate under anaerobic conditions and restored by adding oxygen. No flavin was detected in the purified enzyme. The enzyme contained 11 to 12 mµmoles of copper per mg of protein. The diethyldithiocarbamate-treated enzyme was catalytically inactive. The activity was restored by adding suitable amounts of cupric copper; however, an excess of this metal inhibits the activity. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum is typical of Cu(II) in an environment of tetragonal symmetry. All copper atoms appear to be equivalent and in the cupric state. Addition of excess substrate did not lead to reduction of the copper, but changes in the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum were observed which were specific for each individual substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1610813256,"The aim of the work was to provide tentative criteria for distinguishing between authentic and contaminating activities of plasma membrane preparations from rat liver. To this end, the specific activities and extractabilities were studied of eight activities found in the membrane preparations and in liver microsomes. Liver microsomes were examined since contaminants of the plasma membrane preparations, when they could be detected, were invariably derived from rough endoplasmic reticulum. One of the activities of the plasma membrane preparations (a threonine-dependent adenosine triphosphate-inorganic pyrophosphate exchange activity) appeared to be a soluble adsorbed contaminant; three others (an esterase, β-glucuronidase, and an amylase) seemed to derive from contamination with rough endoplasmic reticulum; and the remaining four activities (acid and alkaline phosphatase (substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate), a diphosphopyridine nucleotide-splitting activity, and phosphodiesterase) were considered to be components of the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1542661598,"Abstract The distribution of acetyl coenzyme A-carnitine acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.7) and of palmityl-CoA-carnitine palmityltransferase (EC 2.3.1) in subcellular fractions of rat liver has been studied. The distribution of carnitine palmityltransferase in the different fractions obtained with differential centrifugation and with centrifugation in a steep sucrose gradient correlated closely with the distribution of the mitochondrial marker enzymes, glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) and d-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30). Carnitine acetyltransferase also most probably is a mitochondrial enzyme. The results obtained suggest that this enzyme is present in a mitochondrial population not identical with the population rich in carnitine palmityltransferase and in the mitochondrial marker enzymes used. Most of the carnitine acyltransferases were found in the membranous part of the mitochondria. The findings presented are consistent with the hypothesis that the carnitine acyltransferases are present in the membranous part of the mitochondria which is the barrier for the acyl-CoA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1598467562,"Abstract Ribonuclease-resistant infectious double-stranded RNA has been isolated in milligram quantities from poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. Purification was accomplished by eliminating high molecular weight single-stranded RNA by differential NaCl precipitation and chromatographing the remaining RNA on columns of methylated albumin-Kieselguhr. The product has the following physicochemical and biological properties: (a) Homogeneity with respect to size, as determined by sedimentation analysis; (b) an s20w, of 17.2, which is compatible with the molecular weight of 4 x 106 anticipated for poliovirus double-stranded RNA; (c) buoyant density in Cs2SO4 of 1.60 g cm-3; (d) abrupt hyperchromic shift of 25% on heating, the value of Tm (temperature at midpoint) being dependent upon ionic environment; (e) nucleotide composition consistent with a base-paired, double-stranded secondary structure; (f) infectivity which is partially resistant to RNase and resistant to formaldehyde; (g) specific infectivity 30-fold greater than that of poliovirus single-stranded RNA; (h) optimal conditions for assay of infectivity which differ from those of single-stranded RNA. It is concluded that the RNase-resistant infectivity derives from information contained in a double-stranded molecule and that the replicative cycle initiated by double-stranded RNA must differ from the cycle initiated by single-stranded RNA. The fact that double-stranded RNA is infectious has definite implications regarding the possible functional role of this material in the virus growth cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1499683409,"In earlier work, a phosphorylated derivative of muramic acid was detected upon amino acid analysis of acid hydrolysates of pneumococcal C polysaccharide. This substance has now been identified as muramic acid 6-phosphate by periodate oxidation, followed by the identification of glycolaldehyde phosphate in the oxidation mixture. Muramic acid phosphate has been found in hydrolysates of the cell walls obtained from all of the eight other species of gram-positive bacteria examined. It accounts for 7 to 39% of the total muramic acid present. It cannot be found in the membrane or in the cytoplasm of Streptococcus, nor can it be detected in the two gram-negative species analyzed. In two organisms studied, Dipiococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus, evidence was obtained that the muramic acid phosphate isolated was originally part of a phosphodiester bond which cross-linked the mucopeptide polymer with the specific polysaccharide of the cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W1531560899,"Abstract The pH optimum of the spinach leaf alkaline fructose diphosphatase depends on the concentration of magnesium ion. At 5 mm MgC12 the pH optimum for enzyme activity is 8.5 and there is very little activity at 7.0. Increasing concentration of magnesium ion up to 40 mm, however, causes a shift of the pH optimum to 7.5. Appreciable activity is observed at pH 7.0 at the higher magnesium ion concentrations (20 to 40 mm). The fructose diphosphate concentration versus velocity curve is sigmoidal at the lower MgC12 concentrations."

Such neurons marked with fast green were found to lie in circumscribed areas of the periventricular gray of the third ventricle and aqueduct, and may represent a site of action of adrenocortical steroids in the regulation of corticotrophin releasing factor and/or adrenocorticotropin secretion by negative feedback."

https://openalex.org/W1487793176,"Abstract The low spin hemoprotein, microsomal Fex, which can be detected by electron spin resonance (ESR) in native liver microsomes, is converted to a high spin form by the action of hydrogen ions or by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate and other reagents for sulfhydryl groups. The optically observable CO-binding microsomal pigment, P-450, is simultaneously converted into another pigment, P-420. By purification, P-420 can be obtained in a low spin state in which only 10 to 20% of the heme is detectable by ESR; it is converted, by means of acid or reagents for sulfhydryl groups, into P-420, in which the heme is detected by ESR in a high spin state. The spin concentration corresponds quantitatively to the heme concentration and to P-420 concentration determined optically. Microsomal Fex (Yamano particles) contains only P-420, but its heme is quantitatively observable as low spin microsomal Fex. In this manner, microsomal Fex is shown to be a component structure of the P-450 ligand system, the spin state of which is dependent on pH and sulfhydryl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1527408421,"Abstract Acyl carrier protein hydrolase, a phosphodiesterase which catalyzes the hydrolysis of Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein to yield the prosthetic group and the apoprotein, was purified 30-fold from extracts of E. coli. Hydrolysis of acyl carrier protein by this enzyme requires manganese (or other divalent cations) and it is stimulated by sulfhydryl compounds such as dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol. The enzymatic reaction products are 4'-phosphopantetheine and the apoprotein which was isolated and identified by comparison of its molecular weight and amino acid composition to intact acyl carrier protein. Acyl carrier protein hydrolase is very specific in regard to substrate since it does not catalyze the hydrolysis of 4'-phosphopantetheine from large peptides of E. coli acyl carrier protein. It does, however, catalyze the cleavage of 4'-phosphopantetheine from E. coli acetyl acyl carrier protein and from Clostridium butyricum acyl carrier protein."
https://openalex.org/W1480935158,"Abstract Pretreatment of adenosine diphosphate-G-actin solutions with apyrase results in a marked decrease in their rate of polymerization at 0° induced by KCl, creatine phosphate, and creatine kinase. In contrast, apyrase has no effect on the rate of polymerization of ATP-G-actin. The retardation can be reversed by the addition of a low concentration of ADP or of ATP. By comparing the rate of polymerization of actin solutions at various concentrations with that of solutions in which the ADP content has been decreased by apyrase treatment, it appears that the effect of apyrase treatment cannot be accounted for by the decrease in polymerizable actin owing to the removal of the bound nucleotide. Studies on the time course of the action of apyrase on 14C-ADP bound to actin indicate that about 7% of the nucleotide initially present is free and that the free nucleotide can be rapidly hydrolyzed by apyrase with relatively little effect on the bound nucleotide. These observations suggest that free ADP is a necessary intermediary in the polymerization of ADP-G-actin by creatine kinase at 0°, and appear to rule out direct phosphorylation of the bound nucleotide of ADP-G-actin by creatine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1493292223,"The properties of glutamyl ribonucleic acid synthetase purified from rat liver were investigated. The pH optimum for glutamyl-RNA formation was about 6.8. The apparent Km values for glutamate, adenosine triphosphate, Mg++, and soluble RNA in the formation of glutamyl-RNA were 1.3 x 10-4 m , 2.1 x 10-4 m , 1.25 x 10-3 m , and 2.9 x 10-7 m , respectively. The enzyme also displayed some activity in the presence of Mn++ or Co++. Deoxy-ATP could partially replace ATP as the energy source. The enzyme was very specific for the glutamic acid structure, with many closely related analogues being unable to inhibit glutamyl-RNA formation. The purified liver enzyme was unable to utilize soluble RNA from yeast, Escherichia coli, or Bacillus subtilis. p-Mercuribenzoate, at very low concentrations, completely inhibited the enzyme, and the substrates did not protect against this inhibition. The enzyme catalyzed an anomalously low ATP-PPi exchange reaction under the usual conditions of assay, but this could be stimulated by the addition of high concentrations of glutamate or soluble RNA. The addition of soluble RNA lowered the apparent Km for glutamate in the exchange reaction from 0.2 m to 6.7 x 10-4 m and also increased the Vmax. The pH optima for the exchange in the presence of soluble RNA or high glutamate concentrations were different. The results are discussed in relation to a concerted mechanism of glutamate activation and transfer to soluble RNA and to the possibility of soluble RNA-PPi intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1500457998,"Abstract The effect of fasting on skeletal muscle lipids has been studied. The amount of phospholipid per g of muscle remained constant throughout prolonged fasting, although when death is imminent it appears that a small fall in phospholipid concentrations may occur. The distribution of lipid phosphorus among the various phospholipid subclasses was not found to be influenced by fasting. Triglyceride tended to increase in muscle during the early stages of fasting but was ultimately depleted when the period of fasting was quite prolonged. Muscle free fatty acids (FFA) were markedly increased during fasting, and evidence is presented that the changes in muscle FFA were not merely a reflection of the changes occurring in plasma FFA. The conclusion is drawn that the phospholipids of muscle are structural-functional elements that are not depleted during fasting for purposes of energy metabolism. It is also concluded that muscle triglyceride does not serve as an energy reservoir to be drawn upon rapidly during caloric deficiency, although if caloric restriction is sufficiently prolonged the triglycerides are then drawn upon to the point of nearly total depletion."
https://openalex.org/W1487696423,"Abstract A new terpene pyrophosphate synthetase (Enzyme II) distinct from the previously reported geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthetase (Enzyme I) has been isolated from extracts of Micrococcus lysodeikticus and partially purified. Enzyme II catalyzes the elongation of terpenoid allyl pyrophosphates by isopentenyl pyrophosphate to long chain products. The order of effectiveness of various allyl pyrophosphates in the elongation reaction is geranyl pyrophosphate g farnesyl pyrophosphate g geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate g dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. Isolation of doubly labeled terpene alcohol from experiments with 14C-isopentenyl pyrophosphate and 3H-farnesyl pyrophosphate and determination of 14C:3H ratios indicates the presence of 7 to 10 isoprene units in the elongation products with a predominance of the C35 and C40 alcohols. The same chain length distribution is estimated from the mass spectra of the acid-hydrolyzed products of Enzyme II. The incorporation of 32P from 32P-isopentenyl pyrophosphate and the acid lability of the 32P-labeled material indicate that the products formed are pyrophosphate derivatives. In contrast to shorter chain terpene pyrophosphates, the products formed by Enzyme II are not cleaved by bacterial alkaline phosphatase. They also have the unusual property of binding very strongly to protein."
https://openalex.org/W1972601625,Adenovirus type 12 transforms the fibroblastic BHK21 (baby hamster kidney) cell line into rounded or cuboidal cells that give rise in hamsters to undifferentiated small cell sarcomas indistinguishable from those induced in newborn hamsters by inoculation of the virus itself. In contrast. cells from this line transformed by polyoma virus retain their fibroblastic morphology and induce fibrosarcomas in hamsters. This suggests that the morphology of tumors induced by the adenovirus-transformed cells from this line may be determined by the viral genome and that such mechanism may also explain the remarkably uniform microscopic appearance which seems to characterize tumors induced in hamsters by direct inoculation of adenovirus type 12.
https://openalex.org/W2135427468,"Abstract A mucopolysaccharide-sulfating system from chick embryo cartilage has been localized in the 105,000 x g supernatant fluid prepared from cartilage homogenates. Adenosine triphosphate was an absolute requirement for sulfate incorporation, but inhibited at high concentrations; NAD+ stimulated sulfate incorporation but nucleotidyl sugars had little effect. Sulfate incorporation did not appear to be taking place into newly synthesized polysaccharide but rather into endogenous acceptors. Protamine chloride treatment of the supernatant fluid greatly diminished sulfate incorporation, which could be fully restored by boiled dialyzed supernatant fluid. A diverse group of polysaccharides was found to be capable of accepting sulfate, indicating that this sulfotransferase system is not highly specific."
https://openalex.org/W1480661645,"Abstract Previous studies (4) on the effects of glucocorticoid therapy on liver microsomal glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.9) and associated inorganic pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase activity have been extended to include investigations of the effects, in vivo, of the synthetic steroid triamcinolone when administered to animals in which protein biosynthesis had been blocked by treatment with actinomycin D. Actinomycin (10 µg/100 g of body weight) was administered daily for 3 days by intraperitoneal injection to a group of 11 rats. Triamcinolone (1.0 mg/100 g of body weight) was injected daily ½ hour later into five of these animals. Enzymic activities were assayed in fresh liver homogenates which were supplemented either with 0.1 part of 2% sodium deoxycholate solution or with an equal volume of distilled water. Glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase and pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase activity levels increased, respectively, to 139% and 177% of comparable values for activities in animals receiving actinomycin only, based on assays carried out in the absence of detergent. However, statistically significant differences in corresponding activity values for the two groups of animals disappeared when assays were carried out with detergent-supplemented homogenates. These findings constitute additional evidence supporting our earlier suggestion (4) that the principal effect of glucocorticoid therapy on the various activities of microsomal glucose 6-phosphatase is that of activation of preexisting enzyme; furthermore, they indicate that this process is independent of protein biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1511853797,"Cytochrome oxidase (Complex IV), reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide-cytochrome c reductase (a mixture of Complexes I and III), and succinic-cytochrome c reductase (a mixture of Complexes II and III) can be induced to form membranes by reducing the bile salt level of the suspending medium (in concentrated solutions of the complexes as prepared, the level of bile salt is sufficient to achieve molecular dispersion of the repeating units). When the membranes formed separately from the individual complex or sets of complexes are mixed prior to or during assay, the mixture of membranes fails to show DPNH oxidase activity (mixture of I + III and IV) or succinic oxidase activity (mixture of II + HI and IV). In a sucrose gradient these mixtures are separable by centrifugation into two distinct bands corresponding to the component membranes. However, the membranes formed by mixing either I + III or II + III with IV in concentrated solution, and then diluting, will catalyze the oxidation of DPNH or succinate by molecular oxygen (the test of reconstitution). Each of these membranes shows only a single band when centrifuged in a sucrose gradient. On the basis of these observations, reconstitution is interpreted in terms of the incorporation within a single membrane of the complete set of complexes necessary for a reconstituted activity. Reconstitution of electron transfer activity does not require selective interactions between, or alignments of, the complexes of the electron transfer chain. A membrane can be formed by any one complex with or without any of the other complexes; any proportions of two or more complexes can be achieved. These observations exclude the notion of stoichiometry among complexes. Cytochrome c, one of the electron transfer links between complexes, is incapable of moving from one membrane to another. Thus, reconstitution requires that not only the complexes but also the mobile components must be in the same membrane system."
https://openalex.org/W1543444205,"Rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase, following equilibration at pH 10 with lactate-2-3H, was precipitated by perchloric acid or reversibly denatured by 8 m urea. The enzyme protein after either method of inactivation was found to contain about 0.5 g atom of tritium label per 132,000 g of protein. The urea-denatured, labeled enzyme, after isolation by Sephadex chromatography and partial reactivation by dilution, was shown by “all-or-none” assay to transfer 63% of its tritium back to lactate or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. After acid or alkaline phosphate hydrolysis of the perchloric acid- or urea-denatured enzyme, 12 to 32% of the label was found in tryptophan isolated from the hydrolysate. Tritium assay of N-acetyl- dl -tryptophan and indole prepared from a sample of the labeled tryptophan indicated that the tritium was in the methylene group of the tryptophan molecule. These experiments suggest the participation of a tryptophanyl residue of muscle lactate dehydrogenase during reversible hydrogen transfer between lactate and NAD, via oxidation to an indolenine. This result is similar to that previously found for yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (2,3)."
https://openalex.org/W1553365848,Abstract A method is described for the purification of NAD+ kinase from extracts of Azotobacter vinelandii (ATCC 9104) cells. The specific activity of the purified enzyme is the highest so far reported. The enzyme requires a metal ion for activity. There is a lack of specificity for the nature of the phosphate donor in the kinase reaction. The Michaelis constants for the enzyme substrates have been determined by a direct spectrophotometric assay method which is described. The enzyme is protected to a remarkable extent from heat inactivation by NAD+. The enzyme appears to be a sulfhydryl enzyme; the sulfhydryl groups are protected by NAD+.

These antibodies show no measurable cross reaction with the enzymatically active form of alkaline phosphatase, but they can react with several denatured forms of the enzyme as well as with subunits that are capable of reassociating to yield active protein. Certain alkaline phosphatase-negative mutants of E. coli produce altered proteins that can be precipitated by these antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1592787821,"Glutamic dehydrogenase from bovine liver, studied by equilibrium dialysis, has a single reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide-binding site per protein chain of molecular weight 52,000. Guanosine triphosphate increases DPNH binding, while adenosine diphosphate and high ionic strength decrease binding. DPNH binding is independent of the concentration-dependent aggregation of the enzyme, and shows a simple dependence on DPNH concentration. These studies, therefore, fail to show a separate regulator site for DPNH on the enzyme, and do not show evidence for cooperative binding in this allosteric protein."

The mechanism of biosynthesis of this hydroxymethyltetrose was studied by determining the distribution of 14C in d-apiose after feeding various labeled precursors. Labeled d-apiose was isolated from this tissue, and an aliquot was reduced to d-apiitol. These two compounds were then oxidized with periodate to formic acid, formaldehyde, and glycolic acid, and the radioactivity in each of the carbon atoms of d-apiose was determined. The results show that d-glucose can serve as a precursor for all of the carbon atoms of d-apiose in L. minor, whereas acetate and dl-serine are probably converted to d-glucose before being incorporated into d-apiose. The evidence obtained in this study indicates that d-apiose is derived from d-glucose by the loss of carbon atom 6, followed by a branching reaction which occurs without randomization, and converts either C-3 or C-4 of d-glucose to one of the hydroxymethyl groups of d-apiose."
https://openalex.org/W1590414311,"Abstract A new type of phosphohydrolase that can hydrolyze only phosphate esters of sugars was purified from Neisseria meningitidis. The α-d-aldohexose 1-phosphates and d-ketohexose 1-phosphatase served as the best substrates for the sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase. The d-aldohexose 6-phosphates and d-ketohexose 6-phosphates were hydrolyzed at the same rate as the α-d-hexose 1-phosphates, with the exception of d-galactose-6-P and d-mannose-6-P, which followed at 30% and 28.5%, respectively. If the phosphate group of the d-aldohexose 1-phosphates was esterified in the β configuration at the first carbon atom, they no longer served as substrates. Both phosphate ester bonds of fructose-1,6-di-P were hydrolyzed. When position 6 of α-d-glucose-1-P was in the form of a carboxyl group giving the sugar acid α-d-glucuronic acid-1-P, its rate of hydrolysis was reduced only 25%. However, when position 1 of d-glucose-6-P or d-glyceraldehyde-3-P was in the form of a carboxyl group giving the nonsugars 6-P-gluconate and 3-P-glycerate, no significant hydrolysis was observed. The d-pentose phosphates and triose phosphates were hydrolyzed at a slower rate than the d-hexose 1-phosphates. The phosphate esters of the disaccharides α-gentiobiose-1-P and α-lactose-1-P were hydrolyzed at 66% and 15% of that of α-d-glucose-1-P, respectively. Phosphate esters other than the sugar phosphates were not hydrolyzed significantly by the purified enzyme. When cells were cultured in a complete basal medium, most of the sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase activity was specifically released into the sucrose-Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetate and cold water wash fractions, implying a surface localization. When cells were maintained in a salt medium lacking glucose and lactalbumin hydrolysate, most of the activity remained with the insoluble cytoplasmic membrane fraction. The latter activity could be partially released after storing the cells at 1–3° for 3 or more weeks. A method is described for the purification of the sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase from N. meningitidis. A similar type of enzyme was also purified from Escherichia coli. A purified preparation of the sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase moved as a single peak in sedimentation, and the s20,w was calculated to be 3.29 x 10-13 sec."

https://openalex.org/W1600929815,"Abstract Fasting ketosis caused no change in liver acetylcarnitine concentration but caused a decrease in muscle acetylcarnitine to one-half the control level. The combined acetyl coenzyme A and acetylcarnitine turnover rates for control and ketotic liver were, respectively, 4.66 and 10.90 mµmoles per g (fresh weight) per min; for normal and ketotic muscle the corresponding figures were 8.23 and 4.52 mµmoles per g (fresh weight) per min. With respiratory activity unchanged in ketotic liver, any increase in acetyl-CoA or acetylcarnitine turnover rate must reflect an increased rate of acetoacetate synthesis. By contrast, ketotic muscle was characterized by a decreased acetyl-CoA or acetylcarnitine turnover rate, a decreased acetylcarnitine pool size, a shift to a more oxidized state as indicated by measured ratios of lactate to pyruvate, and an increased specific activity of acetyl-CoA and acetylcarnitine. These results explain a previously reported observation that fasted ketotic guinea pigs that have received injections of acetate-1-14C expire less Co2 but more 14CO2 than their appropriate controls."
https://openalex.org/W1633528020,"Abstract Glucose 6-phosphatase from rat liver and kidney microsomes previously has been shown to catalyze an inorganic pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase reaction. Nordlie and Soodsma recently have suggested that formation and then degradation of glucose 6-phosphate by the combined action of phosphotransferase and phosphohydrolase activities of this enzyme may under certain conditions constitute part of a mechanism for facilitated transport of glucose across the kidney tubular cell. To attempt to gain additional insight regarding the possible significance of such a physiological role for the enzyme, studies of the effect of phlorizin, a potent inhibitor of tubular sugar transport, on both phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase activities of this enzyme were undertaken. Inhibition, in vitro, of both glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase and pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase activities of kidney homogenates and microsomal suspensions prepared in isotonic sucrose solution was noted over the entire range of phlorizin concentrations studied, 6.7 x 10-5 m to 6.7 mm. Sensitivity of activities to inhibition by this compound was either partially or completely abolished by supplementation of the homogenates or microsomal suspensions, to 0.2% (w/v), with sodium deoxycholate, sodium cholate, digitonin, Triton X-100, or Tween 20. Phlorizin was without discernible effect on activity of partially purified enzyme preparations obtained by fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation of deoxycholate-dispersed microsomal suspensions. Inhibition of phosphotransferase activity in homogenates or microsomes was markedly potentiated by the cationic detergent trimethylhexadecylammonium bromide. Kinetic analyses indicated that inhibition of both phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase activities by phlorizin was of the classical noncompetitive type. A value of approximately 0.7 mm for Ki for phlorizin was determined in the absence of detergent; the value was reduced to 0.2 InM when trimethylhexadecylammonium bromide was added (to 0.2%, w/v) to enzyme preparations prior to assay for activity. The effects of the administration in vivo of phlorizin on phosphotransferase activity of the enzyme were also studied. Reductions in activity per mg of kidney protein of as much as 18% were produced by intravenous injection of 0.1-g doses of phlorizin to rats. The data obtained appear to rationalize the initially apparently contradictory reports of earlier workers regarding the effects (or lack of effect) of phlorizin on glucose 6-phosphatase. The experimental observations reported in this paper also are interpreted to constitute added support for, but not direct proof of, the possible involvement of synthetic and hydrolytic activities of this enzyme in kidney glucose transport. It is suggested that the modifying effects of various detergents on phlorizin-sensitivity of the enzyme are manifest through selective action on both active and inactive silent phlorizin-binding sites in the enzyme preparation."

https://openalex.org/W1528182749,"Abstract The requirement for monovalent and divalent cations was studied in partial reactions of acetyl coenzyme A synthetase involving enzyme-bound acetyl adenylate; enzyme-bound complexes were isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. Formation of enzyme-bound acetyl-14C adenylate under equilibrium conditions, either from acetate-14C and magnesium-adenosine triphosphate or from acetyl-14C-CoA and adenosine monophosphate, required addition of activating monovalent cations, e.g. Rb+, Na+, or K+, and certain divalent metal ions, e.g. Ni2+, Fe2+, Cd2++, or Cu2+. The same dependence was shown for the enzymatic reaction of chemically synthesized acetyl adenylate with coenzyme A or magnesium-pyrophosphate. The maximum ratio attained for millimicromoles of enzyme-bound acetyl adenylate formed to units of acetyl-CoA synthetase added was 1.55; approximately the same ratio was obtained when the enzyme was saturated with 63Ni2+. This is compatible with two binding sites for acetyl adenylate and Ni2+ per enzyme molecule. Binding of free acetyl-14C adenylate to the enzyme required divalent cations, and the stoichiometry of divalent metal ion bound (Ni2+) to enzyme-bound adenylate was 1:1. Acetyl adenylate prevented removal of approximately 30% of the enzyme-attached 63Ni2+ by Sephadex, but little decrease in enzyme-associated radioactivity was noted after dialysis of enzyme-bound 63Ni2+ against NiCl. Activating monovalent cations (Rb+ or Na+) were not needed for binding acetyl-14C adenylate to the enzyme, but were required for its formation from substrates or for its reaction with coenzyme A. Any enzyme-bound intermediate formed in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of activating monovalent cations reacted completely with coenzyme A, indicating that formation of the complex, rather than its reaction with acceptor, is probably rate-limiting in the over-all reaction. Activating monovalent cations had a direct effect on enzyme-bound acetyl-14C adenylate as judged by the stabilization of the complex at 4°. Rough estimates of equilibrium constants for formation of enzyme-bound acetyl-14C adenylate from acetate-14C and magnesium-adenosine triphosphate at 4° were 8.7 x 104 m-1 at pH 7.4 and 5.5 x 104 m-1 at pH 8.0; these correspond, respectively to -ΔF°' values of 6.3 and 6.0 kcal per mole. From acetyl-14C-CoA and adenosine monophosphate, comparable constants were 1.9 to 3.0 x 104 m-1 at pH 7.4 and 1.1 x 105 m-1 at pH 8.0; these are equivalent to -ΔF°' values of 6.8 and 6.4 kcal per mole."

https://openalex.org/W1510129920,"Abstract Phosphoserine phosphatase has been partially purified from mouse brain. The preparation catalyzes the phosphohydrolysis of phosphoserine at an optimal pH of about 6.2. This hydrolysis is strongly inhibited by serine. The preparation also catalyzes an exchange reaction whereby the phosphoryl group of phosphoserine is transferred to serine at an optimal pH of about 7.5. Treatment with urea results in inhibition of the hydrolytic activity and enhancement of the transferase activity. Conversely, transferase activity is inhibited by sucrose while the hydrolase activity or its inhibition by serine is unaffected. These iindings are not compatible with a mechanism that equates serine's activity as an inhibitor of hydrolysis with serine's role as a substrate in phosphotransferase. It is suggested that these two activities may be separate phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W1530181124,"Abstract The apparent pH optimum of oxalacetate reduction by the malate dehydrogenase of Bacillus subtilis changed from pH 9.0 to pH 6.0 during the three crystallizations required to achieve maximal specific activity. The change was apparently due to an alteration in the substrate inhibition characteristics of the enzyme. The degree of substrate inhibition at a given oxalacetate concentration was dependent upon the pH of the assay mixture, and was greater for the than for the crystallized preparations at each pH value studied. In the presence of excess oxalacetate at pH 9.0, the impure enzyme exhibited slight substrate inhibition, while the crystallized enzyme exhibited augmented activity with an increase in oxalacetate concentration. Some differences were also observed between the two forms with respect to their reactions with coenzyme analogues and malate. Conditions leading to unfolding or dissociation or both of the protein brought about transient changes in the substrate inhibition properties of the impure enzyme, but did not alter these characteristics of the crystallized enzyme. No conditions were found which would permanently convert either form of the enzyme into the other. The spectrum of an abortive ternary complex formed by the crystallized enzyme with oxidized substrate (oxalacetate) and oxidized cofactor (acetylpyridine analogue of diphosphopyridine nucleotide) is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W2086772739,"A STRAIN of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which in batch culture demonstrated little tendency to elongate was shown to do so in continuous culture when the supply of nitrogen was limited1. Because fewer cells elongated when sulphydryl compounds or sodium selenate were added to the medium, the sulphydryl–disulphide balance in the cells seemed to be implicated. Later investigations with the same yeast2 revealed that the change in cell shape was not closely paralleled by changes in total and individual carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids of the cells. Attention was therefore directed to enzymes thought to be important in cell extension. Nickerson et al. placed special emphasis on a protein-disulphide reductase system controlling the formation of disulphide bridges in mannan-protein of the wall. They demonstrated in bakers' yeast3 and Candida albicans4 that after oxidation with potassium ferricyanide of isolated cell wall protein, the disulphide linkages were reduced by isolated mitochondria. The protein-disulphide-reductase activity was, however, very low in a mutant strain of C. albicans with elongated cells4. It was of interest, therefore, to compare activities of mitochondria isolated from elongated and ovoid cells of our strain of bakers' yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1599670816,"Abstract Two kinds of sugar phosphate esters were isolated from a dilute ethanol extract of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain BCG. The chemical structures of these compounds were determined to be α,α-trehalose 6,6'-dimannosylphosphate and α-maltose l-phosphate. On mild acid hydrolysis, the former gave α, α-trehalose 6,6'-diphosphate and mannose via an intermediate compound which was identified as α, α-trehalose 6-phosphate 6'-mannosylphosphate. The liberation of reducing mannose was equivalent to the phosphomonoester group which appeared. α-Maltose 1-phosphate was obtained as a minor component. It was nonreducing, but was hydrolyzed by a phosphomonoesterase to give maltose and inorganic phosphate. The chemical structures of these sugar phosphates were confirmed by periodate oxidation. From another sugar phosphate fraction of BCG, a related sugar phosphate was isolated for which the chemical structure, α, α-trehalose 6-mannosylphosphate, was suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2072875691,"RECENTLY, Gillard, McKenzie, Mason, Mayhew, Peel and Stangroom1 presented optical rotatory dispersion data on non-haem iron proteins from several sources. They found that whereas the bacterial ferredoxins from Clostridium acidi-urici, C. pasteurianum and Peptostreptococcus elsdenii and the rubredoxin from P. elsdenii have very similar optical rotatory dispersion spectra in both the oxidized and reduced forms, these spectra differ qualitatively from that obtained with oxidized plant (parsley and spinach) ferredoxin. No data were presented on reduced plant ferredoxin, and indeed it has been reported2 that reduced plant ferredoxin has no optical activity in the visible region of the spectrum. Gillard et al. consequently suggested “that the bonding of iron in plant ferredoxin is entirely different from that in bacterial ferredoxin and rubredoxin”."
https://openalex.org/W1493574365,"Abstract The constants for the dissociation of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide from both the binary (E. DPNH) and ternary (E . DPNH . d-malate) complexes of bovine heart supernatant malic dehydrogenase have been determined at pH values between 6 and 10 by spectrofluorometric techniques. The constants have minimum values at pH 6.5. Above pH 7, the presence of d-malate stabilizes bound DPNH. Furthermore, the dissociation constant of the binary complex increases at pH values above 9.0, although this is not observed for the ternary complex dissociation constant. The changes are interpreted as reflecting the titration of groups on the protein involved in the binding of DPNH. By use of similar techniques, the dissociation constant of the ternary complex with respect to D-malate has been measured. This constant is unchanged beween pH 6 and 8, but increases above pH 8. A group on the protein dissociating at pH 9.0 to 9.5 is considered to be involved in the binding of d-malate. Measurements of the quantum yields of fluorescence of DPNH in the binary and ternary complexes have been made between pH 6 and pH 10. No change in the quantum yield of the free protein can be observed in the pH range from 6 to 10. The results indicate that the quantum yield of DPNH in the complexes cannot be simply related to its dissociation constant. Some of the effect of d-malate on the DPNH quantum yield is attributed to local electronic interactions at the DPNH-binding site, producing changes in coenzyme fluorescence independent of changes in the stability of the bound DPNH. A parameter, q, which defines some properties of the energy transfer phenomenon is derived. In agreement with theoretical predictions, the energy transfer appears to be mainly nonradiative in nature. Examination of the q values indicates that a transition occurs between pH 7.0 and 7.5. A similar transition is observed with the ternary complex. The extent of quenching of the protein fluorescence upon binding of DPNH or DPNH + d-malate has also been measured. The degree of quenching, measured between pH 7.5 and 10.0, reflects the efficiency of energy transfer. In this pH region, the efficiency of energy transfer for both binary and ternary complexes decreases by 40 to 50% with increasing pH. The efficiency of energy transfer is about 10% greater in the ternary than in the binary complex. Below pH 7.5 the observed quenching is a reflection both of the energy transfer process and of quenching arising from other mechanisms. Optical rotatory dispersion studies of free supernatant malic dehydrogenase at pH 6.5 and 8.5, and of enzyme bound to DPNH at pH 8.5, gave almost identical b0 values. However, measurements carried out at pH 6.5 with the enzyme-DPNH complex show a 60% increase in b0 above the value obtained for this complex at pH 8.5. The pH- and DPNH-dependent transition observed from optical rotation and fluorescence studies may be related to a change in the kinetic properties of the enzyme (described in an earlier publication), which occurs over the same pH range."

https://openalex.org/W1490107603,"Abstract Experiments were conducted to determine which of the required factors for β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity becomes limiting when vitamin E-deficient liver homogenates or combinations of mitochondria and microsomes from the livers of either vitamin E-deficient or vitamin E-supplemented rats oxidize β-hydroxybutyrate. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was the only one of the required cofactors which was effective in restoring β-hydroxybutyrate oxidation in both vitamin E-deficient homogenates and in all combinations of mitochondria and microsomes. An initial concentration of 3 mm NAD delayed the onset of decline in oxidation by combinations of mitochondria and microsomes beyond that observed with an initial NAD concentration of 1 mm. The delaying effect due to extra NAD was more pronounced in the combination of vitamin E-supplemented mitochondria and microsomes. NADase activity was highest when microsomes of either type were present, although this activity was not always correlated with respiratory decline. However, the addition of nicotinamide, an inhibitor of NADase, prevented the microsomal-induced decline in oxidation. A study of the effect of pH on inhibitory activity revealed enhanced inhibition as the pH was lowered from 7.5 to 6.8. It is suggested that the microsomal inhibitor is the enzyme NADase and that it is mainly responsible for the respiratory decline. However, supernatant factors can prevent respiratory decline when E-supplemented microsomes are present even though the NAD concentration is quite low. An additional effect of E-deficient microsomes, which is closely related to NAD function, is possible."
