https://openalex.org/W4225980882,"Better understanding of the determinants of national life expectancy is crucial for economic development, as a healthy nation is a prerequisite for a wealthy nation. Many socioeconomic, nutritional, lifestyle, genetic and environmental factors can influence a nation's health and longevity. Environmental degradation is one of the critical determinants of life expectancy, which is still under-researched, as the literature suggests.This study aims to investigate the determinants of life expectancy in 31 world's most polluted countries with particular attention on environmental degradation using the World Bank annual data and British Petroleum data over the period of 18 years (2000-2017).The empirical investigation is based on the model of Preston Curve, where panel corrected standard errors (PCSE) and feasible general least square (FGLS) estimates are employed to explore the long-run effects. Pairwise Granger causality test is also used to have short-run causality among the variables of interest, taking into account the cross-sectional dependence test and other essential diagnostic tests.The results confirm the existence of the Preston Curve, implying the positive effect of economic growth on life expectancy. Environmental degradation is found as a threat while health expenditure, clean water and improved sanitation affect the life expectancy positively in the sample countries. The causality test results reveal one-way causality from carbon emissions to life expectancy and bidirectional causalities between drinking water and life expectancy and sanitation and life expectancy.Our results reveal that environmental degradation is a threat to having improved life expectancy in our sample countries. Based on the results of this study, we recommend that: (1) policy marker of these countries should adopt policies that will reduce carbon emissions and thus will improve public health and productivity; (2) environment-friendly technologies and resources, such as renewable energy, should be used in the production process; (3) healthcare expenditure on a national budget should be increased; and (4) clean drinking water and basic sanitation facilities must be ensured for all people."
https://openalex.org/W4206200394,"Vaccination is a major strategy to prevent the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, information about factors associated with men and women intention to be vaccinated are scarce. To determine COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and identify factors associated vaccine hesitancy according to sex, we performed a cross-sectional population-based random survey in Salvador, Brazil between Nov/2020-Jan/2021. Participants were interviewed to obtain data on intention to receive and pay for a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as on demographics, comorbidities, influenza vaccination history, previous diagnosis of COVID-19, and exposures and perception of COVID-19 risk. Among 2,521 participants, 2,053 (81.4%) reported willingness to use a COVID-19 vaccine and 468 (18.6%) hesitated to take it. Among those intending to get vaccinated, 1,400 (68.2%) would pay for the vaccine if necessary. Sex-stratified multivariable analysis found that men who were working and who had comorbidities were less likely to hesitate about using the vaccine. Among women, higher educational level and high perception of COVID-19 risk were associated with less vaccine hesitancy. In both groups, reporting influenza vaccination in 2020 reduced the chance of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. COVID-19 vaccine campaigns targeting to reduce vaccine hesitancy are urgently needed. These campaigns should consider gender differences in order to be successful."
https://openalex.org/W4225716354,"The potential role of medical students in raising awareness during public health emergencies has been acknowledged. To further explore their potentials as public educators and role models for the communities during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, this study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of these students toward COVID-19.An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students in Indonesia. Socio-demographics characteristics, social interaction history, information-seeking behavior, as well as knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 were collected through a self-reported questionnaire. A p-value of <0.05 indicated statistical significance.Out of 4870 respondents, 64.9% had positive attitude and 51.5% had positive practice toward COVID-19, while only 29.8% had adequate knowledge. Knowledge was slightly positively correlated with attitude and practice (ρ = 0.074 and ρ = 0.054, respectively; both p<0.001), while attitude was weakly correlated with practice (ρ = 0.234, p<0.001). Several factors including age, sex, place of residence, institution type, academic level, family income, history of chronic illness, prior volunteering experience, and perceptual awareness on COVID-19 were significantly associated with either knowledge, attitude, and/or practice toward COVID-19. Furthermore, health institution's and the government's press releases, as well as health expert opinions were deemed as the most reliable sources of COVID-19-related information-yet trivially none of these sources were associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice in the study population.Many undergraduate medical students in Indonesia had positive attitude and practice against COVID-19, yet only a few had adequate knowledge. This warrants further interventions to keep them updated with COVID-19 evidence to maximize their potentials in raising public awareness on COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4205916272,"Ethiopia's economy is dominated by agriculture which is mainly rain-fed and subsistence. Climate change is expected to have an adverse impact particularly on crop production. Previous studies have shown large discrepancies in the magnitude and sometimes in the direction of the impact on crop production. We assessed the impact of climate change on growth and yield of maize and wheat in Ethiopia using a multi-crop model ensemble. The multi-model ensemble (n = 48) was set up using the agroecosystem modelling framework Expert-N. The framework is modular which facilitates combining different submodels for plant growth and soil processes. The multi-model ensemble was driven by climate change projections representing the mid of the century (2021-2050) from ten contrasting climate models downscaled to finer resolution. The contributions of different sources of uncertainty in crop yield prediction were quantified. The sensitivity of crop yield to elevated CO2, increased temperature, changes in precipitations and N fertilizer were also assessed. Our results indicate that grain yields were very sensitive to changes in [CO2], temperature and N fertilizer amounts where the responses were higher for wheat than maize. The response to change in precipitation was weak, which we attribute to the high water holding capacity of the soils due to high organic carbon contents at the study sites. This may provide the sufficient buffering capacity for extended time periods with low amounts of precipitation. Under the changing climate, wheat productivity will be a major challenge with a 36 to 40% reduction in grain yield by 2050 while the impact on maize was modest. A major part of the uncertainty in the projected impact could be attributed to differences in the crop growth models. A considerable fraction of the uncertainty could also be traced back to different soil water dynamics modeling approaches in the model ensemble, which is often ignored. Uncertainties varied among the studied crop species and cultivars as well. The study highlights significant impacts of climate change on wheat yield in Ethiopia whereby differences in crop growth models causes the large part of the uncertainties."
https://openalex.org/W4205700765,"Background Chronic pain is a common condition which causes patients much suffering and is very costly to society. Factors known to be associated with chronic pain include female gender, acute pain, depression, and anxiety. This study investigated whether stress, sleep disturbance, and physical inactivity were risk factors for developing chronic pain among young adults, and whether there were any interactions between these. Methods This retrospective longitudinal study was based on an existing database from a cohort study on IT use and health, called Health 24 Years. A questionnaire was sent to students aged 19–24 in Sweden for five consecutive years, containing questions on pain, stress, sleep, physical activity, technology use, health, and more. In logistic regressions, stress, sleep, and physical activity at baseline were potential predictors of chronic pain one and four years later. In addition, a new variable including all possible interactions between potential predictors was created to test for effect modification between risk factors. Results At the one-year follow-up, stress, non-restorative sleep, and physical inactivity showed odds ratios of 1.6 (95% CI: 1.0–2.4), 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0–2.3), and 1.8 (95% CI: 1.1–3.0) respectively after adjusting for confounders, the reference being non-stressed, having restorative sleep and being active. At the four-year follow-up, stress showed an adjusted odds ratio of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3–2.9), while non-restorative sleep and physical inactivity were statistically insignificant. At the one-year follow-up, the interaction between risk factors were significant. The most clear example of this effect modification was to be inactive and not have -restorative sleep, compared to individuals who were active and had restorative sleep, showing an adjusted odds ratio of 6.9 (95% CI: 2.5–19.2) for developing chronic pain one year after baseline. This in comparison of odds ratios for only inactive respectively only non-restorative sleep being 1.7 (95% CI: 0.6–5.3) respectively 1.6 (95% CI: 0.7–3.5). Conclusions Stress, non-restorative sleep, and physical inactivity were risk factors for developing chronic pain one year after baseline, and stress were also a risk factor four years after baseline. These findings suggest that non-restorative sleep and inactivity are risk factors in the short term while stress is a risk factor in both the short and the long term. In addition to the independent effects of non-restorative sleep and inactivity, their combination seems to further increase the odds of chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W4205129197,"Differences in expressing facial emotions are broadly observed in people with cognitive impairment. However, these differences have been difficult to objectively quantify and systematically evaluate among people with cognitive impairment across disease etiologies and severity. Therefore, a computer vision-based deep learning model for facial emotion recognition trained on 400.000 faces was utilized to analyze facial emotions expressed during a passive viewing memory test. In addition, this study was conducted on a large number of individuals (n = 493), including healthy controls and individuals with cognitive impairment due to diverse underlying etiologies and across different disease stages. Diagnoses included subjective cognitive impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD, MCI due to other etiologies, dementia due to Alzheimer's diseases (AD), and dementia due to other etiologies (e.g., Vascular Dementia, Frontotemporal Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, etc.). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to evaluate cognitive performance across all participants. A participant with a score of less than or equal to 24 was considered cognitively impaired (CI). Compared to cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants, CI participants expressed significantly less positive emotions, more negative emotions, and higher facial expressiveness during the test. In addition, classification analysis revealed that facial emotions expressed during the test allowed effective differentiation of CI from CU participants, largely independent of sex, race, age, education level, mood, and eye movements (derived from an eye-tracking-based digital biomarker for cognitive impairment). No screening methods reliably differentiated the underlying etiology of the cognitive impairment. The findings provide quantitative and comprehensive evidence that the expression of facial emotions is significantly different in people with cognitive impairment, and suggests this may be a useful tool for passive screening of cognitive impairment."
https://openalex.org/W4205675932,"The article presents the results of the analysis of electric scooter user kinematics after a crash against a vehicle. The share of electric scooters (e-scooters) in urban traffic has been growing in recent years. The number of road accidents involving e-scooters is also increasing. However, the safety situation of electric scooter users is insufficiently researched in terms of kinematics and injury outcomes. The article presents the importance of this problem based on an in-depth literature analysis of e-scooter-related types of accidents, injuries percentages, and helmet use. Subsequently, four accident scenarios were designed and simulated using two numerical codes–LS-DYNA for handling finite element (FE) code (the vehicle and scooter model) and MADYMO for multibody code (dummy model). Scenario one is a side bonnet crash that simulates an accident when the scooter drives into the side-front of the vehicle. The second and the third simulation is a side B-pillar crash, which was divided into two dummy’s positions: the squat and up-right. The fourth simulation is a frontal impact. For each scenario, subsequent frames describing the dummy movement are presented. The after-impact kinematics for various scenarios were analyzed and discussed. The plots of the dummy’s head linear acceleration and its magnitude for the analyzed scenarios were provided. As the study is devoted to increasing riders safety in this means of transportation, the potential directions for further research were indicated."
https://openalex.org/W4206044542,"The expanding global trade in herpetofauna has contributed to new infectious disease dynamics and pathways that allow for the rapid spread of pathogens geographically. Improved biosecurity is needed to mitigate adverse biodiversity, economic and human health impacts associated with pathogen transmission through the herpetological trade. However, general lack of knowledge of the pathogen transmission risks associated with the global trade in herpetofauna and public opposition to biosecurity measures are critical obstacles to successfully preventing pathogen transmission. In 2019 we administered a survey to 2,007 members of the public in the United States of America to ascertain their support for interventions to prevent the spread of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), ranaviruses, and Salmonella through the herpetological trade. We presented survey respondents with different potential hazards associated with pathogen transmission through this trade, namely ecological, economic, and human health impacts. We used structural equation models to determine how these different hazards and respondents' characteristics influenced respondents' support for quarantine and veterinary observation of herpetofauna imported into the United States, mandatory tests for diseases of concern, and best practices to reduce stress and improve the care of live herpetofauna during transport to the United States. Respondents' values and their perceived susceptibility and sensitivity to different hazards associated with pathogen transmission were key determinants of their support for biosecurity. Respondents with strong biospheric and altruistic values demonstrated sensitivity to ecological and human health impacts associated with pathogen transmission, whereas respondents with strong egoistic values demonstrated sensitivity to economic impacts. Respondents had limited knowledge of Bd, Bsal or ranaviruses, the size of the herpetological trade, or how this trade may contribute to pathogen transmission. Improved outreach and education on pathogen transmission through the herpetological trade is required, but it is important that messages are tailored to people with different values to elicit their support for biosecurity."
https://openalex.org/W4206106122,"G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) was reported to be a potential target in the breast cancer therapy. This study aimed to illuminate the function of GPER and its mediated PI3K/AKT pathway in cryptotanshinone (CPT) inducing cell apoptosis and antiproliferation effect on GPER positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Cell proliferation was tested by MTT assay. Apoptosis rates were tested by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and the cell cycle was researched by flow cytometry. Autodock vina was applied to make molecular docking between CPT or estradiol and GPER. siRNA technique and GPER specific agonist G-1 or antagonist G-15 were applied to verify the mediated function of GPER. Apoptosis and cell cycle related proteins, as well as the key proteins on PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were detected by western blot. The results indicated that CPT could exert antiproliferation effects by arresting cell cycle in G2/M phase and downregulating the expression of cyclin D, cyclin B and cyclin A. Besides, apoptosis induced by CPT was observed. CPT might be a novel GPER binding compounds. Significantly, suppression of PI3K/AKT signal transduction by CPT was further increased by G-1 and decreased by G-15. The study revealed that the effect of antiproliferation and apoptosis treating with CPT on MCF-7 cells might be through the downregulation of PI3K/AKT pathway mediated by activated GPER."
https://openalex.org/W4206154731,"Mass drug administration for schistosomiasis started in 2014 across Taraba State. Surprisingly in 2020, an outbreak of schistosomiasis was reported in Takum local government area. This epidemiological investigation therefore assessed the current status of infection, analyzed associated risk factors and arrested the outbreak through community sensitization activities and mass treatment of 3,580 persons with praziquantel tablets.Epidemiological assessment involving parasitological analysis of stool and urine samples were conducted among 432 consenting participants in five communities. Samples were processed using Kato-Katz and urine filtration techniques. Participants data on demography, water contact behavior and access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities were obtained using standardized questionnaires. Data were analysed using SPSS 20.0 and significance level was set at 95%.An overall prevalence of 34.7% was observed, with 150 participants infected with both species of Schistosoma parasite. By communities, prevalence was higher in Birama (57.7%), Barkin Lissa (50.5%) and Shibong (33.3%). By species', S. haematobium infection was significantly higher than S. mansoni (28.9% vs 9.5%), with higher proportion of younger males infected (p<0.05). The condition of WASH is deplorable. About 87% had no latrines, 67% had no access to improved source of potable water and 23.6% relied on the river as their main source of water. Infections was significantly associated with water contact behaviors like playing in water (OR:1.50, 95% CI: 1.01-2.25) and swimming (OR:1.55, 95% CI: 1.04-2.31).It is important to reclassify the treatment needs of Takum LGA based on the findings of this study. Furthermore, efforts targeted at improving access to WASH, reducing snail population, improving health education and strengthening surveillance systems to identify schistosomiasis hotspots will be a step in the right direction."
https://openalex.org/W4206262943,"To better prevent the potential risks in Internet-based Supply Chain Financing (SCF) products, this paper optimizes and evaluates the Internet-based SCF-oriented Credit Risk Evaluation (CRE) method. Firstly, this paper summarizes 12 risk factors of SCF business, establishes a Risk Assessment Index System (RAIS) with good consistency and stability; then, the principles of Backpropagation (BP) Neural Network (NN) is expounded together with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model. Consequently, a CRE model is implemented by the NN tools in MATLAB based on the collection of multiple groups of SCF-oriented risk assessment samples. Subsequently, the assessment samples are trained and tested. Finally, the SCF-oriented CRE model is proposed and verified. The results show that the BP-GA model has presented high prediction consistency with the actual classification. According to the comparison of classification results of SVM, BP model, and BP-GA model, the classification accuracy of test samples of the proposed Internet-based SCF-oriented CRE system using BP-GA model reaches 97.19%; the Type I and Type II error rate of the CRE system based on BP-GA model is 7.2% and 14.21%, respectively. Therefore, a suitable SCF-oriented CRE method is put forward for China's commercial banks along with scientific and feasible suggestions to manage SCF-oriented credit risks more reasonably and effectively."
https://openalex.org/W4206701918,"Anxiety disorder is one of the emerging public health problems in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Likewise, in Bangladesh, a growing number of adolescents are experiencing such symptoms though we have very limited research evidence available. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and the factors associated with this condition among urban, semi-urban, and rural school adolescents in Bangladesh.This cross-sectional study used a two-stage cluster sampling procedure. A self-administered questionnaire was conveyed to 2355 adolescents from nine secondary schools of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Of the respondents, 2313 completed the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). Besides, sociodemographic information, self-reported body image as well as modification of Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (LTEQ) and WHO Global PA Questionnaire (GPAQ) were used to determine the sociodemographic and lifestyle factors associated with anxiety among adolescents.A total of 20.1% of adolescents were experiencing moderate to severe anxiety; of them, a significantly higher proportion (49.9%) of female adolescents were suffering more than males (40.1%). Furthermore, age, student's grade, father's educational level, number of family members, and residential setting were found to be significantly associated with anxiety among adolescents. In terms of lifestyle factors, irregular physical activity (AOR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.05-1.63), high screen time (AOR: 1.51; 95% CI:1.21-1.88), sleep dissatisfaction (AOR: 3.79; 95% CI: 3.02-4.76), and underweight body image (AOR: 2.37; 95% CI:1.70-3.28) were found to be significantly associated with anxiety among school adolescents of urban, semi-urban, and rural residential settings.Anxiety is prevalent among urban, semi-urban, and rural school adolescents in Dhaka, Bangladesh. To lessen this prevalence of anxiety among Bangladeshi adolescents, evidence-based health programs- healthy school trials-and policies should therefore be taken based on the findings of this study."
https://openalex.org/W4206979545,"Background Identifying low skeletal muscle strength (SMS), skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and skeletal muscle quality (SMQ) is pivotal for diagnosing sarcopenia cases. Age-related declines in SMS, SMM, and SMQ are dissimilar between the upper (UL) and lower limbs (LL). Despite this, both UL and LL measures have been used to assess SMS, SMM and SMQ in older adults. However, it is not clear whether there is agreement between UL and LL measures to identify older adults with low SMS, SMM and SMQ. Objective To investigate the agreement between UL and LL measures to identify older adults with low SMS, SMM and SMQ. Methods Participants (n = 385; 66.1 ± 5.1 years; 75,4% females) performed the handgrip strength test (HGS) and the 30-s chair stand test (CST) to assess UL- and LL-SMS, respectively. The SMM was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The UL-SMQ was determined as: handgrip strength (kgf) ÷ arm SMM (kg). LL-SMQ was determined as: 30-s CST performance (repetitions) ÷ leg SMM (kg). Results below the 25 th percentile stratified by sex and age group (60–69 and 70–80 years) were used to determine low SMS, SMM and SMQ. Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ) was used for the agreement analyses. Results There was a slight and non-significant agreement between UL and LL measures to identify older adults with low SMS (κ = 0.046; 95% CI 0.093–0.185; p = 0.352). There was a moderate agreement to identify low SMM (κ = 0.473; 95% CI 0.371–0.574; p = 0.001) and a fair agreement to identify low SMQ (κ = 0.206; 95% CI 0.082 to 0.330; p = 0.005). Conclusion The agreement between UL and LL measures to identify older adults with low SMS, SMM and SMQ is limited, which might generate different clinical interpretations for diagnosing sarcopenia cases."
https://openalex.org/W4206149513,"Stigma is common among patients with chronic illnesses. It affects the delivery of healthcare for not addressing the psychological components and may interfere with the patient's attendance to necessary health care services. Therefore, a valid and reliable instrument to measure anticipated stigma related to chronic illness is vital to inform possible interventions. This study aimed to translate the Chronic Illness Anticipated Stigma Scale (CIASS) into the Amharic language and evaluate its psychometric properties in Ethiopia.The CIASS was translated into Amharic language using standard procedures. The Amharic version was completed by 173 patients (response rate 96%) with chronic illness from three referral hospitals in the Amhara region. Internal consistency was examined through Cronbach's alpha. Construct validity was evaluated by confirmatory factor analysis and convergent validity by using a Pearson correlation of P-value less than or equal to 0.05.The internal consistency was estimated at Cronbach alpha of 0.92. By using a structural equation model, and modification indices a model fitness testing was run and shows a root mean squared error of approximation 0.049 (90% CI, 0.012-0.075). The structural validity results in 78.8% of confirmatory factor analysis showed from the extraction of the three-dimension (components). Validity tests for convergent by using Pearson correlation positively correlated with common mental distress and negatively correlated with quality of life-BREF, and the construct validity shows a good valid tool to CIASS.The Amharic language version of the chronic illness anticipated stigma scale shows a satisfactory level of reliability and validity on different psychometric measures of assessment. The tool may be useful for future researchers and patients with chronic illness in the Amharic-speaking population. Moreover, it will be used to see the psychological burden related to chronic illness and for comparison among international population groups."
https://openalex.org/W4206444823,"Background Physical activity (PA) is associated with numerous health benefits among children and youth. However, few studies have examined how active transportation (AT) and device-based measures of PA vary within and between countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Purpose This cross-sectional study sought to investigate the prevalence and correlates of AT and device-measured PA among children living in urban, peri-urban and rural areas in three African countries representing Eastern, Western and Southern regions of Africa. Methods 3,205 participants (53.3% girls; 46.7% boys) aged 10–12 years were recruited in Kenya, Nigeria and Mozambique. Data were collected using a child questionnaire, a parent/guardian questionnaire and PiezoRx® pedometers. ANCOVA and binary logistic regression analyses were used to examine the correlates of AT and PA while controlling for gender, age, parent education and vehicle ownership. Results Participants accumulated an average of 45.6±23.5 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and 11,215±4,273 steps/day. Kenyan and Mozambican children were significantly more active than their Nigerian counterparts ( p &lt;0.001). Only 23% met the MVPA guidelines of 60 min/day. 65.1% of participants engaged in AT to school (and 67.8% for the trip back home) with no gender differences. Living in a rural area, lower parent education, lower vehicle ownership and higher motorcycle ownership were associated with higher odds of AT. Other correlates of AT were country-specific. Girls accumulated less daily MVPA than boys in all countries. MVPA was positively associated with living in less urbanized areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. In Kenya, lower parental education and AT were associated with higher MVPA. Nigerian children’s daily MVPA decreased with age and the number of parent-perceived barriers to AT. Conclusions Majority of children engaged in AT, but still failed to meet MVPA recommendations. Most correlates of AT and PA were country-specific, suggesting that strategies to encourage both behaviours should be informed by local evidence."
https://openalex.org/W4206931718,"Asthma and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are chronic diseases known to be associated with metabolic abnormalities. We aimed to clarify the association between NAFLD and asthma incidence in a large population-based cohort.We selected 160,603 individuals without comorbidities from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample cohort between 2009 and 2014. NAFLD was defined using a surrogate marker, fatty liver index (FLI). During a median of 5.08 years' follow-up, 16,377 subjects (10.2%) were newly diagnosed with asthma and categorized into three groups according to FLI. The cumulative incidence of asthma was higher in subjects with higher vs. lower FLIs (FLI < 30, 10.1%; 30 ≤ FLI < 60, 10.8%; FLI ≥ 60, 10.5%). Higher FLI was associated with an increased incidence of asthma (Hazard ratios (HR)highest vs. lowest FLI, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.15-1.36). The results using another definition of NAFLD, as measured by the hepatic steatosis index (HSI), were similar to the primary results. This association was more pronounced in women than in men (HR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13-1.64 vs. HR 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94-1.20).This study demonstrated that NAFLD, as measured by FLI and HSI, may influence the incidence rates of asthma in adults, especially in women."
https://openalex.org/W4225572737,"Changes in motor activity are core symptoms of mood episodes in bipolar disorder. The manic state is characterized by increased variance, augmented complexity and irregular circadian rhythmicity when compared to healthy controls. No previous studies have compared mania to euthymia intra-individually in motor activity. The aim of this study was to characterize differences in motor activity when comparing manic patients to their euthymic selves. Motor activity was collected from 16 bipolar inpatients in mania and remission. 24-h recordings and 2-h time series in the morning and evening were analyzed for mean activity, variability and complexity. Lastly, the recordings were analyzed with the similarity graph algorithm and graph theory concepts such as edges, bridges, connected components and cliques. The similarity graph measures fluctuations in activity reasonably comparable to both variability and complexity measures. However, direct comparisons are difficult as most graph measures reveal variability in constricted time windows. Compared to sample entropy, the similarity graph is less sensitive to outliers. The little-understood estimate Bridges is possibly revealing underlying dynamics in the time series. When compared to euthymia, over the duration of approximately one circadian cycle, the manic state presented reduced variability, displayed by decreased standard deviation (p = 0.013) and augmented complexity shown by increased sample entropy (p = 0.025). During mania there were also fewer edges (p = 0.039) and more bridges (p = 0.026). Similar significant changes in variability and complexity were observed in the 2-h morning and evening sequences, mainly in the estimates of the similarity graph algorithm. Finally, augmented complexity was present in morning samples during mania, displayed by increased sample entropy (p = 0.015). In conclusion, the motor activity of mania is characterized by altered complexity and variability when compared within-subject to euthymia."

Globally, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is reported to be 27%. In Ethiopia, sufficient data is lacking on the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy as well as information on its predisposing factors. The study was required to assess the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and its predisposing factors in diabetic patients attending at a General Hospital in Ethiopia.An institution based cross sectional study was employed on 331 diabetic patients recruited with a systematic random sampling technique. Data were collected through structured questionnaire, tracing patients' medical folder and ocular health examination. Data were analyzed with Statistical Package for Social Science Version 20. Logistic regression methods of analysis were used to figure out predisposing factors of diabetic retinopathy. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to determine the strength of association.A total of 331 diabetic patients completed the study with a response rate of 99.10%. The median duration of diabetes was 5 years. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 34.1% (95%Confidence Interval (CI): 28.7%-39.3%). Low family monthly income (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 7.43, 95% CI: 2.44-22.57), longer duration of diabetes (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.30-1.58), poor glycemic control (AOR = 4.76, 95%CI: 2.26-10.00), and being on insulin treatment alone (AOR = 3.85, 95%CI: 1.16-12.74) were independently associated with diabetic retinopathy.The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 34.1%, higher than national and global figures.

We have developed new nested PCR primers and a protocol with excellent specificity for detecting both of these Borrelia species, both single and double infections, in tissues and organs of various wildlife species. The positive animals were primarily small non-migratory mammals, approximately twice as many were infected with B . burgdorferi than B . miyamotoi and one animal was found infected with both. In addition to established reservoir species, the jumping mouse ( Napaeozapus insignis ) was found frequently infected; this species had the highest infection prevalence for both B . burgdorferi and B . miyamotoi and has not previously been identified as an important carrier for either Borrelia species. Comprehensive testing of tissues found that all instances of B . burgdorferi infection were limited to one tissue within the host, whereas two of the five B . miyamotoi infections were diffuse and found in multiple systems. In the one coinfected specimen, two fetuses were also recovered and found infected with B . miyamotoi . This presumptive transplacental transmission suggests that vertical transmission in mammals is possible. This finding implies that B . miyamotoi could rapidly spread into wildlife populations, as well as having potential human health implications."
https://openalex.org/W4206238140,"Fate of biofilm sloughing was assessed in a laboratory-scale (LS) integrated fixed-film sequencing batch reactor (IF-SBR) treating synthetic wastewater and in a full-scale (FS) integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) system treating municipal wastewater. It was observed that the properties of biofilms and flocs, including sludge volume index (SVI), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), effluent suspended solids (ESS), relative hydrophobicity, and composition of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) were associated with biofilm sloughing and formation of large granular flocs in the LS IF-SBR. In the FS IFAS system, the changes were studied at the molecular level. For example, the extracted EPS content results (the protein to polysaccharide ratio decreased in the flocs and increased in the biofilms, with biofilm sloughing) were complemented with the confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) coupled with molecular specific staining. CLSM analyses revealed that micro-colonies rich in polysaccharides readily sloughed from the carriers. Live-dead staining revealed areas of the biofilm where the viability of biomass was a contributing factor associated with areas of the biofilm susceptible to sloughing. 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Illumina) of FS IFAS samples revealed greater diversity (α-diversity) in biofilms compared to flocs. Biofilm sloughing resulted in a decrease in diversity in biofilms and a corresponding increase in the flocs during sloughing. Microbial population dynamics revealed that bacteria known for denitrification (for example, Comamonadaceae) detached from the biofilms during sloughing, readily associated with the suspended biomass, and were retained in the bioreactors."
https://openalex.org/W4206719692,"A serological COVID-19 Multiplex Assay was developed and validated using serum samples from convalescent patients and those collected prior to the 2020 pandemic. After initial testing of multiple potential antigens, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein were selected for the human COVID-19 Multiplex Assay. A comparison of synthesized and mammalian expressed RBD proteins revealed clear advantages of mammalian expression. Antibodies directed against NP strongly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assay titers (rsp = 0.726), while anti-RBD correlation was moderate (rsp = 0.436). Pan-Ig, IgG, IgA, and IgM against NP and RBD antigens were evaluated on the validation sample sets. Detection of NP and RBD specific IgG and IgA had outstanding performance (AUC > 0.90) for distinguishing patients from controls, but the dynamic range of the IgG assay was substantially greater. The COVID-19 Multiplex Assay was utilized to identify seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 in people living in a low-incidence community in Ithaca, NY. Samples were taken from a cohort of healthy volunteers (n = 332) in early June 2020. Only two volunteers had a positive result on a COVID-19 PCR test performed prior to serum sampling. Serological testing revealed an exposure rate of at least 1.2% (NP) or as high as 5.7% (RBD), higher than the measured incidence rate of 0.16% in the county at that time. This highly sensitive and quantitative assay can be used for monitoring community exposure rates and duration of immune response following both infection and vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4207031925,"Background The Perinatal Bereavement Care Confidence Scale (PBCCS) was designed to evaluate midwives’ and nurses’ confidence and its psychosocial factors to provide bereavement care in Ireland. However, it is unknown whether this scale is valid and reliable for use with midwives and nurses in China. The aim of this study was to translate the English version into Chinese (C-PBCCS) and determine its validity and reliability in a population of Chinese midwives and nurses. Methods In this cross-sectional observational study, after translating the English version of the PBCCS into Chinese and ensuring the linguistic adequacy and clarity of the language, we evaluated the validity and reliability of the C-PBCCS with Chinese midwives and nurses (n = 608). Participants were recruited using convenience sampling from 10 maternity hospitals in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to determine the construct validity (n = 304). Another sample of 304 midwives and nurses was used for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to verify the quality of the factor structures. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and Guttman split-half coefficient were adopted for the evaluation of internal consistency. The STROBE was followed in reporting the results. Results The 43-item PBCCS was reduced to 40 items. Bereavement support knowledge (13 items, three factors), Bereavement support skills (eight items, two factors), Self-awareness (eight items, two factors), and Organizational support (11 items, two factors). The CFA suggested that the four scales in the C-PBCCS had acceptable fit indices. The Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.835–0.901. The Guttman split-half coefficient was between 0.868–0.933. Conclusion The C-PBCCS was found to be a psychometrically sound measurement tool to evaluate Chinese-speaking midwives’ and nurses’ confidence and the psychosocial factors that affect their confidence in providing perinatal bereavement care."
https://openalex.org/W4205374254,"One important metric of a radiologist’s visibility and influence is their ability to participate in discussion within their community. The goal of our study was to compare the participation level of men and women in scientific discussions at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). Eleven volunteers collected participation data by gender in 59 sessions (286 presentations) at the 2018 RSNA meeting. Data was analyzed using a combination of Chi-squared, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank and T-test. Of all RSNA professional attendees at the RSNA, 68% were men and 32% were women. Of the 2869 presentations listed in the program, 65% were presented by men and 35% were presented by women. Of the 286 presentations in our sample, 177 (61.8%) were presented by men and 109 (38.1%) were presented by women. Of these 286 presentations, 81 (63%) were moderated by men and 47 (37%) were moderated by women. From the audience, 190 male attendees participated in 134 question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) sessions following presentations and 58 female attendees participated in 52 Q&amp;A sessions (P&lt;0.001). Female attendees who did participate in Q&amp;A sessions talked for a significantly shorter period of time (mean 7.14 ± 17.7 seconds, median 0) compared to male attendees (28.7 ± 29.6 seconds, median 16; P&lt;0.001). Overall, our findings demonstrate that women participated less than men in the Q&amp;A sessions at RSNA 2018, and talked for a shorter period of time. The fact that women were outnumbered among their male peers may explain the difference in behavior by gender."
https://openalex.org/W4206002463,"Cognitive psychology has a long history of using physiological measures, such as pupillometry. However, their susceptibility to confounds introduced by stimulus properties, such as color and luminance, has limited their application. Pupil size measurements, in particular, require sophisticated experimental designs to dissociate relatively small changes in pupil diameter due to cognitive responses from larger ones elicited by changes in stimulus properties or the experimental environment. Here, building on previous research, we present a pupillometry paradigm that adapts the pupil to stimulus properties during the baseline period without revealing stimulus meaning or context by using a pixel-scrambled image mask around an intact image. We demonstrate its robustness in the context of pupillary responses to branded product familiarity. Results show larger average and peak pupil dilation for passively viewed familiar product images and an extended later temporal component representing differences in familiarity across participants (starting around 1400 ms post-stimulus onset). These amplitude differences are present for almost all participants at the single-participant level, and vary somewhat by product category. However, amplitude differences were absent during the baseline period. These findings demonstrate that involuntary pupil size measurements combined with the presented paradigm are successful in dissociating cognitive effects of familiarity from physical stimulus confounds."
https://openalex.org/W4206170857,"Peperomia pellucida L. Kunth is a herb well-known for its secondary metabolites (SM) with biological potential. In this study, the variations in the SM of P. pellucida during association with rhizobacteria were evaluated. Plants were inoculated with Enterobacter asburiae and Klebsiella variicola, which were identified by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The data were evaluated at 7, 21, and 30-day post inoculation (dpi). Plant-bacteria symbiosis improved plant growth and weight. Total phenolic content and phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme activity had a significant increase mainly at 30 dpi. P. pellucida was mainly composed of phenylpropanoids (37.30-52.28%) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (39.28-49.42%). The phenylpropanoid derivative 2,4,5-trimethoxy-styrene (ArC2), the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon ishwarane, and the phenylpropanoid dillapiole were the major compounds. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the classes and compounds ≥ 2.0% indicated that plants colonized by E. asburiae had a reduction in the content of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and an increase in phenylpropanoids and derivatives. Plants treated with this bacterium also had an increase in the content of 2,4,5-trimethoxystyrene at 30 dpi. Plants inoculated with K. variicola had significant increases only in the content of the classes monoterpene hydrocarbons and 'other compounds' (hydrocarbons, esters, ketones, etc.). These data suggest that the production of plant secondary metabolites can be modified depending on the type of rhizobacteria inoculated."
https://openalex.org/W4206722935,"High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) therapy offers a proven means of delivering respiratory support to critically ill patients suffering from viral illness such as COVID-19. However, the therapy has the potential to modify aerosol generation and dispersion patterns during exhalation and thereby put healthcare workers at increased risk of disease transmission. Fundamentally, a gap exists in the literature with regards to the effect of the therapy on the fluid dynamics of the exhalation jet which is essential in understanding the dispersion of aerosols and hence quantifying the disease transmission risk posed by the therapy. In this paper, a multi-faceted approach was taken to studying the aerosol-laden exhalation jet. Schlieren imaging was used to visualise the flow field for a range of expiratory activities for three healthy human volunteers receiving HFNO therapy at flow rates of 0-60 L/min. A RANS turbulence model was implemented using the CFD software OpenFOAM and used to perform a parametric study on the influence of exhalation velocity and duration on the dispersion patterns of non-evaporating droplets in a room environment. A dramatic increase in the turbulence of the exhalation jet was observed when HFNO was applied. Quantitative analysis indicated that the mean exhalation velocity was increased by 2.2-3.9 and 2.3-3 times that for unassisted breathing and coughing, respectively. A 1-2 second increase was found in the exhalation duration. The CFD model showed that small droplets (10-40 μm) were most greatly affected, where a 1 m/s increase in velocity and 1 s increase in duration caused an 80% increase in axial travel distance."
https://openalex.org/W4205444263,"Humans can learn simple new tasks very quickly. This ability suggests that people can reuse previously learned procedural knowledge when it applies to a new context. We have proposed a modeling approach based on this idea and used it to create a model of the attentional blink (AB). The main idea of the skill-based approach is that models are not created from scratch but, instead, built up from reusable pieces of procedural knowledge (skills). This approach not only provides an explanation for the fast learning of simple tasks but also shows much promise to improve certain aspects of cognitive modeling (e.g., robustness and generalizability). We performed two experiments, in order to collect empirical support for the model's prediction that the AB will disappear when the two targets are consolidated as a single chunk. Firstly, we performed an unsuccessful replication of a study reporting that the AB disappears when participants are instructed to remember the targets as a syllable. However, a subsequent experiment using easily combinable stimuli supported the model's prediction and showed a strongly reduced AB in a large group of participants. This result suggests that it is possible to avoid the AB with the right consolidation strategy. The skill-based approach allowed relating this finding to a general cognitive process, thereby demonstrating that incorporating this approach can be very helpful to generalize the findings of cognitive models, which otherwise tends to be rather difficult."
https://openalex.org/W4206242493,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients often experience disease flare-ups during international air travel. We aimed to identify risk factors associated with IBD flare-up during international air travel.Patients with scheduled international air travel were enrolled in the study from the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital IBD clinic. Flight information and clinical data were collected via questionnaires and personal interviews, and risk factors associated with IBD flares were determined.Between May 2018 and February 2020, 94 patients were prospectively enrolled in the study (mean age, 33.0 years; males, 53.2%; mean disease duration, 56.7 months), including 56 (59.6%) with ulcerative colitis and 38 (40.4%) with Crohn's disease. Of the 94 patients enrolled, 15 (16.0%) experienced an IBD flare-up and 79 (84.0%) remained in remission throughout travel. Logistic regression analysis revealed that high fecal calprotectin levels before travel (odds ratio [OR]: 1.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.000-1.001, p = 0.016), the presence of a comorbidity (OR: 6.334, 95% CI: 1.129-35.526, p = 0.036), and history of emergency room visit (OR: 5.283, 95% CI: 1.085-25.724, p = 0.039) were positively associated with disease flare-up. The previous and current use of immunomodulators and biologics, time of flight, altitude, number countries visited, travel duration, objective of visit, and previous medical consultations were not associated with disease flare-up.Elevated fecal calprotectin levels, history of emergency room visits, and the presence of a comorbidity predicted IBD flare-up during international air travel."
https://openalex.org/W4206303168,"Social relationships play a key role in both substance use and homelessness. Transitioning out of homelessness often requires reduction in substance use as well as changes in social networks. A social network-based behavior change intervention that targets changes personal social networks may assist the transition out of homelessness. Most behavior change interventions that incorporate social networks assume a static network. However, people experiencing homelessness who transition into housing programs that use a harm reduction approach experience many changes in their social networks during this transition. Changes may include disconnecting from street-based network contacts, re-connecting with former network contacts, and exposure to new network members who actively engage in substance use. An intervention that helps people transitioning out of homelessness make positive alterations to their social networks may compliment traditional harm reduction housing program services.We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an innovative Social Network Intervention (MI-SNI), which combines network visualization and Motivational Interviewing to assist adults transitioning out of homelessness. The MI-SNI provides feedback to new residents about their social environments and is designed to motivate residents to make positive changes in both their individual behavior and their personal network. In a sample of 41 adult housing program residents with past year risky substance use, we examined whether participants randomized to receive a MI-SNI showed greater changes in their personal networks over 3 months compared to those receiving usual care.There were significant differences in the networks of the MI-SNI group compared to the group receiving usual care at follow-up, controlling for baseline network characteristics. The MI-SNI group had greater reductions in the proportion of their network members who influenced alcohol or other drug use (AOD) use, such as drinking partners, and more frequently changed their relationships in the direction of lower AOD risk with network members who were retained in their networks across waves.This study is the first pilot test of a MI-SNI customized for assisting the transition out of homelessness to test for personal network changes. Results indicate that MI-SNIs can have a positive impact on short-term network changes and thus may serve as a useful adjunct to behavioral change interventions. These findings suggest that a MI-SNI approach may help individuals experiencing homelessness and risky AOD use positively restructure their social networks while transitioning into supportive housing. These promising results suggest the need for a larger RCT test of this innovative intervention approach.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02140359."

Therefore, we would like to combine the advantages of the demyelination model with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to provide a local autoimmune encephalomyelitis (LAE) inside rat brain. We induced a demyelinating lesion by immunizing male Wistar rats, followed by blood-brain barrier opening protein (vascular endothelial growth factor) by stereotactic injection. We confirmed the immunization against myelin epitopes and minor neurological impairment. Histological assessment confirmed the lesion development after both 3- and 7 days post-injection. Our approach was sufficient to develop a demyelinating lesion with high reproducibility and low morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W4206721604,"Fetal growth restriction is a major complication of pregnancy and is associated with stillbirth, infant death and child morbidity. Ultrasound monitoring of pregnancy is becoming more common in Africa for fetal growth monitoring in clinical care and research, but many countries have no national growth charts. We evaluated the new international fetal growth standards from INTERGROWTH-21st and WHO in a cohort from southern Benin.Repeated ultrasound and clinical data were collected in women from the preconceptional RECIPAL cohort (241 women with singleton pregnancies, 964 ultrasounds). We modelled fetal biometric parameters including abdominal circumference (AC) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) and compared centiles to INTERGROWTH-21st and WHO standards, using the Bland and Altman method to assess agreement. For EFW, we used INTERGROWTH-21st standards based on their EFW formula (IG21st) as well as a recent update using Hadlock's EFW formula (IG21hl). Proportions of fetuses with measurements under the 10th percentile were compared.Maternal malaria and anaemia prevalence was 43% and 69% respectively and 11% of women were primigravid. Overall, the centiles in the RECIPAL cohort were higher than that of INTERGROWTH-21st and closer to that of WHO. Consequently, the proportion of fetuses under 10th percentile thresholds was systematically lower when applying IG21st compared to WHO standards. At 27-31 weeks and 33-38 weeks, respectively, 7.4% and 5.6% of fetuses had EFW <10th percentile using IG21hl standards versus 10.7% and 11.6% using WHO standards.Despite high anemia and malaria prevalence in the cohort, IG21st and WHO standards did not identify higher than expected proportions of fetuses under the 10th percentiles of ultrasound parameters or EFW. The proportions of fetuses under the 10th percentile threshold for IG21st charts were particularly low, raising questions about its use to identify growth-restricted fetuses in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4226126675,"Medical billing errors and fraud have been described as one of the last ""great unreduced healthcare costs,"" with some commentators suggesting measurable average losses from this phenomenon are 7% of total health expenditure. In Australia, it has been estimated that leakage from Medicare caused by non-compliant medical billing may be 10-15% of the scheme's total cost. Despite a growing body of international research, mostly from the U.S, suggesting that rather than deliberately abusing the health financing systems they operate within, medical practitioners may be struggling to understand complex and highly interpretive medical billing rules, there is a lack of research in this area in Australia. The aim of this study was to address this research gap by examining the experiences of medical practitioners through the first qualitative study undertaken in Australia, which may have relevance in multiple jurisdictions.This study interviewed 27 specialist and general medical practitioners who claim Medicare reimbursements in their daily practice. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis.The qualitative data revealed five themes including inadequate induction, poor legal literacy, absence of reliable advice and support, fear and deference, and unmet opportunities for improvement.The qualitative data presented in this study suggest Australian medical practitioners are ill-equipped to manage their Medicare compliance obligations, have low levels of legal literacy and desire education, clarity and certainty around complex billing standards and rules. Non-compliant medical billing under Australia's Medicare scheme is a nuanced phenomenon that may be far more complex than previously thought and learnings from this study may offer important insights for other countries seeking solutions to the phenomenon of health system leakage. Strategies to address the barriers and deficiencies identified by participants in this study will require a multi-pronged approach. The data suggest that the current punitive system of ensuring compliance by Australian medical practitioners is not fit for purpose."
https://openalex.org/W4205266908,"Background The uptake of Self-Management Support (SMS) among clinicians is suboptimal. To date, few studies have tested knowledge translation (KT) interventions to increase the application of SMS in chiropractic teaching clinics. Study objective Evaluate the feasibility of implementing a KT intervention to promote the use of a SMS strategy among chiropractic interns, their supervisors, and individuals with spine pain compared to controls. Methods Mixed methods pilot clustered-clinical trial. Clusters of 16 Patient Management Teams were allocated to a complex KT intervention (online and workshop training). Primary feasibility outcomes for clinicians, interns and patients were rates of recruitment, retention, and adherence to protocol. A nominal group technique and interviews were used to seek end-users’ views on the implementation process, and generate possible solutions. Results In total, 16 (84%) clinicians, 65 (26%) interns and 42 patients agreed to participate. All clinicians in the intervention group completed all KT intervention components, 23 interns (85%) completed the online training and 14 interns (51.8%) attended the workshop training. All clinicians in the intervention and seven (78%) in the control group completed all outcome measures at baseline and 6-month follow-up, while 15 (55.6%) and 23 (60.5%) interns in the intervention and control groups completed the questionnaires at baseline and 6-month follow-up, respectively. Among patients, 10 (52.6%) and 12 (52.2%) in the intervention and control groups respectively completed the questionnaires at the end of the study. Based on interview findings, solutions to improve the feasibility of conducting a full trial include: making SMS a part of the internship, changing the time of introducing the study to the interns, and having more training on SMS. Conclusion Recruitment and retention of chiropractic interns and patients for a larger implementation trial in a single outpatient teaching clinic may be challenging."
https://openalex.org/W4205303139,"With the renewed interest in low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) in the sports field, a few animal studies have investigated their potential. However, most rodent studies have used an LCD containing low protein, which does not recapitulate a human LCD, and the muscle-specific adaptation in response to an LCD remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of two types of LCDs, both containing the same proportion of protein as a regular diet (isonitrogenous LCD; INLCD), on body composition, exercise performance, and metabolic fuel selection at the genetic level in the skeletal muscles of exercise-trained mice. Three groups of mice (n = 8 in each group), one fed a regular AIN-93G diet served as the control, and the others fed either of the two INLCDs containing 20% protein and 10% carbohydrate (INLCD-10%) or 20% protein and 1% carbohydrate (INLCD-1%) had a regular exercise load (5 times/week) for 12 weeks. Body weight and muscle mass did not decrease in either of the INLCD-fed groups, and the muscle glycogen levels and endurance capacity did not differ among the three groups. Only in the mice fed INLCD-1% did the plasma ketone concentration significantly increase, and gene expression related to glucose utilization significantly declined in the muscles. Both INLCD-1% and INLCD-10% consumption increased gene expression related to lipid utilization. These results suggest that, although INLCD treatment did not affect endurance capacity, it helped maintain muscle mass and glycogen content regardless of the glucose intake restrictions in trained mice. Moreover, an INLCD containing a low carbohydrate content might present an advantage by increasing lipid oxidation without ketosis and suppressing muscle glucose utilization."
https://openalex.org/W4205414748,"An understanding of cassava starch paste properties (CSPP) can contribute to the selection of clones with differentiated starches. This study aimed to identify genomic regions associated with CSPP using different genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods (MLM, MLMM, and Farm-CPU). The GWAS was performed using 23,078 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The rapid viscoanalyzer (RVA) parameters were pasting temperature (PastTemp), peak viscosity (PeakVisc), hot-paste viscosity (Hot-PVisc), cool-paste viscosity (Cold-PVisc), final viscosity (FinalVis), breakdown (BreDow), and setback (Setback). Broad phenotypic and molecular diversity was identified based on the genomic kinship matrix. The broad-sense heritability estimates (h2) ranged from moderate to high magnitudes (0.66 to 0.76). The linkage disequilibrium (LD) declined to between 0.3 and 2.0 Mb (r2 <0.1) for most chromosomes, except chromosome 17, which exhibited an extensive LD. Thirteen SNPs were found to be significantly associated with CSPP, on chromosomes 3, 8, 17, and 18. Only the BreDow trait had no associated SNPs. The regional marker-trait associations on chromosome 18 indicate a LD block between 2907312 and 3567816 bp and that SNP S18_3081635 was associated with SetBack, FinalVis, and Cold-PVisc (all three GWAS methods) and with Hot-PVisc (MLM), indicating that this SNP can track these four traits simultaneously. The variance explained by the SNPs ranged from 0.13 to 0.18 for SetBack, FinalVis, and Cold-PVisc and from 0.06 to 0.09 for PeakVisc and Hot-PVisc. The results indicated additive effects of the genetic control of Cold-PVisc, FinalVis, Hot-PVisc, and SetBack, especially on the large LD block on chromosome 18. One transcript encoding the glycosyl hydrolase family 35 enzymes on chromosome 17 and one encoding the mannose-p-dolichol utilization defect 1 protein on chromosome 18 were the most likely candidate genes for the regulation of CSPP. These results underline the potential for the assisted selection of high-value starches to improve cassava root quality through breeding programs."

This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020 on all hospital staff using a three-part questionnaire comprised of personal and work-situational factors, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Psychological Empowerment Scale (PES). The partial least squares (PLS) path modelling and the neural network (NN) model were used to identify the significant variables within the BO dimensions. A total of 358 staff completed the questionnaire and were recruited for the study. Emotional exhaustion (EE) was seen in 137 medical staff (38.3%) and depersonalization (DP) was observed in 75 individuals (20.1%). Thinking about job change was the most important factor positively correlated with EE. Positive stress and work experience were among the most significant factors negatively associated with PA and DP, respectively. The hospital staff experienced BO in a way comparable to the national results. Work-situational and personal variables interacted with the three dimensions of BO in the hospital staff. More experienced staff also felt more accomplished and successful, resulting in the identification of a decreased level of DP and elevated PA."
https://openalex.org/W4205980168,"Occupation is a poorly characterised risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) with females and indigenous populations under-represented in most research. This study assessed associations between occupation and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in males and females of the general and Māori (indigenous people of NZ) populations of New Zealand (NZ).Two surveys of the NZ adult population (NZ Workforce Survey (NZWS); 2004-2006; n = 3003) and of the Māori population (NZWS Māori; 2009-2010; n = 2107) with detailed occupational histories were linked with routinely collected health data and followed-up until December 2018. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for IHD and ""ever-worked"" in any of the nine major occupational groups or 17 industries. Analyses were controlled for age, deprivation and smoking, and stratified by sex and survey.'Plant/machine operators and assemblers' and 'elementary occupations' were positively associated with IHD in female Māori (HR 2.2, 95%CI 1.2-4.1 and HR 2.0, 1.1-3.8, respectively) and among NZWS males who had been employed as 'plant/machine operators and assemblers' for 10+ years (HR 1.7, 1.2-2.8). Working in the 'manufacturing' industry was also associated with IHD in NZWS females (HR 1.9, 1.1-3.7), whilst inverse associations were observed for 'technicians and associate professionals' (HR 0.5, 0.3-0.8) in NZWS males. For 'clerks', a positive association was found for NZWS males (HR 1.8, 1.2-2.7), whilst an inverse association was observed for Māori females (HR 0.4, 0.2-0.8).Associations with IHD differed significantly across occupational groups and were not consistent across males and females or for Māori and the general population, even within the same occupational groups, suggesting that current knowledge regarding the association between occupation and IHD may not be generalisable across different population groups."
https://openalex.org/W4205993318,"Background Data on outcomes of children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) following treatment are scarce with none described from any upper-middle-income country. This study established mortality, clinical outcomes and anthropometric recovery of children with SAM six months following hospital discharge. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in children aged 3–59 months enrolled on discharge from two hospitals in the Tshwane district of South Africa between April 2019 and January 2020. The primary outcome was mortality at six months. Secondary outcomes included relapse rates, type(s) and frequency of morbidities experienced and the anthropometric changes in children with SAM following hospital discharge. Standard programmatic support included nutritional supplements. Results Forty-three children were enrolled with 86% of participants followed up to six months. Only a third of the participants had normal anthropometry at hospital discharge–a quarter still had ongoing SAM. There were no deaths, although four children (9%) were re-hospitalised including two for complicated SAM. Mean weight-for-length z-scores (WLZ) and wasting rates improved at one month but deteriorated by three months. At three months, six children (14%) either had ongoing or relapsed SAM–a SAM incidence rate of 20 per 1000 person-months despite more than half of the participants still receiving nutritional supplements at the time. Risk factors associated with persistent malnutrition at three months included a low WLZ on admission (relative risk [RR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.2–9.2), being discharged from hospital before meeting WHO SAM treatment discharge criteria (RR 5.3, 95%CI 1.3–14.8) or having any illness by three months (RR 8.6, 95%CI 1.3–55.7). Conclusion Post-discharge mortality and morbidity was lower than in other less resourced settings. However, anthropometric recovery was poorer than expected. Modifying discharge criteria, optimising the use of available nutritional supplements and better integration with community-based health and social services may improve outcomes for children with SAM post-hospitalisation."
https://openalex.org/W4206293108,"To reach its goal of ending AIDS by 2030, Thailand has adopted antiretroviral treatment as prevention and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) as its core HIV control strategy. However, in the absence of reliable epidemiologic indicators, the impact of these policies on the course of the HIV epidemic in these groups remains unknown. To help answer this question, we formulated an HIV epidemic consensus initiative for Bangkok, Thailand, to analyze epidemiologic and program data and reach agreement between experts and stakeholders on the evolving state of the HIV epidemic among MSM and TGW. A customized Delphi process was used to consult and consolidate viewpoints of experts and stakeholders. Experts presented and discussed HIV prevalence and incidence data from recent and ongoing studies among MSM and TGW in Bangkok (2014 to 2018) during a meeting with stakeholders representing government, donors, and civil society. Agreement about the course of the HIV epidemic among MSM and TGW was attained by voting consensus. Based on presented data, meeting participants agreed that HIV prevalence and incidence had decreased among Bangkok MSM from 2014 to 2018. Despite these declines, HIV prevalence and incidence were found to remain high. This was particularly the case among younger MSM. Participants agreed that there was no evidence for a decrease in HIV prevalence and incidence among Bangkok TGW. Introduction of antiretroviral treatment as prevention and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis may have contributed to these declines. However, HIV prevalence and incidence remained high, and no signs of a decrease were reported among Bangkok TGW. At the current rate of new HIV infections in MSM and TGW, Thailand will not reach its goal of ending AIDS by 2030. This HIV consensus initiative may serve as a model for building agreement and advocacy on epidemiologic and program data and their implications for a large metropolitan city."
https://openalex.org/W4206293250,"Somatic tissue oxygen saturation (SstO2) is associated with systemic hypoperfusion. Kidney dysfunction may lead to increased mortality and morbidity in patients who undergo living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). We investigated the clinical utility of SstO2 during LDLT for identifying postoperative kidney dysfunction.Data from 304 adults undergoing elective LDLT between January 2015 and February 2020 at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital were retrospectively collected. Thirty-six patients were excluded based on the exclusion criteria. In total, 268 adults were analyzed, and 200 patients were 1:1 propensity score (PS)-matched.Patients with early kidney dysfunction had significantly lower intraoperative SstO2 values than those with normal kidney function. Low SstO2 (< 66%) 1 h after graft reperfusion was more highly predictive of early kidney dysfunction than the values measured in other intraoperative phases. A decline in the SstO2 was also related to kidney dysfunction.Kidney dysfunction after LDLT is associated with patient morbidity and mortality. Our results may assist in the detection of early kidney dysfunction by providing a basis for analyzing SstO2 in patients undergoing LDLT. A low SstO2 (< 66%), particularly 1 h after graft reperfusion, was significantly associated with early kidney dysfunction after surgery. SstO2 monitoring may facilitate the identification of early kidney dysfunction and enable early management of patients."
https://openalex.org/W4206679993,"Globally, breastfeeding duration is below the recommended level. In Ethiopia, more than 24% of mothers ceased breastfeeding before 24 months of age of a child which caused 14,000 preventable childhood deaths annually. To tackle this problem, current and up-to-date information regarding the time to breastfeeding cessation and its predictors is essential. Therefore, this study aims to determine the time to breastfeeding cessation and its predictors among mothers who have children aged two to three years in Gozamin district, Northwest Ethiopia.A community-based retrospective follow-up study was used among 502 mothers who have children aged two to three years in the Gozamin district from October 1, 2017, up to September 30, 2020. Interviewer-administered structured questionnaires were used. Cox proportional hazard model was applied after its assumptions and model fitness were checked, to identify predictors for time to breastfeeding cessation.The overall mean time to breastfeeding cessation was 22.56 (95%CI: 22.21, 22.91) months, and the cumulative survival probability on breastfeeding up to 24 months was 82.5% (95%CI:78.85, 85.53). The overall incidence of early breastfeeding cessation was 7.77 (95%CI:6.31, 9.58) per 1000 person-month observations. Having no antenatal care follow up (AHR:2.15, 95%CI:1.19, 3.89), having ≥4 number of children (AHR:1.76, 95%CI:1.10, 2.80), < 24 months breastfeeding experience (AHR:1.77, 95%CI:1.14, 2.75), and presence of cow milk in the household (AHR:3.01, 95%CI:1.89, 4.78) were significant predictors for time to breastfeeding cessation.The time to breastfeeding cessation is below the recommendation and therefore, strengthening breastfeeding education and related counseling at the community level is better."
https://openalex.org/W4206713274,"Background The use of linked healthcare data in research has the potential to make major contributions to knowledge generation and service improvement. However, using healthcare data for secondary purposes raises legal and ethical concerns relating to confidentiality, privacy and data protection rights. Using a linkage and anonymisation approach that processes data lawfully and in line with ethical best practice to create an anonymous (non-personal) dataset can address these concerns, yet there is no set approach for defining all of the steps involved in such data flow end-to-end. We aimed to define such an approach with clear steps for dataset creation, and to describe its utilisation in a case study linking healthcare data. Methods We developed a data flow protocol that generates pseudonymous datasets that can be reversibly linked, or irreversibly linked to form an anonymous research dataset. It was designed and implemented by the Comprehensive Patient Records (CPR) study in Leeds, UK. Results We defined a clear approach that received ethico-legal approval for use in creating an anonymous research dataset. Our approach used individual-level linkage through a mechanism that is not computer-intensive and was rendered irreversible to both data providers and processors. We successfully applied it in the CPR study to hospital and general practice and community electronic health record data from two providers, along with patient reported outcomes, for 365,193 patients. The resultant anonymous research dataset is available via DATA-CAN, the Health Data Research Hub for Cancer in the UK. Conclusions Through ethical, legal and academic review, we believe that we contribute a defined approach that represents a framework that exceeds current minimum standards for effective pseudonymisation and anonymisation. This paper describes our methods and provides supporting information to facilitate the use of this approach in research."
https://openalex.org/W4207005018,"To understand the ways in which past stone knappers controlled the morphology of the flakes they produced, archaeologists have focused on examining the effects of striking platform attributes on flake size and shape. Among the variables commonly considered, platform width has routinely been noted to correlate with flake size and hence used to explain past knapping behaviors. Yet, the influence of platform width on flake variation remains equivocal due to the fact that the attribute is not under the direct control of the knapper. Instead, platform width tends to be treated as a by-product of other independent knapping parameters, such as platform depth. In this study, we hypothesize that platform width acts as an intermediary that intervenes the effect of other independent variables on flake attributes. By analyzing experimental flakes produced under both controlled and replicative settings, the results support the hypothesis that platform width mediates the effect of platform depth on flake width, such that flakes with relatively larger platform widths are generally wider but no longer. This finding provides a way to incorporate platform width into discussions of the interrelationships among knapping variables, and highlights the importance of platform width for investigating how past knappers controlled flake production through platform manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W4207009739,"In preparation for the National Hepatitis C Elimination Program in the country of Georgia, a nationwide household-based hepatitis C virus (HCV) seroprevalence survey was conducted in 2015. Data were used to estimate HCV genotype distribution and better understand potential sex-specific risk factors that contribute to HCV transmission. HCV genotype distribution by sex and reported risk factors were calculated. We used explanatory logistic regression models stratified by sex to identify behavioral and healthcare-related risk factors for HCV seropositivity, and predictive logistic regression models to identify additional variables that could help predict the presence of infection. Factors associated with HCV seropositivity in explanatory models included, among males, history of injection drug use (IDU) (aOR = 22.4, 95% CI = 12.7, 39.8) and receiving a blood transfusion (aOR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.4, 8.8), and among females, history of receiving a blood transfusion (aOR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.1, 7.7), kidney dialysis (aOR = 7.3 95% CI 1.5, 35.3) and surgery (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1, 3.2). The male-specific predictive model additionally identified age, urban residence, and history of incarceration as factors predictive of seropositivity and were used to create a male-specific exposure index (Area under the curve [AUC] = 0.84). The female-specific predictive model had insufficient discriminatory performance to support creating an exposure index (AUC = 0.61). The most prevalent HCV genotype (GT) nationally was GT1b (40.5%), followed by GT3 (34.7%) and GT2 (23.6%). Risk factors for HCV seropositivity and distribution of HCV genotypes in Georgia vary substantially by sex. The HCV exposure index developed for males could be used to inform targeted testing programs."
https://openalex.org/W4207028937,"Background Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cancer type in China. Targeted therapies have been used to treat NSCLC for two decades, which is only suitable for a subgroup of patients with specific genetic variations. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of genetic variations leading to sensitivity or resistance to targeted therapies in NSCLC, and their relationship with clinicopathological characteristics of the patients. Methods Tumor samples were collected from 404 patients who were diagnosed to have NSCLC and underwent surgery, transthoracic biopsy, bronchoscopy biopsy, or pleural aspiration in Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital from January 2019 to March 2020. Commercial amplification-refractory mutation system kits were used to detect targeted therapy-related genetic variations in those tumor samples. The prevalence of genetic variations and their relationship with patient clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed using statistical software, followed by subgroup analysis. Results In all, 50.7% of the NSCLC patients had sensitive genetic variations to anti-EGFR therapies, and 4.9% of those patients had co-existing resistant genetic variations. Fusions in ALK , ROS1 , or RET were found in 7.7% of the patients, including 2 patients with co-existing EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R. EGFR exon 19 deletion and L858R were more common in female patients and adenocarcinoma. Further subgroup analysis confirmed the observation in female patients in adenocarcinoma subgroup, and in adenocarcinoma in male patients. In addition, smokers were more likely to have squamous cell carcinoma and KRAS mutation and less likely to have EGFR L858R, which were also confirmed after standardization of gender except KRAS mutations. Conclusion Nearly half of the NSCLC patients were eligible for anti-EGFR treatments. In NSCLC, female gender and adenocarcinoma may indicate higher chance of EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R, and smoking history may indicate squamous cell carcinoma and EGFR L858R."
https://openalex.org/W4207038028,"Native forests on tropical islands have been displaced by non-native species, leading to calls for their transformation. Simultaneously, there is increasing recognition that tropical forests can help sequester carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. However, it is unclear if native forests sequester more or less carbon than human-altered landscapes. At Palmyra Atoll, efforts are underway to transform the rainforest composition from coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) dominated to native mixed-species. To better understand how this landscape-level change will alter the atoll's carbon dynamics, we used field sampling, remote sensing, and parameter estimates from the literature to model the total carbon accumulation potential of Palmyra's forest before and after transformation. The model predicted that replacing the C. nucifera plantation with native species would reduce aboveground biomass from 692.6 to 433.3 Mg C. However, expansion of the native Pisonia grandis and Heliotropium foertherianum forest community projected an increase in soil carbon to at least 13,590.8 Mg C, thereby increasing the atoll's overall terrestrial carbon storage potential by 11.6%. Nearshore sites adjacent to C. nucifera canopy had a higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (110.0 μMC) than sites adjacent to native forest (81.5 μMC), suggesting that, in conjunction with an increase in terrestrial carbon storage, replacing C. nucifera with native forest will reduce the DOC exported from the forest into in nearshore marine habitats. Lower DOC levels have potential benefits for corals and coral dependent communities. For tropical islands like Palmyra, reverting from C. nucifera dominance to native tree dominance could buffer projected climate change impacts by increasing carbon storage and reducing coral disease."
https://openalex.org/W4206079704,"A wealth of research suggests that sexual minority individuals experience stigma and lack of sexual minority specific competencies in mental health care, which could lead to less optimal treatment outcome. However, most related research suffers from methodological limitations, such as selected samples, retrospective design, or not assessing treatment outcome. To overcome some of these limitations, we explored if sexual minority patients have poorer treatment outcome and are less satisfied with treatment in a mental health care setting not specialized in sexual minority issues. The analytical sample comprised 5609 inpatients, including 11% sexual minority patients, from a German psychiatric clinic. Outcomes were improvement in well-being and depression from admission to discharge, and satisfaction with treatment judged at discharge. Nearly all sexual orientation differences were in a direction hinting at less improvement of depression and well-being and less satisfaction among sexual minority compared to heterosexual patients. However, the differences were generally small and not statistically significant. Stigma and lacking sexual orientation specific competency in healthcare may not be universally present or not as severe as studies with other research designs suggested. However, this needs to be investigated in more clinical settings by including sexual orientation as part of the routine assessment. Moreover, adequate sexual-minority specific competencies are important in any case, not just to prevent that sexual minority patients benefit less from treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4206146950,"Whether sociocultural perceptions of charcoal-burning suicide have influenced its rapid increase in prevalence is unclear. We aimed to explore perceptions of Taiwan's general population regarding charcoal-burning suicide, their personal belief in life after death, and related feelings of thoughts associated with those who attempt charcoal-burning suicide.An online web-based survey, focussing on sociocultural attitudes towards death, as well as perceptions towards charcoal-burning suicide, and those who attempt charcoal-burning suicide, was conducted from 14 January to 14 June 2016.In total, 1343 adults completed the online survey (mean age of 33.46; 66.6% women). Notably, 90.3% of participants considered charcoal burning to be an easily accessible suicide method. Multivariable analyses revealed that among the examined factors, the perceived 'painlessness' of charcoal-burning suicide was associated with an over seven-fold increased risk of choosing charcoal-burning suicide (OR = 7.394; p < 0.001; 95% CI: 2.614-20.912).As reflected in this study, charcoal-burning suicide is perceived as easily accessible and painless. The perceived 'painlessness' may be the factor that distinguishes the choice of charcoal-burning suicide from that of other suicide methods. Future efforts to target these perceptions regarding charcoal-burning suicide may be warranted in both media reporting and suicide prevention programmes."
https://openalex.org/W4206349198,"Background Heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently coexist, and the combination is linked to poor outcomes, but limited data exist to guide optimal management. We evaluated the outcome of dialysis therapy in older patients with HF and advanced CKD. Methods We examined adults aged ≥70 years with HF and eGFR ≤20 ml/min/1.73 m 2 between 2008–2012 and no prior renal replacement therapy, cancer, cirrhosis or organ transplant. We identified patients who initiated chronic dialysis through 2013 and matched patients who did not initiate dialysis on age, gender, diabetes status, being alive on dialysis initiation date, and a high-dimensional propensity score for starting dialysis. Deaths were identified through 2013. We used Cox regression to evaluate the association of chronic dialysis and all-cause death. Results Among 348 adults with HF and advanced CKD who initiated dialysis and 947 matched patients who did not start dialysis, mean age was 80±5 years, 51% were women and 33% were Black. The crude rate of death was high overall but lower in those initiating vs. not initiating chronic dialysis (26.1 vs. 32.1 per 100 person-years, respectively, P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, dialysis was associated with a 33% (95% Confidence Interval:17–46%) lower adjusted rate of death compared with not initiating dialysis. Conclusions Among older adults with HF and advanced CKD, dialysis initiation was associated with lower mortality, but absolute rates of death were very high in both groups. Randomized trials should evaluate net outcomes of dialysis vs. conservative management on length and quality of life in this high-risk population."
https://openalex.org/W4206537536,"Nor98-like atypical scrapie is a sporadic disease that affects the central nervous system of sheep and goats that, in contrast to classical scrapie, is not generally regarded as naturally transmissible. However, infectivity has been demonstrated via bioassay not only of brain tissue but also of certain peripheral nerves, lymphoid tissues, and muscle. This study examines placental tissue, a well characterized route of natural transmission for classical scrapie. Further, this study was conducted in sheep homozygous for the classical scrapie resistant ARR genotype and is the first to characterize the transmission of Nor98-like scrapie between homozygous-ARR sheep. Nor98-like scrapie isolated from a United States ARR/ARR sheep was transmitted to four ARR/ARR ewes via intracerebral inoculation of brain homogenate. These ewes were followed and observed to 8 years of age, remained non-clinical but exhibited progression of infection that was consistent with Nor98-like scrapie, including characteristic patterns of PrP Sc accumulation in the brain and a lack of accumulation in peripheral lymphoid tissues as detected by conventional methods. Immunoblots of placental tissues from the infected ewes revealed accumulation of a distinct conformation of PrP res , particularly as the animals aged; however, the placenta showed no infectivity when analyzed via ovinized mouse bioassay. Taken together, these results support a low risk for natural transmission of Nor98-like scrapie in ARR/ARR sheep."
