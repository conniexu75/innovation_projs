https://openalex.org/W3138734145,"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is devastating health systems and economies worldwide. Recombinant or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), and P.1 (Brazil) harbor mutations in the viral spike (S) protein that may alter virus-host cell interactions and confer resistance to inhibitors and antibodies. Here, using pseudoparticles, we show that entry of all variants into human cells is susceptible to blockade by the entry inhibitors soluble ACE2, Camostat, EK-1, and EK-1-C4. In contrast, entry of the B.1.351 and P.1 variant was partially (Casirivimab) or fully (Bamlanivimab) resistant to antibodies used for COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, entry of these variants was less efficiently inhibited by plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients and sera from BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may escape neutralizing antibody responses, which has important implications for efforts to contain the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3150736119,"T cell exhaustion limits immune responses against cancer and is a major cause of resistance to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapeutics. Using murine xenograft models and an in vitro model wherein tonic CAR signaling induces hallmark features of exhaustion, we tested the effect of transient cessation of receptor signaling, or rest, on the development and maintenance of exhaustion. Induction of rest through enforced down-regulation of the CAR protein using a drug-regulatable system or treatment with the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in the acquisition of a memory-like phenotype, global transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming, and restored antitumor functionality in exhausted CAR-T cells. This work demonstrates that rest can enhance CAR-T cell efficacy by preventing or reversing exhaustion, and it challenges the notion that exhaustion is an epigenetically fixed state."

Whether bacterial genomes may also adapt to the industrialization of their host populations remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the extent to which the rates and targets of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) vary across thousands of bacterial strains from 15 human populations spanning a range of industrialization. We show that HGTs have accumulated in the microbiome over recent host generations and that HGT occurs at high frequency within individuals. Comparison across human populations reveals that industrialized lifestyles are associated with higher HGT rates and that the functions of HGTs are related to the level of host industrialization. Our results suggest that gut bacteria continuously acquire new functionality based on host lifestyle and that high rates of HGT may be a recent development in human history linked to industrialization."
https://openalex.org/W3148616091,"Brain region coordination in learning Gamma-frequency oscillations have been hypothesized as a physiological mechanism of interregional communication in the brain. However, until now, all supporting data have been correlational and thus indirect. Fernández-Ruiz et al. examined gamma-frequency activity and spike coupling between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus during learning and after selective perturbation of gamma-frequency spike timing. They observed an integrated neuron, gamma-band, and task-specific organization of the entorhinal cortex–hippocampal circuits. These data demonstrate that specific, projected gamma-frequency oscillation patterns dynamically engage functionally related cell assemblies across brain regions in a task-specific manner.

https://openalex.org/W3139810373,"Patient access and adherence to chronic medications is critical. In this work, we evaluate whether disruptions related to Covid-19 have affected new and existing patients’ access to pharmacological therapies without interruption. We do so by performing a retrospective analysis on a dataset of 9.4 billion US prescription drug claims from 252 million patients from May, 2019 through August, 2020 (about 93% of prescriptions dispensed within those months). Using fixed effect (conditional likelihood) linear models, we evaluate continuity of care, how many days of supply patients received, and the likelihood of discontinuing therapy for drugs from classes with significant population health impacts. Findings indicate that more prescriptions were filled in March 2020 than in any prior month, followed by a significant drop in monthly dispensing. Compared to the pre-Covid era, a patient’s likelihood of discontinuing some medications increased after the spread of Covid: norgestrel-ethinyl estradiol (hormonal contraceptive) discontinuation increased 0.62% (95% CI: 0.59% to 0.65%, p&lt;0.001); dexmethylphenidate HCL (ADHD stimulant treatment) discontinuation increased 2.84% (95% CI: 2.79% to 2.89%, p&lt;0.001); escitalopram oxalate (SSRI antidepressant) discontinuation increased 0.57% (95% CI: 0.561% to 0.578%, p&lt;0.001); and haloperidol (antipsychotic) discontinuation increased 1.49% (95% CI: 1.41% to 1.57%, p&lt;0.001). In contrast, the likelihood of discontinuing tacrolimus (immunosuppressant) decreased 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12% to 0.19%, p&lt;0.001). The likelihood of discontinuing buprenorphine/naloxone (opioid addiction therapy) decreased 0.59% (95% CI: 0.55% to 0.62% decrease, p&lt;0.001). We also observe a notable decline in new patients accessing these latter two therapies. Most US patients were able to access chronic medications during the early months of Covid-19, but still were more likely to discontinue their therapies than in previous months. Further, fewer than normal new patients started taking medications that may be vital to their care. Providers would do well to inquire about adherence and provide prompt, nonjudgmental, re-initiation of medications. From a policy perspective, opioid management programs seem to demonstrate a robust ability to manage existing patients in spite of disruption."
https://openalex.org/W3150835854,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption, distress, and loss of life around the world. While negative health, economic, and social consequences are being extensively studied, there has been less research on the resilience and post-traumatic growth that people show in the face of adversity. We investigated New Zealanders’ experiences of benefit-finding during the COVID-19 pandemic and analysed qualitative responses to a survey examining mental well-being during the New Zealand lockdown. A total of 1175 of 2010 eligible participants responded to an open-ended question probing ‘silver linings’ (i.e., positive aspects) they may have experienced during this period. We analysed these qualitative responses using a thematic analysis approach. Two thirds of participants identified silver linings from the lockdown and we developed two overarching themes: Surviving (coping well, meeting basic needs, and maintaining health) and thriving (self-development, reflection, and growth). Assessing positive as well as negative consequences of the pandemic provides more nuanced insights into the impact that New Zealand’s response had on mental well-being."
https://openalex.org/W3149399312,"This paper reports survey findings on the Swiss public’s willingness, attitudes, and concerns regarding personalized health research participation by providing health information and biological material. The survey reached a sample of 15,106 Swiss residents, from which we received 5,156 responses (34.1% response rate). The majority of respondents were aware of research using human biological samples (71.0%) and held a positive opinion towards this type of research (62.4%). Of all respondents, 53.6% indicated that they would be willing to participate in a personalized health research project. Willingness to participate was higher in younger, higher educated, non-religious respondents with a background in the health sector. Respondents were more willing to provide ‘traditional’ types of health data, such as health questionnaires, blood or biological samples, as opposed to social media or app-related data. All respondents valued the return of individual research results, including risk for diseases for which no treatment is available. Our findings highlight that alongside general positive attitudes towards personalized health research using data and samples, respondents have concerns about data privacy and re-use. Concerns included potential discrimination, confidentiality breaches, and misuse of data for commercial or marketing purposes. The findings of this large-scale survey can inform Swiss research institutions and assist policymakers with adjusting practices and developing policies to better meet the needs and preferences of the public. Efforts in this direction could focus on research initiatives engaging in transparent communication, education, and engagement activities, to increase public understanding and insight into data sharing activities, and ultimately strengthen personalized health research efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3151602627,"Agricultural production is vital for the stability of the country’s economy. Controlling weed infestation through agrochemicals is necessary for increasing crop productivity. However, its excessive use has severe repercussions on the environment (damaging the ecosystem) and the human operators exposed to it. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been proposed by several authors in the literature for performing the desired spraying and is considered safer and more precise than the conventional methods. Therefore, the study’s objective was to develop an accurate real-time recognition system of spraying areas for UAVs, which is of utmost importance for UAV-based sprayers. A two-step target recognition system was developed by using deep learning for the images collected from a UAV. Agriculture cropland of coriander was considered for building a classifier for recognizing spraying areas. The developed deep learning system achieved an average F1 score of 0.955, while the classifier recognition average computation time was 3.68 ms. The developed deep learning system can be deployed in real-time to UAV-based sprayers for accurate spraying."
https://openalex.org/W3144492674,"Evidence-based STI (science, technology, and innovation) policy making requires accurate indicators of innovation in order to promote economic growth. However, traditional indicators from patents and questionnaire-based surveys often lack coverage, granularity as well as timeliness and may involve high data collection costs, especially when conducted at a large scale. Consequently, they struggle to provide policy makers and scientists with the full picture of the current state of the innovation system. In this paper, we propose a first approach on generating web-based innovation indicators which may have the potential to overcome some of the shortcomings of traditional indicators. Specifically, we develop a method to identify product innovator firms at a large scale and very low costs. We use traditional firm-level indicators from a questionnaire-based innovation survey (German Community Innovation Survey) to train an artificial neural network classification model on labelled (product innovator/no product innovator) web texts of surveyed firms. Subsequently, we apply this classification model to the web texts of hundreds of thousands of firms in Germany to predict whether they are product innovators or not. We then compare these predictions to firm-level patent statistics, survey extrapolation benchmark data, and regional innovation indicators. The results show that our approach produces reliable predictions and has the potential to be a valuable and highly cost-efficient addition to the existing set of innovation indicators, especially due to its coverage and regional granularity."
https://openalex.org/W3150956300,"Introduction Early and rapid confirmation of dengue infections strengthens disease surveillance program and are critical to the success of vector control measures. Rapid diagnostics tests (RDTs) are increasingly used to confirm recent dengue infections due to their ease of use and short turnaround time for results. Several studies undertaken in dengue-endemic Southeast Asia have reported the performance of RDTs against enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation methods. However, few studies have compared multiple RDTs for the detection of dengue NS1 antigen and IgM antibody in a single combo cassette. We evaluated six RDTs in Singapore for their utility in routine clinical testing to detect recent dengue infections. Methods The evaluation comprised two phases. The first phase sought to determine each RDT’s specificity to dengue NS1 and IgM using zika and chikungunya virus supernatant and zika convalescent samples. RDTs that cross-reacted with zika or chikungunya were not further tested in phase 2. The second phase sought to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the remaining RDTs to dengue NS1 and IgM using pre-characterised dengue specimens and non-dengue/chikungunya febrile clinical specimens. Results None of the RDTs cross-reacted with zika IgM in Phase 1. Truquick and Quickprofile cross reacted with zika and chikungunya viruses and were not evaluated thereafter. Standard Q had the highest dengue NS1 and IgM sensitivity at 87.0% and 84.3% respectively whereas Bioline (68.5%) and Multisure (58.3%) had the lowest dengue NS1 and IgM sensitivity respectively. Combining dengue NS1/IgM detection results greatly improved the RDT ability to detect recent dengue infection; Standard Q had the highest sensitivity at 99.1% while Multisure had the lowest at 92.6%. All the RDTs were highly specific for dengue NS1 and IgM (96.7% to 100%). All the RDTs had high positive predictive values (98.4% to 100%) for NS1, IgM and combined NS1/IgM parameters whereas Standard Q had the highest negative predictive values at 68.2% (NS1), 63.8% (IgM) and 96.8% (NS1/IgM). For the RDTs, detection of NS1 declined from acute to convalescent phase of illness whereas IgM detection rate gradually increased over time. Conclusion In our study, several RDTs were evaluated for their diagnostic accuracy and capability in detecting recent dengue infection. Standard Q demonstrated a high degree of diagnostic accuracy and capability in the detection of NS1 and IgM biomarkers. RDTs can provide rapid and accurate confirmation of recent dengue infections and augment dengue surveillance and control programmes. Further studies are required to assess the usefulness of these RDTs in other epidemiology settings."
https://openalex.org/W3141992723,"Objective Emergency Department (ED) attendances with chest pain reduced during the COVID-19 lockdown. We performed a service evaluation project in NHS Lothian to explore how and why the COVID-19 pandemic and public health advice had affected chest pain presentations and help-seeking behaviour at an individual patient level using a qualitative interview approach. Methods We carried out 28 semi-structured telephone interviews with a convenience sample of patients who presented with chest pain during lockdown and in patients with known coronary heart disease under the outpatient care of a cardiologist in April and May 2020. Interviews were audio recorded and voice files listened to while making detailed notes. Salient themes and issues were documented as verbatim extracts. Interviews were analysed thematically. Results Patient interviews revealed three main themes. 1) pandemic help-seeking behaviour; describing how participants made the decision to seek professional healthcare assessment. 2) COVID-19 exposure concerns; describing how the subthemes of perceived vulnerability, wishing to protect others and adding pressure to the health service shaped their decision making for an episode of acute chest pain. 3) hospital experience; describing the difference between the imagined and actual experience in hospital. Conclusions Qualitative interviews revealed how the pandemic shaped help-seeking practices, how patients interpreted their personal vulnerability to the virus, and described patient experience of attending hospital for assessment during this time. As patient numbers presenting to hospital appeared to mirror public health messaging, dynamic monitoring of this messaging should evaluate public response to healthcare campaigns to ensure the net impact on health, pandemic and non-pandemic related, is optimised."
https://openalex.org/W3149298607,"Data on the prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody in healthcare workers (HCWs) is scarce, especially in pediatric settings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positivity among HCWs of a tertiary pediatric hospital. In addition, follow-up of the serological response in the subgroup of seropositive HCWs was analysed, to gain some insight on the persistence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We performed a retrospective analysis of voluntary SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing, which was made available free of charge to HCWs of the Children’s Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw (Poland). Plasma samples were collected between July 1 and August 9, 2020, and tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Of 2,282 eligible participants, 1,879 (82.3%) HCWs volunteered to undergo testing. Sixteen HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, corresponding to a seroprevalence of 0.85%. Among seropositive HCWs, three HCWs had confirmed COVID-19. Nine (56.3%) of the seropositive HCWs reported neither symptoms nor unprotected contact with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in the previous months. A decline in the IgG index was observed at a median time of 86.5 days (range:84‒128 days) after symptom onset or RT-PCR testing. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the duration of persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as the correlation between seropositivity and protective immunity against reinfection. Regardless of the persistence of antibodies and their protective properties, such low prevalence indicates that this population is vulnerable to a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3145707119,"Background Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is a rare histologic pattern of acute lung involvement with intra-alveolar fibrin deposition. However, the clinical significance of the pathological findings of AFOP remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the clinical significance of AFOP through a comprehensive clinical examination. Methods The medical records of patients with lung diseases accompanied by the pathological finding of intra-alveolar organization between January 2010 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical and radiological findings were compared between the groups with and without the histologic pattern of AFOP. Results We identified 34 patients with AFOP (AFOP group) and 143 without AFOP (non-AFOP group). The underlying diseases of the AFOP group were as follows: 19 patients had cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (OP), 5 had connective tissue diseases, 3 had radiation pneumonitis, 3 had chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, 2 had myelodysplastic syndromes, and 2 had drug-induced pneumonia. Fever was more common, the time from symptom onset to biopsy was shorter, and the serum C-reactive protein level was higher in the AFOP group than in the non-AFOP group. On high-resolution computed tomography, 85% of patients had OP pattern, and halo sign was more common in the AFOP group. Corticosteroids were effective in 94% of the patients in the AFOP group; however, recurrences were more frequent, and a higher corticosteroid dose was needed during recurrence. Conclusions AFOP might be an early phase of a histologic pattern associated with known etiologies. In addition, it could be a marker indicating intense inflammatory diseases with a tendency of recurrence."

Whereas radiant energy positively enhances or ostensibly promotes socio-economic stability and the controlled environment. The fossil energy sources supply has become progressively stern in China and reconnoitering the beta decoupling relationships between CO2 emissions, GDP, energy consumption, electricity consumption, value-added industries, and population. The results will be favorable for illustrative the security of the valuable resources. This study adopts the extended stochastic model (STIRPAT) with Beta Decoupling Techniques (BDT). This modern technique merely employs the decoupling situation by the alpha and beta effects from 1989 to 2018 and calculates the % change in CO2 emissions by GDP growth and energy consumption. The estimated results represent negative and economic growth depends on coal and natural gas. First, CO2 emissions annually increasing cause of rapid growth, energy consumption, and electricity production, and the structural contradiction of energy remained static. Second, the Value-added industries estimated that CO2 emissions reduce by primary industries. Third, the decoupling states of CO2 emissions and population show an inverse relationship. This paper tentatively suggests China is sustainable, naturally strengthens energy output, transmutes the energy consumption structure, and advances development policies under environmental circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W3148782712,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spread out all over the world. Although a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has been used as a primary diagnostic tool for COVID-19, the utility of CT based diagnostic tools have been suggested to improve the diagnostic accuracy and reliability. Herein we propose a semi-supervised deep neural network for an improved detection of COVID-19. The proposed method utilizes CT images in a supervised and unsupervised manner to improve the accuracy and robustness of COVID-19 diagnosis. Both labeled and unlabeled CT images are employed. Labeled CT images are used for supervised leaning. Unlabeled CT images are utilized for unsupervised learning in a way that the feature representations are invariant to perturbations in CT images. To systematically evaluate the proposed method, two COVID-19 CT datasets and three public CT datasets with no COVID-19 CT images are employed. In distinguishing COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 CT images, the proposed method achieves an overall accuracy of 99.83%, sensitivity of 0.9286, specificity of 0.9832, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.9192. The results are consistent between the COVID-19 challenge dataset and the public CT datasets. For discriminating between COVID-19 and common pneumonia CT images, the proposed method obtains 97.32% accuracy, 0.9971 sensitivity, 0.9598 specificity, and 0.9326 PPV. Moreover, the comparative experiments with respect to supervised learning and training strategies demonstrate that the proposed method is able to improve the diagnostic accuracy and robustness without exhaustive labeling. The proposed semi-supervised method, exploiting both supervised and unsupervised learning, facilitates an accurate and reliable diagnosis for COVID-19, leading to an improved patient care and management."
https://openalex.org/W3146946317,"Background In all areas of the World Health Organization, the prevalence of hypertension was highest in Africa. High blood pressure is a significant risk factor for coronary and ischemic diseases, as well as hemorrhagic stroke. However, there were scarce data concerning the magnitude and risk factors of hypertension. Thus, this study aimed to identify the prevalence and associated factors of hypertension among adults in Addis Ababa city. Method A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June to October 2018 in Addis Ababa city. Participants aged 18 years and older recruited using a multi-stage random sampling technique. Data were collected by face-to-face interview technique. All three WHO STEPS instruments were applied. Additionally, participants’ weight, height, waist, hip, and blood pressure (BP) were measured according to standard procedures. Multiple logistic regressions were used and Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were also calculated to identify associated factors. Results In this study, a total of 3560 participants were included.The median age was 32 years (IQR 25, 45). More than half (57.3%) of the respondents were females. Almost all (96.2%) of participants consumed vegetables and or fruits less than five times per day. Eight hundred and sixty-five (24.3%) of respondents were overweight, while 287 (8.1%) were obese. One thousand forty-one 29.24% (95% CI: 27.75–30.74) were hypertensive, of whom two-thirds (61.95%) did not know that they had hypertension. Factors significantly associated with hypertension were age 30–49 and ≥50 years (AOR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.39–5.56) and (AOR = 8.23, 95% CI: 4.09–16.55) respectively, being male (AOR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.18–2.99), consumed vegetables less than or equal to 3 days per week (AOR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.21–4.93), obesity (AOR = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.13–3.71), abdominal obesity (AOR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.10–2.64) and high triglyceride level (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.38–3.07). Conclusion In Addis Ababa, around one in three adults are hypertensive. With a large proportion, unaware of their condition. We recommend integrating regular community-based screening programs as integral parts of the health promotion and disease prevention strategies. Lifestyle interventions shall target the modifiable risk factors associated with hypertension, such as weight loss and increased vegetable consumption."

Although congenital syphilis is preventable through timely treatment, the rate of new infections in the United States (US) has increased each year since 2013, and is increasing at a noticeably greater pace in California (CA). Most research into congenital syphilis has focused on individual psychosocial and behavioral factors that contribute to maternal vulnerability for syphilis. The aim of this study was to evaluate structural barriers to prenatal care access and utilization and congenital syphilis prevention in Kern County, CA. Transcripts from 8 in-depth interviews with prenatal care providers and 5 focus group discussions with 42 pregnant and postpartum persons were examined using thematic analysis. Structural barriers experienced by pregnant and postpartum persons to prenatal care access and utilization included (1) burdens of poverty; (2) stigma around substance use in pregnancy; (3) citizenship status; (4) lack of healthcare coverage; (5) low sexual health literacy; and (6) gender inequality Structural barriers experienced by prenatal care providers in congenital syphilis prevention included (1) limited guidance on clinical management of syphilis in pregnancy; (2) decay in public health infrastructure; and (3) inadequate support for managing patients’ social comorbidities. The response to congenital syphilis prevention will require an examination of the complex context of social determinants of health in which persons diagnosed with syphilis live in."
https://openalex.org/W3150055657,"Background Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) develops in various underlying pulmonary conditions. There is scarce data evaluating interstitial lung disease (ILD)/abnormalities (ILA) as such conditions, and it has not been explored much whether non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) is a prognostic factor for mortality in CPA patients. Few reports had investigated prognostic factors of CPA including underlying pulmonary conditions. Objectives To explore prognostic factors of CPA including pulmonary conditions. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 264 CPA patients from a center for pulmonary aspergillosis in Japan. Results Survival rates were 78.7%, 61.0%, and 47.4% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Of 264 patients, 53 (20.1%) and 87 (33.1%) were complicated with ILA and NTM-PD. Several independent prognostic factors were identified by multivariate Cox proportional analysis: ILA (HR 1.76, 95%CI 1.06–2.92, p = 0.029), age (1.05, 1.02–1.08, p&lt;0.001), male sex (2.48, 1.34–4.59, p = 0.004), body mass index of &lt;18.5 kg/m 2 (1,87, 1.20–2.90, p = 0.005), presence of aspergilloma (1.59, 1.04–2.45, p = 0.033), and lower serum albumin (0.56, 0.38–0.83, p = 0.004). NTM-PD was not associated with higher mortality (0.85, 0.52–1.38, p = 0.51). Conclusions The poor prognosis of CPA and several prognostic factors were revealed. Early diagnosis and intervention is required with reference to such factors."
https://openalex.org/W3140075007,"The particle size distribution (PSD) of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and other submicron particles in biofluids is commonly measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS). A new technique for measuring the PSD is microfluidic resistive pulse sensing (MRPS). Because specific guidelines for measuring EVs together with other particles in biofluids with MRPS are lacking, we developed an operating procedure to reproducibly measure the PSD. The PSDs of particles in human plasma, conditioned medium of PC3 prostate cancer cell line (PC3 CM), and human urine were measured with MRPS (nCS1, Spectradyne LLC) to investigate: (i) the optimal diluent that reduces the interfacial tension of the sample while keeping EVs intact, (ii) the lower limit of detection (LoD) of particle size, (iii) the reproducibility of the PSD, (iv) the optimal dilution for measuring the PSD, and (v) the agreement in measured concentration between microfluidic cartridges with overlapping detection ranges. We found that the optimal diluent is 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline. Based on the shape of the PSD, which is expected to follow a power-law function within the full detection range, we obtained a lower LoD of 75 nm for plasma and PC3 CM and 65 nm for urine. Normalized PSDs are reproducible (R 2 &gt; 0.950) at dilutions between 10–100x for plasma, 5–20x for PC3 CM, and 2–4x for urine. Furthermore, sample dilution does not impact the dilution-corrected concentration when the microfluidic cartridges are operated within their specified concentration ranges. PSDs from microfluidic cartridges with overlapping detection ranges agreed well (R 2 &gt; 0.936) and when combined the overall PSD spanned 5 orders of magnitude of measured concentration. Based on these findings, we have developed operating guidelines to reproducibly measure the PSD of EVs together with other particles in biofluids with MRPS."
https://openalex.org/W3142714547,"Clinical guidelines (CG) are used to reduce variability in practice when the scientific evidence is sparse or when multiple therapies are available. The development and implementation of evidence-based CG is intended to organize and provide the best available evidence to support clinical decision making in order to improve quality of care. Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) are the leading cause of misuse of antibiotics and a CG may reduce the unnecessary antibiotic prescription.The aim of this quasi-experimental, before-after study was to analyze the short- and long-term effects of the implementation of a CG to decrease the rate of antibiotic prescription in URTI cases in the emergency department of a third level private hospital in Quito, Ecuador. The study included 444 patients with a main diagnosis of URTI. They were distributed in three groups: a baseline cohort 2011 (n = 114), a first post-implementation cohort 2011 (n = 114), and a later post-implementation cohort 2018 (n = 216). The implementation strategy consisted of five key steps: acceptance of the need for implementation of the CG, dissemination of the CG, an educational campaign, constant feedback, and sustainability of the strategy through continuous training.The results of this study show a 42.90% of antibiotic prescription rate before the CG implementation. After the implementation of the CG, the prescription rate of antibiotics was significantly reduced by 24.5% (42.9% vs 18.4%, p<0.0001) and the appropriate antibiotic prescription rate was significantly increased by 44.2% (22.4% vs 66.6%, p<0.0001) in the first post-implementation cohort 2011. There was not a significant difference in antibiotic prescription rate and appropriate antibiotic prescription rate between two post-implementation cohorts: 18.4% vs 25.9% (p = 0.125) and 66.6% vs 50% (p = 0.191), respectively.The implementation of CGs decreases the rate of antibiotic prescription in URTI cases. The results are remarkable after early implementation, but the effect persists over time. The emphasis must shift from guideline development to strategy implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3145655010,"Human gait is as unique to an individual as is their fingerprint. It remains unknown, however, what gait characteristics differentiate well between individuals that could define the uniqueness of human gait. The purpose of this work was to determine the gait characteristics that were most relevant for a neural network to identify individuals based on their running patterns. An artificial neural network was trained to recognize kinetic and kinematic movement trajectories of overground running from 50 healthy novice runners (males and females). Using layer-wise relevance propagation, the contribution of each variable to the classification result of the neural network was determined. It was found that gait characteristics of the coronal and transverse plane as well as medio-lateral ground reaction forces provided more information for subject identification than gait characteristics of the sagittal plane and ground reaction forces in vertical or anterior-posterior direction. Additionally, gait characteristics during the early stance were more relevant for gait recognition than those of the mid and late stance phase. It was concluded that the uniqueness of human gait is predominantly encoded in movements of the coronal and transverse plane during early stance."

The empirical results indicate that clarity and commitment regarding content marketing strategy and a content production in line with the organization’s target groups’ content needs as well as normative journalistic quality criteria are context factors associated with higher content marketing effectiveness. The outcomes also reveal that regularly measuring content marketing performance and using the data obtained as guidance for improving content offerings positively influence content marketing effectiveness, as do structural specialization and specialization-enabling processes and systems. The insights provided in this study could offer important theoretical contributions for research on content marketing and its effectiveness and may help practitioners to optimize the design and implementation of content marketing initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W3143418328,"Purpose Existing virtual agents (VAs) present in dialogue systems are either information retrieval based or static goal-driven. However, in real-world situations, end-users might not have a known and fixed goal beforehand for the task, i.e., they may upgrade/downgrade/update their goal components in real-time to maximize their utility values. Existing VAs are unable to handle such dynamic goal-oriented situations. Methodology Due to the absence of any related dialogue dataset where such choice deviations are present, we have created a conversational dataset called Deviation adapted Virtual Agent( DevVA ), with the manual annotation of its corresponding intents, slots, and sentiment labels. A Dynamic Goal Driven Dialogue Agent (DGDVA) has been developed by incorporating a Dynamic Goal Driven Module (GDM) on top of a deep reinforcement learning based dialogue manager. In the course of a conversation, the user sentiment provides grounded feedback about agent behavior, including goal serving action. User sentiment appears to be an appropriate indicator for goal discrepancy that guides the agent to complete the user’s desired task with gratification. The negative sentiment expressed by the user about an aspect of the provided choice is treated as a discrepancy that is being resolved by the GDM depending upon the observed discrepancy and current dialogue state. The goal update capability and the VA’s interactiveness trait enable end-users to accomplish their desired task satisfactorily. Findings The obtained experimental results illustrate that DGDVA can handle dynamic goals with maximum user satisfaction and a significantly higher success rate. The interaction drives the user to decide its final goal through the latent specification of possible choices and information retrieved and provided by the dialogue agent. Through the experimental results (qualitative and quantitative), we firmly conclude that the proposed sentiment-aware VA adapts users’ dynamic behavior for its goal setting with substantial efficacy in terms of primary objective i.e., task success rate (0.88). Practical implications In real world, it can be argued that many people do not have a predefined and fixed goal for tasks such as online shopping, movie booking &amp; restaurant booking, etc. They tend to explore the available options first which are aligned with their minimum requirements and then decide one amongst them. The DGDVA provides maximum user satisfaction as it enables them to accomplish a dynamic goal that leads to additional utilities along with the essential ones. Originality To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort towards the development of A Dynamic Goal Adapted Task-Oriented Dialogue Agent that can serve user goals dynamically until the user is satisfied."

Changes in social dynamics due to local restrictions impacted human behavior and led to a shift in crime dynamics. We analyze shifts in crime types by comparing crimes before the implementation of stay at home orders and the time period shortly after these orders were put in place across three cities. We find consistent changes across Chicago, Baltimore, and Baton Rouge with significant declines in total crimes during the time period immediately following stay at home orders. The starkest differences occurred in Chicago, but in all three cities the crime types contributing to these declines were related to property crime and statutory crime rather than interpersonal crimes."
https://openalex.org/W3147341513,"Understanding the microbial communities in anaerobic digesters, especially bacteria and archaea, is key to its better operation and regulation. Microbial communities in the anaerobic digesters of the Gulf region where climatic conditions and other factors may impact the incoming feed are not documented. Therefore, Archaeal and Bacterial communities of three full-scale anaerobic digesters, namely AD1, AD3, and AD5 of the Jebel Ali Sewage water Treatment Plant (JASTP) were analyzed by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Among bacteria, the most abundant genus was fermentative bacteria Acetobacteroides (Blvii28). Other predominant bacterial genera in the digesters included thermophilic bacteria ( Fervidobacterium and Coprothermobacter ) and halophilic bacteria like Haloterrigena and Sediminibacter . This can be correlated with the climatic condition in Dubai, where the bacteria in the incoming feed may be thermophilic or halophilic as much of the water used in the country is desalinated seawater. The predominant Archaea include mainly the members of the phyla Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota belonging to the genus Methanocorpusculum , Metallosphaera , Methanocella , and Methanococcus . The highest population of Methanocorpusculum (more than 50% of total Archaea), and other hydrogenotrophic archaea, is in agreement with the high population of bacterial genera Acetobacteroides (Blvii28) and Fervidobacterium , capable of fermenting organic substrates into acetate and H 2 . Coprothermobacter , which is known to improve protein degradation by establishing syntrophy with hydrogenotrophic archaea, is also one of the digesters’ dominant genera. The results suggest that the microbial community in three full-scale anaerobic digesters is different. To best of our knowledge this is the first detailed report from the UAE."
https://openalex.org/W3148553192,"Background The optimal dose of simethicone before capsule endoscopy is unknown. Prior studies have reported inconsistent cleansing, with some showing improved visualization only in the proximal small intestine. We hypothesized a higher volume of simethicone may improve cleansing and diagnostic yield, especially in the distal small bowel. Methods A phase III randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing high volume (1125 mg simethicone in 750 ml water) versus standard volume (300 mg simethicone in 200 ml water) solutions, both at 1.5 mg/ml. The primary outcome was adequate bowel preparation, defined as a KOrea-CanaDA (KODA) score &gt;2.25, overall and stratified by the proximal and distal half of the small bowel. Secondary outcomes included mean KODA score, diagnostic yield, completion rate, and adverse events. All analyses were intention-to-treat. Results A total of 167 patients were randomized (mean (SD) age 58.7 (15.7), 54% female) and the most common indication was obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (71.7%). Adequate cleansing was achieved in 39 (50%) patients in the high volume group and in 39 (48%) patients in the standard volume group (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76–1.43, p = 0.82), with no differences observed in the proximal half (71% vs 64%, p = 0.40) or the distal half -of the small bowel (36% vs. 37%, p = 0.88). There was no differences in the mean (SD) KODA score (2.20 (0.41) vs. 2.18 (0.44), p = 0.73), diagnostic yields (53% vs. 56%, p = 0.71), or completion rates (both 95%). One adverse event, nausea, occurred in the control group. Conclusion High volume simethicone does not improve visualization during capsule endoscopy.

https://openalex.org/W3143097609,"Background Anemia has severe public health significance in sub-Saharan Africa. In Ethiopia, anemia has been increasing in the last two decades, reaching the highest national level in 2016, however, the geospatial distribution and determinants of anemia in children weren’t well explored at a national level. Methods We used the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey(EDHS) data from 2005–2016. The data consists of samples of households (HHs) obtained through a two-stage stratified sampling procedure. Our analysis included 19,699 children. Descriptive statistics, geospatial analysis, and Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMMs) were used. Results The overall prevalence of anemia was 51.5%; the spatial distribution of anemia significantly different across clusters in each survey. Children from 6 to 11 months had higher odds of anemia compared to 24–59 months (Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR) = 3.4, 95%Confidence level (CI): 2.99–3.76). Children with the first and second birth order were less likely to be anemic compared to fifth and above (AOR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.38–0.95, and AOR = 0.83, 95%C: 0.73–0.93) respectively. Mothers’ age 15 to 24 years was associated with higher odds of anemia compared to 35 to 49 years (AOR = 1.37, 95%CI: 1.20–1.55). Children from HHs with the poorest and poorer wealth category showed a higher odds of anemia compared to the richest (AOR = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.45–1.93, and AOR = 1.25, 95%CI: 1.08–1.45) respectively. Moreover, children from HHs with one to two under-five children were less likely to be anemic compared to those three and more (AOR = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.76–0.91). Conclusions The geospatial distribution of anemia among children varies in Ethiopia; it was highest in the East, Northeast, and Western regions of the country. Several factors were associated with anemia; therefore, interventions targeting the hotspots areas and specific determinant factors should be implemented by the concerned bodies to reduce the consequences of anemia on the generation."

Lysine phosphoglycerylation, a newly discovered reversible type of PTM that affects glycolytic enzyme activities, and is responsible for a wide variety of diseases, such as heart failure, arthritis, and degeneration of the nervous system. Our goal is to computationally characterize potential phosphoglycerylation sites to understand the functionality and causality more accurately. In this study, a novel computational tool, referred to as predPhogly-Site, has been developed to predict phosphoglycerylation sites in the protein. It has effectively utilized the probabilistic sequence-coupling information among the nearby amino acid residues of phosphoglycerylation sites along with a variable cost adjustment for the skewed training dataset to enhance the prediction characteristics. It has achieved around 99% accuracy with more than 0.96 MCC and 0.97 AUC in both 10-fold cross-validation and independent test. Even, the standard deviation in 10-fold cross-validation is almost negligible. This performance indicates that predPhogly-Site remarkably outperformed the existing prediction tools and can be used as a promising predictor, preferably with its web interface at http://103.99.176.239/predPhogly-Site ."
https://openalex.org/W3151738210,"Emerging studies indicate that APOA-I binding protein (AIBP) is a secreted protein and functions extracellularly to promote cellular cholesterol efflux, thereby disrupting lipid rafts on the plasma membrane. AIBP is also present in the mitochondria and acts as an epimerase, facilitating the repair of dysfunctional hydrated NAD(P)H, known as NAD(P)H(X). Importantly, AIBP deficiency contributes to lethal neurometabolic disorder, reminiscent of the Leigh syndrome in humans. Whereas cyclic NADPHX production is proposed to be the underlying cause, we hypothesize that an unbiased metabolic profiling may: 1) reveal new clues for the lethality, e.g., changes of mitochondrial metabolites., and 2) identify metabolites associated with new AIBP functions. To this end, we performed unbiased and profound metabolic studies of plasma obtained from adult AIBP knockout mice and control littermates of both genders. Our systemic metabolite profiling, encompassing 9 super pathways, identified a total of 640 compounds. Our studies demonstrate a surprising sexual dimorphism of metabolites affected by AIBP deletion, with more statistically significant changes in the AIBP knockout female vs male when compared with the corresponding controls. AIBP knockout trends to reduce cholesterol but increase the bile acid precursor 7-HOCA in female but not male. Complex lipids, phospholipids, sphingomyelin and plasmalogens were reduced, while monoacylglycerol, fatty acids and the lipid soluble vitamins E and carotene diol were elevated in AIBP knockout female but not male. NAD metabolites were not significantly different in AIBP knockout vs control mice but differed for male vs female mice. Metabolites associated with glycolysis and the Krebs cycle were unchanged by AIBP knockout. Importantly, polyamine spermidine, critical for many cellular functions including cerebral cortex synapses, was reduced in male but not female AIBP knockout. This is the first report of a systemic metabolite profile of plasma samples from AIBP knockout mice, and provides a metabolic basis for future studies of AIBP regulation of cellular metabolism and the pathophysiological presentation of AIBP deficiency in patients."
https://openalex.org/W3146008850,"Many human viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), do not infect mice, which is challenging for biomedical research. We have previously reported that EBV infection induces erosive arthritis, which histologically resembles rheumatoid arthritis, in humanized NOD/Shi- scid/IL-2Rγ null (hu-NOG) mice; however, the underlying mechanisms are not known. Osteoclast-like multinucleated cells were observed during bone erosion in this mouse model, and therefore, we aimed to determine whether the human or mouse immune system activated bone erosion and analyzed the characteristics and origin of the multinucleated cells in hu-NOG mice. Sections of the mice knee joint tissues were immunostained with anti-human antibodies against certain osteoclast markers, including cathepsin K and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Multinucleated cells observed during bone erosion stained positively for human cathepsin K and MMP-9. These results indicate that human osteoclasts primarily induce erosive arthritis during EBV infections. Human osteoclast development from hematopoietic stem cells transplanted in hu-NOG mice remains unclear. To confirm their differentiation potential into human osteoclasts, we cultured bone marrow cells of EBV-infected hu-NOG mice and analyzed their characteristics. Multinucleated cells cultured from the bone marrow cells stained positive for human cathepsin K and human MMP-9, indicating that bone marrow cells of hu-NOG mice could differentiate from human osteoclast progenitor cells into human osteoclasts. These results indicate that the human immune response to EBV infection may induce human osteoclast activation and cause erosive arthritis in this mouse model. Moreover, this study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate human osteoclastogenesis in humanized mice. We consider that this model is useful for studying associations of EBV infections with rheumatoid arthritis and human bone metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3147692287,"Background ADVanced Organ Support (ADVOS) is a novel type of extracorporeal albumin dialysis and holds promise to sustain liver function and recovery of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Previously, ADVOS was tested as continuous treatment for intensive care patients with liver failure. Data related to the applicability and safety as discontinuous treatment outside of ICU is not available. Aim Evaluation of ADVOS as discontinuous treatment for patients with ACLF outside intensive care unit and comparison with a matched historic cohort. Methods and results In this retrospective study, 26 patients with ACLF and the indication for renal replacement therapy related to HRS-AKI were included. Majority of patients were male (65%) with alcoholic cirrhosis in 88% and infections as a trigger of ACLF in 96%. Liver function was severely compromised reflected by high median MELD and CLIF-C ACLF scores of 37 (IQR 32;40) and 56.5 (IQR 51;60), respectively. Patients were treated discontinuously with ADVOS over a median time of 12 days (IQR 8.25;17) and received 8 (IQR 4.25;9.75) treatment cycles on average. No treatment related adverse events were recorded, and safety laboratory parameters remained constant during the observation time. After 16 h cumulative dialysis therapy, ADVOS significantly reduced protein-bound bilirubin (14%), creatinine (11.8%) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN, 33%). Using a matched cohort with ACLF treated with hemodialysis, ADVOS achieved a stronger decrease in bilirubin (p = 0.01), while detoxification of water-soluble catabolites’ including creatinine and BUN was comparable. The 28-days mortality in the ADVOS group was 56% (14/26) and was not inferior to predicted survival (predicted median 28-days mortality was 44%, IQR 30; 59). Conclusion Discontinuous ADVOS treatment was safe and effective in patients with ACLF outside intensive care and outperformed hemodialysis in reducing protein-bound metabolites."

https://openalex.org/W3149898351,"Anterior pituitary endocrine cells that release hormones such as growth hormone and prolactin are excitable and fire action potentials. In these cells, several studies previously showed that extracellular sodium (Na+) removal resulted in a negative shift of the resting membrane potential (RMP) and a subsequent inhibition of the spontaneous firing of action potentials, suggesting the contribution of a Na+ background conductance. Here, we show that the Na+ leak channel NALCN conducts a Ca2+- Gd3+-sensitive and TTX-resistant Na+ background conductance in the GH3 cell line, a cell model of pituitary endocrine cells. NALCN knockdown hyperpolarized the RMP, altered GH3 cell electrical properties and inhibited prolactin secretion. Conversely, the overexpression of NALCN depolarized the RMP, also reshaping the electrical properties of GH3 cells. Overall, our results indicate that NALCN is functional in GH3 cells and involved in endocrine cell excitability as well as in hormone secretion. Indeed, the GH3 cell line suitably models native pituitary cells that display a similar Na+ background conductance and appears as a proper cellular model to study the role of NALCN in cellular excitability."
https://openalex.org/W3151113943,"Background Preterm birth is a significant contributor of under-five and newborn deaths globally. Recent estimates indicated that, Tanzania ranks the tenth country with the highest preterm birth rates in the world, and shares 2.2% of the global proportion of all preterm births. Previous studies applied binary regression models to determine predictors of preterm birth by collapsing gestational age at birth to &lt;37 weeks. For targeted interventions, this study aimed to determine predictors of preterm birth using multinomial regression models accounting for missing data. Methods We carried out a secondary analysis of cohort data from the KCMC zonal referral hospital Medical Birth Registry for 44,117 women who gave birth to singletons between 2000-2015. KCMC is located in the Moshi Municipality, Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania. Data analysis was performed using Stata version 15.1. Assuming a nonmonotone pattern of missingness, data were imputed using a fully conditional specification (FCS) technique under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. Multinomial regression models with robust standard errors were used to determine predictors of moderately to late ([32,37) weeks of gestation) and very/extreme (&lt;32 weeks of gestation) preterm birth. Results The overall proportion of preterm births among singleton births was 11.7%. The trends of preterm birth were significantly rising between the years 2000-2015 by 22.2% (95%CI 12.2%, 32.1%, p&lt;0.001) for moderately to late preterm and 4.6% (95%CI 2.2%, 7.0%, p = 0.001) for very/extremely preterm birth category. After imputation of missing values, higher odds of moderately to late preterm delivery were among adolescent mothers (OR = 1.23, 95%CI 1.09, 1.39), with primary education level (OR = 1.28, 95%CI 1.18, 1.39), referred for delivery (OR = 1.19, 95%CI 1.09, 1.29), with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (OR = 1.77, 95%CI 1.54, 2.02), inadequate (&lt;4) antenatal care (ANC) visits (OR = 2.55, 95%CI 2.37, 2.74), PROM (OR = 1.80, 95%CI 1.50, 2.17), abruption placenta (OR = 2.05, 95%CI 1.32, 3.18), placenta previa (OR = 4.35, 95%CI 2.58, 7.33), delivery through CS (OR = 1.16, 95%CI 1.08, 1.25), delivered LBW baby (OR = 8.08, 95%CI 7.46, 8.76), experienced perinatal death (OR = 2.09, 95%CI 1.83, 2.40), and delivered male children (OR = 1.11, 95%CI 1.04, 1.20). Maternal age, education level, abruption placenta, and CS delivery showed no statistically significant association with very/extremely preterm birth. The effect of (&lt;4) ANC visits, placenta previa, LBW, and perinatal death were more pronounced on the very/extremely preterm compared to the moderately to late preterm birth. Notably, extremely higher odds of very/extreme preterm birth were among the LBW babies (OR = 38.34, 95%CI 31.87, 46.11). Conclusions The trends of preterm birth have increased over time in northern Tanzania. Policy decisions should intensify efforts to improve maternal and child care throughout the course of pregnancy and childbirth towards preterm birth prevention. For a positive pregnancy outcome, interventions to increase uptake and quality of ANC services should also be strengthened in Tanzania at all levels of care, where several interventions can easily be delivered to pregnant women, especially those at high-risk of experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3139866302,"While failure in resolution of inflammation is considered to increase the risk of tumorigenesis, there is paucity of experimental as well as clinical evidence supporting this association. Resolvin D1 (RvD1) is a representative pro-resolving lipid mediator that is endogenously generated from docosahexaenoic acid for the resolution of inflammation. Here, we report a decreased level of RvD1 in the blood from colorectal cancer patients and mice having inflammation-induced colon cancer, suggesting plasma RvD1 as a potential biomarker for monitoring colorectal cancer. Administration of RvD1 attenuated dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and azoxymethane (AOM) plus DSS-induced colorectal carcinogenesis by suppressing the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-6-mediated chromosomal instability. The protective effect of RvD1 against chromosomal instability is associated with downregulation of IL-6-induced Cyclin D1 expression, which appears to be mediated by blocking the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) axis. RvD1 inhibited the STAT3 signaling pathway by interfering with the binding of IL-6 to its receptor (IL-6R), suggesting the novel function of RvD1 as a putative IL-6R antagonist. Together, our findings suggest that RvD1-mediated blockade of IL-6 signal transmission may contribute to inhibition of chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis."

In 2020, several changes were made to the OSTRC questionnaires (OSTRC-O, OSTRC-H), including changes to the wording, structure, and logic of the original questionnaires. In the present study, the Japanese versions of the OSTRC questionnaires (OSTRC-O.JP, OSTRC-H.JP) were revised to meet the requirements of the updated versions and to analyse new and previously collected data to illustrate the impact of the changes on Japanese athletes. Proposed changes were categorized as minor or more substantial; minor changes were effected to the questionnaire instructions and to the wording of all four questions, and more substantial changes were made to the wording of question 2. The updated questionnaires also included changes to questionnaire logic and answer categories. To assess the consequences of the changes to the wording of question 2, 101 athletes were asked to complete the OSTRC-H.JP, which included both the original and updated versions of question 2, over 10 consecutive weeks. We calculated the number of health problems identified when new gatekeeper logic was and was not applied, using 1585 OSTRC-H.JP responses to assess the consequences of the changes to the questionnaire logic. The kappa coefficient, which measures the level of agreement between the responses to question 2 of the original and updated versions, was high. By applying gatekeeper logic, there was a remarkable reduction in the number of injuries and illnesses among all health problems but less reduction in substantial health problems and time loss health problems. These changes will make it easier for Japanese athletes to complete the questionnaires and improve the quality of collected data."
https://openalex.org/W3148769246,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public health problems in Ethiopia. Determining treatment outcome of TB cases could help to understand the effectiveness of TB control efforts. The objective of this study was to assess TB treatment outcome and associated factors and determine the risk factors of death among TB cases who were on Directly Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS). Methodology We analyzed a retrospective data for TB cases who were on DOTS at Dilla Referral Hospital from July 2011- June 2016. The study population was TB cases with known HIV status and whose treatment outcome was evaluated at the Hospital. Data were entered, cleaned and analyzed using statistical package SPSS for windows, version 20. Result Out of 899 registered TB cases, 731 included in this analysis. Of these cases, 424 (58.0%) were male and 334 (45.7%) were in the age group of below 25 years. Treatment success rate of TB was 675 (92.3%) and death rate was 18 (2.5%). Treatment outcome showed statistically significant variation by HIV status (P &lt; 0.001). HIV status of the TB cases and pretreatment weight were associated with TB treatment outcome. HIV status of the TB cases was associated with death of the TB cases (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 5.0; CI 95%: 1.8–13.5). Conclusion TB treatment success rate found in this study was high. Patient’s weight and HIV status were associated with treatment outcome. Moreover, HIV status predicted death of TB cases. Cautious treatment follow-up and defaulter tracing mechanisms for TB cases with these risk factors were suggested."
https://openalex.org/W3139547986,"Background Data on illicit drug use by Korean people infected with HIV are lacking. Here, we examined the prevalence and patterns of illicit drug use among people infected with HIV in Korea. Material and methods In this cross-sectional study, we included all patients infected with HIV who visited a tertiary care hospital in Korea from January 1990 to May 2020. Sociodemographic data of patients, including drug use, were collected at the first visit and during follow-up. Results Among 1,267 patients, 5.13% reported the use of an illicit drug in their lifetime, and 2.61% were users of injection drugs. The most commonly used drugs were cannabis/marijuana and methamphetamine, followed by nitrite inhalants, cocaine, dextromethorphan, carisoprodol, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. The illicit drug users tended to be younger than non-users, homosexuals/bisexuals, and infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV); they had a higher CD4 + cell count than non-users. Among 65 users of illicit drugs, only 24.6% revealed their drug use at the first visit interview, and 24.6% reported using two or more drugs in their lifetime. Individuals who used injection drugs were more likely to be arrested for drug-related charges than the users of non-injection drugs. Moreover, they tended to be heavy users of illicit drugs, to report using two or more drugs in their lifetime, and to be HCV seropositive. In contrast, the users of non-injection drugs were more likely to be experimental users and to start using drugs overseas for the first time, but less likely to report their drug use at the first interview. Conclusions The prevalence of illicit drug use in people with HIV infection in Korea may have been underestimated. Further research based on more accurate measurements are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3143174043,"In response to cold or diet, fatty acids are dissipated into heat through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown adipose tissue (BAT). This process is termed non-shivering thermogenesis, which is important for body temperature maintenance and contributes to obesity pathogenesis. Thermogenic enhancement has been considered a promising anti-obesity strategy. Ghrelin and its receptor Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor (GHS-R) have critical roles in energy intake, nutrient sensing, and lipid metabolism. We previously reported that global Ghsr -knockout mice have increased energy expenditure due to enhanced thermogenesis. To determine the site of action for GHS-R mediated thermogenesis, we generated brown adipocyte-specific Ghsr knockout mice ( UCP1 -Cre ER / Ghsr f/f ) and assessed thermogenic responses under regular diet (RD) fed homeostatic metabolic state or high-fat diet (HFD) fed metabolically-impaired obese state, under normal or cold housing environment. Under a RD-feeding, UCP1 -Cre ER / Ghsr f/f mice showed increased body fat and a slightly elevated core body temperature under cold but not under normal temperature. Consistently, the expression of thermogenic genes in BAT of RD-fed UCP1 -Cre ER / Ghsr f/f mice was increased in reposes to cold. Under HFD feeding, HFD-fed UCP1 -Cre ER / Ghsr f/f mice showed no difference in body fat or body temperature under either normal or cold exposure. Interestingly, the expression of thermogenic genes in BAT of HFD-fed UCP1 -Cre ER / Ghsr f/f mice was upregulated under normal temperature but downregulated under cold exposure. Overall, our data show that GHS-R has cell-autonomous effect in brown adipocytes, and GHS-R regulates BAT thermogenic activity in a temperature- and metabolic state-dependent manner. The thermogenic effect of GHS-R in BAT is more pronounced in cold environment and differentially variable based on metabolic state; under cold exposure, GHS-R inhibition in BAT activates thermogenesis under homeostatic state but suppresses thermogenesis under obese state. Our finding collectively suggests that GHS-R in BAT, acting as a “metabolic thermostat”, differentially regulates thermogenesis in response to different metabolic and thermal stimuli."

However, mass screening of mosquitoes is usually laborious and expensive, requiring specialized expertise and equipment.

Here we test the use of filter papers to detect chikungunya virus in mosquito saliva in laboratory conditions, before proposing this method in large-scale mosquito surveillance programs. We found that 0.9 cm 2 cards impregnated with a 50% honey solution could replace the forced salivation technique as they offered a viral RNA detection until 7 days after oral infection of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes with CHIKV."
https://openalex.org/W3147887527,"Computer simulations of mathematical models open up the possibility of assessing hypotheses generated by experiments on pathogen immune evasion in human whole-blood infection assays. We apply an interdisciplinary systems biology approach in which virtual infection models implemented for the dissection of specific immune mechanisms are combined with experimental studies to validate or falsify the respective hypotheses. Focusing on the assessment of mechanisms that enable pathogens to evade the immune response in the early time course of a whole-blood infection, the least-square error (LSE) as a measure for the quantitative agreement between the theoretical and experimental kinetics is combined with the Akaike information criterion (AIC) as a measure for the model quality depending on its complexity. In particular, we compare mathematical models with three different types of pathogen immune evasion as well as all their combinations: (i) spontaneous immune evasion, (ii) evasion mediated by immune cells, and (iii) pre-existence of an immune-evasive pathogen subpopulation. For example, by testing theoretical predictions in subsequent imaging experiments, we demonstrate that the simple hypothesis of having a subpopulation of pre-existing immune-evasive pathogens can be ruled out. Furthermore, in this study we extend our previous whole-blood infection assays for the two fungal pathogens Candida albicans and C . glabrata by the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and calibrated the model predictions to the time-resolved experimental data for each pathogen. Our quantitative assessment generally reveals that models with a lower number of parameters are not only scored with better AIC values, but also exhibit lower values for the LSE. Furthermore, we describe in detail model-specific and pathogen-specific patterns in the kinetics of cell populations that may be measured in future experiments to distinguish and pinpoint the underlying immune mechanisms."

Methods Eye bank corneas of 3 female and 3 male healthy individuals as well as the corneal buttons of 3 female and 3 male KC patients were utilized for this study. The endothelium of the cornea was removed with sterile surgical scalpels, the probes were washed repeatedly with Dulbecco’s PBS and corneoscleral rims were trimmed off. Subsequently the corneal stroma was digested with collagenase type I and the harvested CSFs were cultured. We then examined (1) cell proliferation, (2) cell viability and (3) cytokine release of CSFs upon exposure to prolactin in vitro . Results With respect to viability and proliferation our experiments did not show significant differences between CSFs exposed to different PRL concentrations. Our data show a significantly lower IL-8 concentration in normal CSFs exposed to 10ng/ml PRL compared to 0ng/ml and 1000ng/ml at 5 hours post exposition. Moreover, we can report significantly lower secretion of IL-8, IL-6, HGF, VEGF and FGFb in KC CSFs compared to normal CSFs, independent of PRL exposure, as determined by cytokine ELISA. Conclusion Our data in part points towards corneal cytokine secretion as a possible link between altered stromal PRL concentrations and KC progression. However, in our small dataset a significant influence of PRL concentration on cytokine secretion can only be described for IL-8 in normal CSFs. Further our results contribute to existing reports on the importance of cytokines in KC development, with an emphasis on significantly lower cytokine secretion in KC CSFs compared to normal controls."

Obstetric fistula is an abnormal connection between the vagina and the bladder or the rectum resulting from obstetric causes, mainly prolonged obstructed labour. Zimbabwe has two obstetric fistula repair centers. Because the program uses specialist surgeons from outside the country, the repairs are organized in quarterly camps with a target to repair 90 women per quarter. This study aimed at assessing the impact of restrictions on movement and gathering of people brought about by the Cocid-19 pandemic and to characterize participants of the camp which was held in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic at Mashoko Hospital. Specifically it looked at how Covid-19 pandemic affected programming for obstetric fistula repair and characterized participants of the fistula camp held in November to December 2020 at one of the repair centers. A review of the dataset and surgical log sheets for the camp and national obstetric fistula dataset was conducted. Variables of interest were extracted onto an excel spreadsheet and analyzed for frequencies and proportions. Data were presented in charts, tables and narratives. The study noted that Covid-19 pandemic negatively affected performance of fistula repairs greatly with only 25 women repaired in 2020 as compared to 313 in 2019. Ninety women were called to come for repairs but 52 did not manage to attend due to reasons related to the restriction of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. Two thirds of those women suffered from urinary incontinence while the other third had fecal incontinence. The successful repair rate was 92%. This study concluded that the pandemic greatly affected programming of fistula repair in the country and recommended the Ministry of Health and Child Care to institute measures to resume programming as soon as the situation allows."

In this study, the integrated depth-dose-distributions (IDDDs) of 190 MeV/u and 260 MeV/u carbon beams in the active spot-scanning delivery system were measured and calculated by FLUKA Monte Carlo simulation based on the Heavy Ion Medical Machine (HIMM). Considering the dose distributions caused by secondary particles and scattering, we also used different types of pencil beam (PB) models to fit and compare the spatial distributions of PB. We superposed a bunch of PB to form a 20×20 cm 2 treatment field with the double Gaussian and double Gaussian logistic beam models and calculated the influence of beam delivery error on the field flatness and penumbra, respectively. The simulated IDDDs showed good agreement with the measured values. The triple Gaussian and double Gaussian logistic beam models have good fitness to the simulated dose distributions. There are different influences on dose uniformity and penumbra resulting from beam uncertainties. These results would be helpful for understanding carbon ion therapy, and physical therapists are more familiar with beam characteristics for active scanning therapy, which provides a reference for commissioning and optimization of treatment plans in radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3141597676,"This study investigated the effect of restoration management of a weed-infested area, previously used as cattle resting place, on herbage production and nutrient concentrations in the soil and herbage. The experiment was undertaken from 2004 to 2011 at the National Park of Nízké Tatry, Slovakia. Three treatments were applied: (i) cutting twice per year, (ii) herbicide application, followed after three weeks by reseeding with a mixture of vascular plant species and then cut twice per year, and (iii) unmanaged. Treatments had significant effect on biomass production and concentration of nutrients in the soil and in herbage. Nutrient concentrations in herbage and in soil declined progressively under the cutting treatments and reached optimum ranges for dairy cattle at the end of the experiment when herbage N was less than 15 g kg -1 and herbage P was 3.4 g kg -1 . There was also a strong positive relationship under the cutting treatments between soil nutrient concentrations and herbage nutrient concentrations for N, P, K, Mg and Ca. Although the cutting management as well as the combination of herbicide application with cutting management reduced nutrient concentrations in the soil and in herbage, the nutrient concentrations remained relatively high. We can conclude that restoration of grassland covered with weedy species like Urtica dioica and Rumex obtusifolius , with excessive levels of soil nutrients, cannot be achieved just by cutting and herbicide application."
https://openalex.org/W3144476817,"Oncogene addiction is a cellular property by which cancer cells become highly dependent on the expression of oncogenes for their survival. Oncogene addiction can be exploited to design molecularly targeted drugs that kill only cancer cells by inhibiting the specific oncogenes. Genes and cell lines exhibiting oncogene addiction, as well as the mechanisms by which cell death is induced when addicted oncogenes are suppressed, have been extensively studied. However, it is still not fully understood how oncogene addiction is acquired in cancer cells. Here, we take a synthetic biology approach to investigate whether oncogenic mutation or oncogene expression suffices to confer the property of oncogene addiction to cancer cells. We employed human mammary epithelium-derived MCF-10A cells expressing the oncogenic KRAS or BRAF. MCF-10A cells harboring an oncogenic mutation in a single-allele of KRAS or BRAF showed weak transformation activity, but no characteristics of oncogene addiction. MCF-10A cells overexpressing oncogenic KRAS demonstrated the transformation activity, but MCF-10A cells overexpressing oncogenic BRAF did not. Neither cell line exhibited any oncogene addiction properties. These results indicate that the introduction of oncogenic mutation or the overexpression of oncogenes is not sufficient for cells to acquire oncogene addiction, and that oncogene addiction is not associated with transformation activity."
https://openalex.org/W3150988825,"Here we report the discovery of ceramic fragments that form part of a Gorgoneion, a ceramic image representation of the Gorgon Medusa. The fragments were found in a deep part of Gorham’s Cave, well known to ancient mariners as a natural shrine, between the 8 th and 2 nd century BCE. We discuss the context of this discovery, both within the inner topography of the cave itself, and also the broader geographical context. The discovery is situated at the extreme western end of the Mediterranean Sea, where it meets the Atlantic Ocean. The location was known to ancient mariners as the northern Pillar of Herakles, which marked the end of the known world. We relate the discovery, and its geographical and chronological context, to Greek legends that situated the lair of the Gorgon sisters at a location which coincides with the physical attributes and geographical position of Gorham’s Cave. We thus provide, uniquely, a geographical and archaeological context to the myth of Perseus and the slaying of the Gorgon Medusa."
https://openalex.org/W3152447721,"Q fever is one of the most important zoonotic diseases caused by the obligate intracellular bacteria, Coxiella burnetii . This bacterial infection has been frequently reported in both humans and animals, especially ruminants. Ticks are important ectoparasite and serve as reservoir hosts of Coxiella -like endosymbionts (CLEs). In this study, we have attempted to express chaperone-coding genes from CLEs of Rhipicephalus annulatus ticks collected fromcow path. The partial DnaK coding sequence has been amplified and expressed by Escherichia coli . Amino acid sequences have been analyzed by MS-MS spectrometry and the UniProt database. Despites nucleotide sequences indicating high nucleotide variation and diversity, many nucleotide substitutions are synonymous. In addition, amino acid substitutions compensate for the physicochemical properties of the original amino acids. Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB-AR) was employed to indicate the antigenicity of the partial DnaK protein and predict the epitopes of B-and T-cells. Interestingly, some predicted HLA-A and B alleles of the MHC-I and HLA-DR alleles belonging to MHC-II were similar to T-cell responses to C . burnetii in Q fever patients. Therefore, the partial DnaK protein of CLE from R . annulatus could be considered a vaccine candidate and immunogenic marker with future prospects."
https://openalex.org/W3140741707,"The microenvironment of an early-stage tumor, in which a small number of cancer cells is surrounded by a normal counterpart milieu, plays a crucial role in determining the fate of initiated cells. Here, we examined cell competition between anaplastic thyroid cancer cells and normal thyroid follicular cells using co-culture method. Cancer cells were grown until they formed small clusters, to which normal cells were added to create high-density co-culture condition. We found that co-culture with normal cells significantly suppressed the growth of cancer cell clusters through the activation of Akt-Skp2 pathway. In turn, cancer cells triggered apoptosis in the neighboring normal cells through local activation of ERK1/2. A bi-directional cell competition provides a suppressive mechanism of anaplastic thyroid cancer progression. Since the competitive effect was negated by terminal growth arrest caused by radiation exposure to normal cells, modulation of reciprocal stress response in vivo could be an intrinsic mechanism associated with tumor initiation, propagation, and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3151086282,"The measurement of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) in cochlear implant (CI) patients is widely used to provide evidence of a functioning electrode-nerve interface, to confirm proper location of the electrode array and to program the sound processor. In patients with an auditory brainstem implant (ABI), a likewise versatile measurement would be desirable. The ECAP measurement paradigm “Alternating Polarity” was utilized to record responses via the implanted ABI electrode array placed on the cochlear nucleus. Emphasizing on the different location of stimulation and recording, these responses are called local evoked potentials (LEP). LEP measurements were conducted during the clinical routine in 16 ABI patients (12 children and 4 adults), corresponding to 191 electrode contacts. A retrospective analysis of these data revealed, that LEP responses were observed in 64.9% of all measured electrode contacts. LEP responses predicted auditory perception with a sensitivity of 90.5%. False-positive rate was 33.7%. Objective LEP thresholds were highly significantly (p &lt; 0.001) correlated both to behavioral thresholds (Pearson’s r = 0.697) and behavioral most comfortable levels (r = 0.840). Therefore, LEP measurements have the potential to support fitting in ABI patients."
