https://openalex.org/W1963597613,"The utilization of solar energy on a large scale requires its storage. In natural photosynthesis, energy from sunlight is used to rearrange the bonds of water to oxygen and hydrogen equivalents. The realization of artificial systems that perform “water splitting” requires catalysts that produce oxygen from water without the need for excessive driving potentials. Here we report such a catalyst that forms upon the oxidative polarization of an inert indium tin oxide electrode in phosphate-buffered water containing cobalt (II) ions. A variety of analytical techniques indicates the presence of phosphate in an approximate 1:2 ratio with cobalt in this material. The pH dependence of the catalytic activity also implicates the hydrogen phosphate ion as the proton acceptor in the oxygen-producing reaction. This catalyst not only forms in situ from earth-abundant materials but also operates in neutral water under ambient conditions."

These cells could in turn be used for disease modeling, drug discovery, and eventually autologous cell replacement therapies. Although recent studies have demonstrated the reprogramming of human fibroblasts to a pluripotent state, it remains unclear whether these induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be produced directly from elderly patients with chronic disease. We have generated iPS cells from an 82-year-old woman diagnosed with a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These patient-specific iPS cells possess properties of embryonic stem cells and were successfully directed to differentiate into motor neurons, the cell type destroyed in ALS."

Although certain natural compounds, such as reseveratrol, have endurance-enhancing activities, their exact metabolic targets remain elusive. We therefore tested the effect of pathway-specific drugs on endurance capacities of mice in a treadmill running test. We found that PPARβ/δ agonist and exercise training synergistically increase oxidative myofibers and running endurance in adult mice. Because training activates AMPK and PGC1α, we then tested whether the orally active AMPK agonist AICAR might be sufficient to overcome the exercise requirement. Unexpectedly, even in sedentary mice, 4 weeks of AICAR treatment alone induced metabolic genes and enhanced running endurance by 44%. These results demonstrate that AMPK-PPARδ pathway can be targeted by orally active drugs to enhance training adaptation or even to increase endurance without exercise.

Skeletal muscle is an adaptive tissue composed of multiple myofibers that differ in their metabolic and contractile properties, including oxidative slow-twitch (type I), mixed oxidative-glycolytic fast-twitch (type IIa) and glycolytic fast-twitch (type IIb) myofibers (Pette and Staron, 2000Pette D.

Molecular basis of skeletal muscle plasticity-from gene to form and function.Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 146: 159-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Type I fibers preferentially express enzymes that oxidize fatty acids, contain slow isoforms of contractile proteins, and are more resistant to fatigue than are glycolytic fibers. Type II fibers preferentially metabolize glucose and express the fast isoforms of contractile proteins. Endurance exercise training triggers a remodeling program in skeletal muscle that progressively enhances performance in athletes such as marathon runners, mountain climbers, and cyclists. This involves change in metabolic programs and structural proteins within the myofiber that alter the energy substrate utilization and contractile properties that act to reduce muscle fatigue (Pette and Staron, 2000Pette D.

Training-based adaptations in the muscle are linked to increases in the expression of genes involved in the slow-twitch contractile apparatus, mitochondrial respiration, and fatty acid oxidation (Holloszy and Coyle, 1984Holloszy J.O.

These adaptations that improve performance can also protect against obesity and related metabolic disorders (Wang et al., 2004Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R.

Moreover, skeletal muscles rich in oxidative slow-twitch fibers are resistant to muscle wasting (Minnaard et al., 2005Minnaard R. Drost M.R. Wagenmakers A.J. van Kranenburg G.P. Kuipers H. Hesselink M.K. Skeletal muscle wasting and contractile performance in septic rats.Muscle Nerve. 2005; 31: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given the numerous benefits of exercise on general health, identification of orally active agents that mimic or potentiate the genetic effects of endurance exercise is a long-standing, albeit elusive, medical goal. High doses of certain natural extracts such as resveratrol can improve endurance (Lagouge et al., 2006Lagouge M. Argmann C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Meziane H. Lerin C. Daussin F. Messadeq N. Milne J. Lambert P. Elliott P. et al.Resveratrol improves mitochondrial function and protects against metabolic disease by activating SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha.Cell. 2006; 127: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). The aerobic effects of resveratrol are thought to dependent on activation of SIRT1-PGC1α coactivator complex in skeletal muscle. However, the downstream transcriptional factor(s) targeted by SIRT1/PGC1α in mediating these effects are not known. More importantly, both SIRT1/PGC1α and resveratrol activate multiple targets, and thus whether there is a specific signaling pathway that can be selectively activated by a synthetic drug to improve endurance is not known. Exercise training activates a number of transcriptional regulators and serine-threonine kinases in skeletal muscles that contribute to metabolic reprogramming (Bassel-Duby and Olson, 2006Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Signaling pathways in skeletal muscle remodeling.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). We and others previously identified a critical role for PPARβ/δ (henceforth referred to as PPARδ) in transcriptional regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism (Dressel et al., 2003Dressel U. Allen T.L. Pippal J.B. Rohde P.R. Lau P. Muscat G.E.

Regulation of muscle fiber type and running endurance by PPARdelta.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a constitutively active PPARδ (VP16-PPARδ) in skeletal muscles of transgenic mice preprograms an increase in oxidative muscle fibers, enhancing running endurance by nearly 100% in untrained adult mice (Wang et al., 2004Wang Y.X.

Regulation of muscle fiber type and running endurance by PPARdelta.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). One of the best understood serine-threonine kinases is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular and organismal metabolism whose function is conserved in all eukaryotes (Hardie, 2007Hardie D.G. AMP-activated/SNF1 protein kinases: Conserved guardians of cellular energy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). In mammals, AMPK has been shown to contribute to glucose homeostasis, appetite, and exercise physiology (Andersson et al., 2004Andersson U. Filipsson K. Abbott C.R. Woods A. Smith K. Bloom S.R.

Metab. 2007; 292: E196-E202Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These observations raise the question as to whether synthetic PPARδ or AMPK agonists can reprogram established fiber specification in adult muscle toward an overt endurance phenotype. We have found that the PPARδ agonist GW1516 (shown to be bioactive in humans; Sprecher et al., 2007Sprecher D.L. Massien C. Pearce G. Billin A.N. Perlstein I. Willson T.M. Hassall D.G. Ancellin N. Patterson S.D. Lobe D.C. Johnson T.G. Triglyceride:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol effects in healthy subjects administered a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta agonist.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) enables mice to run 60%–75% longer and further than the nontreated controls only when combined with exercise training. This “super-endurance phenotype” is linked to a transcriptional boost provided by exercise-activated AMPK resulting in a novel endurance gene signature. A more critical role of AMPK in the super-endurance phenotype is revealed in our unexpected finding that the orally active AMPK agonist AICAR is sufficient as a single agent to improve running endurance by nearly 45% in nonexercised mice. Together, these results provide new insights into the pharmacological malleability of muscle performance. To examine whether treatment with PPARδ ligands alone can reprogram the muscle transcriptome and endurance capacity, we treated wild-type C57Bl/6J age matched cohorts with vehicle or GW1516 for 4 weeks. QPCR analysis of selective target genes confirmed that drug treatment induced oxidative metabolic biomarkers such as uncoupling protein 3 (Ucp3), muscle carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (mCPT I, Cpt 1b), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4) (Figure 1A). These changes in gene expression were detected as early as 4 days after treatment, as well as with drug concentrations ranging from 2–5 mg/kg/day. Moreover, in all our gene expression studies, maximal effects of PPARδ activation were detected in predominantly fast-twitch (quadricep and gastrocnemius) but not slow-twitch (soleus) muscles (data not shown). In primary muscle cells cultured from wild-type and PPARδ null mice (Chawla et al., 2003Chawla A. Lee C.H. Barak Y. He W. Rosenfeld J. Liao D. Han J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PPARdelta is a very low-density lipoprotein sensor in macrophages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 1268-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, Man et al., 2007Man M.Q. Barish G.D. Schmuth M. Crumrine D. Barak Y. Chang S. Jiang Y. Evans R.M. Elias P.M. Feingold K.R. Deficiency of PPARbeta/delta in the epidermis results in defective cutaneous permeability barrier homeostasis and increased inflammation.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 128: 370-377PubMed Google Scholar), we confirmed that the induction of oxidative genes by GW1516 is mediated via selective activation of PPARδ in skeletal muscles (Figures S1A–S1C available online). Moreover, this is similar to the expression changes found in the same genes in muscles expressing the constitutively active VP16-PPARδ transgene (Wang et al., 2004Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. Regulation of muscle fiber type and running endurance by PPARdelta.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A), supporting the concept that pharmacological activation of PPARδ is sufficient to initiate an oxidative response in adult skeletal muscle. To determine the functional effects of ligand, age- and weight-matched cohorts of treated and control mice were subjected to an endurance treadmill performance test before (week 0) and after (week 5) treatment. Curiously, running performance was unchanged by GW1516 treatment (Figure 1B). Furthermore, long-term drug treatment of up to 5 months also did not change running endurance (data not shown). These results indicate that pharmacologic activation of the PPARδ genetic program in adult C57Bl/6J mice is insufficient to promote a measurable enhancement of treadmill endurance. Since endurance exercise remodels the skeletal muscle to progressively alter performance (Holloszy and Coyle, 1984Holloszy J.O. Coyle E.F.

Human muscle gene expression responses to endurance training provide a novel perspective on Duchenne muscular dystrophy.FASEB J. 2005; 19: 750-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we speculated whether coadministration of GW1516 in the context of exercise training might enhance anticipated changes in fiber type composition and mitochondrial biogenesis. The effect of GW1516 and exercise on fiber type composition was determined via metachromatic staining of cryosections of the gastrocnemius (Wang et al., 2004Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. Regulation of muscle fiber type and running endurance by PPARdelta.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). As expected from the results of the running performance in Figure 1B, there was no significant difference in the proportion of type I fibers between vehicle- and GW1516-treated sedentary mice (Figure 1C). In contrast, in trained mice, GW1516 increased the proportion of type I fibers (by ∼38%) compared to the vehicle-treated sedentary mice (Figures 1C and 1D). In addition to its effects on the fiber type, exercise training increases skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, which was measured as a function of mitochondrial DNA expression levels via quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR). Similar to type I fiber changes, mitochondrial DNA expression was not changed by drug alone but was increased by approximately 50% with the combination of exercise and GW1516 treatment (Figure 1E). The effects of GW1516 treatment and exercise, singly or in combination, on components of the oxidative metabolism of fatty acids were further analyzed by measurement of the gene expression levels of selective biomarkers for fatty acid β oxidation. As expected, we found that previously examined genes such as Ucp3, Cpt 1b, and Pdk4 were upregulated by GW1516 but showed no further induction with exercise (Figure 2A). Unexpectedly, we discovered a second set of genes that show no response to exercise or drug alone but are robustly induced by the combination. This intriguing response profile includes a series of genes involved in the regulation of fatty acid storage (such as steroyl-CoA-desaturase [Scd1], fatty acyl coenzyme A synthase [FAS, Fasn] and serum response element binding protein 1c [SREBP1c, Srebf1c]) and fatty acid uptake (such as the fatty acid transporter [FAT, Cd36] and lipoprotein lipase [Lpl]) (Figures 2B, 2C, and 3).Figure 3Running Endurance and Gene Signature in Exercise-Trained MiceShow full caption(A and B) Running endurance was tested in V- (open bars) and GW- (black bars) treated mice before (Week 0) and after (Week 5) exercise training.

We also measured the protein levels of selective oxidative biomarkers including myoglobin, UCP3, cytochrome c (CYCS), and SCD1. In each case, a more robust upregulation of protein expression was found by combining exercise and GW1516 treatment relative to either drug or exercise alone (Figure 2D). Altered triglycerides are one way to assess changes in muscle oxidative capacity. Triglyceride levels were unchanged in vehicle- or GW1516-treated sedentary mice but showed a striking increase with exercise. In contrast, this increase was completely reversed by GW1516 treatment, presumably because of enhanced fat utilization (Figure S1D). As described above, although GW1516 treatment alone induces widespread genomic changes associated with oxidative metabolism, it fails to increase running endurance. On the other hand, drug treatment in conjunction with exercise produces an enriched remodeling program that includes a series of transcriptional and posttranslational adaptations in the skeletal muscle. This suggests that exercise training serves as a key trigger to unmask a cryptic set of PPARδ target genes, leading us to re-examine the ability of the drug to modulate endurance. Indeed, the same dose and duration of GW1516 treatment that previously failed to alter performance, when paired with 4 weeks of exercise training, increases running time by 68% and running distance by 70% over vehicle-treated trained mice (Figures 3A and 3B, compare week 5). It is also important to note that comparison of running time and distance before (week 0) and after (week 5) exercise and drug treatment revealed a 100% increment in endurance capacity for individual mice, underscoring the robustness of the combination paradigm (Figures 3A and 3B). Finally, it is noteworthy that the combined effects of GW1516 and exercise reduces the ratio of epididymal fat to body weight and fat cross-sectional area in these mice (Figures S1E and S1F), suggesting the broader systemic effects of this protocol. To dissect the mechanism underlying the super-endurance phenotype, we conducted a comprehensive study of the muscle transcriptome induced by ligand, exercise, or the combination, which produced three overlapping networks of 96, 113, and 130 genes, respectively (Figure 3C). Approximately 50% of the target genes were common between GW1516 and exercise, demonstrating that PPARδ activation partially mimics exercise. To our surprise, combined GW1516 treatment and exercise established a unique gene expression pattern that was neither an amalgamation nor a complete overlap of the individual interventions (Figure 3C). This signature included 48 new target genes (Table S1) not regulated by either GW1516 or exercise alone while excluding 74 genes regulated by GW1516 or exercise (selective genes are listed in Table S3). The majority of the genes in the GW1516-exercise signature were induced (108/130), the components of which are described in Figure 3D. Although the largest gene subclass (32% of genes) was linked to positive regulation of aerobic capacity, additional pathways implicated in muscle remodeling and endurance were also represented in the signature (see Table S2 for detailed description). It is noteworthy that comparative expression analysis of the 48 exclusive genes of the endurance signature (but not of either intervention alone) revealed a striking similarity to “untrained” VP16-PPARδ transgenic mice (Figure 3E). This observation confirms the primary dependence of the 48 genes on PPARδ and points to the possibility that exercise-generated signals may function to synergize PPARδ transcriptional activity to levels comparable to transgenic overexpression. What might be the molecular interface between mechanical exercise and PPARδ transcription? Exercise training is known to activate multiple kinases, among which AMPK has profound effects on skeletal muscle gene expression and oxidative metabolism (Chen et al., 2003Chen Z.P. Stephens T.J.

MyD88 deficiency in mice leads to susceptibility to a broad range of pathogens in experimental settings of infection. We describe a distinct situation in a natural setting of human infection. Nine children with autosomal recessive MyD88 deficiency suffered from life-threatening, often recurrent pyogenic bacterial infections, including invasive pneumococcal disease. However, these patients were otherwise healthy, with normal resistance to other microbes. Their clinical status improved with age, but not due to any cellular leakiness in MyD88 deficiency. The MyD88-dependent TLRs and IL-1Rs are therefore essential for protective immunity to a small number of pyogenic bacteria, but redundant for host defense to most natural infections."

We report a high lateral ionic conductivity, showing up to eight orders of magnitude enhancement near room temperature, in yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/strontium titanate epitaxial heterostructures. The enhancement of the conductivity is observed, along with a YSZ layer thickness–independent conductance, showing that it is an interface process. We propose that the atomic reconstruction at the interface between highly dissimilar structures (such as fluorite and perovskite) provides both a large number of carriers and a high-mobility plane, yielding colossal values of the ionic conductivity."

Although decomposition rates vary strongly with climate, nitrogen immobilization into litter and its release in mineral forms are mainly controlled by the initial chemical composition of the residues. We used a data set of ∼2800 observations to show that these global nitrogen-release patterns can be explained by fundamental stoichiometric relationships of decomposer activity. We show how litter quality controls the transition from nitrogen accumulation into the litter to release and alters decomposers' respiration patterns. Our results suggest that decomposers lower their carbon-use efficiency to exploit residues with low initial nitrogen concentration, a strategy used broadly by bacteria and consumers across trophic levels."

We describe an air electrode based on a porous material coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), which acts as an O 2 reduction catalyst. Continuous operation for 1500 hours was demonstrated without material degradation or deterioration in performance. O 2 conversion rates were comparable with those of Pt-catalyzed electrodes of the same geometry, and the electrode was not sensitive to CO.

We used diphtheria toxin to kill all mouse postmitotic sensory neurons expressing the sodium channel Na v 1.8. Mice showed normal motor activity and low-threshold mechanical and acute noxious heat responses but did not respond to noxious mechanical pressure or cold. They also showed a loss of enhanced pain responses and spontaneous pain behavior upon treatment with inflammatory insults. In contrast, nerve injury led to heightened pain sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli indistinguishable from that seen with normal littermates. Pain behavior correlates well with central input from sensory neurons measured electrophysiologically in vivo. These data demonstrate that Na v 1.8-expressing neurons are essential for mechanical, cold, and inflammatory pain but not for neuropathic pain or heat sensing."

https://openalex.org/W2105942108,"Partial melting in the Earth's mantle plays an important part in generating the geochemical and isotopic diversity observed in volcanic rocks at the surface. Identifying the composition of these primary melts in the mantle is crucial for establishing links between mantle geochemical 'reservoirs' and fundamental geodynamic processes. Mineral inclusions in natural diamonds have provided a unique window into such deep mantle processes. Here we provide experimental and geochemical evidence that silicate mineral inclusions in diamonds from Juina, Brazil, crystallized from primary and evolved carbonatite melts in the mantle transition zone and deep upper mantle. The incompatible trace element abundances calculated for a melt coexisting with a calcium-titanium-silicate perovskite inclusion indicate deep melting of carbonated oceanic crust, probably at transition-zone depths. Further to perovskite, calcic-majorite garnet inclusions record crystallization in the deep upper mantle from an evolved melt that closely resembles estimates of primitive carbonatite on the basis of volcanic rocks. Small-degree melts of subducted crust can be viewed as agents of chemical mass-transfer in the upper mantle and transition zone, leaving a chemical imprint of ocean crust that can possibly endure for billions of years."

This provides a detailed observational context for change in the three-dimensional structure of atmospheric circulation between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ∼23,000 to 19,000 years ago) and the present. The synthesis reveals evidence for frequent cold polar air incursions, topographically channeled into the northwestern Mediterranean. Anomalously steep vertical temperature gradients in the central Mediterranean imply local convective precipitation. We find the LGM patterns to be analogous, though amplified, to previously reconstructed phases of enhanced meridional winter circulation during the Maunder Minimum (the Little Ice Age)."

https://openalex.org/W2075358898,"Percolation theory is a part of statistical physics that deals with the slow flow of liquid through porous media, and is more generally extended to consider the formation of long-range connectivity in a random system. It has been suggested that this theory might apply to the spread of infectious diseases in certain conditions, but no natural examples have been reported until now. A disease that does behave in this way is plague (Yersinia pestis infection) among great gerbils in Central Asia. The flea dispersal movements carrying plague from one family group of great gerbils to another are small compared to the vast areas of the desert habitat. This equates to a system in which plague percolates through an area only if the landscape is sufficiently filled with family groups of hosts. This paper presents an example of a percolation threshold for infectious disease, namely the plague among great gerbils in Central Asia. The threshold arises from the spatial constraints on flea dispersal movements that carry plague from one family group of great gerbils to another. These movements are small compared to the vast contiguous areas of desert that have been colonized by the great gerbil. The result is a percolation system wherein plague is only able to percolate through the landscape if it is sufficiently 'filled' with family groups of hosts. Percolation theory is most commonly associated with the slow flow of liquid through a porous medium, with applications to the physical sciences1. Epidemiological applications have been anticipated for disease systems where the host is a plant or volume of soil2,3, and hence is fixed in space. However, no natural examples have been reported. The central question of interest in percolation theory4, the possibility of an infinite connected cluster, corresponds in infectious disease to a positive probability of an epidemic. Archived records of plague (infection with Yersinia pestis) in populations of great gerbils (Rhombomys opimus) in Kazakhstan have been used to show that epizootics only occur when more than about 0.33 of the burrow systems built by the host are occupied by family groups5. The underlying mechanism for this abundance threshold is unknown. Here we present evidence that it is a percolation threshold, which arises from the difference in scale between the movements that transport infectious fleas between family groups and the vast size of contiguous landscapes colonized by gerbils. Conventional theory predicts that abundance thresholds for the spread of infectious disease arise when transmission between hosts is density dependent such that the basic reproduction number (R0) increases with abundance, attaining 1 at the threshold. Percolation thresholds, however, are separate, spatially explicit thresholds that indicate long-range connectivity in a system and do not coincide with R0 = 1. Abundance thresholds are the theoretical basis for attempts to manage infectious disease by reducing the abundance of susceptibles, including vaccination and the culling of wildlife6,7,8. This first natural example of a percolation threshold in a disease system invites a re-appraisal of other invasion thresholds, such as those for epidemic viral infections in African lions (Panthera leo), and of other disease systems such as bovine tuberculosis (caused by Mycobacterium bovis) in badgers (Meles meles)."
https://openalex.org/W2098391569,"The transition from naïve to activated T cells is marked by alternative splicing of pre-mRNA encoding the transmembrane phosphatase CD45. Using a short hairpin RNA interference screen, we identified heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein L-like (hnRNPLL) as a critical inducible regulator of CD45 alternative splicing. HnRNPLL was up-regulated in stimulated T cells, bound CD45 transcripts, and was both necessary and sufficient for CD45 alternative splicing. Depletion or overexpression of hnRNPLL in B and T cell lines and primary T cells resulted in reciprocal alteration of CD45RA and RO expression. Exon array analysis suggested that hnRNPLL acts as a global regulator of alternative splicing in activated T cells. Induction of hnRNPLL during hematopoietic cell activation and differentiation may allow cells to rapidly shift their transcriptomes to favor proliferation and inhibit cell death."

Previously, we reported that connexin (Cx) 43 hemichannels in mechanosensing osteocytes mediate the release of prostaglandin, PGE2, a crucial factor for bone formation in response to anabolic loading. We show here that the opening of hemichannels and release of PGE2 by shear stress were significantly inhibited by a potent antibody we developed that specifically blocks Cx43-hemichannels, but not gap junctions or other channels. The opening of hemichannels and release of PGE2 are magnitude-dependent on the level of shear stress. Insertion of a rest period between stress enhances this response. Hemichannels gradually close after 24 h of continuous shear stress corresponding with reduced Cx43 expression on the cell surface, thereby reducing any potential negative effects of channels staying open for extended periods. These data suggest that Cx43-hemichannel activity associated with PGE2 release is adaptively regulated by mechanical loading to provide an effective means of regulating levels of extracellular signaling molecules responsible for initiation of bone (re)modeling.

The skeleton regulates its architecture and mass to meet structural and metabolic needs. To fulfill its structural functions, this complex tissue must adapt to loading and unloading while simultaneously regulating the metabolic demands of the skeleton. Numerous in vivo animal studies show the essential role of mechanical loading for bone formation and remodeling; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms, in particular how bone cells adapt to mechanical stimulation, remain largely uncharacterized. When mechanical forces are applied to bone, several potential stimuli occur including changes in hydrostatic pressure, direct cell strain, fluid flow, and electric potentials. These changes lead to fluid movement through the bone (1Knothe Tate M.L. J. Biomech. 2003; 36: 1409-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 2Zeng Y. Cowin S.C. Weinbaum S. Ann. Biomed.

Pathologie Biologie. 2005; 53: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). More importantly, PGE2 can increase bone mass in mammals when used at the appropriate doses, and bone formation and remodeling caused by mechanical loading are attenuated by inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis (28Jee W.S.

Cell Culture and PGE2 Measurement—MLO-Y4 cells were cultured on collagen-coated (rat tail collagen type I, 0.15 mg/ml) surfaces and were grown in α-modified essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 2.5% BCS and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C as described previously (15Cheng B. Zhao S. Luo J. Sprague E. Bonewald L.F. Jiang J.X. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). After fluid flow treatment at specific time and shear stress levels, the conditioned media were collected, and the extracellular PGE2 released into the media was measured using a PGE2 EIA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Biochemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). Intracellular PGE2 was measured after the cells were thoroughly washed three times with PBS and lysed. PGE2 release after post-stress incubation was determined by subjecting the MLO-Y4 cells to FFSS and then incubating the cells in media at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The medium was collected at the respective time points as indicated and measured using the kit described above. The PGE2 measurement at FFSS (0 h) was then subtracted from the accumulated amount at each time point yielding a net PGE2 measurement. Fluid Flow Shear Stress—FFSS experiments were conducted as previously described (31Prasad A.R. Logan S.A. Nerem R.M. Schwartz C.J. Sprague E.A. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and stress levels of 4, 8, and 16 dynes/cm2 were generated. Controls consist of MLO-Y4 cells not subjected to FFSS. A cell surface area of 5 cm2 was used for dye uptake, and 90 cm2 was used for PGE2 measurement and for the biotinylation assay. During post-stress chase experiments, the cells were maintained in α-MEM at 37 °C. Dye Uptake Assay—MLO-Y4 cells were grown at low initial density to ensure that the majority of the cells were not physically in contact. After treatment, dye uptake experiments were conducted in the presence of 0.2% Lucifer yellow (LY) or 0.2% Alexa 594 along with 0.2% rhodamine dextran (RD) for 5 min, and cells were rinsed and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. LY and Alexa 594 were used as a tracer for hemichannel activity, and RD was used as a negative control. Similar fields were observed under the fluorescence microscope. Approximately 7 images per slide per treatment group were collected. From the phase images, the total number of cells was counted up to 300 cells. The number of fluorescent cells was then counted from the corresponding fluorescent images. Dye uptake is presented as the number of fluorescent cells divided by the total number of cells and normalized to 1 for control. Immunofluorescence Labeling and Fluorescence Microscopy—The cells cultured on the microscopic slides were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated in blocking solution (2% normal goat serum, 2% fish skin gelatin, and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) in the absence or presence of 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and then overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified antibodies against Cx43(E2), Cx43(CT), preimmune (1:300 dilutions), or anti-Cx43 antibody pre-absorbed with antigen Cx43 (E2) fusion protein (0.6 mg/ml) in blocking solution. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300 dilution) in blocking solution. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus B-MAX microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and recorded on a “Spot II” digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). For dye uptake, LY was detected using the filter set for fluorescein at excitation wavelengths of 505–525 nm, and Alexa 594 and RD by using the filter set for rhodamine with a corresponding excitation wavelength of 560 nm. Mean fluorescence intensity was acquired by taking representative fluorescence images from various regions of each microscope slide. Using Image J program (Image J Software, NIH) the threshold was adjusted to clearly distinguish fluorescent cells from non-fluorescent cells. Threshold conditions were kept constant for each experimental condition. The program measured the intensity of the signal coming from all fluorescent cells in the field; the output is given as mean fluorescent intensity. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Biotinylation of MLO-Y4 cells was performed based on a modification of previously published procedures (25Cherian P.P. Siller-Jackson A.J. Gu S. Wang X. Bonewald L.F.

These cells were labeled with or without 1 mg/ml EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce Biotechnology) in PBS at 4 °C for 20 min. The cells were washed with PBS containing Ca2+, Mg2+, and glycine and lysed in lysis buffer (133 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1% dextrose, and 20 mm HEPES) plus 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were mixed with monomeric avidin beads and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed with PBS, and biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in sample loading buffer containing 1% SDS and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and proportional amounts of sample prior to and after avidin bead elution were loaded on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting by using affinity-purified anti-Cx43 antibody. The intensity of Cx43 bands was quantified by densitometry (NIH Image J). Generation of Cx43(E2) Antibody and Use in Blocking Experiments—An antibody (Cx43(E2)) against the second extracellular loop region, E2, of Cx43 between amino acid residues 185 and 206 was generated. Initially, the corresponding cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR, subcloned into pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences), sequenced, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and was used to generate antiserum in rabbits (Pocono Rabbit Farm & Laboratory, Canadensis, PA). Both preimmune sera and anti-Cx43 were collected from the same rabbit. Cx43(E2) was affinity-purified using a GST column, followed by a Cx43(E2) fusion protein-conjugated column with sequential washing with PBS followed by elution buffer containing 0.1 m glycine at pH 2.5. MLO-Y4 cells were incubated with affinity-purified anti-Cx43(E2) (28 μg/ml), anti-Cx43 C-terminal domain(CT) (30 μg/ml), anti-Cx43(E2) antibody pre-absorbed with antigen Cx43 (E2) fusion protein (0.6 mg/ml), or preimmune antibodies for 30 min prior to FFSS at 16 dynes/cm2 for 30 min. Dye uptake experiments were conducted as described above. Scrape-loading Dye Transfer Assay for Gap Junction-mediated Intercellular Communication—The scrape-loading dye transfer was based on a published protocol (33El-Fouly M.H. Trosko J.E. Chang C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scratched in the presence of two types of fluorescence dyes: RD (Mr ∼ 10,000) and LY (Mr ∼ 457). RD is too big to pass through gap junction channels and therefore serves as a tracer molecule for the cells originally receiving dyes. MLO-Y4 cells were treated in the absence or presence of 28, 56, and 100 μg/ml of anti-Cx43(E2) antibody for 4 h, and then 1% RD and 1% LY were applied to the cells after scratching lightly with a surgical blade. After incubation for 5 min, cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution three times and finally fixed in freshly made 2% paraformaldehyde (from 16% stock) for 30 min. The dye transfer results were examined with an Olympus fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan), and the degree of dye transfer was calculated based on the percentage of cells transferring LY dye. Isolation of Chick Primary Osteocytes—Preparation of primary osteocytes from chick calvaria was based on previously published procedures (34Tanaka K. Yamaguchi Y. Hakeda Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 13: 61-70Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, calvarial bone was dissected from 16-day embryonic chicks and minced into small pieces. The soft tissues and osteoid were removed by collagenase treatment followed by decalcification using EDTA. The final particles were treated with collagenase and vigorously agitated to release osteocytes. The larger sized osteoblast/fibroblast cells were separated from osteocytes by incubating the cells with collagen-coated culture plates for 10 min, of which osteoblast/fibroblast were attached to the plates. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test along with a biostatistics program (Prism). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of multiple measurements. Asterisks represent the degree of significance compared with control (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005; ***, p < 0.001). Some of the data presented were normalized to controls for easy comparison, and the variables were analyzed as described above. Hemichannels Are Dynamic and Finely Regulated by Mechanical Loading—We quantitated hemichannel activity with increasing magnitudes of FFSS. The opening of hemichannels, as detected by LY (Mr ∼ 457) dye uptake, was directly proportional to the magnitude of FFSS applied (Fig. 1, A and B). Similar dye uptake results were obtained when these experiments were repeated with a larger probe, Alexa 594 (Mr ∼ 760) (Fig. 1C), showing that hemichannel function was not limited by either the properties or the smaller size of LY. The lack of RD uptake (Mr ∼10,000), a dye too big to pass through hemichannels, excludes the possibility of membrane leakage or the cells being unhealthy. In addition, a close correlation between hemichannel opening with increasing FFSS and increased release of PGE2 was also observed (Fig. 1D). To determine the effect of different types of FFSS on hemichannel function, steady (16 dynes/cm2) and pulsatile (8 ± 8 dynes/cm2) flow were applied (Fig. 1E). As compared with non-treated controls, both steady and pulsatile FFSS treatment showed a similar increase in hemichannel opening. There was no significant difference in hemichannel opening between these two different flow types. Together, these results suggest that hemichannel opening, associated with the release of PGE2, is directly correlated to the magnitude of FFSS applied. To determine the function of hemichannels after FFSS, we assessed hemichannel opening at various incubation periods after exposure to FFSS (Fig. 2). For all post-shear stress incubation periods (0–8 h), except 24 h, a similar number of cells took up the LY dye (Fig. 2A). Although the relative number of cells taking up the dye was significantly increased over control, there was no significant difference in dye uptake between 0 and 8 h after FFSS. At 24 h, however, the number of cells taking up dye returned to control levels. To assess the relative level of functional hemichannels in individual cells after FFSS, the intensity of fluorescence signals was measured (Fig. 2B). The levels of dye uptake reached a maximum immediately following FFSS (0 h) and gradually decreased over time (0.5–8 h), but was still elevated at significant levels compared with control and eventually returned to control levels after 24 h. These results suggest that up to 8 h after FFSS, even though the total number of cells that have functional hemichannels remains the same, the number of open hemichannels in individual cells gradually declines. The release of PGE2 appeared to be closely associated with hemichannel function (Fig. 2C). This decrease in hemichannel function could be caused by either the gradual closure of hemichannels or/and decreased expression of Cx43 protein and therefore decreased numbers of hemichannels on the cell surface. To distinguish between these possibilities, Cx43 protein exposed on the cell surface was determined using a biotinylation assay (Fig. 2D). A significant increase in Cx43 protein on the cells surface was not observed until 2-h post-shear stress, which returned to control levels by 24-h post-shear stress. The results shown in Fig. 2 suggest that there is little direct correlation between Cx43 expression with either number of LY+ cells uptaking dye (Fig. 2A) or with dye intensity (Fig. 2B), not with PGE2 release (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that decreased function of hemichannels up to 8 h after post-stress is primarily caused by a decrease in numbers of open hemichannels. However at 24 h, hemichannel closure does appear to correspond to the decreased cell surface expression of Cx43. Reduced expression of Cx43 may be partially responsible for the 24-h response. To determine if response to reloading would affect hemichannel function, FFSS (16 dynes/cm2 for 30 min) was applied to MLO-Y4 cells after 0.5, 4, and 24 h incubation after FFSS. The reapplication of 30 min of FFSS significantly re-stimulated the function of hemichannels as detected by dye uptake in osteocytes that showed modest (0.5 and 4 h) or significant (24 h) reduction in dye uptake with post-FFSS incubation (Fig. 3A). Although the effects of re-applying FFSS are similar and significant in cells from each of the post-stress periods, they are more dramatic after the longer post-FFSS incubation periods, i.e. after the hemichannels have had longer time to recover (Fig. 3, 24 h (–) versus 24h(+)). However, reapplication of FFSS results in a similar level of response regardless of length of the post-FFSS period. To investigate how hemichannels respond to sustained mechanical stimulation, MLO-Y4 cells were subjected to continuous FFSS for various time periods. As shown in Fig. 1, low shear stress resulted in lower dye uptake than that from high stress (Fig. 1B), but still above control levels. We subjected MLO-Y4 cells to FFSS at 4 dynes/cm2 to ensure cell attachment during the 24 h of treatment. Compared with control, FFSS increased dye uptake significantly at 0.5 and 2 h of FFSS (Fig. 3B). However, the induction of hemichannel opening by FFSS decreased with longer periods of shear stress (4, 8, and 24 h). The surface expression of Cx43 in response to continuous FFSS was examined by cell surface biotinylation (Fig. 3C). Biotinylated Cx43 protein increased at a significantly in response to continuous FFSS at 2 and 4 h of FFSS, but decreased to the control level at 24 h. (No biotinylation was detected for intracellular β-actin, therefore. the possibility of potential biotinylation of intracellular Cx43 is unlikely.) Similar to the biotinylation results shown in Fig. 2D, the pattern of cell surface-expressed Cx43 in response to continuous FFSS does not exactly correlate with hemichannel activity, further suggesting that the opening of hemichannels is not solely regulated by the level of Cx43 protein expressed on the cell surface. Together, the data suggest re-application of FFSS to previously stressed osteocytes leads to the re-activation of hemichannels as early as 30 min after the first round of FFSS stimulation. However, hemichannels appear to become less responsive to continuous FFSS and close over time in response to extended application of continuous shear stress. Similar to the post-stress experiments shown in Fig. 2, an increase in both cell surface protein expression and dye uptake occurs up to 4 h of continuous FFSS, but after 24 h, the decrease of dye uptake appears to correlate with a return to control levels of cell surface expression of Cx43, These results support the concept that a hemichannel gating mechanism is likely to be involved during the shorter periods of continuous FFSS, but reduced levels of cell surface-expressed Cx43 may be partially responsible for the decreased activity of hemichannels after 24 h of continuous FFSS. Cx43-forming Hemichannels Play a Major Role in Regulating Osteocyte Response to FFSS—Clarification of the functional role(s) played by Cx43 hemichannels compared with gap junctions and other channels would be greatly advanced with specific blocking reagents for Cx43 hemichannels. Therefore, we generated a specific Cx43-hemichannel blocking antibody that targets the second extracellular loop (E2) of Cx43 (Fig. 4A). The generation of this antibody was not trivial as extracellular domains of connexins are highly conserved among different types of connexins from various species. This antibody (Cx43(E2)) recognizes Cx43, whereas no reactivity was observed using the preimmune antibody negative control (Fig. 4B). At the same dilution, the binding signal appeared to be even stronger than antibody against the C-terminal tail of Cx43 (Cx43(CT)), generated previously using a similar approach (35He D.S. Jiang J.X. Taffet S.M. Burt J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6495-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Preincubating this antibody with its antigen, a GST fusion protein with the Cx43 E2 domain, but not GST protein alone, totally abolished this reactivity with Cx43 (Fig. 4C). This antibody failed to detect other connexins including Cx32, Cx26, Cx50, and Cx46 (data not shown). Immunostaining shows that in the presence of Triton X-100 (TX100) (Fig. 4D, panels D and F), comparable fluorescence signals are observed with Cx43(E2) antibody compared with that of Cx43(CT) antibody. While in the absence of detergent (panels C and E), only the labeling of Cx43(E2) antibody was observed, but no labeling for Cx43(CT) antibody, suggesting that the Cx43(E2) antibody recognizes the extracellular domain of Cx43 (Fig. 4D). The specificity of the Cx43(E2) antibody was further confirmed by preimmune and Cx43(E2) antibody pre-absorbed with antigen (Fig. 4D, panels A and B), where no specific signals were detected. Our previous preliminary study shows that gap junction activity appears not to be affected by this Cx43(E2) antibody (25Cherian P.P. Siller-Jackson A.J. Gu S. Wang X. Bonewald L.F. Sprague E. Jiang J.X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3100-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We showed here that gap junction function detected by scrape-loading dye transfer was not affected by increased concentrations of Cx43(E2) antibody (Fig. 4E). Cx43(E2) antibody significantly inhibited dye uptake induced by FFSS, but not by antibody against the cytosolic C-terminal domain of Cx43(CT) and preimmune antibody (Fig. 5A). In contrast, preincubating with antigen removed the capacity of Cx43(E2) antibody to block dye uptake induced by FFSS (Fig. 5B), further confirming the specificity of this antibody for hemichannels. Similar to MLO-Y4 cells, FFSS-induced dye uptake in primary osteocytes was significantly blocked by Cx43(E2) antibody, but not by preimmune antibody (Fig. 5C), showing that the MLO-Y4 cells function similarly to primary bone osteocytes. We have tested the specificity of this antibody in blocking hemichannnels, but not other membrane pores of similar sizes such as ATP-gated P2X7-associated pannexin channels (36Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). P2X7 channels were reported to be involved in bone cell response to mechanical stimulation (37Li J. Liu D.

The heme-binding NEAT domains of Isd proteins IsdA, IsdB (domain 2), IsdC, and HarA/IsdH (domain 3), and the heme-binding IsdE protein, were overexpressed and purified in apo (heme-free) form. Absorption and magnetic circular dichroism spectral data, together with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry were used to unambiguously identify that heme transfers from NEAT-A through NEAT-C to IsdE. Heme transfer was demonstrated to occur in a unidirectional fashion in the sequence NEAT-B2 → NEAT-A → NEAT-C → IsdE or, alternatively, initiating from NEAT-H3 instead of NEAT-B2: NEAT-H3 → NEAT-A → NEAT-C → IsdE. Under the conditions of our experiments, only NEAT-H3 and NEAT-B2 could transfer bidirectionally, which is in the reverse direction as well, and only with each other. Whereas apo-IsdE readily accepted heme from holo-NEAT-C, it would not accept heme from holo-NEAT-A. Heme transfer to IsdE requires the presence of holo-NEAT-C, in agreement with the proposal that IsdC serves as the central conduit of the heme transfer pathway. These experimental findings corroborate the heme transfer model first proposed by the Schneewind group.

Staphylococcus aureus is widely known as an important human pathogen that causes a range of infections and diseases from minor, such as impetigo and abscesses, to life-threatening, such as pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, and septicemia (1Gordon R.J. Lowy F.D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2008; 46: S350-S359Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The emergence of resistant bacteria has taken place over several decades and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) are particularly clinically challenging, often accompanied by limited treatment options (2McGowan Jr., J.E. Tenover F.C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MRSA, initially limited to hospitals, has since spread to the community (CA-MRSA). Adding to the complexity is our incomplete understanding of mechanisms of drug resistance. Iron is an essential nutrient for the majority of living organisms. Although the human body contains abundant iron, its low solubility in the ferric state of aerobic systems and the fact that the majority is intracellular means that very little soluble iron (estimated as ∼10–9 m) is directly available to bacteria. As such, bacteria have developed multiple iron acquisition systems to facilitate their survival in such low iron environments. The most abundant potential iron source for bacteria is heme, or iron-protoporphyrin IX, which is typically bound in proteins such as hemoglobin and myoglobin. Pathogenic bacteria have evolved specialized mechanisms for acquiring heme-iron from the host (for recent reviews, see Refs. 3Genco C.A. Dixon D.W. Mol.

In recent years, there has been a significant amount of research into defining the Isd-mediated heme acquisition system, especially in S. aureus. Briefly, the Isd system in S. aureus consists of nine iron-regulated proteins: IsdA, IsdB, IsdC, and IsdH/HarA, which are cell wall-anchored surface proteins, and IsdDEF, which constitute a membrane-localized transporter, and, finally, IsdG and IsdI, which encode heme-degrading enzymes in the cytoplasm (12Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 436-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). IsdA is highly expressed on the cell wall of iron-limited S. aureus and, in addition to several other reported functions (13Clarke S.R. Foster S.J. Infect.

IsdE, a lipoprotein and a member of the bi-lobed, α-helical backbone family of substrate-binding proteins, binds heme into a shallow groove between the two lobes of the protein, using His and Met to coordinate to the heme-iron (22Grigg J.C.

Conversely, proteins IsdA, IsdB, IsdC, and IsdH/HarA each contain at least one so-called Near Transporter (NEAT) domain that adopt a β-sandwich structure to bind one heme into a groove with heme-iron coordination via Tyr (17Grigg J.C.

Together, the series of Isd proteins in S. aureus are believed to interact with heme proteins, extract the heme molecule, and transport it across the cell wall through to the membrane where it is then translocated into the cytoplasm (for a recent review, please refer to Ref. 11Reniere M.L.

Extending the power of these two tools, we now demonstrate, for the first time, direct evidence for an ordered, multiprotein, heme transfer system between the Gram-positive bacterial surface Isd proteins. Key to these experiments is that the MCD signal intensity is a fingerprint of the oxidation state, spin state, and ligation state of the heme-iron and that the ESI-MS technique indicates possible changes in folding as a function of heme binding. For mixtures, the ESI-MS data show all components in their relative fractions, so in total in heme exchange reactions, heme binding between the very similar NEAT-containing Isd proteins and the IsdE protein can all be clearly identified, thus providing unambiguous information on the heme transfer. Gene Cloning—DNA encoding residues 62–184 of IsdA, residues 337–462 of IsdB, residues 28–150 of IsdC, residues 539–658 of IsdH/HarA, and residues 32–292 of IsdE were PCR-amplified from S. aureus RN6390 chromosome and cloned into pET28(+) in such a way as to incorporate N-terminal His6 tags. DNA encoded His-tagged protein was digested out of pET28a(+) and cloned into pBAD30 (31Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar) before being introduced into Escherichiacoli RP523, a hemB mutant (32Li J.M. Umanoff H. Proenca R. Russell C.S. Cosloy S.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Over the course of the study, two different cloning methods were used to generate each of His-tagged IsdB-NEAT-domain 2 and IsdH-NEAT-domain 3, resulting in a slight difference in amino acid composition in the His tag region of recombinant protein (i.e. non-Isd protein sequence) even after thrombin cleavage. The sensitivity of MS illustrates these differences in mass. Construct 1 of each of the two proteins was used in Figs. 1 and 5, and construct 2 was used in Figs. 8 and 9. There was no change in heme binding properties between the two constructs.FIGURE 5Mass spectral data for solution of mixed proteins showing heme transfer from the Isd holo-NEAT domains (A, B2, and H3) to apo-NEAT-C. A, charge state and deconvoluted mass spectra measured for a mixture of heme-containing, Isd holo-NEAT-A, and apo-NEAT-C. Excess heme-free, apo-NEAT-C was added. Three species coexist in solution and are identified in the charge state spectra with the abbreviations for apo-NEAT-C (a-C; with a mass of 14,442), apo-NEAT-A (a-A; with a mass of 14,626), and holo-NEAT-C (h-C; with a mass of 15,059). B, charge state and deconvoluted mass spectra measured for a mixture of heme-containing, Isd holo-NEAT-B2, and apo-NEAT-C. Excess heme-free, apo-NEAT-C was added. Three species coexist in solution and are identified in the charge state spectra with the abbreviations for apo-NEAT-B2 (a-B2; with a mass of 14,345), apo-NEAT-C (a-C; with a mass of 14,444), and holo-NEAT-C (h-C; with a mass of 15,060). C, charge state and deconvoluted mass spectra measured for a mixture of heme-containing, Isd holo-NEAT-H3 and apo-NEAT-C. Excess heme-free, apo-NEAT-C was added. Three species coexist in solution and are identified in the charge state spectra with the abbreviations for apo-NEAT-H3 (a-H3; with a mass of 14,640), apo-NEAT-C (a-C; with a mass of 14,444), and holo-NEAT-C (h-C; with a mass of 15,060). In each case, heme transfer to Isd NEAT-C was observed, resulting in a mixture of the heme-free-Isd-NEAT domain of NEAT-A, NEAT-B2, NEAT-H3) and heme-free apo-NEAT-C and heme-bound-holo-NEAT-C. No heme-bound-holo-NEAT-A (at 15,245 Da), NEAT-B2 (at 14,960 Da), or NEAT-H3 (at 15,256 Da) was observed in their respective mass spectra following mixing with apo-NEAT-C. The difference in relative %-abundances of the proteins depends on the relative efficiencies of the charged proteins reaching the detector in competition with the other ions. Closely similar ratios of protein were used in each of the spectral data shown here. In each case, excess (∼1.5×) of the heme-acceptor protein was used, so that there was also apo-heme-free protein remaining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 8Heme transfer from holo-NEAT-B2 and holo-NEAT-H3 to apo-IsdE. Charge state and deconvoluted mass spectra and absorption spectra measured for mixtures of A holo-NEAT-B2 with apo-IsdE as a heme acceptor and B holo-NEAT-H3 with apo-IsdE as a heme acceptor. In A, the data show that holo-NEAT-B2 transfers heme to apo-IsdE. In each mass spectrum are peaks that correspond to both the holo-and apo-proteins: peaks that correspond to apo-IsdE (+11 to +13) at 30,218 Da, peaks that correspond to holo-IsdE (+11 to +13) at 30,832 Da and peaks that correspond to apo-NEAT-B2 (+7 to +8) at 15,272 Da. The absorption spectra represent the holo-NEAT-B2 before the addition of IsdE (indicated by the arrow from the legend holo-NEAT-B2) and following mixing with IsdE for 25 min (indicated by the arrows from the legend after mixing with apo-IsdE). The holo-NEAT-B2 was formed by binding heme to heme-free, apo-NEAT-B2 (construct 2), which was made using a different cloning strategy than that used to make NEAT-B2 which was used for the data in Figs. 1, 2, and 5. Residues in the His tag region (non-Isd) differ between the two constructs (see “Experimental Procedures”). The experimental results were unchanged by the use of the second construct. In B, the data show that holo-NEAT-H3 transfers heme to apo-IsdE. In each mass spectrum are peaks that correspond to both the holo-and apo-proteins: peaks that correspond to apo-IsdE (+11 to +13) at 30,250 Da, peaks that correspond to holo-IsdE (+11 to +13) at 30,865 Da and peaks that correspond to apo-NEAT-H3 (+7 to +8) at 14,156 Da.

The apo-NEAT-H3 (construct 2) was made using a different cloning procedure than that used for the NEAT-H3 which was used to generate the data shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 5. Residues in the His tag region (non-Isd) were altered between the two constructs (see “Experimental Procedures”). The experimental results were unchanged by the use of the second construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 9Heme transfer from holo-NEAT-B2 to apo-NEAT-A, and holo-NEAT-H3 to apo-NEAT-A and NEAT-B2.

After overnight incubation, cells were harvested and resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). Cells were then ruptured in a French pressure cell, and cell lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h to remove insoluble material. Proteins were purified using a 1-ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) and anÄKTA FPLC system with an elution buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole. Proteins were then desalted using a 5-ml HiTrap Desalting column (GE Healthcare). The His6 tags were removed by incubation with thrombin (10 units/mg protein; GE Healthcare) at room temperature for 16 h and run through a HisTrap column for final purification. Hemin (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO for estimation of solution concentrations. Hemin concentrations in DMSO were calculated using the extinction coefficients 10.74 mm–1 cm–1 at 501 nm, and 6.23 mm–1 cm–1 at 624 nm. These values were determined using the pyridine hemochrome test as a reference, using ϵ526 = 16.99 mm–1 cm–1 and ϵ526 = 16.99 mm–1 cm–1 for pyridine hemochrome (33Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated using the extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 15.48 mm–1 cm–1 for myoglobin, 15.93 mm–1 cm–1 for NEAT-A and for NEAT-C, and 14.65 mm–1 cm–1 NEAT-B2, 18.49 mm–1 cm–1 for NEAT-H3. Because of the lack of tryptophan residues in IsdE, mass spectrometry was used to estimate protein concentrations using a NEAT domain sample as reference point. Protein samples in 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer were incubated with 1.5× molar excess hemin dissolved in DMSO. Samples were then concentrated to ∼100 μm and purified using G-25 size exclusion chromatography. Mass spectra of collected samples were run to ensure that free heme was effectively removed. Magnetic Circular Dichroism Measurements—Protein solutions were prepared in a 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer at pH 7.4. Measurements at room temperature were made in 1-cm cuvettes at 5.5 T in an Oxford Instruments SM2 superconducting magnet, aligned in a Jasco J810 CD instrument. Peak absorbance was always below 0.8 near 400 nm. Absorption measurements were made using the Cary 500 (Varian, Canada). All solutions were measured in the Cary 500 before and after being measured in the MCD spectrometer. No changes were observed. ESI-MS Measurements—A Micromass LC-T instrument was used with sample infusion through a microliter pump. The mass spectrometer settings were: capillary +3,300 V, sample cone: 75–100 V, desolvation temperature: 20 °C, source temperature: 80 °C. Samples were infused at rates of ∼10 μl/min. Averaging was carried out for several minutes. Max Ent 1 (Micromass) software was used to calculate the deconvoluted parent spectrum. ESI-MS Sample Preparation—Stock protein solutions in phosphate-buffered saline were concentrated using centrifuge concentration tubes (Millipore) to ∼100 μm. Buffer exchange to 20 mm ammonium formate (pH 7.3) was performed using G-25 size exclusion chromatography. Heme Transfer Reactions—To monitor heme transfer between the two NEAT domains (NEAT-A and NEAT-C) and IsdE, the protein samples were mixed with an approximate 1.5× excess of the appropriate heme acceptor protein. The mixing times were varied from 10 min to 2 h. In all cases, the spectra remained the same. ESI-MS as a Method to Discriminate Apo from Holo Isd Proteins—The heme-binding NEAT domains from IsdA (NEAT-A), IsdB (NEAT-B2), IsdC (NEAT-C), and HarA or IsdH (NEAT-H3), as well as IsdE were overexpressed in apo-form and purified. Holo-proteins were prepared by reconstitution of apo-proteins with hemin. The proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry to confirm that each was heme-free (apo) or homogeneously heme-bound (holo), and to establish the number of heme molecules bound to each protein. The mass spectral data are shown as the charge states in Fig. 1 with the deconvoluted spectra in Fig. 2. Charge states in ESI-MS provide an indication of the volume of the protein or solvent access to the protein basic amino acid residues (28Pluym M. Vermeiren C.L. Mack J. Heinrichs D.E. Stillman M.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12777-12787Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, the lack of changes in charge state distribution between the apo- and holo-species for NEAT-B2, and NEAT-C, in addition to the data previously published for IsdE (28Pluym M. Vermeiren C.L. Mack J. Heinrichs D.E. Stillman M.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12777-12787Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), indicates that no significant structural changes take place with heme binding in any of these proteins. The ESI-MS data in Fig. 1B, see Fig. 1A, indicate that there is a very slight change in conformation of NEAT-A upon heme binding, because the charge state maximum increases to +8 from +7, suggesting solvent exposure of one additional basic residue when the heme binds. Similarly, we note the change in the relative magnitude of the +9 and +8 charge states in Fig. 1G (see Fig. 1H for apo- and holo-NEAT-H3), respectively; again, the implication is that there are conformational changes upon binding the heme in holo-NEAT-H3, which, in this case, cause a reduction of solvent exposure. Compared with changes that take place following acid-induced denaturation of, for example, IsdE (28Pluym M. Vermeiren C.L. Mack J. Heinrichs D.E. Stillman M.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12777-12787Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the changes in conformation of NEAT-A and NEAT-H3 with heme binding are small, but real, and for NEAT-A in agreement with the published crystal structures of the holo versus apo forms of the protein (17Grigg J.C. Vermeiren C.L. Heinrichs D.E. Murphy M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Following heme loading, mass spectrometry was used again to confirm that the holo-proteins were formed (Fig. 2, A–J). The mass spectral data provide important evidence that the holo-proteins were the only source of heme in the transfer reactions because of the lack of a mass near 616 Da (data not shown). This is an important test, as we have observed that absorption spectroscopy is not a reliable technique to ensure the complete uptake and hence removal of free heme from a solution. The Soret band of free heme can appear as a blue-shifted shoulder on the Soret band of bound-heme and may be confused with its vibronic band, yielding complications in assessing heme transfer reactions spectroscopically. Moreover, because each of the heme-binding Isd NEAT domains possess heme-binding characteristics that result in similar optical properties, quantifying heme transfer proves very difficult. Table 1 summarizes the UV-visible absorption band maxima for each of the heme-binding NEAT domains and IsdE. Given that the absorption spectroscopic properties of the hemes bound in IsdA, IsdB NEAT domain 2, IsdC, and IsdH NEAT domain 3 are all very similar, monitoring NEAT domain heme transfer reactions solely via absorption spectroscopy is, therefore, ambiguous and likely to be imprecise as the spectral envelopes of the reactants and products significantly overlap.TABLE 1Absorption spectra properties for the heme-bound NEAT domains of IsdA, IsdB-domain2, IsdC, and IsdH-domain 3, and IsdEProteinSoret λmaxVisible region λmaxRef.nmnmNEAT-A406502,535,628(27Pluym M.

FKBP38 (immunophilin FK506-binding protein, 38 kDa), was recently reported to exert a negative effect on mTORC1 function that is relieved by its binding to Rheb·GTP. We confirm that Rheb binds wild type FKBP38, but inactive Rheb mutants showed contrasting abilities to bind FKBP38. We were unable to observe any regulation of FKBP38/mTOR binding by amino acids or insulin. Furthermore, FKBP38 did not inhibit mTORC1 signaling. The translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) in Drosophila was recently reported to act as the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for Rheb. We have studied the role of TCTP in mammalian TORC1 signaling and its control by amino acids. Reducing TCTP levels did not reproducibly affect mTORC1 signaling in amino acid-replete/insulin-stimulated cells. Moreover, overexpressing TCTP did not rescue mTORC1 signaling in amino acid-starved cells. In addition, we were unable to see any stable interaction between TCTP and Rheb or mTORC1. Accumulation of uncharged tRNA has been previously proposed to be involved in the inhibition of mTORC1 signaling during amino acid starvation. To test this hypothesis, we used a Chinese hamster ovary cell line containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in leucyl-tRNA synthetase. Leucine deprivation markedly inhibited mTORC1 signaling in these cells, but shifting the cells to the nonpermissive temperature for the synthetase did not. These data indicate that uncharged tRNALeu does not switch off mTORC1 signaling and suggest that mTORC1 is controlled by a distinct pathway that senses the availability of amino acids.

Thus, the phosphorylation of S6 requires both amino acids and insulin and is blocked by rapamycin, whereas in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation of Thr-37/46 is induced by amino acids alone and is largely insensitive to rapamycin (6Wang X.

Nonetheless, extensive data suggest that mTORC1 mediates the phosphorylation of Thr-37/46 in 4E-BP, because this is impaired by inhibitors of the kinase activity of mTOR (other than rapamycin), by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2), a negative regulator of Rheb and mTORC1, and by decreasing the cellular levels of mTOR or the mTORC1 component raptor (6Wang X.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4786-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A very recent study reported that FKBP38 interacted with mTOR and could inhibit its function, both in vitro and in cells (24Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). FKBP38 was also reported to bind to Rheb, such that Rheb·GTP induced the release of FKBP38 from mTOR. This would provide a mechanism by which Rheb·GTP could activate mTORC1 signaling (Fig. 1B). It is not clear from the available data whether FKBP38 is involved in the regulation of mTORC1 by amino acids (24Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).TCTP (also termed “P23”) is a growth-related and anti-apoptotic protein. Extensive studies have led to numerous functions being ascribed to it (25Bommer U.A. Thiele B.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). We have previously established its microtubule binding/stabilizing activity (26Gachet Y. Tournier S. Lee M. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Poulton T. Bommer U.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1257-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Knocking out TCTP results in embryonic lethality highlighting its importance in early development (27Chen S.H. Wu P.S. Chou C.H.

Cell. 2007; 18: 2525-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Recent genetic studies in Drosophila implicated Drosophila TCTP (dTCTP) in the control of the dTOR pathway, which controls cell growth and cell number (28Hsu Y.C. Chern J.J. Cai Y. Liu M. Choi K.W. Nature. 2007; 445: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, dTCTP was required for phosphorylation of dS6K. Biochemical evidence suggested that dTCTP acts as a GEF for Rheb (28Hsu Y.C. Chern J.J. Cai Y. Liu M. Choi K.W. Nature. 2007; 445: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Indeed, Drosophila and human TCTP were shown to mediate GDP/GTP exchange on the corresponding Rheb proteins in vitro (28Hsu Y.C. Chern J.J. Cai Y. Liu M. Choi K.W. Nature. 2007; 445: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The proposed role of TCTP is depicted in Fig. 1A.The fact that starving cells for amino acids (especially leucine) leads to inhibition of mTORC1 signaling has led to the suggestion that uncharged tRNA, generated because of insufficiency of amino acids, might act as a proximal negative regulator of mTORC1 (29Iiboshi Y. Papst P.J. Kawasome H. Hosoi H. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1092-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In yeast it is well established that uncharged tRNA activates the protein kinase Gcn2p, which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 on its α-subunit, leading to inhibition of general protein synthesis (reviewed in Ref.30Proud C.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain an ortholog of Gcn2p (mGcn2) (31Berlanga J.J. Santoyo J. de Haro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 32Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus formally possible that activated mGcn2 can negatively regulate mTORC1 signaling, perhaps by phosphorylating mTORC1 or a regulator of this complex. These proposed tRNA-mediated regulatory inputs to mTORC1 are summarized in Fig. 1C. Given the high level of interest in mTORC1 signaling, it was important to assess the roles of these proposed regulators of mammalian TORC1 signaling, including their possible importance for the control of this protein kinase by amino acids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Biochemicals—Chemicals and biochemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated.

Amino acid-free serum was prepared by dialysis against cold phosphate-buffered saline.

Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) proposed that FKBP38 acts as a negative regulator of mTORC1 by binding to mTOR. That report also suggested that Rheb·GTP bound to FKBP38, releasing the latter protein from mTOR and thereby eliciting the activation of mTORC1. We began our study by testing whether FKBP38 can indeed interact with Rheb. As the available antisera for FKBP38 and Rheb fail to detect the endogenous proteins (data not shown), we transfected HEK293 cells with vectors encoding HA-FKBP38 and FLAG-Rheb and then immunoprecipitated each protein separately using the antibody for the corresponding epitope. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2A, HA-FKBP38 and FLAG-Rheb did co-immunoprecipitate, confirming a mutual interaction (but not proving that it is direct). To explore further the interaction between FKBP38 and Rheb, we made use of two different types of mutant, which have been shown to be unable to activate mTORC1 signaling.FIGURE 2Wild type Rheb, but not the inactive C181S mutant, binds FKBP38 in a constitutive manner. A, HEK293 cells were transfected with vectors encoding FLAG-tagged Rheb or its C181S mutant and HA-tagged FKBP38. Cells were starved of serum overnight and, where indicated, treated with insulin (100 nm, 30 min). Cells were then lysed, and samples were either subjected to direct Western blot analysis (top section; using anti-FLAG) or to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA prior to SDS-PAGE/Western blot with anti-FLAG (middle section) and anti-HA (bottom section). Samples of cell lysate were analyzed in parallel in the middle and bottom sections. In the top section, the arrows indicate the slower migrating (nonfarnesylated) and faster migrating (farnesylated) forms of Rheb. B. HEK293 cells were transfected with vectors for wild type Rheb, the C181S mutant, or the empty vector. Twenty four hours later, cells were starved overnight for serum and, where shown (–), of amino acids for 60 min. Where indicated, cells were treated with insulin (100 nm for a further 30 min). Samples of cell lysate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using the indicated antisera. n.s. denotes a nonspecific band detected by anti-FLAG. The differentially phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 are indicated (α-γ). C, as A, but using wild type Rheb and the S20N mutant.E.V., empty vector. D, cells were transfected (with vectors for HA-FKBP38 and also FLAG-Rheb where indicated) and treated as in B.

Rebhun J.F. Clark G.J. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32493-32496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar)). Mutation of the Cys residue to Ser (C181S mutant) prevents farnesylation (as is evidenced by altered mobility shown in Fig. 2A) and results in drastically reduced GTP loading (see e.g. Ref. 40Li Y. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7965-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The C181S mutant is also defective in restoring mTORC1 signaling (phosphorylation of Ser-65 in 4E-BP1 or Ser-240/244 in S6) in amino acid-starved cells (Fig. 2B; consistent with earlier data (39Castro A.F.

(Note that 4E-BP1 runs as three distinct bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B) termed α-γ in order of increasing phosphorylation.) The C181S mutant is also incapable of binding to FKBP38 (Fig. 2A).Mutation of the final Met of Rheb to Leu should create a site for a different lipid modification, geranylgeranylation, which might substitute for farnesylation. We therefore created and tested a C181S/M184L double mutant. Its mobility was similar to that of the C181S mutant (data not shown), and like this variant it neither supported mTORC1 signaling nor bound to Rheb (not shown).The mutation of Ser-20 to Asn (S20N) yields a Rheb mutant that cannot bind guanine nucleotides and fails to activate mTORC1 signaling (9Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 40Li Y. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7965-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The Rheb(S20N) mutant expressed at lower levels than the wild type protein in HEK293 cells, but relatively much more of the mutant was recovered in HA-FKBP38 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C). This shows the following: (i) the ability to bind GTP or GDP is not required for Rheb to interact with FKBP38; and (ii) the inability of the Rheb[C181S] mutant to bind FKBP38 arises from an effect that is distinct from its (in)ability to bind GTP. The reason for its inability to bind FKBP38 remains to be determined.Our data do confirm the finding of the earlier study (24Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) that Rheb can bind FKBP38. However, taken together, the data for the two mutants tested here are not consistent with the idea that FKBP38 preferentially binds to Rheb·GTP as suggested by the earlier study (24Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).Furthermore, in multiple experiments we were unable to see any consistent difference in the amount of wild type FKBP38 that co-immunoprecipitated with Rheb under conditions where mTORC1 signaling is impaired (amino acid starvation) or activated (treatment of amino acid-replete cells with insulin; Fig. 2D). This finding suggests that the association of FKBP38 with Rheb is independent of amino acids or insulin; it is not consistent with the idea (24Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) that agents that activate mTORC1 signaling do so by increasing the association of Rheb with FKBP38, thereby alleviating the proposed inhibitory effect of FKBP38 on mTORC1.FKBP38 Also Binds mTOR but Does Not Inhibit mTORC1 Signaling in HEK293 Cells—To study whether FKBP38 also bound to mTOR, we co-expressed HA-FKBP38 and FLAG-mTOR in HEK293 cells. HA immunoprecipitation of FKBP38 consistently brought down mTOR, as shown in Fig. 3A. This is in agreement with earlier data (24Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). However, the levels of mTOR associated with FKBP38 were the same whether the cells had been starved of serum or of amino acids, or treated with insulin, prior to lysis (Fig. 3A), even though these conditions do have marked effects on mTORC1 signaling (as shown in Fig. 2B).FIGURE 3FKBP38 interacts with mTOR but does not inhibit mTORC1 signaling. A, HEK293 cells were transfected with vectors encoding FLAG-mTOR and HA-FKBP38 (or where indicated only with FLAG-mTOR). Twenty four hours later, cells were starved overnight for serum and, where shown (–) of amino acids for 60 min. Where indicated, cells were treated with insulin (for a further 30 min). Samples of lysate were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blot with the indicated antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2005070872,"Cholesterol is required for normal cellular and physiological function, yet dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism is associated with diseases such as atherosclerosis. Cholesterol biosynthesis is regulated by end product negative feedback inhibition where the levels of sterols and oxysterols regulate the expression of cholesterologenic enzymes. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 is responsive to both sterols and oxysterols and has been shown to mediate the transcriptional response of the cholesterologenic enzymes to these lipids. Here, we show that the nuclear hormone receptor for oxysterols, the liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), regulates cholesterol biosynthesis by directly silencing the expression of two key cholesterologenic enzymes (lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51A1), and squalene synthase (farnesyl diphosphate farnesyl transferase 1)) via novel negative LXR DNA response elements (nLXREs) located in each of these genes. Examination of the CYP51A1 gene revealed that both the SRE and nLXRE are required for normal oxysterol-dependent repression of this gene. Thus, these data suggest that LXRalpha plays an important role in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2056269293,"Protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt has been strongly implicated in the insulin-dependent stimulation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport in skeletal muscle and fat cells. Recently an allosteric inhibitor of PKB (Akti) that selectively targets PKBα and -β was reported, but as yet its precise mechanism of action or ability to suppress key insulin-regulated events such as glucose and amino acid uptake and glycogen synthesis in muscle cells has not been reported. We show here that Akti ablates the insulin-dependent regulation of these processes in L6 myotubes at submicromolar concentrations and that inhibition correlates tightly with loss of PKB activation/phosphorylation. Similar findings were obtained using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Akti did not inhibit IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, or activation of Erks, ribosomal S6 kinase, or atypical protein kinases C but significantly impaired regulation of downstream PKB targets glycogen synthase kinase-3 and AS160. Akti-mediated inhibition of PKB requires an intact kinase pleckstrin homology domain but does not involve suppression of 3-phosphoinositide binding to this domain. Importantly, we have discovered that Akti inhibition is critically dependent upon a solvent-exposed tryptophan residue (Trp-80) that is present within the pleckstrin homology domain of all three PKB isoforms and whose mutation to an alanine (PKBW80A) yields an Akti-resistant kinase. Cellular expression of PKBW80A antagonized the Akti-mediated inhibition of glucose and amino acid uptake. Our findings support a critical role for PKB in the hormonal regulation of glucose and system A amino acid uptake and indicate that use of Akti and expression of the drug-resistant kinase will be valuable tools in delineating cellular PKB functions."

FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK) is known for its role in inhibiting integrin-mediated cell migration; however, its role in myofibroblast differentiation has not been defined. Here, we report that FRNK abrogates TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. TGF-β1 can induce α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression in the presence or absence of FAK; however, TGF-β1-induced α-SMA expression is reduced (∼73%) in FAK-deficient fibroblasts. Although both ERK and p38 MAPK activation is required for maximal TGF-β1-induced α-SMA expression, ERK is the major signaling intermediate in cells that express FAK. In contrast, p38 MAPK is the dominant mediator of TGF-β1-induced α-SMA expression in FAK-deficient cells. FRNK overexpression blocks TGF-β1-induced ERK or p38 MAPK activation in the presence, and surprisingly, in the absence of FAK. The loss of FRNK was tested in vivo during experimentally induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. FRNK knock-out mice have a greater increase in α-SMA-expressing cells in response to a pulmonary fibrotic stimulus in vivo, as compared with congenic wild type mice. This is the first time that FRNK loss has been shown to modify the pathobiology in any animal disease model. Together, the data demonstrate that FRNK negatively regulates myofibroblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo.

The loss of FRNK was tested in vivo during experimentally induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. FRNK knock-out mice have a greater increase in α-SMA-expressing cells in response to a pulmonary fibrotic stimulus in vivo, as compared with congenic wild type mice. This is the first time that FRNK loss has been shown to modify the pathobiology in any animal disease model. Together, the data demonstrate that FRNK negatively regulates myofibroblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. These data further suggest that modulation FRNK expression may be a novel avenue for therapeutic intervention in tissue fibrosis. Deranged tissue repair and remodeling or failed termination of the normal wound healing response may result in tissue fibrosis. After injury, fibroblasts migrate into the wound, proliferate, and differentiate to “activated” fibroblasts (1.Hinz B. Phan S.H. Thannickal V.J. Galli A. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Gabbiani G. Am. J.

In this study, the effect of gain of FRNK and the FAK dependence of the effect of FRNK on TGF-β1-induced α-SMA expression were examined.

Lastly, we evaluated the effect of FRNK deficiency on myofibroblast differentiation in a murine model of experimentally induced pulmonary fibrosis. Reagents—TGF-β1 was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The following purified polyclonal antibodies were purchased: anti-phospho-FAK (Tyr(P)397) (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), anti-FAK (recognizes both FAK C-terminal and FRNK; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology/New England Biolabs, Danvers, MA), anti-ERK IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p38 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-p38 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), and anti-phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling). Purified Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Molecular Probes (Carlsbad, CA). The following purified monoclonal antibodies were purchased: anti-α-SMA (American Research Products, Belmont, MA), Cy3-conjugated anti-α-SMA antibody (clone 1A4; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ). The selective inhibitors PD98059, U0126, U0124, and SB203580 were purchased from EMD Biosciences/Calbiochem and dissolved in Me2SO. Animal Protocol—Animal interventions were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Animal Resources Facility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and were performed under the guidelines for animal care recommended by the American Physiological Society. All of the animals were pathogen-free, housed in micro-isolator cages, and fed with autoclaved food and water. FRNK knock-out mice were generated as described (44.Hayasaka H. Martin K.H. Hershey E.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biochem. 2007; 102: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and were generously provided by Dr. J. Thomas Parsons. FRNK knock-out mice were C57BL/6 background (back-crossed with C57BL/6 mice for at least 12 generations before the current study). The genotype of FRNK knock-out (homozygous) mice and their wild type littermates was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from tails as published (44.Hayasaka H. Martin K.H. Hershey E.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biochem. 2007; 102: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the absence of FRNK expression in lung tissue from FRNK knock-out mice was confirmed by Western blot (data not shown). The administration of bleomycin and harvest of lung tissues were described previously (45.Olman M.A. Mackman N. Gladson C. Moser K. Loskutoff D. J. Clin.

Briefly, the animals (7–10 weeks) were anesthetized, and bleomycin (1 unit/kg of body weight in 50 μl of saline) or saline alone (50 μl) was slowly instilled through airway to lungs by using an intratracheal catheter. The skin wounds were closed, and the animals were allowed to recover. The animals were euthanized at day 18 after bleomycin instillation. The lungs were perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline, inflated with tissue-preservation media Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (OCT), and sectioned for immunofluorescence analysis of α-SMA-positive cells. Whole lung homogenate supernatants were used for Western blot analysis. The harvested lungs were homogenized in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (with the following inhibitors, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm sodium vanadate, and 20 μg/ml TLCK) with a polytron (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY), and homogenate supernatants were extracted by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) (46.Simmons W.L.

Briefly, primary cultures of murine lung fibroblasts were established by mechanical disaggregation and enzymatic digestion (collagenase and DNase) of sterilely removed lungs and by cell culture. Fibroblasts were selected by differential adherence to tissue culture plastic and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 20 mm HEPES, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin/gentamycin. The cell identity of primary cultures was verified by the absence of tight junctions, by production of collagen types I and III, and by typical morphology on phase contrast as described previously (47.Olman M.A. Hagood J.S.

Primary adult normal human lung fibroblasts (HL1–1608) were purchased from Cambrex (Walkersville, Maryland), and normal adult human lung fibroblasts (HL2–19LU) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human lung fibroblasts were propagated and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The experiments were performed on early passages (passage 2–9) of primary murine and human lung fibroblasts. The Tet-FAK fibroblast-like cells and their parental FAK-null embryonic fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. Steven K. Hanks. In the absence of doxycycline in cell culture medium, FAK expression is induced in Tet-FAK cells as described previously (49.Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In the presence of doxycycline (2 μg/ml), FAK expression in Tet-FAK cells is repressed (49.Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The Tet-FAK cells and their parental FAK-null cells were propagated and maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, 0.6 g/liter glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B as described previously (49.Owen J.D.

To efficiently deliver the FRNK cDNA into primary lung fibroblasts, the adenovirally mediated gene delivery system was used. The HA-tagged FRNK cDNA was engineered into a replication-deficient adenovirus vector by using the Adeno-X Expression System 2 according to the manufacturer's manual (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The Ad-FRNK was rescued and amplified in 293 cells, purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation, and used to infect cells as described previously (46.Simmons W.L. White K.E. Curiel D.T. Williams W.F.

Protein concentration of whole cell or whole lung lysate was determined by a BCA kit (Pierce). Equivalent micrograms (by BCA assay) of whole cell or lung detergent lysates were electrophoresed on a disulfide-reduced 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), probed, or stripped followed by reprobing with indicated antibodies, and developed with ECL system (GE Healthcare).

The expression of G3PDH protein was used as a loading control. Quantitative analysis (densitometry) of Western blots was performed by calculating the relative density (pixel density) of the immunoreactive bands after acquisition of the blot image (scanning) and analysis with Adobe Photoshop software. For analysis of band intensity, a specific band on the ECL-developed films was subjected to densitometric analysis (Adobe Photoshop). The densitometric readings were pooled and averaged from three independent experiments, and the results were normalized to the total protein level.

Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and reacted sequentially with primary antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies. To detect HA-tagged FRNK expression, the cells were reacted with monoclonal anti-HA IgG (13 μg/ml), and followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 IgG (10 μg/ml). To study the α-SMA-incorporated cytoskeletal fibers, the cells were reacted with Cy3-conjugated anti-α-SMA monoclonal antibodies (1:300). Digital fluorescence images were obtained by using a Leica microscope and Simple PCI software (Compix Inc.). The percentage of cells containing highly organized α-SMA-incorporated fibers were quantified. The results were pooled from eight randomly selected, non-overlapping fields (original magnification, 400×) from a total of three experiments (each performed in triplicate).

https://openalex.org/W2005510844,"Calcineurin/NFAT signaling is involved in multiple aspects of skeletal muscle development and disease. The myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, MyoD, myogenin, Myf5, and MRF4 specify the myogenic lineage. Here we show that calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) signaling is required for primary myogenesis by transcriptional cooperation with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor MyoD. Calcineurin/NFAT signaling is involved in myogenin expression in differentiating myoblasts, where the myogenic regulatory factor MyoD synergistically cooperates with NFATc2/c3 at the myogenin promoter. Using gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we identified two conserved NFAT binding sites in the myogenin promoter that were occupied by NFATc3 upon skeletal muscle differentiation. The transcriptional integration between NFATc3 and MyoD is crucial for primary myogenesis in vivo, as myogenin expression is weak in myod:nfatc3 double null embryos, whereas myogenin expression is unaffected in embryos with null mutations for either factor alone. Thus, the combined findings provide a novel transcriptional paradigm for the first steps of myogenesis, where a calcineurin/NFATc3 pathway regulates myogenin induction in cooperation with MyoD during myogenesis."

We analyzed the pigment compositions of surface sediments and detected Chl d and its derivatives from diverse aquatic environments. Our data show that the viable habitat for Chl d-producing phototrophs extends across salinities of 0 to 50 practical salinity units and temperatures of 1 degrees to 40 degrees C, suggesting that Chl d production can be ubiquitously observed in aquatic environments that receive near-infrared light. The relative abundances of Chl d derivatives over that of Chl a derivatives in the studied samples are up to 4%, further suggesting that Chl d-based photosynthesis plays a quantitatively important role in the aquatic photosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1969164654,"During Drosophila metamorphosis, most larval cells die. Pupal and adult tissues form from imaginal cells, tissue-specific progenitors allocated in embryogenesis that remain quiescent during embryonic and larval life. Clonal analysis and fate mapping of single, identified cells show that tracheal system remodeling at metamorphosis involves a classical imaginal cell population and a population of differentiated, functional larval tracheal cells that reenter the cell cycle and regain developmental potency. In late larvae, both populations are activated and proliferate, spread over and replace old branches, and diversify into various stalk and coiled tracheolar cells under control of fibroblast growth factor signaling. Thus, Drosophila pupal/adult tissue progenitors can arise both by early allocation of multipotent cells and late return of differentiated cells to a multipotent state, even within a single tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1968330432,"Ceramide functions as an important second messenger in apoptosis signaling pathways. In this report, we show that treatment of NT-2 neuronal precursor cells with hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) resulted in ceramide up-regulation. This elevation in ceramide was primarily due to the actions of acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide synthase LASS 5, demonstrating the action of the salvage pathway. Hypoxia/reoxygenation treatment led to Bax translocation from the cytoplasm to mitochondria and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Down-regulation of either acid sphingomyelinase or LASS 5-attenuated ceramide accumulation and H/R-induced Bax translocation to mitochondria. Overall, we have demonstrated that ceramide up-regulation following H/R is pertinent to Bax activation to promote cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2086628330,"The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are essential signaling molecules that mediate many cellular effects of growth factors, cytokines, and stress stimuli. Full activation of the MAP kinases requires dual phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues in the TXY motif of the activation loop by MAP kinase kinases.

A typical MAPK cascade consists of three tiers of sequentially activating protein kinases, which commonly are referred to as MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK). An activated MAPKKK phosphorylates and activates a specific MAPKK, which then activates a specific MAPK. The three best characterized MAPK cascades are the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, and the p38 kinase pathway. ERKs are activated by a range of stimuli, including growth factors, cell adhesion, tumor-promoting phorbol esters, and oncogenes, whereas JNK and p38 are preferentially activated by proinflammatory cytokines, and a variety of environmental stresses such as UV and osmotic stress. After activation, each MAPK phosphorylates a distinct spectrum of substrates, which include key regulatory enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, nuclear receptors, regulators of apoptosis, and many transcription factors. mitogen-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase protein-tyrosine phosphatase activating transcription factor 2 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine p-nitrophenyl phosphate p38αphosphorylated on Thr-180 and Tyr-182 p38αphosphorylated on both Thr-180 and Tyr-182 lactate dehydrogenase kinase interaction motif nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid epidermal growth factor EGF receptor c-Jun N-terminal kinase glutathione S-transferase dual specificity phosphatase MAP kinase-binding. mitogen-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase protein-tyrosine phosphatase activating transcription factor 2 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine p-nitrophenyl phosphate p38αphosphorylated on Thr-180 and Tyr-182 p38αphosphorylated on both Thr-180 and Tyr-182 lactate dehydrogenase kinase interaction motif nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid epidermal growth factor EGF receptor c-Jun N-terminal kinase glutathione S-transferase dual specificity phosphatase MAP kinase-binding. Like many protein kinases, the activity of MAPKs is regulated by phosphorylation in an activation loop located near their active sites (7Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). The hallmark of the MAPKs is their unique requirement for dual phosphorylation at a conserved threonine and tyrosine residue belonging to the consensus sequence TXY for catalytic activation (where X is Glu in ERKs, Pro in JNKs, and Gly in p38 kinases) (8Ahn N.G.

Because both threonine and tyrosine residues must be phosphorylated for full kinase activity, dephosphorylation on either site is sufficient to inactivate MAPK. Increasing evidence suggests that multiple phosphatases are involved in MAPK inactivation, thus forming a negative feedback mechanism. Several serine/threonine phosphatases, such as PP2A and PP2Cα, and tyrosine phosphatases, such as PTP-SL and HePTP, have been shown to shut off MAPK activity (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, there are several MAPK phosphatases that show dual specificity and could inactivate MAPKs (18Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) are dual specificity phosphatases that inactivate MAPKs through dephosphorylation of phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues in the activation loop of MAPKs (18Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 19Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). MKPs belong to the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPase) superfamily, which is defined by the PTPase signature motif (H/V)C(X)5R(S/T). Mechanistic studies with small molecule aryl phosphates have shown that the tyrosine-specific PTPases and the dual specificity phosphatases share a common catalytic mechanism (20Zhang Z.Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 33: 1-52Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, at least 13 MKPs have been identified, and they are grouped into four categories on the basis of their structural and functional characteristics (21Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2005; 16: 769-779Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Type I MKPs contain only an ∼200-residue dual specificity phosphatase (DSP) domain. Type II MKPs consist of an N-terminal MAP kinase-binding (MKB) domain and a DSP domain. Type III subgroup of MKPs contains only one member, MKP5, which possesses an N-terminal domain of unknown function in addition to the MKB and DSP domains. Like type II subgroup of MKPs, type IV MKPs contain both the MKB and DSP domains. Their unique feature, however, is that they contain a sequence of about 300 residues C terminus to the DSP domain, which is rich in prolines, glutamates, serines, and threonines. Many MKPs exhibit distinct substrate specificity toward three major classes of MAPKs. For instance, PAC1 and MKP3 are highly selective in inactivating ERKs, whereas MKP5 selectively dephosphorylate p38 and JNK MAPKs (22Ward Y. Gupta S. Jensen P. Wartmann M. Davis R.J. Kelly K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This substrate selectivity of MKPs is in part due to their ability to recognize distinctively different dual phosphorylation sites containing the pTXpY motif in the three different classes of MAPKs. Although the activation of MAPKs has been extensively studied, the equally important process of quenching MAPK activity is poorly understood. Most previous mechanistic studies of protein phosphatases used small molecule of substrates, and there are few detailed investigations of protein phosphatases with physiological substrates. The most commonly used approaches for studying the substrate specificity of protein phosphatases involve overexpression experiments followed by either monitoring a target reporter gene expression or in vitro assay of phosphorylation level of protein substrate in the immunoprecipitate of cellular extracts. These kinds of experiments do not provide definitive information about the identity of protein phosphatases involved in certain cellular functions. Indeed, one would almost always observe substrate dephosphorylation if a sufficient amount of a protein phosphatase is provided to the system. Therefore, further understanding of the specific functional role of MKPs in cellular signaling requires quantitative study of protein phosphatases with physiological substrates. In this study, we prepared milligram quantities of p38α in its various phosphorylation states. This has allowed us to fully characterize the biochemical properties of p38α in different phosphorylation states. Our results indicate the following. (i) p38α phosphorylated at both Thr-180 and Tyr-182 was 10–20-fold more active than p38α phosphorylated at Thr-180 only, whereas p38α phosphorylated at Tyr-182 alone was inactive. (ii) The dual-specific MKP5, the tyrosine-specific HePTP, and the Ser/Thr-specific PP2Cα are all highly specific for the dephosphorylation of p38α, and the dephosphorylation rates were significantly affected by different phosphorylated states of p38α. (iii) The N-terminal domain of MPK5 has no effect on enzyme catalysis, whereas deletion of the MKB domain in MKP5 leads to a 370-fold decrease in kcat/Km for the dephosphorylation of p38α/pTpY. This study provides a quantitative understanding of the roles of phosphorylation at each site with respect to the activation mechanism of p38α. Materials—ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), NADH, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), bacterial purine nucleotide phosphorylase, and the ingredients to generate the purine nucleotide phosphorylase substrate 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine (MESG) were purchased from Sigma.

All other chemicals were local products of analytical grade used without further purification. Double-deionized water was used throughout. Preparation of Unphosphorylated p38α and Bisphosphorylated p38α/pTpY—The cDNA encoding mouse p38α (a generous gift from Dr. Zhenguo Wu) was subcloned into pET15b (Novagen). The N-terminally His6-tagged unphosphorylated p38α was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by Ni-NTA column (Qiagen), followed by an anion exchange Source 15Q HR 10/10 column (GE Healthcare). The cDNAs for human wild-type MKK6 and MKK6CA, the constitutively active MKK6 mutant (S207E/T211E) in pET15b (Novagen), were kindly provided by Dr. Zhenguo Wu. Bisphosphorylated p38α/pTpY was obtained by coexpressing p38α and MKK6CA in vivo. Both p38α and MKK6CA were subcloned into the same plasmid pETDuet-1 (Novagen) used to transform competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Four liters of culture medium was inoculated with an overnight culture of Luria Broth (LB, 100 ml) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8. Expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12–16 h at 25 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended immediately in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl). Cells were lysed in 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by sonication at 4 °C. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (13,500 rpm, 4 °C, 40 min). Ni-NTA column was used to separate N-terminal His6-tagged p38α/pTpY from other cell components. The fraction of eluted protein from Ni-NTA column were pooled and applied directly to an ion exchange Source 15Q column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol. The protein eluted using a 100-ml gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl. The protein purity was over 98% as judged by SDS-PAGE. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the purified p38α/pTpY was effectively homogeneous and was phosphorylated stoichiometrically to a ratio of 2 mol of phosphate per mol of p38α. The protein was stored in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) at -80 °C. The concentration of p38α was determined using the molar extinction coefficient (A280) of 52,501 cm-1 m-1, following the method of Gill and von Hippel (28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal.

The catalytically inactive mutant HePTPC270S, PP2CαD239N, and MKP5C408S were generated by PCR oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis, and all mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The N-terminally His6-tagged HePTP, PP2Cα, and MKP5 and the inactive mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified using standard procedures of Ni-NTA column, followed by an anion exchange source 15Q column. Recombinant GST fusion human HePTP and PP2Cα (in pGEX-4T vector; GE Healthcare) were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified according to standard procedures using the affinity matrix glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), followed by an anion exchange Source 15Q column.

The GST-ATF2(1–109) construct was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified according to standard procedures with an additional high resolution Source 15Q anion exchange chromatography step. The GST tag was removed by incubation with thrombin at 4 °C for 6 h. The untagged ATF2-(1–109) was concentrated to 200 μm in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol). All proteins prepared were examined by SDS-PAGE analysis, and the contents of each were judged at least 98% pure. The purified protein was made to 20% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using theoretical molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm. Enzyme Assays for p38α—The enzymatic activity of p38α was measured spectrophotometrically using EGF receptor peptide and ATF2Δ109 as substrates (29Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). This assay couples the production of ADP with the oxidation of NADH by pyruvate kinase and LDH. The standard assay was carried out at 25 °C in 1.8-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADH, 1.0 mm PEP, 20 units/ml LDH, and 15 units/ml pyruvate kinase and varying amounts of ATP, EGF receptor peptide, and enzyme. Based on the theoretical calculation and control experiments, the amount of the coupling enzymes used in our assays are more than sufficient to determine the initial velocity of the protein kinase reaction (30McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1969; 7: 2782-2787Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). Reactions were initiated by the addition of p38α to the reaction mixture. Progress of the reaction was monitored continuously by following the formation of NAD+ at 340 nm, on a Lambda 45 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a magnetic stirrer in the cuvette holder. The concentrations of ADP formed in p38α-catalyzed reaction were determined using an extinction coefficient for NADH of 6220 cm-1 m-1 at 340 nm. The concentration of EGF receptor peptide was determined by turnover with the enzyme under conditions of limiting peptide at a fixed concentration of ATP. Enzyme Assays for Protein Phosphatases—With pNPP as a substrate, the reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme in a reaction mixture, and the initial rates for hydrolysis of pNPP by phosphatase were measured at 25 °C in 1.8 ml of reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, in the presence of either 10 mm MgCl2 for MKP5, HePTP or 2 mm MnCl2 for PP2Cα. The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without the addition of enzyme. The amount of product p-nitrophenol was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 18,000 m-1 cm-1 (31Zhou B. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35526-35534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters for the dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated p38α was determined using a continuous spectrophotometric assay (17Zhou B. Wang Z.X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Cheng Q. Wang Z.X. Killilea S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This assay incorporates a coupled enzyme system, which uses purine nucleoside phosphorylase and its chromogenic substrate 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine (MESG) for the quantification of inorganic phosphate produced in the phosphatase reaction (33Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 1.8 ml of reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm MESG, 0.1 mg/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The reactions were initiated by the addition of phosphatase unless indicated otherwise. The time courses of absorbance change at 360 nm were recorded on a Lambda 45 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a magnetic stirrer in the cuvette holder. Initial rates were determined from the linear slope of progress curves obtained, and the experimental data were analyzed using a nonlinear regression analysis program. Quantitation of phosphate release was determined using the extinction coefficient of 11,200 m-1cm-1 for the phosphate-dependent reaction at 360 nm at pH 7.0 (34Sergienko E.A. Srivastava D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The concentration of MESG was determined at 331 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 32,000 m-1cm-1. Western Blotting—The phosphorylation states of p38α were assessed by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. The same amount of p38α in various phosphorylation states were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). After incubation of the membranes with anti-p38 (sc-7149, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-bisphosphorylated p38 (catalog number 9211, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and anti-phospho-Tyr antibodies (catalog number 9411, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), specific immunocomplexes were detected by chemiluminescence using ECL reagents. The membrane was finally exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Preparation of Bis- and Monophosphorylated p38α—The bisphosphorylated p38α, p38α/pTpY (p38α phosphorylated on both Thr-180 and Tyr-182), was prepared by coexpression of N-terminal His6-tagged p38α and constitutively active MKK6 encoded on a single plasmid in E. coli and followed by purification using Ni-NTA column and Source 15Q anion exchange chromatography. To characterize the phosphorylated states of the p38α preparation, we employed a continuous spectrophotometric enzyme-coupled assay that measures the inorganic phosphate produced in a phosphatase reaction (17Zhou B. Wang Z.X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Cheng Q. Wang Z.X. Killilea S.D. Anal.

A summation of the two enzyme activities involved is as shown in Reactions 1 and 2. phosphoprotein+H2Ophosphatase→protein+PiREACTION 1 Pi+MESGPNPase→MTGua+ribosa1-phosphateREACTION 2 In this coupled enzyme system, the coupling enzyme, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNPase), uses the inorganic phosphate, generated by the action of the phosphatase, to convert 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine to 7-methyl-6-thioguanine (MTGua) and ribose 1-phosphate, resulting in an increase in absorbance at 360 nm. Fig. 1 shows time course of MKP5-catalyzed p38α/pTpY dephosphorylation. The continuous assay for phosphatases was carried out at 25 °C in a 1.8-ml reaction mixture. After 5 min of equilibration at 25 °C, the reaction was initiated by adding catalytic amount of MKP5 (186 nm), and absorbance at 360 nm was recorded. The change in absorbance was because of the conversion of MESG to 7-methyl-6-thioguanine in the presence of inorganic phosphate released from the dephosphorylation of p38α by MKP5. The MKP5-catalyzed dephosphorylation was near 100% complete in 3 min. Quantitation of phosphate release was determined using the extinction coefficient of 11,200 m-1cm-1 for the phosphate-dependent reaction at 360 nm at pH 7.0. As shown in Fig. 1, the phosphorylation stoichiometry of p38α was determined to be close to 2 mol of phosphate/mol of p38α. Thus the change in absorbance at 360 nm is a direct measure of the stoichiometric, phosphorylated p38α concentration. MKP5 is a dual specificity phosphatase capable of dephosphorylating both Tyr(P) and Thr(P) in the activation loop of p38α. In addition to MKP5, bisphosphorylated p38α can also be inactivated through the action of serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2Cα (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and tyrosine-specific PTP-SL and HePTP (35Saxena M. Williams S. Brockdorff J. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol.

J. 2003; 372: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the time dependence of HePTP-catalyzed reaction. Upon the addition of HePTP (470 nm), the dephosphorylation reaction of bisphosphorylated p38α was initiated as detected by monitoring the real time phosphate release. At the end of the HePTP-catalyzed dephosphorylation reaction, all bisphosphorylated p38α molecules were converted to the threonine 180 phosphorylated form of p38α; 186 nm MKP5 was added to the reaction mixture, and the threonine 180-phosphorylated p38α underwent MKP5-catalyzed dephosphorylation, resulting in a further increase of phosphate release. Similarly, Fig. 2, B, C, and D, shows the time-dependent absorption profiles (at 360 nm) for sequential additions of different phosphatases into the coupled reaction system. It can be seen from these figures that HePTP and PP2Cα specifically dephosphorylated the phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine of p38α, respectively, and the ratio of phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine in this"
https://openalex.org/W1664071819,"Many are calling for large increases in the budget for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to address the damaging effects on biomedical research resulting from recent flat funding levels. Yet politicians respond with skepticism, as the NIH budget is already very large and was doubled over the 5-year period 1998 to 2003 (1). What is often left unsaid is that the fundamental problems are structural in nature—biomedical research funding is both erratic and subject to positive-feedback loops (2, 3) that together drive the system ineluctably toward damaging instability. It may be possible to create broad political support for large annual NIH funding increases into the indefinite future. But if not, objective analyses of systemic instabilities, followed by incremental adjustments, would be strongly in the interest of maintaining the quality of U.S. biomedical research."

All three 1-C-Grx are expressed in both the mammalian bloodstream and the insect procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei, with the highest levels found in stationary phase and starving parasites. In the rudimentary mitochondrion of bloodstream cells, 1-C-Grx1 reaches concentrations above 200 μm/subunit. Recombinant T. brucei 1-C-Grx1 exists as a noncovalent homodimer, whereas 1-C-Grx2 and 1-C-Grx3 are monomeric proteins. In vitro, dimeric 1-C-Grx1 coordinated an H2O2-sensitive [2Fe-2S] cluster that required GSH as an additional ligand. Both bloodstream and procyclic trypanosomes were refractory to down-regulation of 1-C-Grx1 expression by RNA interference. In procyclic parasites, the 1-c-grx1 alleles could only be deleted if an ectopic copy of the gene was expressed. A 5–10-fold overexpression of 1-C-Grx1 in both parasite forms did not yield a growth phenotype under optimal culture conditions. However, exposure of these cells to the iron chelator deferoxamine or H2O2, but not to iron or menadione, impaired cell growth. Treatment of wild-type bloodstream parasites with deferoxamine and H2O2 caused a 2-fold down- and up-regulation of 1-C-Grx1, respectively.

The proteins occur in different subcellular compartments; for instance, yeast Grx3 and Grx4 are nuclear proteins, whereas Grx5 is mitochondrially localized (for a review see Ref. 2Herrero E. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 655: 1-13Google Scholar). The mitochondrial isoform of 1-C-Grx seems to be a key component of the evolutionarily conserved machinery that incorporates iron-sulfur clusters (ISC) into the apoproteins (3Mühlenhoff U. Gerber J. Richhardt N. Lill R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4815-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar).

We show that the concentration of these proteins is highest in parasites that are grown to the stationary/starvation phase. For the mitochondrial 1-C-Grx1, we provide strong evidence that the homodimeric protein can coordinate an iron-sulfur center using GSH as ligand, fulfilling an essential role in the iron and redox homeostasis of the parasite.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—All enzymes employed in the molecular biology experiments were purchased from MBI Fermentas. Kits for the purification of genomic DNA, gel extraction, and mini- and midi-preps were from Qiagen or Macherey-Nagel. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech, Operon, or Metabion. E. coli strains DH5-α and Novablue served as host cells in all genetic procedures. Glutathione disulfide, menadione, and 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), used for thiol determinations (15Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem.

Antibiotics were purchased from Sigma and Invitrogen. Polyclonal guinea pig antibodies against T. brucei His6-1-C-Grx1, untagged 1-C-Grx2, and 1-C-Grx3 were produced by Eurogentec. The antisera against T. cruzi trypanothione reductase (TR) and T. brucei 1-C-Grx1 were purified (13Filser M. Comini M.A. Molina-Navarro M.M. Dirdjaja N. Herrero E. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Biol.

Anti-guinea pig and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Santa Cruz. Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG and anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes™ (Invitrogen). His-tagged 1-C-Grx1 was prepared essentially as described (13Filser M.

Before induction, the cultures were kept at 4 °C for 30 min, 200 μm isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, was added and the cells were incubated at 18 °C overnight. The pH of all buffers was 7.0.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of His-tagged 1-C-Grx2 and 1-C-Grx3—The coding regions of 1-c-grx2 and 1-c-grx3 were amplified from T. brucei (strain 427) (16Melville S.E. Leech V. Navarro M. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) genomic DNA with the primers given in the supplemental table. The amplicon for 1-c-grx2 was blunt end-cloned using the Perfectly Blunt® cloning kit (Novagen), which yielded plasmid pETBlue1-1-c-grx2. This construct served as template to amplify 1-c-grx2 without the first 21 residues. The PCR product was BamHI/PstI-digested and ligated into the vector pQE30 (Qiagen) yielding pQE30-1-c-grx2(-)MTS. The PCR product for 1-c-grx3 was ligated into the pET19b vector (Novagen). All expression constructs were completely sequenced in both directions. Expression of pQE30-1-c-grx2(-)MTS and pET19b-1-c-grx3 yielded recombinant His6-1-C-Grx2 and His10-1-C-Grx3, respectively. The plasmids were overexpressed in E. coli BL21-DE3 cells grown in 2× YT medium and Tuner-DE3 cells cultivated in Terrific Broth medium with 1% (w/v) glucose, respectively. The cultures containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin were incubated at 37 °C and 180 rpm. At an A600 of 0.6, the temperature was lowered to 4 °C for 30 min, 0.2–1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and the cells were grown at 18 °C overnight. Cells from 1 to 2 liters of culture were resuspended in 25–50 ml of 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, and disintegrated by sonification. The supernatant was applied onto 10 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen). After washing with 10 mm imidazol, the His-tagged proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 10–250 mm imidazol. Fractions containing pure recombinant proteins were pooled, and the protein concentration was determined.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the Tag-free 1-C-Grx— The coding regions of 1-c-grx1 and 1-c-grx2 lacking the putative mitochondrial targeting sequences were amplified from pQE30/1-c-grx1 (13Filser M.

PCR products for 1-c-grx1 and -2 and the sequence encoding 1-c-grx3, excised with NdeI and BamHI from pET19b-1-c-grx3, were cloned into the expression vector pET43.1b(+) (Novagen). BL21-DE3 E. coli cells were transformed with pET43b1(+)-1-c-grx1,-2, and -3, and the heterologous expression was induced as described above. For 1-C-Grx1, cells from 2 liters of culture were suspended in 10 ml of 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, containing 150 nm pepstatin, 4 nm cystatin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were disintegrated by sonification, and the pellet was re-extracted. Both supernatants were combined, and 3% (w/v) streptomycin sulfate was added. After centrifugation, the sample was applied onto a Q-Sepharose column (8 ml wet resin/gram of protein) equilibrated in 80 mm NaCl in 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. The column was washed with 100 mm NaCl, and 1-C-Grx1 was eluted with 200 mm NaCl. The protein was precipitated with 58% ammonium sulfate, dissolved in 2 ml of 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, and applied onto a gel chromatography column as described below. In the case of 1-C-Grx2 and 1-C-Grx3, cells from 1–2 liters of culture were suspended in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture and 100 units/ml DNase and disintegrated by sonification. For 1-C-Grx2 a precipitation step with 50% (NH4)2SO4 was included. The proteins were subjected to gel chromatography at 8 °C on a Superdex 75 Hiload 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences).Gel Chromatography and Mass Spectrometric Analysis of 1-C-Grx1 Treated with GSSG or Hydrogen Peroxide—In a total volume of 5 ml of PBS buffer, pH 7.4, 50 μm tag-free 1-C-Grx1 (expressed from a modified pET9d vector (New England Biolabs) containing a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-cleavable thioredoxin-His6 fusion vector (kindly provided by Gunther Stier, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany)) was incubated with 500 μm GSSG overnight at 4 °C and with 500 μm H2O2 for 2 h at room temperature, respectively. The latter reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 unit of bovine liver catalase (Fluka). The GSSG-treated sample was subjected to two PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) to remove the low molecular mass components and stored at 4 °C for 3 days. Both 1-C-Grx1 samples contained 0.3 free thiol/protein subunit as shown by Ellman's reaction (15Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21077) Google Scholar). The protein solutions were concentrated in Amicon 10-kDa concentrators (Millipore) to 3.6 and 4.0 mg/ml for the subsequent size exclusion chromatography. A Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) was pre-equilibrated in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0. 200-μl samples of the oxidized 1-C-Grx1 species as well as of the untreated fully reduced protein, corresponding to about 0.8 mg of protein, were chromatographed at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at 8 °C. The low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit (GE Healthcare) served for standardization. The elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing and reducing conditions. The peak fractions were subjected to ESI-MS on an API-QSTAR™ Pulsar instrument (Applied Biosystems) with a high pressure liquid chromatography system (Agilent) on-line-coupled to the ESI-QTOF (quadrupole time-of-flight) instrument. 50 μl of a 10 μm protein solution was incubated with 20 mm iodoacetamide and injected into the mass spectrometer essentially as described previously (12Melchers J.

Hudemann C. Hanschmann E.M. Axelsson R. Holmgren A. Lillig C.H. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 100–200 μm 1-C-Grx1 was incubated under an argon atmosphere at room temperature with 0.01 molar equivalents of E. coli cysteine desulfurase IscS, 2.5–5 equivalents of cysteine, 2–4 equivalents of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 1 mm GSH, 5 mm DTT, and 10 μm pyridoxal phosphate in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl. After 2–3.5 h, the protein was separated from the reaction components on Sephadex G25 columns (NAP-5 or PD-10, GE Healthcare). The reconstitution mixture was subjected to gel chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm GSH. The molecular mass of the complex was determined by a standard curve provided by the supplier's manual and by standard proteins. Absorbance at 280 and 420 nm was recorded. UV-visible spectra and the kinetics of cluster disassembly, measuring the absorbance at 420 nm in the presence or absence of 1 mm GSH, as well as of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.36, and 1 mm H2O2, were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2100 spectrophotometer. Kinetic measurements were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl at 25 °C.Determination of Iron and Acid-labile Sulfide—Protein bound iron was quantified as described by Fish (18Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), and acid-labile sulfide was quantified according to Broderick et al. (19Broderick J.B. Henshaw T.F. Cheek J.

Three determinations were carried out on samples from five independent reconstitution assays.DNA Constructs for the Overexpression or Deletion of 1-c-grx1 in T. brucei—The full-length 1-c-grx1 coding region was amplified from pMM351-grx1 (clone 5) (13Filser M. Comini M.A. Molina-Navarro M.M. Dirdjaja N. Herrero E. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Biol. Chem. 2008; 389: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using forward Grx1 HindIII and reverse Grx1 BamHI as primers (supplemental table) and cloned into the pHD1700 vector (Dr. Christine Clayton, Heidelberg, Germany) to generate pHD1700-1-c-grx1-c-myc2. T. brucei cells were transfected with the NotI-linearized plasmid (see below). For disruption of the 1-c-grx1 alleles, blasticidin and puromycin resistance genes flanked by the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) of T. brucei 1-c-grx1 were generated. The 5′- and 3′-UTRs were amplified from genomic DNA of wild-type T. brucei (strain 449) using forward Grx1–5′UTR SacI/Re Grx1–5′UTR XbaI and forward Grx1–3′UTR HindIII/Re Grx1–3′UTR XhoI, respectively, as primers (supplemental table). The puromycin N-acetyltransferase (PAC) and blasticidin S-deaminase (BLA) genes were amplified with primers containing the respective restriction sites (supplemental table) from plasmids pHD 1034 and pHD 886 (Dr. Christine Clayton, Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. The 1-c-grx1 5′-UTR, the PAC- or BLA-gene, and the 1-c-grx1 3′-UTR were cloned stepwise into the SacI/XbaI, BamHI/PstI, and HindIII/XhoI restriction sites, respectively, of pBluescript II SK(+). The complete knock-out (KO) cassettes were excised with SacI/XhoI, purified from an agarose gel, and used to transfect T. brucei cells as described below. All PCRs and genetic engineering procedures were carried out using Pfu DNA polymerase and E. coli DH5-α or Novablue (Novagen) strains, respectively. The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing (MWG Biotech).Cell Lines, Culture Conditions, and Transfection—The T. brucei cell line 449 (referred to here as wild type, encoding one copy of the Tet repressor protein, PhleoR) (20Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and cell line 514–1313 (encoding the T7-RNA Pol and two copies of the Tet repressor protein, PhleoR and NeoR, respectively) (21Alibu V.P. Storm L. Haile S. Clayton C. Horn D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) employed in this work derive from strain 427 (16Melville S.E. Leech V. Navarro M. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Bloodstream cells were grown in HMI-9 medium (22Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and procyclic T. brucei in MEM-Pros medium (Biochrom) containing 7.5 μg/ml hemin at 27 °C. Both culture media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Biochrom, unless otherwise stated), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Depending on the resistance gene harbored by the trypanosomes, the medium of bloodstream and procyclic cells contained 0.2 and 0.5 μg/ml phleomycin, respectively, and/or 2.5 and 15 μg/ml G-418, respectively.3 × 107 Trypanosomes were transfected with 10–100 μg of the DNA constructs according to standard techniques (23Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 24Comini M.A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Flohé L. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in an ECM 630 electroporator (BTX). Single clones of bloodstream and procyclic cells were obtained in 24-wells culture plates by splitting the cultures immediately after transfection and by limiting dilution 24 h after transfection, respectively. Selection of stable transfectants was initiated about 16 h after electroporation by adding the respective antibiotics.Generation and Growth Phenotype Analysis of 1-C-Grx1-overexpressing T. brucei Cells—T. brucei bloodstream (cell line 449) and procyclic (cell line 514-1313) were transfected with pHD1700-1-c-grx1-c-myc2 and selected with 10 and 50 μg/ml hygromycin, respectively. Ectopic expression was induced with tetracycline (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml) and evaluated by Western blotting as described below. Bloodstream parasites were inoculated at 1 × 105 cells/ml in 10 ml of fresh medium with (Tet-induced) or without (control) 1 μg/ml tetracycline. The cells were counted daily, and the cultures were diluted to the initial cell density with fresh medium with or without tetracycline. In the case of procyclic parasites, the starting cell density was 5 × 105 cells/ml. The medium was not replaced during cultivation, and the cell density was assessed at different time points. Sustained expression of 1-C-Grx1-c-Myc2 was achieved by adding 1 μg/ml tetracycline every 48 h.Generation and Analysis of 1-c-grx1 Knock-out T. brucei Cell Lines—Bloodstream and procyclic T. brucei cells were transfected with the BLA-KO cassette and grown in the presence of 5 and 10 μg/ml blasticidin, respectively. In procyclic cells, replacement of the second 1-c-grx1 allele was attempted in two ways. A loss of heterozygosity was induced by stepwise increasing the concentration of blasticidin (10, 70, 150 and 300 μg/ml). The cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml, cultivated for 4 to 7 days in the presence of the selecting drug, and diluted back to the initial cell density before increasing the concentration of the antibiotic. Alternatively, 1 × 106 cells/ml were grown for 1 week in the presence of 300 μg/ml blasticidin, the culture was diluted 1:2, and cultivation was continued. In the second approach, BLA-resistant cells were transfected with the PAC-KO cassette and grown in the presence of puromycin (2 μg/ml) and blasticidin (10 μg/ml).To generate 1-c-grx1 conditional KOs of procyclic T. brucei, cell line 514-1313 Tb1-c-grx1Ti HYG (clone B5) displaying a tightly regulated expression of the ectopic copy of 1-c-grx1 was first transfected with the BLA-KO cassette. Cell cloning in a 24-well microculture plate was performed as described above in the presence of 10 μg/ml blasticidin. Loss of the second allele was achieved by transfecting a BLA-resistant cell line with the PAC-KO cassette in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline (replaced every 48–72 h), 10 μg/ml blasticidin, and 2 μg/ml puromycin. The successful replacement of the 1-c-grx1 gene was verified by PCR and Western blot analysis (described below). Genomic DNA was subjected to PCR using oligonucleotides complementary to the open reading frames upstream and downstream of the 1-c-grx1 gene in combination with 1-c-grx1 specific primers (see supplemental table). Genomic DNA from wild-type cells served as negative control. PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Procyclic cells with a single allele replaced and wild-type parasites (control) were grown continuously, and the cell density was determined daily. The growth of procyclic trypanosomes with a conditional-1-c-grx1-KO genotype was followed in medium with Tet-free certified fetal calf serum (Cambrex). Steady expression of 1-c-grx1-c-myc2 in the control cultures was achieved by adding fresh tetracycline (1 μg/ml) every 48 h. On day 0, 5 × 105 cells/ml were diluted in 10 ml of medium and incubated at 27 °C. For a 6- and 15-days experiment, every second and fifth day, respectively, the cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber, samples were withdrawn for further analysis, and the cultures were diluted to the initial cell density.Western Blot Analysis—4 × 106–1 × 107 Parasites were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4), boiled in Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% gel) followed by Western blots with antibodies against 1-C-Grx1, 1-C-Grx2, 1-C-Grx3, T. cruzi TR, and c-Myc at dilutions of 1:500, 1:200, 1:1000, 1:1000 and 1:400, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, and anti-mouse IgG served as secondary antibodies (1:10000). Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal West Pico Kit from Pierce. Densitometric analysis of the protein bands was performed using the program BIO-PROFIL (Vilber-Lourmat).Immunofluorescence—2.5 × 106 Bloodstream and procyclic parasites from logarithmic phase cultures, 24–48 h after induction of 1-C-Grx1-c-Myc2 expression, were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 27 °C and incubated for 15 min at 27 and 37 °C in 10 ml of fresh medium containing 0.2 and 0.75 μm MitoTracker®Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes), respectively. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS, suspended in 10 ml of fresh medium, cultivated for 20 min, and again washed. After fixation in 1 ml PBS, 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 18 min at room temperature, the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 1 min and washed three times with 500 μl of PBS, resuspended in 800 μl of PBS, and allowed to settle on a 4-well culture slide (200 μl/well; BD Falcon™) by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The cells were permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min, washed twice with PBS, and blocked for 20 min with 0.5% (w/v) gelatin in PBS. After washing with PBS, the slides were incubated for 1 h with purified guinea pig anti-1-C-Grx1 or mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (1:400 in PBS), washed again with PBS, and then incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor®"

An unprocessed monomeric N-terminal fragment (PF1) induced a very high heparin binding response, indicating heparin-mediated multimerization. Using PF1 deletion and short fragments, a heparin binding site was localized within the domain encoded by exon 7 after the first hybrid domain. Rodent embryonic fibroblasts adhered to PF1 and deletion fragments, and, when cells were plated on fibrillin-1 or fibronectin Arg-Gly-Asp cell-binding fragments, cells showed heparin-dependent spreading and focal contact formation in response to soluble PF1. Within domains encoded by exons 59–62 near the fibrillin-1 C terminus are novel conformation-dependent high affinity heparin and tropoelastin binding sites. Heparin disrupted tropoelastin binding but did not disrupt N- and C-terminal fibrillin-1 interactions. Thus, fibrillin-1 N-terminal interactions with heparin/heparan sulfate directly influence cell behavior, whereas C-terminal interactions with heparin/heparan sulfate regulate elastin deposition. These data highlight how heparin/heparan sulfate controls fibrillin-1 interactions. Fibrillin-1 N- and C-terminal heparin binding sites have been characterized.

Fibrillin-1 is a large glycoprotein that assembles pericellularly into microfibrils that have a complex recurring bead construction and are widespread in elastic tissues, such as skin, lung, arteries, and ligaments (1.Hubmacher D.

In all cases, cDNA sequencing and mass spectrometry confirmed the DNA and protein sequences, respectively (not shown).Gel filtration chromatography was used to ensure that only monomeric recombinant fragments were used in all experiments. Recombinant fragments were concentrated after elution from nickel affinity chromatography, using Vivaspin columns (Sartorius), prior to separation using Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare), using an AKTA Purifier system. Monomeric protein was pooled for further experimentation. All recombinant fragments had the correct molecular mass as determined by SDS-PAGE. Fragments with N-glycosylation sites were N-glycosylated, as determined by treatment with PNGase F (New England Biolabs). In some experiments, PF12, PF13, and PF16 were pretreated with trypsin for 10–120 min before SDS-PAGE analysis.Our initial PF16-expressing 293-EBNA cultures produced two bands (see Fig. 3A), which were shown by mass spectrometry to correspond to intact PF16 plus a large cleavage fragment lacking some C-terminal sequence (designated PF16trunc). PF16 was separated from PF16trunc using S200 size fractionation. Some transfected 293-EBNA cultures expressed recombinant PF16trunc only, as judged by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry. Both PF16trunc preparations gave similar results in binding assays and solution studies.FIGURE 3BIAcore analysis of interactions of heparin with C-terminal fibrillin-1 fragments.A, SDS-PAGE showing recombinant PF16 and PF16trunc fragments run in reducing conditions and corresponding tryptic peptides identified by mass spectrometry.

This approach gave theoretical sedimentation coefficients and hydrodynamic radius measurements that were compared with those derived from analytical ultracentrifugation.Analysis of Fibrillin-1 Fragments by Multiangle Laser Light Scattering—Monomeric recombinant fibrillin-1 fragments were isolated by Superdex 200 gel filtration (GE Healthcare). Samples eluting from the column passed through a Wyatt EOS 18-angle light scattering detector fitted with a 688-nm laser and an Optilab r-EX refractometer. The solute Mr and Rh values were determined using in-line multiangle laser light scattering attached to a (quasielastic) QELS and a differential refractometer (Wyatt Technology Corp.).Analysis of the relationship between Rh and solute molecular mass provided details of the size and shape of C-terminal fibrillin-1 and how these parameters are affected by fragment mass. For a single molecule, a rodlike conformation gives an approximated α value of 1, whereas a compact symmetrical structure gives an approximated α value of 0.33. For each fibrillin-1 mass value, the slope α was calculated from the coordinates of the tangent fitted by regression analysis of the 10 surrounding mass values.Modeling—Fibrilllin-1 oligomers were represented as an assembly of spheres using the equation set out by Bloomfield et al. (21.Bloomfield V. Dalton W.O. Vanholde K.E. Biopolymers. 1967; 5: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), which allows the calculation of theoretical friction values (f) for molecules of known shape.

Biochem. 2004; 332: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). First, reductive amination with ammonia and then biotin was coupled to the free amines. Heparin species dp24 (0.1 mg) were dissolved in 2 m NH4Cl, in a volume of 100 μl. 2 mg of NaCNBH3 was added, and the mixture was heated at 70 °C for 2 days. After cooling, the mixture was dialyzed extensively into Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Cambrex). 10 μl of 3 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin) (Pierce), was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The nonreacted biotin was then removed by further dialysis into 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5.BIAcore Analysis of Heparin Interactions with Fibrillin-1 Fragments—For kinetic binding studies of dp24 heparin saccharides with fibrillin-1 by surface plasmon resonance, a Biacore biosensor was used (Biacore 3000; GE Healthcare). Biotinylated heparin fragments were immobilized onto commercially prepared SA sensor chips, which have preimmobilized streptavidin, to allow biotin capture. Using heparin concentrations of 1 μm, typically 150–200 response units of biotinylated heparin samples were immobilized, which was at a saturation level. Samples were applied to the sensor chip surface in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5. All subsequent binding experiments were performed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% surfactant P20 (designated HBS-Ca). Protein fragments were injected at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 μg/ml at a flow rate of 12 μl/min. Samples were injected for 12 min and dissociated for 10 min, before the chip was regenerated using 5 mm NaOH, 1 m NaCl twice for 1 min each and then stabilized for 10 min using HBS-Ca, before the next injection. After subtraction of each response value from the blank cell, association and dissociation rate constants were determined by global data analysis. Initially, all curves were fitted using a 1:1 Langmuir association/dissociation model (BIAevaluation 4.1; GE Healthcare). This model was found to fit the data for all of the protein fragments very well, apart from PF1 and PF4, with low χ2 values. χ2 values are a standard statistical measure of the closeness of fit (mean square of the signal noise).Because of very high binding responses, PF1 and PF4 binding to heparin was calculated independently using equilibrium analysis. The equilibrium response was plotted against concentration, and nonlinear regression using the equation for one-site binding used to calculate KD.BIAcore Analysis of Fibrillin-1 Fragment Interactions with Tropoelastin and MAGP-1—Tropoelastin was immobilized onto CM5 sensor chips by amine coupling using 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride, N-hydroxysuccinimide, and ethanolamine-HCl, as described by the manufacturer (12.Rock M.J. Cain S.A. Freeman L.J. Morgan A. Mellody K. Marson A. Shuttleworth C.A. Weiss A.S. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23748-23758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and gave ∼12,000 response units. Subsequent binding experiments were performed in HBS-Ca. PF12, PF13, or PF16 fragments were then injected at concentration ranges of 0.5–5 μg/ml for 3 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Curves were fitted using 1:1 Langmuir association/dissociation model (BIAevaluation 4.1; GE Healthcare).To investigate the kinetics of interactions between the fibrillin protein fragments and MAGP-1, MAGP-1 was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip via amine coupling, as described (12.Rock M.J. Cain S.A. Freeman L.J. Morgan A. Mellody K. Marson A. Shuttleworth C.A. Weiss A.S. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23748-23758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); PF1 and deletion constructs Ex1F-11, Ex3–11, and Ex4–11 were then injected at concentration ranges of 1–20 μg/ml at a flow rate 12 μl/min. To calculate the equilibrium constant, equilibrium response was plotted against concentration, in the same method as described above for heparin interactions. Each binding interaction was performed in triplicate.Solid Phase Binding and Inhibition Assays—Flat bottomed microtiter plates were coated with tropoelastin or with PF12, PF13, or PF16 at 100 nm in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 (TBS-Ca), overnight at 4 °C, as described (12.Rock M.J. Cain S.A. Freeman L.J. Morgan A. Mellody K. Marson A. Shuttleworth C.A. Weiss A.S. Kielty C.M. J. Biol.

Nonspecific binding sites were then blocked with TBS-Ca containing 4% BSA at room temperature for at least 2 h. The plates were washed three times with TBS-Ca, 0.1% BSA and incubated with 100 nm biotinylated PF12, PF13, or PF16, with or without preincubation with heparin in TBS-Ca, overnight at 4 °C. After a further three washes, plates were incubated with 1:200 dilution of extravidin peroxidase conjugate at room temperature for 15 min. Bound protein was quantified after four more washes by a colorimetric assay using 40 mm 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) solution (Sigma) for 10–20 min at room temperature. Plates were read at a wavelength of 405 nm. Control wells with the first nonbiotinylated soluble ligand not added were incubated in TBS-Ca only. For both methods, wells were then washed four times, and the color was developed. Any nonspecific fibrillin-1 binding was detected by blocking wells before incubation with BSA only. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and all assays were repeated at least twice to confirm observed results.Cells and Cell Culture—HDFs were obtained from Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR) and were used up to passage 6. They were cultured in modified Eagle's medium + Earle's + l-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids (100×), minimum Eagle's medium vitamins (100×), 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 μg/ml penicillin, 5 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 up to passage 6. Wild-type rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; wild-type, syndecan-4 null), and CHOK1 and CHO761 cells were available in the Couchman laboratory.Cell Attachment Assays—Cell attachment assays were performed using 24-well plates coated with recombinant fibrillin-1 PF1 fragment, as previously reported (9.Bax D.V. Mahalingam Y. Cain S. Mellody K. Freeman L. Younger K. Shuttleworth C.A. Humphries M.J. Couchman J.R. Kielty C.M. J.

Bound cells were quantified by incubating with 15 μm the fluorescent dye Calcein (Invitrogen) and then measuring in a Fluostar Galaxy plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies) at 485-nm excitation and 520-nm emission. Relative cell attachment was determined by comparison with known numbers of cells added to uncoated, unblocked wells. In all experiments, triplicate wells were used. Data were statistically analyzed using unpaired Student's t tests (GraphPad Prism 2.0). Error bars represent S.D. values of the three experiments. Results were statistically significant when p was <0.05 (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.001; ***, p < 0.0001).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Spread cells were fixed after 2 h or 2 h 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells to be stained for focal adhesion kinase were fixed and permeabilized in ice cold methanol. Primary antibodies used were a monoclonal paxillin antibody Z035 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology), monoclonal vinculin antibody hVin1 (Sigma), and polyclonal anti-focal adhesion kinase antibody BC3 (Upstate Biotechnology). Double fluorescence microscopy was performed using the described antibodies, followed by incubation with appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies and phalloidin (Alexa Fluor 488/568; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Samples were analyzed on an Olympus AX70 fluorescence microscope (Olympus; objectives, UPlanApo ×40, 1.0 numerical aperture oil iris, UPlanApo ×60, 1.4 numerical aperture oil). Images were captured with a SPOT Insight Mono digital camera and processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.Focal plaque formation was analyzed using immunofluorescence microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2091359566,"Background Ear infection or otitis media (OM) accounts for most bacterial respiratory infections in children in both developed and developing nations. Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the major OM pathogens. However, little is known about the genetic basis of bacterial OM largely due to practical difficulties in conducting research in ear infection models and genetically manipulating clinical isolates. Here, we report the first genome-scale in vivo screen for bacterial genes required for ear infection in a chinchilla model by signature tagged mutagenesis (STM), a high throughput mutant screen technique. Methodology/Principal Findings STM strains were constructed with a multi-drug resistant OM isolate ST556 (serotype 19F) and screened in a chinchilla OM model. Out of 5,280 mutants tested, 248 mutants were substantially underrepresented in the mutant pools recovered from the middle ear fluids of the infected chinchillas, indicating the impaired ability to survive and replicate in the middle ears due to genetic disruptions in the chromosome of strain ST556. Further DNA sequencing analysis mapped the mutations to 169 pneumococcal genes. Surprisingly, only 52 of these genes were required for pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization in a murine model. This infection site-specific gene requirement was verified by targeted mutagenesis in the selected genes. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that there are a subset of pneumococcal genes required for ear infection and that these may be distinct from those required for nasal colonization. Our data thus provide comprehensive gene targets for mechanistic understanding of pneumococcal ear infection. Finally, this study has also developed a model for future genome-scale search for virulence determinants in other pathogens associated with ear infections."
https://openalex.org/W2155647627,"Anticoagulant heparan sulfate proteoglycans bind and activate antithrombin by virtue of a specific 3-O-sulfated pentasaccharide. They not only occur in the vascular wall but also in extravascular tissues, such as the ovary, where their functions remain unknown. The rupture of the ovarian follicle at ovulation is one of the most striking examples of tissue remodeling in adult mammals. It involves tightly controlled inflammation, proteolysis, and fibrin deposition. We hypothesized that ovarian heparan sulfates may modulate these processes through interactions with effector proteins. Our previous work has shown that anticoagulant heparan sulfates are synthesized by rodent ovarian granulosa cells, and we now have set out to characterize heparan sulfates from human follicular fluid. Here we report the first anticoagulant heparan sulfate purified from a natural human extravascular source. Heparan sulfate chains were fractionated according to their affinity for antithrombin, and their structure was analyzed by 1H NMR and MS/MS. We find that human follicular fluid is a rich source of anticoagulant heparan sulfate, comprising 50.4% of total heparan sulfate. These antithrombin-binding chains contain more than 6% 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residues, convey an anticoagulant activity of 2.5 IU/ml to human follicular fluid, and have an anti-Factor Xa specific activity of 167 IU/mg. The heparan sulfate chains that do not bind antithrombin surprisingly exhibit an extremely high content in 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residues, which suggest that they may exhibit biological activities through interactions with other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2054910277,"Divalent metal ions play a critical role in the removal of N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins by methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP). Being an essential enzyme for bacteria, MetAP is an appealing target for the development of novel antibacterial drugs. Although purified enzyme can be activated by several divalent metal ions, the exact metal ion used by MetAP in cells is unknown. Many MetAP inhibitors are highly potent on purified enzyme, but they fail to show significant inhibition of bacterial growth. One possibility for the failure is a disparity of the metal used in activation of purified MetAP and the metal actually used by MetAP inside bacterial cells. Therefore, the challenge is to elucidate the physiologically relevant metal for MetAP and discover MetAP inhibitors that can effectively inhibit cellular MetAP. We have recently discovered MetAP inhibitors with selectivity toward different metalloforms of Escherichia coli MetAP, and with these unique inhibitors, we characterized their inhibition of MetAP enzyme activity in a cellular environment. We observed that only inhibitors that are selective for the Fe(II)-form of MetAP were potent in this assay. Further, we found that only these Fe(II)-form selective inhibitors showed significant inhibition of growth of five E. coli strains and two Bacillus strains. We confirmed their cellular target as MetAP by analysis of N-terminal processed and unprocessed recombinant glutathione S-transferase proteins. Therefore, we conclude that Fe(II) is the likely metal used by MetAP in E. coli and other bacterial cells.

Methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) 2The abbreviations used are: MetAP, methionine aminopeptidase; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 2The abbreviations used are: MetAP, methionine aminopeptidase; GST, glutathione S-transferase. plays a critical role in maturation of proteins by catalyzing removal of the N-terminal initiator methionine from nascent proteins (1.Bradshaw R.A. Brickey W.W. Walker K.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 263-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Consistent with this role is the ubiquitous presence of the enzyme in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and N-terminal methionine excision affects between 55 and 70% of proteins (2.Giglione C. Boularot A. Meinnel T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1455-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). MetAP is coded by a single gene in bacteria (type I or type II), while eukaryotic cells have both type I and type II MetAP enzymes. The lethal effect of MetAP gene deletion has been reported for Escherichia coli (3.Chang S.Y. McGary E.C. Chang S. J.

In addition, some anticancer compounds, such as fumagillin and bengamides, are potent inhibitors of mammalian MetAPs, possibly due to the involvement of MetAPs in angiogenesis and cell proliferation (7.Griffith E.C.

Purified MetAP apoenzyme can be reproducibly activated by a number of divalent metal ions, such as Co(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), and Fe(II) (11.D'Souza V.M. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11079-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 12.Li J.Y. Chen L.L. Cui Y.M. Luo Q.L. Li J. Nan F.J. Ye Q.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Among them, Co(II) is one of the best activators of the enzyme, and many MetAP inhibitors were discovered by screening on purified MetAP with high Co(II) concentrations in the activity assay (13.Schiffmann R. Heine A. Klebe G. Klein C.D. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 3620-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Several x-ray structures of MetAP with or without an inhibitor bound showed that the catalytic site is a shallow pocket with two Co(II) ions situated at the bottom for a dinuclear arrangement (14.Lowther W.T. Matthews B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). A protein or peptide substrate is believed to bind to the catalytic site with its N-terminal methionine and coordinate with the Co(II) ions around its scissile bond. A water molecule, often seen bridging the two Co(II) ions, attacks the scissile bond during the hydrolysis (15.Lowther W.T. Orville A.M. Madden D.T. Lim S. Rich D.H. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7678-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16.Lowther W.T. Zhang Y. Sampson P.B. Honek J.F. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14810-14819Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A modified mechanism based on a single metal ion at the active site is also proposed (17.Copik A.J. Swierczek S.I.

Although there is no question for a central role of divalent metal ions in catalysis, possibility exists that a divalent metal ion other than Co(II) may function as the activating metal for MetAP in a physiologically relevant environment. Walker and Bradshaw were the first who questioned the metal identity with observation of activation of S. cerevisiae MetAP in the presence of a physiological concentration of reduced glutathione and suggested the possibility of Zn(II) as the cofactor for yeast MetAP (19.Walker K.W. Bradshaw R.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2684-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recent theoretical calculation also favors Zn(II) as the cofactor (20.Leopoldini M. Russo N. Toscano M. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 7776-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Based on whole cell metal analyses and activity measurements of purified enzyme under anaerobic condition, D'Souza and Holz (11.D'Souza V.M. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11079-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) suggested that E. coli MetAP functions as a Fe(II) enzyme. Wang et al. (21.Wang J. Sheppard G.S. Lou P. Kawai M. Park C. Egan D.A. Schneider A. Bouska J. Lesniewski R. Henkin J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5035-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) analyzed inhibition of MetAP by two MetAP inhibitors, one non-selective for different metalloforms and the other lack of inhibition on the Mn(II)-form, and concluded that human type II MetAP is a Mn(II) enzyme.Potent MetAP inhibitors have been identified, but none of the inhibitors have shown significant antibacterial activity (13.Schiffmann R. Heine A. Klebe G. Klein C.D. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 3620-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22.Oefner C. Douangamath A. D'Arcy A. Hafeli S. Mareque D. Mac Sweeney A.

Li Y. Lushington G.H. Ye Q.Z. Nan F.J. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although most of the current MetAP inhibitors inhibit the Co(II)-form of MetAP effectively, their potency on other metalloforms often has not been characterized. We reported that potent inhibitors of the Co(II)-form may or may not inhibit other MetAP metalloforms with a metal ion other than Co(II) at the catalytic site (12.Li J.Y. Chen L.L. Cui Y.M. Luo Q.L. Li J. Nan F.J. Ye Q.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24.Ye Q.Z. Xie S.X. Huang M. Huang W.J. Lu J.P. Ma Z.Q. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13940-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that lack of antibacterial activity by MetAP inhibitors is due to their inability to inhibit MetAP inside bacterial cells. It becomes critical to elucidate the native metal used by MetAP inside cells and identify MetAP inhibitors that can effectively inhibit the cellular MetAP.By using high throughput screening of large chemical libraries, we have previously identified several small molecule MetAP inhibitors with high potency and superb selectivity toward either the Co(II)-form or the Mn(II)-form of E. coli MetAP (24.Ye Q.Z. Xie S.X. Huang M. Huang W.J. Lu J.P. Ma Z.Q. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13940-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, we discovered additional inhibitors with selectivity for the Fe(II)-form of E. coli MetAP. 3Wang, W.-L., Chai, S. C., Huang, M., He, H. Z., and Ye, Q.-Z. (2008) J. Med. Chem. in press. 3Wang, W.-L., Chai, S. C., Huang, M., He, H. Z., and Ye, Q.-Z. (2008) J. Med. Chem. in press. With these unique MetAP inhibitors available as research tools, we established a novel MetAP enzyme activity assay using live E. coli cells and characterized these metalloform-selective inhibitors on this cellular MetAP activity assay. We demonstrated that the Fe(II)-form selective inhibitors inhibit not only the cellular MetAP activity but also growth of bacterial cells. These findings shed important lights on the development of MetAP inhibitors as useful therapeutics.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Fluorogenic substrate, Met-AMC, is a methionine derivatized with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC), which was purchased from Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA). Resazurin dye was purchased from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ). Mueller Hinton broth and agar were purchased from Remel Products (Lenexa, KS). The pBACE vector with the cGSTA1 insert was generously provided by Prof. Ming F. Tam at Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The recombinant E. coli MetAP was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as an apoenzyme (12.Li J.Y. Chen L.L. Cui Y.M. Luo Q.L. Li J. Nan F.J. Ye Q.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Bacterial Strains—Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, and E. coli ATCC 25922 were acquired from Fisher Scientific. E. coli strains D22 (26.Normark S. Boman H.G. Matsson E. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 1334-1342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RL25 (27.Lathe R. Buc H. Lecocq J.P. Bautz E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1980; 77: 3548-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center at Yale. E. coli AS19 strain was obtained as a gift from Prof. Liam Good at Karolinska Institute. Strain AS19 has a severely depleted lipopolysaccharides (LPS) layer (28.Zorzopulos J. de Long S. Chapman V. Kozloff L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 52: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but its exact mutation is unknown.MetAP Activity and Inhibition Assay on Purified Enzyme—Enzyme activity was monitored by fluorescence on a Spectra-Max Gemini XPS plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), following hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate Met-AMC (λex 360 nm, λem 460) at room temperature (12.Li J.Y. Chen L.L. Cui Y.M. Luo Q.L. Li J. Nan F.J. Ye Q.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24.Ye Q.Z. Xie S.X. Huang M. Huang W.J. Lu J.P. Ma Z.Q.

Lett. 2005; 15: 5386-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All kinetic experiments were carried out on 384-well plates with an 80-μl assay volume. The IC50 values were calculated from non-linear regression curve fitting of percent inhibitions as a function of inhibitor concentrations.Cellular MetAP Activity and Inhibition Assay—BL21(DE3) cells overexpressing the recombinant E. coli MetAP were let to grow to exponential phase, harvested, and washed twice with water. The final cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mm CaCl2 in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and then an equal volume of glycerol was added. The cell suspension was aliquoted and kept at –80 °C for storage. For the cellular MetAP activity assay, the cell suspension was diluted 400-fold with 10 mm CaCl2 in 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5). The cells, substrate Met-AMC, and inhibitor at 12 serial concentrations were combined in wells of a 384-well plate. The final assay volume was 80 μl with 150 μm Met-AMC, 5 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Production of AMC was monitored via fluorescence (λex 360 nm, λem 460) at room temperature every 2 min for 6–8 h. The IC50 values were calculated from the rate of substrate hydrolysis within the first 4 h.Inhibition of Bacterial Growth—The assay was carried out on 384-well plates containing 12 serial concentrations for each inhibitor (the highest final concentration in the assay was 1 mm). A suspension of bacterial cells grown to exponential phase in Mueller Hinton medium was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland optical density (30.National Committee for Clinical Laboratory StandardsMethods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically, Approved Standard M7-A4. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Wayne, PA2000Google Scholar) and then further diluted by 1000-fold in the same medium containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The cell suspension was dispensed into the microplate by Multidrop Combi reagent dispenser (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). In the case of E. coli AS19, 40 μl of cell culture was dispensed into 40 μl of inhibitor, and cell growth was monitored by absorbance at 600 nm using a SpectraMax 340PC384 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Because of excessive variation of absorbance at 600 nm for other bacterial strains, analysis of these strains was carried out by monitoring fluorescence by including resazurin with the cells (31.Sarker S.D. Nahar L. Kumarasamy Y. Methods. 2007; 42: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Inhibitor (20 μl), cells (40 μl), and resazurin dye (450 μm, 20 μl) were mixed. The conversion from resazurin to resofurin was monitored kinetically by fluorescence (λex 530 nm and λem 590 nm) using a SpectraMax Gemini XPS plate reader. Both absorbance and fluorescence kinetic experiments were carried out for 10 h at 37 °C, with readings taken every 5 min. Signal intensities at time points along the exponential phase of the growth curve corresponding to 50–85% of total intensity of an uninhibited sample were averaged and converted to percent inhibitions to calculate IC50 values by non-linear regression curve fitting. MIC values were calculated as the concentration of compound resulting in 90% inhibition of cell growth.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Glutathione S-Transferase—E. coli AS19 cells were transformed with the pBACE expression vector encoding for chicken liver glutathione S-transferase A1–1 with a phenylalanine to alanine substitution at position 111 (32.Liu L.F. Liaw Y.C. Tam M.F. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When cells reached exponential phase in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, the cells were diluted by 10,000-fold into an induction medium described by Craig et al. (33.Craig 3rd, S.P. Yuan L. Kuntz D.A. McKerrow J.H. Wang C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to grow at 25 °C for an additional 50 h in the presence or absence of an inhibitor. Harvested cells were resuspended in PBS buffer containing 5 mm EDTA and lysed by French press. The glutathione S-transferase proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a GSTrap HP column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). After washing impurities out of the column with PBS buffer, the recombinant proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris containing 20 mm glutathione, pH 7.8.Characterization of N-terminal Processed and Unprocessed Glutathione S-Transferases by Mass Spectrometry and N-terminal Sequencing—Purified proteins were incubated with 5 mm dithiothreitol to remove protein-bound glutathione, after which the sample was dialyzed into deionized water. The proteins dissolved in a solution containing 50% methanol and 3% acetic acid were injected into an Agilent G1946B mass spectrometer interfaced with an electrospray ionization source in the positive mode. Deconvoluted mass spectrum was obtained with the software MagTran (34.Zhang Z. Marshall A.G. J. Am Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The first six amino acids at the N terminus of glutathione S-transferase purified from AS19 cells grown in the presence of inhibitor 6 were identified by Edman sequencing as a service by Alphalyse (Palo Alto, CA).Physicochemical Calculation of the Compounds—The program ALOGPs was used to compute the calculated logP of the compounds (35.Tetko I.V. Gasteiger J. Todeschini R. Mauri A. Livingstone D. Ertl P. Palyulin V.A. Radchenko E.V. Zefirov N.S. Makarenko A.S. Tanchuk V.Y. Prokopenko V.V. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2005; 19: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Physicochemical parameters describing Lipinski's rule of five (such as molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors, and acceptors) were evaluated by Molinspiration Property Calculation Service.RESULTSDevelopment of a Cell-based MetAP Enzyme Activity Assay—To evaluate the ability of a compound to inhibit MetAP inside cells, we employed a strategy to make live E. coli cells permeable to small molecules, including substrates and inhibitors, and to assess inhibition by the compound when MetAP carries out hydrolysis of its substrate in a cellular environment. Ca(II) cation has been widely used to make bacterial cells permeable for molecules as big and charged as DNA molecules during bacterial transformation (36.Dagert M. Ehrlich S.D. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 6: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 37.Brass J.M. Boos W. Hengge R. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 10-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tris also enhances outer-membrane permeability, making bacteria more sensitive to antibiotics (38.Irvin R.T. MacAlister T.J. Costerton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1397-1403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We overexpressed E. coli MetAP protein in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and used the recombinant MetAP still inside live bacterial cells as the enzyme reagent. Ca(II) is not a MetAP activator and does not inhibit purified MetAP enzyme. With the cells suspended in 50 mm Tris buffer, we investigated the effect of Ca(II) on cell permeability by monitoring fluorescence from hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate Met-AMC (Fig. 1). Clearly, no significant amount of fluorescence was detectable when Ca(II) was below 10 μm, possibly due to inability of the substrate Met-AMC to pass though intact cell membranes. As CaCl2 concentration increases, rate of hydrolysis of Met-AMC accelerates as reflected by change of fluorescence with increasing amounts of CaCl2. The rate reached maximum at around 200 μm of CaCl2 and maintained at that level to 10 mm of CaCl2, suggesting easy penetration of Met-AMC into the cells at this concentration range. We chose a condition of 5 mm CaCl2 and 50 mm Tris in our following cellular enzyme activity assay.Inhibition of the Enzymatic Activity of MetAP in the Cell-based Assay—We have previously observed MetAP inhibitors that are either selective for the Mn(II)-form of E. coli MetAP or the Co(II)-form (24.Ye Q.Z. Xie S.X. Huang M. Huang W.J. Lu J.P. Ma Z.Q. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13940-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, no compounds in either of the two classes have significant inhibitory activity for the Fe(II)-form. Therefore, we carried out a high throughput screening campaign recently with a Fe(II)-activated E. coli MetAP and identified another unique class of MetAP inhibitors with both high potency and selectivity for the Fe(II)-form.3 We selected two compounds from each of the three metalloform-selective inhibitor classes (1 and 2 selective for the Mn(II)-form, 3 and 4 for the Co(II)-form, and 5 and 6 selective for the Fe(II)-form) and characterized them on the newly established cellular MetAP enzyme activity assay in comparison with their inhibitory activity on the purified enzymes activated by Co(II), Mn(II), or Fe(II) (Table 1). No inhibitory activity was detectable at the highest concentration (1 mm) for the Co(II)-form and the Mn(II)-form selective inhibitors (1–4) in this cellular MetAP assay. In contrast, the Fe(II)-form selective inhibitors (5 and 6) displayed significant inhibition, indicating that Fe(II) ion is likely the metal used by MetAP in the cellular environment. X-ray structures of E. coli MetAP in complex with these inhibitors (39.Xie S.X. Huang W.J. Ma Z.Q. Huang M. Hanzlik R.P. Ye Q.Z. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)3 confirm that they directly interact with the enzyme at the active site.TABLE 1Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of MetAP in purified form and in cellular environment by metalloform-selective MetAP inhibitors 1–6a Metal concentrations used to activate the enzyme: Co(II), 100 μm; Mn(II), 100 μm; and Fe(II), 6 μm.b Values reported in Ref. 29.Huang Q.Q.

Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Growth of E. coli and Bacillus Strains—Because of the importance of post-translational modification by MetAP, it is conceivable that MetAP inhibition will lead to inhibition of bacterial cell growth. Five E. coli strains and two Bacillus strains were selected for such testing. Among the E. coli strains, ATCC25922 is a wild-type strain, while AS19, D22, RL25, and RL436 have different mutations that make their membrane more permeable to small molecules (26.Normark S. Boman H.G. Matsson E. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 1334-1342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Lathe R. Buc H. Lecocq J.P. Bautz E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3548-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28.Zorzopulos J. de Long S. Chapman V. Kozloff L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 52: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Two wild-type Bacillus strains (B. subtilis and B. megaterium) were also included because they are Gram-positive with a membrane structure different from that of Gram-negative E. coli. Inhibition of growth was determined in a quantitative way by calculating IC50 values for bacteria that grow in wells of a 384-well microplate according to continuous absorbance readings (600 nm, for AS19) or continuous fluorescence readings (λex 530 nm, λem 590, for the other 6 strains). Consistent with their ability to inhibit MetAP in the cellular assay, the Fe(II)-form selective inhibitors 5 and 6 inhibited all of the seven strains tested (Table 2). Generally, the IC50 values are lower for the Gram-positive Bacillus couple, compared with the Gram-negative E. coli strains. Although all E. coli strains were inhibited, strain D22 with membrane mutation was the most susceptible to compounds 5 and 6. It is important to note that none of the Co(II)-form and Mn(II)-form selective inhibitors 1–4 showed any detectable inhibitory activity under the same condition. This growth inhibition was tested in the presence of 50 mm Tris to increase cell permeability to small molecules (38.Irvin R.T. MacAlister T.J. Costerton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1397-1403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compounds 5 and 6 were also tested in the absence of Tris on E. coli ATCC 25922, and they both showed reduced but still significant antibacterial activity on the wild-type E. coli cells (281 μm and 179 μm, respectively).TABLE 2Inhibition of growth of some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains by metalloform-selective MetAP inhibitors 1–6Bacterial strainInhibition of bacterial cell growth (IC50, μm)aInhibitors 1-4 showed no inhibition for all seven strains tested at the highest concentration of 1 mm.,bValues in parentheses are MIC in mg/liter.56E. coli AS19117 (91)15 (7)E. coli D226 (4)9 (3)E. coli RL25107 (54)90 (41)E. coli RL436113 (33)52 (15)E. coli ATCC 25922110 (65)58 (30)B. subtilis67 (41)22 (8)B. megaterium70 (73)15 (13)a Inhibitors 1-4 showed no inhibition for all seven strains tested at the highest concentration of 1 mm.b Values in parentheses are MIC in mg/liter. Open table in a new tab Confirmation of the Cellular Target as MetAP Enzyme by Analysis of Recombinant GST—To make a connection between observed inhibition of bacterial cell growth to inhibition of MetAP enzyme activity inside bacterial cells, we used a construct that expresses recombinant GST and measured the ratio of N-terminal processed and unprocessed GSTs as an indication of MetAP inhibition in cells. N-terminal methionine residue of chicken liver GST was efficiently removed when the protein was expressed in E. coli (32.Liu L.F. Liaw Y.C. Tam M.F. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and analysis of the extent of N-terminal processing of the recombinant GST will provide the important information of MetAP inhibition under physiological conditions. E. coli cells harboring the GST-expressing plasmid were cultured at sublethal concentrations of either inhibitor 5 or inhibitor 6, and bacterial cell growth was retarded with the concomitant accumulation of unprocessed glutathione S-transferase protein. Both processed and unprocessed GST proteins were purified from cell extracts by affinity chromatography, and processed and unprocessed GST proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2). The deconvoluted spectra shows two peaks with masses 26114, corresponding to the processed GST, and 26245, corresponding to the unprocessed GST, and the mass difference of 131 is a shift due to a methionine residue. In the absence of 5 or 6, almost all of the GST was processed, and only the protein missing the first methionine was detected. In contrast, significant amount of unprocessed GST was accumulating in the sample derived from cells cultured with 5 or 6, consistent with the inhibition of the N-terminal processing by MetAP in the presence of the Fe(II)-form selective inhibitors. The same sample collected in the presence of 6 was analyzed by Edman degradation for the first six amino acids at the N terminus, the sequence obtained was mixture of Met-Ala-Ala-Lys-Pro-Val and Ala-Ala-Lys-Pro-Val, validating presence of the processed and unprocessed proteins.FIGURE 2Effect of inhibition of MetAP on N-terminal processing of recombinant GST protein.A, ESI-MS protonation multiplicity spectra of a mixture of processed and unprocessed GST with charge states ranging from +19 to +"
https://openalex.org/W2082478137,"It is widely reported that the Ca2+ increase following nonspecific cell membrane permeabilization is among the earliest biochemical modifications in cells exposed to toxic amyloid aggregates. However, more recently receptors with Ca2+ channel activity such as α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA), ryanodine, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors have been proposed as mediators of the Ca2+ increase in neuronal cells challenged with β-amyloid peptides. We previously showed that prefibrillar aggregates of proteins not associated with amyloid diseases are toxic to exposed cells similarly to comparable aggregates of disease-associated proteins. In particular, prefibrillar aggregates of the prokaryotic HypF-N were shown to be toxic to different cultured cell lines by eliciting Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species increases. This study was aimed at assessing whether NMDA and AMPA receptor activations could be considered a generic feature of cell interaction with amyloid aggregates rather than a specific effect of some aggregated protein. Therefore, we investigated whether NMDA and AMPA receptors were involved in the Ca2+ increase following exposure of rat cerebellar granule cells to HypF-N prefibrillar aggregates. We found that the intracellular Ca2+ increase was associated with the early activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors, although some nonspecific membrane permeabilization was also observed at longer times of exposure. This result matched a significant co-localization of the aggregates with both receptors on the plasma membrane. Our data support the possibility that glutamatergic channels are generic sites of interaction with the cell membrane of prefibrillar aggregates of different peptides and proteins as well as the key structures responsible for the resulting early membrane permeabilization to Ca2+. It is widely reported that the Ca2+ increase following nonspecific cell membrane permeabilization is among the earliest biochemical modifications in cells exposed to toxic amyloid aggregates.

In particular, prefibrillar aggregates of the prokaryotic HypF-N were shown to be toxic to different cultured cell lines by eliciting Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species increases. This study was aimed at assessing whether NMDA and AMPA receptor activations could be considered a generic feature of cell interaction with amyloid aggregates rather than a specific effect of some aggregated protein. Therefore, we investigated whether NMDA and AMPA receptors were involved in the Ca2+ increase following exposure of rat cerebellar granule cells to HypF-N prefibrillar aggregates. We found that the intracellular Ca2+ increase was associated with the early activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors, although some nonspecific membrane permeabilization was also observed at longer times of exposure. This result matched a significant co-localization of the aggregates with both receptors on the plasma membrane. Our data support the possibility that glutamatergic channels are generic sites of interaction with the cell membrane of prefibrillar aggregates of different peptides and proteins as well as the key structures responsible for the resulting early membrane permeabilization to Ca2+. Many human degenerative diseases are associated with the intracellular and/or extracellular deposition, in the affected tissues, of fibrillar aggregates arising from the ordered polymerization of specific proteins or peptides (1Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Protein aggregation can occur either in the central nervous system, where it is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer, Huntington, Parkinson, and prion diseases, or in peripheral tissues and organs, as in cardiac or systemic amyloidosis (2Stefani M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1739: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Although in the peripheral amyloidoses the accumulation of huge amounts of amyloid deposits may be directly responsible for the clinical symptoms because of the physical disruption of tissue architecture, in neurodegenerative disorders the neurotoxic effects seem to arise directly from the presence of soluble protein oligomers produced early in the fibrillization path. Actually, early oligomers have been identified as the primary toxic species for a number of amyloid diseases (3Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 2004; 11: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and shown to be cytotoxic to cells in culture (4Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar) and in tissue (5Giovannini M.G. Scali C. Prosperi C. Bellucci A. Vannucchi M.G. Rosi S. Pepeu G. Casamenti F. Neurobiol.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8160-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar); on the contrary, mature fibrils are considered as stable and substantially harmless end products of the process (7Bucciantini M.

Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar), although in some cases they can be cytotoxic as well (8Novitskaya V. Bocharova O.V. Bronstein I. Baskakov I.V. J. Biol.

Morozova-Roche L.-A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 1337-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent findings have shown that monomers can recycle within the fibril population (11Carulla N. Caddy G.L. Hall D.R. Zurdo J. Gairi M. Feliz M. Giralt E. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2005; 436: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and amyloid fibrils may undergo fragmentation (12Smith J.F. Knowles T.P.J. Dobson C.M. MacPhee C.E. Welland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15806-15811Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), increasing the concentration of free ends where further polymerization of misfolded monomers can occur. This view could support the widely accepted idea that, at least in most cases, amyloid fibrils are benign assemblies whose frequency of rupture could be related to their protective effect by clearing misfolded monomers, thus preventing their assembly into toxic oligomers. Previous papers on amyloid cytotoxicity suggest that oligomers formed by proteins and peptides not associated with any amyloid disease display a toxic behavior indistinguishable from that of comparable oligomers of proteins and peptides associated with disease (7Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 13Bucciantini M. Calloni G.

These findings suggest that, at least in most cases, cell damage by protein/peptide oligomers follows a general mechanism associated with early amyloid assemblies in the path of aggregation (14Kayed R. Sokolov Y. Edmonds B. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Hall J.E. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46363-46366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Such a view supports the notion of amyloidoses as “conformational diseases,” whereby a common mechanism of pathogenesis involves shared conformational features of amyloid assemblies of structurally different peptides and proteins. Accordingly, disease-unrelated proteins can provide a useful experimental model to study the interaction between protein oligomers and cells to better understand the generic molecular mechanisms of their cytotoxicity. It is commonly accepted that disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress are among the earliest biochemical modifications following the interaction of amyloid prefibrillar assemblies with the cell membranes (7Bucciantini M.

We have previously shown that early aggregates of HypF-N, the N-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli hydrogenase maturation factor, a protein not associated with any amyloid disease that displays a fibrillogenic pathway (7Bucciantini M.

We have also reported that the same aggregates can induce Ca2+ influx in liposomes and disrupt the ordered structure of supported lipid bilayers (20Relini A. Canale C. Torrassa S. Rolandi R.

On the other hand, recent reports support the idea that the increase of the intracellular Ca2+ levels can result as a consequence of the interaction of the β-amyloid (Aβ) 2The abbreviations used are: Aβ, β-amyloid; AcP, human muscle acylphosphatase; AMPA-R, receptor for α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid; APV, dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid; CNQX, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione; NMDA-R, receptor for N-methyl d-aspartate; HypF-N, N-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli hydrogenase maturation factor HypF; TFE, trifluoroethanol; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine. peptides with the glutamatergic NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs) (22Kelly B.L. Ferreira A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28079-28089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Aβ can also drive the loss from the cell surface of both NMDA-Rs and AMPA receptors (AMPA-Rs) (23Hsieh H. Boehm J. Sato C. Iwatsubo T. Tomita T. Sisodia S. Malinov R. Neuron. 2006; 52: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), whereas Ca2+-permeable AMPA-Rs are involved in the cell death associated with neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer disease (24Liu S.J. Zukin R.S. Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 126-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The interaction of amyloidogenic peptides and, possibly, their early aggregates with cell surface receptors such as those involved in Ca2+ trafficking can account, at least in part, for the alteration of the ion distribution across the cell membrane, although not excluding some nonspecific membrane permeabilization. In this paper we sought to elucidate some of the above issues. In particular, we investigated whether cultured rat cerebellar granule cells are damaged by HypF-N amyloid aggregates, whether cell damage is accomplished via a nonspecific pathway or through aggregate interaction with specific cell surface receptors, and whether NMDA-Rs and AMPA-Rs are involved in the biochemical modifications resulting from cell exposure to HypF-N or muscle acylphosphatase (AcP, a related protein) aggregates. To this purpose, we measured the Ca2+ influx following aggregate interaction with our experimental cell model by blocking selectively the possible permeation pathways. We also investigated whether the immunoreactivity of the AMPA-Rs and/or NMDA-Rs at the cell membrane was reduced in cells exposed to the aggregates for 1 h. Our results indicate that an influx of the external Ca2+ in the exposed cells did occur and that such influx displayed two different kinetics. The co-localization experiments confirmed that the Ca2+ influx could substantially be attributed to the interaction of the early HypF-N aggregates with the glutamatergic NMDA-R and AMPA-R, similarly to previous data concerning Aβ peptides. Finally, we found a significant reduction of AMPA-R immunoreactivity in cells exposed to the aggregates for 1 h, suggesting receptor internalization following receptor-aggregate interaction. Cell Preparation—Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from 8-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Morini, Italia), as published previously (25Casagrande S. Cupello A. Pellistri F. Robello M. Neurosci. Lett. 2007; 414: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 per dish on 20-mm poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and maintained in Basal Eagle's culture medium, containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, and 25 mm KCl at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cultures were treated with 10 μm cytosine arabinoside from day 1 to minimize proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Experiments were performed in cultures between day 6 and 10 after plating. Preparation of Prefibrillar Aggregates—HypF-N and AcP were purified from an Escherichia coli expression system, as reported previously (26Taddei N. Stefani M. Magherini F. Chiti F. Modesti A. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7077-7083Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Chiti F. Bucciantini M. Capanni C. Taddei N. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). HypF-N and AcP prefibrillar aggregates were obtained by incubating each protein at room temperature at a concentration of 29 and 27 μm, respectively, in 30% trifluoroethanol (TFE), 17 mm ammonium acetate, 2.0 mm dithiothreitol, pH 5.5. Aggregation times of 12, 24, and 48 h and 7 and 8 days were considered. Sample aliquots were withdrawn at different aggregation times and added to the cell culture media (0.2–2.0 μm final protein concentration range), after TFE removal. To remove TFE, which could give rise to artifacts, the volume of the protein aliquot was reduced to 70% of its initial value by evaporation under a stream of N2 and then restored to 100% by adding the required amount of external solution. The amount of TFE still present in the sample after this treatment was about 1% of the initial value, as determined by mass spectrometry. The final TFE concentration in the cell culture media after aggregate addition was about 0.01%. Control experiments showed that such low TFE levels did not affect cell viability and did not influence the cell responses induced by protein aggregates. Fluorescence Measurements—Neurons were incubated at 37 °C for 40–45 min in a 6.0 μm solution of the cell-permeant AM ester of Oregon Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and then washed several times with 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, at room temperature. Then cultures were transferred to a recording chamber mounted onto a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. Cells were continuously perfused with the appropriate solution and were visualized using a ×100 objective in oil (N.A. 1.3). The fluorescence signal, including real time changes of the internal calcium concentration after the addition of protein aggregates, was detected using a Hamamatsu digital CCD camera with a 450–490-nm excitation filter, a 505-nm dichroic mirror, and a 520-nm emission filter (Nikon Italia, Florence, Italy). Images were acquired with the Simple PCI software (Compix Imaging Systems, Hamamatsu Corp., Sewickley, PA). Fluorescence intensity was calculated in arbitrary units by building a scale of the pixel intensity; to this purpose, only pixels located in the region of interest were considered. Fluorescence intensity changes were calculated as (F - F0) × 100/F0, where F was the fluorescence intensity measured after stimulation and F0 the basal fluorescence level. Measurements in the presence of antagonists of glutamatergic receptors were performed using memantine, CNQX, and APV purchased from Sigma. Confocal Fluorescence Measurements—The co-localization of HypF-N prefibrillar aggregates with NMDA-Rs or AMPA-Rs was tested in cerebellar granule neurons treated for 10 min with 24-h aged protein aggregates (0.2 μm soluble protein concentration) at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and fixed with 2.0% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 22 °C. After rinsing, cells were incubated with a blocking solution (0.2% gelatin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 20 min at 22 °C. Cells requiring membrane permeabilization were kept in ice-cold acetone for 1.0 min before the blocking step or incubated with the blocking solution supplemented with 0.2% saponin for 20 min. Neurons were then incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti-NMDA-R type 2B antibody (1:800) (MAI-2014, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), or a monoclonal mouse anti-GluR2 AMPA-R subunit antibody (1:800) (MAB397, Chemicon International Inc.), or a polyclonal goat anti-gp91 phox C-15 (1:400) (sc-5827, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), together with a polyclonal rabbit anti-HypF-N antibody (1:100) (provided by Primm S.r.l. Milan, Italy) for 1.0 h at room temperature. After repeated washing, the coverslips were incubated with a secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:400) (Molecular Probes) (for HypF-N aggregates), or a secondary Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:400) (Molecular Probes) (for NMDA-R and AMPA-R), or a secondary Cy3-conjugated anti-goat antibody (1:400) (Molecular Probes) (for gp91 phox) for 1.0 h at room temperature. In control experiments, the primary antibodies were omitted from the labeling process. After repeated washing, the coverslips were mounted on the stage of a Leica TCS SP5 confocal scanning microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany) equipped with a HeNe/Ar laser source for fluorescence measurements. The observations were performed using a Leica Plan Apo 63× oil immersion objective. To minimize cross-talk between fluorochromes, sequential scanning was performed at excitation wavelengths of 488 and 543 nm. Series of optical sections (1024 × 1024 pixels, pixel size 204 nm) 0.5 μm in thickness were taken through the cells at 0.4-μm intervals. Confocal stacks were then resized to 4096 × 4096 pixel size (pixel size 51 nm) and then filtered with an FFT-based bandpass filter to cut background noise (structures down to 20 μm and up to 153 nm). For each sample, 20 optical sections were superimposed into a single composite image. For all channels a threshold value was used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The co-localization of NMDA-R, AMPA-R, and gp91 phox with HypF-N aggregates on the cell membrane was estimated on regions of interest (70-μm side, 12–13 cells per selected area) in three-dimensional confocal stacks, using a specially developed algorithm (28Costes S.V. Daelemans D. Cho E.H. Dobbin Z. Pavlakis G. Lockett S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3993-4003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). In particular, we used ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda) and JACOP plugin (rsb.info.nih.gov) software. To measure a possible HypF-N-induced reduction of cell surface receptors, cells were treated for 1 h with prefibrillar aggregates. Neurons were counterstained for the cell membrane with TRITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin for 20 min at room temperature, fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained for NMDA-Rs or AMPA-Rs as described above. The cells were then washed and incubated with a Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:500. Finally, cells were processed for confocal microscopy as indicated above. Cell surface-associated receptor fluorescence was quantified after cell borders were defined by using the contrast phase and the counterstaining images. Twenty or more cells from at least two independent preparations were analyzed for each experimental condition. The data expressed as arbitrary units of fluorescence intensity are reported as means ± S.E. For each set of experiments, the Student's test was used for statistical analysis. In all cases p values << 0.001 were considered to be significant. Aggregate internalization was detected by incubating cultured cells for 24 h in the presence of protein aggregates labeled with Texas Red as reported previously (13Bucciantini M. Calloni G. Chiti F. Formigli L. Nosi D. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31374-31382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.0 μl of a 10 mg/ml Texas Red solution in DMSO was added to 0.1 mg of protein aggregates dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature with continuous stirring, the reaction was stopped by adding 1.0 μl of 1.5 m hydroxylamine, pH 8.5. Series of optical sections were acquired at an excitation wavelength of 546 nm. Patch Clamp Measurements—In the patch clamp experiments, the membrane potential was kept at -80 mV, and membrane currents were measured with the standard whole cell patch clamp technique as described previously (25Casagrande S. Cupello A. Pellistri F. Robello M. Neurosci. Lett. 2007; 414: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The internal solution contained 124 mm CsCl, 4.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, and 3.0 mm ATP. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Trizma (Tris base). The external solution contained 120 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 20 mm BaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, and 4.0 mm 4-aminopyridine, pH 7.4. Patch electrodes were manufactured from borosilicate glass capillaries (Hilgenberg GmbH, Malsfeld, Germany) with a programmable Sachs and Flaming puller PC-84 (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). The final electrode resistance was 4.0–10 megohms when filled with the internal solution. Cell responses were filtered at 3.0 kHz and sampled at 100 Hz. Voltage stimulation and data acquisition were performed by a Labmaster D/A-A/D converter driven by pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Capacitance transient neutralization and series resistance compensation were optimized. Data analysis was performed using the pCLAMP and SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific, Ekrath, Germany). Prefibrillar Aggregates Induce a Very Fast Increase of Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration—Cerebellar granule cells loaded with Oregon Green were exposed to 0.2 μm HypF-N either in the monomeric native form or aggregated for different lengths of time. Early aggregates obtained after 24 or 48 h of incubation in the aggregation medium consisted of globular structures 2–3 nm in diameter, whereas aggregates aged for 8 days consisted mainly of mature amyloid fibrils, as reported previously (20Relini A. Canale C. Torrassa S. Rolandi R. Gliozzi A. Rosano C. Bolognesi M. Plakoutsi G. Bucciantini M. Chiti F. Stefani M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 943-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In all the cells analyzed, we observed a very fast increase of the fluorescence intensity following the addition of HypF-N early aggregates to the cell external medium. Fig. 1a (frames 1–5) shows a time sequence of fluorescence images of the same region of the sample before (frame 1) and after (frames 2–5) the addition of HypF-N aggregates aged for 24 h; the fluorescence increase is particularly evident in the marked cell. Fig. 1a, frame 6, shows the typical time course of the average fluorescence intensity, which reached a maximum in about 30 s and then decreased in 70 s, indicating membrane permeabilization. A statistical analysis of the time duration of the fluorescence responses elicited by aggregates aged 24 and 48 h is reported in Fig. 1b, showing that the peak width is larger for earlier aggregates. Remarkably, no fluorescence increase was observed when cells were exposed either to 0.2 μm monomeric soluble HypF-N (Fig. 1c) or to mature fibrils arising from HypF-N aged 8 days (Fig. 1d). However, in both cases, after washing out either the native or the aggregated protein, a fluorescence signal was detected upon subsequent addition of prefibrillar aggregates aged for 24 h (Fig. 1, c and d). These results indicate that the absence of response observed in the presence of native or fibrillar HypF-N is not because of the lack of sample integrity. Overall, our fluorescence measurements in living cells indicate that early HypF-N aggregates, but not monomeric HypF-N nor mature fibrils, induce a very rapid and transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Fluorescence Increase in Exposed Cells Results from an Influx of Extracellular Ca2+ Not Involving Voltage-dependent Calcium Channels—To assess whether the increase of intracellular Ca2+ resulted from the influx of extracellular Ca2+ or from the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores, we repeated the experiments in a Ca2+-free medium after having checked cell integrity by inducing a fluorescence response with early HypF-N aggregates (Fig. 2). In the absence of Ca2+, no fluorescence increase was recorded in cells exposed to HypF-N aggregates aged for 24 h (Fig. 2, middle) or 48 h (not shown). This suggests that the intracellular fluorescence increase did result from an influx of extracellular Ca2+. Next, we checked whether the intracellular Ca2+ increase in the exposed cells resulted from the activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels. To this purpose, we added to the external solution 50 μm Cd2+, a blocker of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. We found that the fluorescence response induced by 24-h aged aggregates was the same in the absence (Fig. 2a, left) and in the presence of Cd2+ (Fig. 2a, right, and Table 1). This result rules out the possibility that voltage-dependent calcium channels play a direct role in the observed Ca2+ influx in the exposed cells. The patch clamp technique provided further evidence that voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are not involved in the Ca2+ influx. Fig. 2b shows the calcium current-voltage curves measured in control cells and in cells incubated in the presence of protein aggregates aged 48 h. The calcium current exhibits the typical behavior previously reported for granule cells (29Amico C. Marchetti C. Nobile M. Usai C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without significant differences between cells treated with protein aggregates and control cells. Overall, the experiments reported in Fig. 2 indicate that voltage-dependent calcium channels are not involved in the permeabilization of the cell membrane induced by HypF-N prefibrillar aggregates.TABLE 1Fast response of granule cells to HypF-N aggregates Maximum fluorescence increase (corresponding to Ca2+ influx) was recorded in the fast response of granule cells upon the addition of 0.2 μm HypF-N at different aggregation times. Measurements were also performed in the presence of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker, Cd2+, the NMDA-R antagonist memantine, or the AMPA-R antagonist CNQX. The values reported are the average over the number n of cells observed.Protein aggregation time% fluorescence increasen001024 h25 ± 25224 h + 10 μm memantine14 ± 23024 h + 100 μm APV9 ± 31024 h + 10 μm CNQX01824 h + 50 μm Cd2+23 ± 22048 h22 ± 2578 days010 Open table in a new tab Fast Ca2+ Increase in Exposed Cells Depends on the Activation of Glutamatergic Receptors—Having excluded that the fast fluorescence increase induced by HypF-N oligomers in cerebellar granule cells involved voltage-dependent calcium channels, we wondered whether it could involve the activation of calcium channels such as the glutamatergic receptors. To test this possibility, we added to the external solution memantine a low affinity, noncompetitive NMDA-R antagonist, and we repeated the experiments exposing the cells to HypF-N aggregates aged 24 h. The results shown in Fig. 3a indicate that, in the"
https://openalex.org/W2038734746,"S100A2 and S100A6 interact with several target proteins in a Ca2+-regulated manner. However, the exact intracellular roles of the S100 proteins are unclear. In this study we identified Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop) and kinesin light chain (KLC) as novel targets of S100A2 and S100A6. Hop directly associates with Hsp70 and Hsp90 through the tetratricopeptide (TPR) domains and regulates Hop-Hsp70 and Hop-Hsp90 complex formation. We have found that S100A2 and S100A6 bind to the TPR domain of Hop, resulting in inhibition of the Hop-Hsp70 and Hop-Hsp90 interactions in vitro. Although endogenous Hsp70 and Hsp90 interact with Hop in resting Cos-7 cells, but not with S100A6, stimulation of these cells with ionomycin caused a Hop-S100A6 interaction, resulting in the dissociation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 from Hop. Similarly, glutathione S-transferase pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that S100A6 binds to the TPR domain of KLC, resulting in inhibition of the KLC-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein 1 (JIP-1) interaction in vitro. The transiently expressed JIP-1 interacts with KLC in resting Cos-7 cells but not with S100A6. Stimulation of these cells with ionomycin also caused a KLC-S100A6 interaction, resulting in dissociation of JIP-1 from KLC. These results strongly suggest that the S100 proteins modulate Hsp70-Hop-Hsp90 multichaperone complex formation and KLC-cargo interaction via Ca2+-dependent S100 protein-TPR protein complex formation in vivo as well as in vitro. Moreover, we have shown that S100A2 and S100A6 interact with another TPR protein Tom70 and regulate the Tom70-ligand interaction in vitro. Thus, our findings suggest a new intracellular Ca2+-signaling pathway via S100 proteins-TPR motif interactions. S100A2 and S100A6 interact with several target proteins in a Ca2+-regulated manner. However, the exact intracellular roles of the S100 proteins are unclear. In this study we identified Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop) and kinesin light chain (KLC) as novel targets of S100A2 and S100A6. Hop directly associates with Hsp70 and Hsp90 through the tetratricopeptide (TPR) domains and regulates Hop-Hsp70 and Hop-Hsp90 complex formation. We have found that S100A2 and S100A6 bind to the TPR domain of Hop, resulting in inhibition of the Hop-Hsp70 and Hop-Hsp90 interactions in vitro. Although endogenous Hsp70 and Hsp90 interact with Hop in resting Cos-7 cells, but not with S100A6, stimulation of these cells with ionomycin caused a Hop-S100A6 interaction, resulting in the dissociation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 from Hop. Similarly, glutathione S-transferase pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that S100A6 binds to the TPR domain of KLC, resulting in inhibition of the KLC-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein 1 (JIP-1) interaction in vitro. The transiently expressed JIP-1 interacts with KLC in resting Cos-7 cells but not with S100A6. Stimulation of these cells with ionomycin also caused a KLC-S100A6 interaction, resulting in dissociation of JIP-1 from KLC. These results strongly suggest that the S100 proteins modulate Hsp70-Hop-Hsp90 multichaperone complex formation and KLC-cargo interaction via Ca2+-dependent S100 protein-TPR protein complex formation in vivo as well as in vitro. Moreover, we have shown that S100A2 and S100A6 interact with another TPR protein Tom70 and regulate the Tom70-ligand interaction in vitro. Thus, our findings suggest a new intracellular Ca2+-signaling pathway via S100 proteins-TPR motif interactions. The S100 protein family consists of ∼20 low molecular weight Ca2+-binding proteins that possess two EF-hand motifs and share about 20–80% homogeneity in amino acid sequence. Unlike the prototypical EF-hand calcium sensor calmodulin, S100 proteins exhibit cell- and tissue-specific expression (1Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro, the S100 proteins form hetero- or homodimers. The EF-hand proteins bind Ca2+ through their EF-hand motifs and undergo a Ca2+-dependent conformational change to expose a hydrophobic effector protein-binding surface, which in turn allows them to bind to and regulate an array of secondary effector proteins (for review, see Refs. 1Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 2Bhattacharya S. Bunick C.G. Chazin W.J. Biochim. Biophys.

S100 proteins are proposed to have intracellular and extracellular roles in the regulation of many cellular processes such as contraction, cell motility and growth, cell-cycle progression, differentiation, transcription, and protein phosphorylation (1Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 4Donato R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 6: 540-551Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). However, the precise intracellular roles of the S100 proteins are not fully understood.Recently, we identified S100A1 to be a new member of the multichaperone complex and a potent molecular chaperone (5Okada M. Hatakeyama T. Itoh H. Tokuta N. Tokumitsu H. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4221-4233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To identify additional possible chaperone-interacting S100 proteins, we examined their interaction with the co-chaperone Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop). 3The abbreviations used are: Hop, Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein; Hsp, heat shock protein; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; KLC, kinesin light chain; KHC, kinesin heavy chain; JIP-1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein 1; Tom, translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; CC, coiled-coil domain. 3The abbreviations used are: Hop, Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein; Hsp, heat shock protein; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; KLC, kinesin light chain; KHC, kinesin heavy chain; JIP-1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein 1; Tom, translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; CC, coiled-coil domain. Hop is one of the co-chaperones and is able to associate directly with both Hsp70 and Hsp90 through tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains (6Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B.

Here, we report that S100A2 and S100A6 interact with Hop-TPR domains and inhibit Hop-Hsp70 and Hop-Hsp90 complex formation in vitro and in vivo. Thus, S100A2 and S100A6 represent the first example of Ca2+-dependent regulators of the Hsp70-Hop-Hsp90 multichaperone complex.The TPR domain is a protein-protein interaction motif that was originally identified by sequence comparisons among yeast proteins (12Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The TPR domain consists of a 34-amino acid motif with a loose consensus and is present as tandem repeats in proteins with many cellular functions (13Blatch G.L. Lassle M. BioEssays. 1999; 11: 932-939Crossref Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structural analyses have shown that a TPR motif contains two antiparallel α-helices such that tandem arrays of TPR motifs generate a right-handed helical structure with an amphipathic channel. The hydrophobic surface of this structure mediates protein-protein interactions between TPR- and non TPR-containing proteins (13Blatch G.L. Lassle M. BioEssays. 1999; 11: 932-939Crossref Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that some S100 proteins interact with other TPR-containing proteins in addition to Hop. Kinesin-1 (formerly conventional kinesin or Kif5) is a heterotetramer of two kinesin heavy chain (KHC) and two kinesin light chain (KLC) polypeptides. The N-terminal coiled-coil domain of KLC interacts with KHC, and the C-terminal TPR domain of KLC links to vesicular cargo via cytosolic adaptor proteins such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein 1 (JIP-1), JIP-2, JIP-3/Syd, JIP-4, JLP, TorsinA, Huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1), and calsyntenin-1 (14Verhey K.J.

In the present study we also demonstrated that S100A2 and S100A6 interact with KLC-TPR domain and that S100A6 inhibits KLC-JIP-1 binding in vitro and in vivo. To further explore the relationship between S100 and TPR proteins, we focused on translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane (Tom) 70. Tom70 is a membrane-localized co-chaperone that directly associates with Hsp70 and Hsp90 through TPR motifs. We have found that S100A2 and S100A6 also interact with Tom70 and inhibit Tom70-Hsp70 and Tom70-Hsp90 complex formation in vitro. Collectively, these findings have prompted us to propose a novel physiological function for the S100 proteins and have also provided information about the regulation mechanism of TPR protein-ligand interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, glutathione-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, and protein G-Sepharose were purchased from GE Healthcare.

Hatakeyama T. Tokumitsu H. Kobayashi R. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, a series of Hop deletion mutants (glutathione S-transferase (GST)-TPR1, residues 1–104; GST-N (1–224), residues 1–224; GST-C (225–543), residues 225–543; GST-TPR2A, residues 225–359; GST-TPR2B, residues 360–461; GST-DP2, residues 462–543) were prepared by PCR using the expression plasmid pGEX4T2-Hop wild type (WT; which encodes wild type rat Hop) as the template. Hop point mutants were generated as previously described (29Carrigan P.E. Nelson G.M. Roberts P.J. Stoffer J. Riggs D.L. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16185-16193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The single point mutations in the each domain were generated as follows: TPR1, Y27A and K73E; TPR2A, K301E and R305E; TPR2B, K429E and R433E. PCR products were then inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX4T2 (GE Healthcare).Human Hsp90 (full-length) and Human Hsp70 (full-length) were prepared by PCR using human Hsp90 (RIKEN number 1127) and Hsp70 (ATCC number 57494) cDNAs as templates and specific primers. PCR products were subcloned into pET-16b vector (Novagen). Human Tom70 (residues 111–608) was prepared by PCR using human Tom70 cDNA (OpenBiosystems number 6067022) as the template and specific primers. PCR products were subcloned into pGEX4T2 vector.The cDNA coding sequences of rat KLC1b (GenBank™ accession number M75147), amino acids 1–200 (coiled-coil domain, CC), and amino acids 167–560 (TPR) were isolated from a rat brain cDNA library. KLC1b coding sequences were amplified using PCR and subcloned into pGEX4T2, generating the constructs GST-KLC-WT, GST-KLC-CC, and GST-KLC-TPR. Likewise, the JIP-1 coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF109768) was amplified by PCR from a Mouse Brain Quick-clone cDNA (Clontech), Mountain View, CA and cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen), generating the construct histidine (His6)-tagged JIP (493–707), or cloned into pME18S. The TorsinA coding sequence was amplified by PCR from a verified human TorsinA cDNA clone (Origene, Rockville, MD) and subcloned into pME18S. The plasmids constructed using the pME18S vector were used for transfection into mammalian cells. The nucleotide sequences of all inserts used in this study were confirmed by a sequencer (Applied Biosystems Japan, Tokyo, Japan).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—All recombinant S100 proteins (S100B, A1, A2, A4, A6, A10, A11, A12, and A13) were expressed in a tag-free fashion and prepared as described previously (5Okada M. Hatakeyama T. Itoh H. Tokuta N. Tokumitsu H. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4221-4233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Yamashita K. Oyama Y. Shishibori T. Matsushita O. Okabe A. Kobayashi R. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, S100 proteins expressed in BL21 (DE3) were extracted using TE buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and purified by phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography. GST-tagged fusion proteins and His6-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions.GST Pulldown Assay and Binding Analysis—The Ca2+-binding proteins (S100 proteins or calmodulin, 25 μg each) or Hsps (Hsp70 or Hsp90, 20 μg each) and GST fusion TPR proteins (0–25 μg) were mixed in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.02% Tween 20, pH 7.5) with 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA. The reaction mixtures in a total volume of 200–400 μl were incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 60 min at 25 °C. After pelleting by microcentrifugation, the beads were subjected to replicate washes (3 × 1 ml), boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE.To estimate the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), a fixed concentration of GST-Hop wild type (0.56 μm) or GST-KLCs (0.27 μm each) was mixed with increasing concentrations of purified recombinant S100 proteins (0–40 μm) in buffer A with 1 mm CaCl2. After the reaction mixtures (total volume of 200 μl) were incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 60 min at 25 °C, the beads were washed and eluted as described above. Bound proteins were resolved by 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Coomassie-stained gels were scanned, and arbitrary densitometric values for S100 proteins bound to GST-Hop or GST-KLCs were obtained. These values were converted to micromolar equivalents by normalizing them against the value for 0.4 μg of S100 proteins on the same gel. Kinetic analyses of the data to obtain the binding parameters were performed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism software (Version 5; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The experiments were performed in triplicate.Competition Assay in Vitro—To investigate the effects of the S100 proteins on the interactions between the TPR proteins (such as Hop, KLC, and Tom70) and their ligand proteins (such as Hsp90, Hsp70, JIP-1, TorsinA, and KHC), the GST-TPR proteins (10 or 25 μg) and the S100 proteins (0–50 μg) were mixed in buffer A with 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA. After the reaction mixtures (total volume, 200 μl) were incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 60 min at 25 °C, the beads were collected and washed (3 × 1 ml). Next, the beads were incubated with the appropriate recombinant ligand proteins or cell extract (2 mg of protein) in buffer A with 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA. After the second incubation was performed for 60 min at 25 °C, the beads were washed (3 × 1 ml), boiled in SDS-sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting or SDS-PAGE. In some experiments 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose was mixed with the TPR proteins, their ligand proteins, and S100 proteins simultaneously in buffer A with 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA. After the incubation was performed for 60 min at 25 °C, the beads were treated as describe above. The details of the experimental conditions are described in the figure legends.Immunoprecipitation of Endogenous KLC from Mouse Brain—Mouse brain extracts (2 mg of protein) supplemented with or without recombinant S100A6 (25 μg) were incubated with goat polyclonal anti-KLC antibody (2 μg) for 16 h at 4 °C in buffer A with 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA. After the addition of protein G-Sepharose beads (50 μl), the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times in buffer A with 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies for KLC and S100A6.Cell Culture, Transfection, Ionomycin Treatment, Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cos-7 monkey fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences). Next, 6 × 105 cells were seeded in a 10-cm culture dish and grown until confluent. Ionomycin treatment of Cos-7 cells and immunoprecipitation were performed as described by Tomas and Moss (27Tomas A. Moss S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20210-20216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with or without 1 μm ionomycin for 5 min. After washing the cells with 5 ml of buffer A, 500 μl of buffer A with 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA was added to the dishes, and the cells were collected and lysed by sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and cleared lysate was subjected to the following immunoprecipitation. Antibody resin was prepared by incubating anti-Hop, anti-KLC, or anti-HA antibody IgG (2–10 μg) with protein G-Sepharose (20 μl) in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 25 °C. The antibody-conjugated resins were washed three times in buffer A. The resins were mixed with the cell lysates and rotated for 1 h at 4 °Cand washed 3 times in buffer A with 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA. In some cases Cos-7 cells were transfected with HA-KLC, JIP-1, and S100A6 before ionomycin stimulation. The expression plasmids pME18S-HA-KLC (1.2 μg), pME18S-JIP-1 (0.05 μg), and pME18S-S100A6 (2.7 μg) were introduced into Cos-7 cells and cultured for 2 days. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions.The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies specific for Hop, KLC, Hsp70, Hsp90, HA, JIP-1, and S100A6. Western blotting was performed as described previously (5Okada M. Hatakeyama T. Itoh H. Tokuta N. Tokumitsu H. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4221-4233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Preparation of Tissue Extracts and Cell Lysates—Whole mouse brain was homogenized with 10 ml of buffer A supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Expression of TorsinA in Cos-7 cells was carried out essentially as described above, using 12 μg of pME18S-TorsinA expression plasmid. After 2 days of culture, 500 μl of buffer A was added to the 10-cm dishes, and the cells were collected and lysed by sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were stored at –30 °C until used in the immunoprecipitation or competition assays.RESULTSInteraction between Hop and the Members of the S100 Protein Family—Previously, we showed that S100A1 interacts with Hsp90, Hsp70, FK506-binding protein 52 (FKBP52), and cyclophilin40 (CyP40) (5Okada M. Hatakeyama T. Itoh H. Tokuta N. Tokumitsu H. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4221-4233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To further study the interaction of S100 proteins with molecular chaperones, we performed an in vitro binding assay using GST-Hop in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA (Fig. 1A). S100A6, but not calmodulin or other S100 proteins, strongly bound to GST-Hop in the presence of Ca2+. S100A2 bound weakly to GST-Hop in a Ca2+-dependent manner, whereas S100A1 bound to Hop in a Ca2+-independent fashion. These experiments indicate that S100A6 and S100A2 exclusively interact with Hop in a Ca2+-dependent manner.The domain structure of Hop is shown in Fig. 1B. Hop contains three separate TPR domains, TPR1, TPR2A, and TPR2B, and two regions that contain aspartic acid-proline (DP) residue repeats; DP1 after TPR1 and DP2 after TPR2B (28Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 29Carrigan P.E. Nelson G.M. Roberts P.J. Stoffer J. Riggs D.L. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16185-16193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The TPR1 domain of Hop co-crystallizes with a heptapeptide containing terminal EEVD residues in Hsp70, and the TPR2A domain of Hop co-crystallizes with a pentapeptide containing the terminal MEEVD residues of Hsp90 (9Sceufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). To determine the S100 binding site of Hop, we performed a pulldown assay using a series of GST-Hop deletion mutants (Figs. 1, C and D). As shown in Fig. 1C, S100A2 bound to TPR2B preferentially and weakly associated with TPR1. In contrast, S100A6 exclusively interacted with TPR1 and bound weakly to TPR2A and TPR2B (Fig. 1D).Interaction of S100A2 and S100A6 with GST-KLC—Because S100A2 and S100A6 interact with the TPR domain of Hop in a Ca2+-dependent manner, we hypothesized that some S100 proteins interact with the other TPR-containing proteins such as KLC. To investigate the interaction between KLC and the S100 proteins, we performed an in vitro binding assay using GST-KLC-WT in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. Purified GST-KLC-WT was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and then incubated with an equal amount of recombinant S100 proteins. The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. S100A2 and S100A6 specifically bound to GST-KLC-WT in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the other S100 proteins such as S100A1, S100A4, S100A10, S100A11, S100A12, and S100B did not bind to GST-KLC-WT in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). Recently, Lazarov et al. (30Lazarov O. Morfini G.A. Lee E.B. Farah M.H. Szodorai A. DeBoe;r S.R. Koliatsos V.E. Kins S. Lee V.M. Wong P.C. Price D.L. Brady S.T. Sisodia S.S. J.

They also described that this feature is a potential source of artifacts in GST pulldown assays, confirming putative interactions with a co-immunoprecipitation assay critical. Therefore, to exclude the possibility that the interaction of S100 proteins with KLC was nonspecific, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In mouse brain extracts supplemented with exogenous S100A6 (i.e. recombinant S100A6) in the presence of either Ca2+ or EGTA, endogenous KLC was immunoprecipitated with an anti-KLC polyclonal antibody. Furthermore, and solely in the presence of Ca2+, S100A6 was coprecipitated with KLC (Fig. 2B). Based on these results, the interaction of S100A6 with KLC is specific and apparently Ca2+-dependent.FIGURE 2Properties of S100 protein binding to GST-KLC and deletion mutants. A, the S100 proteins (25 μg) and GST-KLC-WT (25 μg) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose in buffer A with 1 mm CaCl2 (Ca2+) or EGTA (total volume 200 μl). The experiments were performed as described in Fig. 1A. B, mouse brain extracts (2 mg of protein) and S100A6 (0 μg (control) or 25 μg) were incubated with goat polyclonal anti-KLC antibody (2 μg) for 16 h at 4 °C in buffer B in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. After the addition of protein G-Sepharose beads (50 μl), the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed, and then eluted with the SDS-sample buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (WB) with antibodies specific for KLC and S100A6. C, schematic diagrams of a series of KLC deletion mutants. The numbering refers to amino acid positions in KLC. D and E, GST pulldown assays were performed using GST-KLC-WT, GST-KLC-CC, and GST-KLC-TPR (GST-KLCs) and GST alone as a control. GST-KLCs (25 μg) and S100 proteins (25 μg) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose in buffer A with 1 mm CaCl2 (Ca2+) or EGTA (total volume 200 μl). The experiment was performed as described in the Fig. 1A legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The domain structure of KLC is shown in Fig. 2C. KLC consists of N-terminal heptad repeats (coiled-coil domain), which have been implicated in its binding to KHC, and a C-terminal TPR domain, which binds to cytosolic adaptor proteins such as JIP-1 and vesicular cargo proteins including TorsinA. To map the S100A2 or S100A6 binding domain in KLC, we used GST-KLC-WT, GST-KLC-CC, and GST-KLC-TPR in a GST pulldown assay (Figs. 2, D and E). The binding assay indicated that S100A2 and S100A6 bind to both the TPR and CC domains of KLC.Binding Affinities of S100 Proteins to Hop and KLC—We next sought to quantify the binding affinity between Hop and the S100 proteins in vitro. We performed GST pulldown assays and analyzed the data by nonlinear regression fitting using Prism 5.0 software (Figs. 3, A and B). GST-Hop (0.56 μm) was incubated with a graded dose of S100A2 (0–40 μm) or S100A6 (0–26 μm) in the presence of Ca2+. The amounts of bound protein were measured by SDS-PAGE followed by densitometric analysis. The curves fit best to a two-site binding model, and R2 for S100A2 and S100A6 was 0.987. The KD values for S100A2 and S100A6 were 8.1 and 6.1 μm, respectively. The Scatchard plot obtained from the same experiments depicts two linear relationships that give evidence of a minimum of two different S100A2 or S100A6 binding sites (Figs. 3, A and B, insets) Although the KD values for S100A2 and S100A6 binding to Hop are almost identical, the stoichiometries of the S100 proteins binding to Hop showed a significant difference; S100A2 dimer bound to the Hop monomer in a 4:1 molar ratio, whereas the molar ratio of S100A6 dimer to Hop monomer was about 2:1.FIGURE 3Binding curves of S100A2 or S100A6 to TPR-containing proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2036238031,"Calmodulin plays a key role in the chemical gating of gap junction channels. Two calmodulin-binding regions have previously been identified in connexin32 gap junction protein, one in the N-terminal and another in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the molecule. The aim of this study was to better understand how calmodulin interacts with the connexin32-binding domains. Lobe-specific interactions of calmodulin with connexin32 peptides were studied by stopped flow kinetics, using Ca2+ binding-deficient mutants. Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal tail (residues 1–22) of connexin32 engaged both the N- and C-terminal lobes (N- and C-lobes) of calmodulin, binding with higher affinity to the C-lobe of calmodulin (Ca2+ dissociation rate constants k3,4, 1.7 ± 0.5 s–1) than to the N-lobe (k1,2, 10.8 ± 1.3 s–1). In contrast, peptides representing the C-terminal tail domain (residues 208–227) of connexin32 bound either the C- or the N-lobe but only one calmodulin lobe at a time (k3,4, 2.6 ± 0.1 s–1 or k1, 13.8 ± 0.5 s–1 and k2, 1000 s–1). The calmodulin-binding domains of the N- and C-terminal tails of connexin32 were best defined as residues 1–21 and 216–227, respectively. Our data, showing separate functions of the N- and C-lobes of calmodulin in the interactions with connexin32, suggest trans-domain or trans-subunit bridging by calmodulin as a possible mechanism of gap junction gating.

Our data, showing separate functions of the N- and C-lobes of calmodulin in the interactions with connexin32, suggest trans-domain or trans-subunit bridging by calmodulin as a possible mechanism of gap junction gating. Gap junctions mediate direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and soluble molecules between cells. Gap junction channels are composed of two hemichannels (connexons); each connexon is composed of six connexins (Cx) 2The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexin; IAEDANS, 5-[[2-[(iodoacetyl)amino]ethyl]amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; AEDANS, 5-[[2-[amino]ethyl]amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CaM, calmodulin; CaM-s, calmodulins; N-lobe, N-terminal lobe; C-lobe, C-terminal lobe; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RF, relative fluorescence. (1.Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Each Cx polypeptide chain contains an N-terminal tail, four transmembrane domains (M1, M2, M3, and M4), two extracellular loops (EL1 and EL2), a cytoplasmic loop, and a C-terminal tail (Fig. 1). Gap junction channels are gated by transjunctional voltage (Vj), Ca2+, and H+ (2.Bennett M.V. Verselis V.K. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 29-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3.Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Bukauskas F.F. Verselis V.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 42-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 5.Peracchia C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 61-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Vj gradients activate two types of gates: fast and slow. The fast Vj gate flickers rapidly between the open and residual states, whereas the chemical/slow gate undergoes slow transitions between the open and closed states (6.Bukauskas F.F. Peracchia C. Biophys J. 1997; 72: 2137-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cytosolic acidification of small cells subjected to moderate Vj gradients allows the chemical/slow gate to be distinguished from the fast Vj-sensitive gate (6.Bukauskas F.F. Peracchia C. Biophys J. 1997; 72: 2137-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Uncouplers activate a chemical gate that behaves identically to the slow Vj gate in terms of kinetics and efficiency. Thus, although chemical gate and slow Vj gate are usually referred to as separate gates, they may have closely related or identical mechanisms. Ca2+ and H+ are pivotal to the operation of gap junctions because their concentrations within the cell dictate whether the junction is opened or closed (reviewed in Ref. 7.Spray D.C. White R.L. Mazet F. Bennett M.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: H753-H764PubMed Google Scholar). Increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the range of 200 to 1000 nm induce the opening of hemichannels (8.De Vuyst E. Decrock E. Cabooter L. Dubyak G.R. Naus C.C. Evans W.H. Leybaert L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In contrast, [Ca2+]i in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range inhibits gap junctional communication (reviewed in Ref. 5.Peracchia C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 61-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), indicating that gap junction channels and hemichannels are both sensitive to [Ca2+]i but may be affected by Ca2+ in opposite ways. The molecular mechanisms of gap junction gating are still poorly defined. Ca2+ may act via calmodulin (CaM) inducing an interaction between Ca2+-bound CaM and one or more intracellular domains of connexins (5.Peracchia C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 61-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9.Peracchia C. Bernardini G. Peracchia L.L. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J.

J. 1997; 326: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CaM is a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein of 16.8 kDa (148 amino acids) with a sequence that is well conserved from plants to mammals. CaM has a high affinity for binding Ca2+, and in its Ca2+ bound form, CaM binds to a large number of target proteins regulating their function (13.Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding sites of CaM comprise four helix-loop-helix EF hands situated in two globular lobes; EF hands 1 and 2 are located in the N-terminal lobe (N-lobe), and EF hands 3 and 4 are found in the highly homologous C-terminal lobe (C-lobe). The N- and C-lobes are separated by a 30-amino acid linker, which, although appearing α-helical in crystals, is flexible in solution (14.Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). The C-terminal lobe of Ca2+-free (apo) CaM has an about 5-fold higher affinity for binding Ca2+ because of the semi-open conformation of its two EF hands, differing significantly from the fully closed conformation of EF hands 1 and 2 in the N-lobe (15.Grabarek Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This semi-open conformation adopted by the C-terminal lobe accounts for the ability of CaM to bind peptides in the absence of Ca2+ (15.Grabarek Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Many target peptides, however, bind to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner, associating with the more open hydrophobic pockets exposed in the Ca2+-bound state (15.Grabarek Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The bound peptide, once subjected to the hydrophobic pockets, tends to form an α-helical structure, often flanked by a Trp residue near the N terminus and a Phe, or other bulky hydrophobic residues, at the C terminus (16.Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). CaM undergoes a number of structural changes upon binding of Ca2+. We have shown by Förster resonance energy transfer that apo-CaM exists in an extended conformation, with maximum distance between the N- and C-lobes, whereas in Ca2+·CaM·peptide complexes, the conformation of CaM is more compact as indicated by the significantly reduced distance between its N- and C-lobes (17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the Ca2+-bound state (holo-CaM), CaM exists in a dynamic equilibrium of two major conformations, extended and semi-compact (17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This allows it enough flexibility to bind targets in variably extended conformations (17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and to form interdomain connections (18.Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The possibility that CaM is involved in gap junction regulation was first proposed by Peracchia and co-workers (9.Peracchia C. Bernardini G. Peracchia L.L. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1983; 399: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10.Peracchia C. Hertzberg E.L. Johnson R.G. Gap Junctions. Alan R. Liss, New York1988: 267-282Google Scholar), suggesting a CaM-binding site at the C-terminal tail of connexin32 (Cx32, Gjb1). Previously, we have identified, by equilibrium binding studies, two CaM-binding domains in Cx32, a novel site in the N-terminal tail, and a site in the previously proposed C-terminal tail region (12.Török K. Stauffer K. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The peptide, consisting of residues 1–21, which represents the N-terminal tail CaM-binding domain of Cx32, bound to the fluorescent CaM derivative, TA-CaM with a high affinity (Kd, 27 nm) and in a Ca2+-dependent manner (12.Török K. Stauffer K. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The peptide representing residues 216–230 of the Cx32 C-terminal tail, bound TA-CaM with a Kd of 2.1 μm, also in a Ca2+-dependent manner (12.Török K. Stauffer K. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both the N-terminal and the C-terminal tail CaM-binding domains of Cx32 are located close to the membrane and are contiguous with hydrophobic membrane-spanning sequences (Fig. 1). Furthermore, although the C-terminal tail CaM-binding domain in Cx32 represents only 15% of the C-terminal tail of Cx32, the removal of the other 85% had little effect on junction permeability and chemical gating (19.Wang X. Li L. Peracchia L.L. Peracchia C. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20.Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Peracchia L.M. Peracchia C.

Recently, CaM has also been shown to bind peptides matching a cytoplasmic loop domain of Cx43 (Gja1) (23.Zhou Y. Yang W. Lurtz M.M. Ye Y. Huang Y. Lee H.W. Chen Y. Louis C.F. Yang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35005-35017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and C-terminal tail domains of Cx36 and Cx35 (24.Burr G.S. Mitchell C.K. Keflemariam Y.J. Heidelberger R. O'Brien J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that CaM plays a role in the function of several connexins. Peracchia and coworkers (19.Wang X. Li L. Peracchia L.L. Peracchia C. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20.Peracchia C. Wang X.G. Peracchia L.M. Peracchia C. Gap Junctions: Molecular Basis of Cell Communication in Health and Disease. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2000: 271-295Google Scholar), using Cx chimera Cx32/38IL, have shown that a domain in the second half of the cytoplasmic loop may be involved in the chemical gating mechanism of Cx32. Because this region in Cx32 does not contain a CaM-binding motif (12.Török K. Stauffer K. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), in contrast with Cx43 (23.Zhou Y. Yang W. Lurtz M.M. Ye Y. Huang Y. Lee H.W. Chen Y. Louis C.F. Yang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35005-35017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the mechanism of this involvement is yet to be determined. Here, we explore the binding of CaM to Cx32 domains to better understand how CaM participates in the chemical gating mechanism of gap junction channels. To assess the binding potential of all four Ca2+ sites of CaM two Ca2+ binding-deficient CaM mutants were used: CaM12, in which a single-point mutation was made in each of the two N-lobe EF hands, and CaM34, in which single-point mutation was applied to each of the two C-lobe EF hands of CaM. CaM mutants were combined with Cx32-derived peptides and using stopped flow kinetics; the Ca2+ dissociation rate constants (koff) were measured. In addition, a resonance energy transfer CaM derivative was used to explore CaM conformation in the Cx32 peptide complexes and helped establish a more exact definition of the two CaM-binding regions of Cx32. Vectors—Human liver wild type CaM was subcloned between restriction sites NdeI for the 5′ and PstI for the 3′ end in the Escherichia coli expression vector pAED4. CaM and the T34C/T110C double mutant CaM were generated as previously described (17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CaM12 (D22A/D58A CaM) and CaM34 (D95A/D131A CaM) cDNA-s, kindly provided by Dr. J. P. Adelman (Vollum Institute, Portland, OR), were subcloned in the BamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′) restriction sites in the E. coli expression vector pET-21b by Dr. Nael Nadif Kasri (Katholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium). DNA sequencing confirmed that the mutations were in the desired positions. Protein Expression and Purification—Wild type and mutant CaM-s were expressed and purified by previously described procedures (17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Final purification to homogeneity was performed by HPLC and the purity, and identity of the proteins is confirmed by mass spectrometry as in Ref. 17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar. The concentrations of CaM, its mutants, and fluorescent derivatives were determined as previously described (17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were collected using a Chirascan spectropolarimeter in the wavelength ranges of 185–260 and 230–400 nm. Protein samples were desalted, freeze-dried, and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and 10 mm EGTA. The instrument was flushed continuously with pure N2 gas throughout the experiment to improve performance below 200 nm. The path length was 0.5 mm for far UV and 1 mm for near UV measurements. All of the spectra were acquired at room temperature and were buffer base line-subtracted. The far UV CD spectra were corrected for concentration and path length and expressed in terms of molar differential extinction coefficient, Δϵ (m–1 cm–1). Secondary structure estimation was calculated using the Principle Component Analysis method (33.Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Springer, 1996: 69-108Crossref Google Scholar). DA-CaM—The synthesis, characterization, and properties of DA-CaM are described in Ref. 17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar. In short, cysteine residues in the double mutant T34C/T110C-CaM were labeled with the fluorophore, IAEDANS and DDP, a quencher compound. The two probes IAEDANS and DDP form a Förster resonance energy transfer pair with Ro of 2.6 nm (17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); increased quenching of the donor AEDANS fluorescence by the acceptor DDP indicates close proximity of the probes and hence of the N- and C-CaM lobes. Following random labeling of the two sites, T34C and T110C, the labeled mixture was fractionated by HPLC to separate the CaM fractions labeled with different fluorophores at each lobe, termed DA-CaM (17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). DA-CaM fractions were identified by maximum donor quenching displayed upon binding target peptides, e.g. CaM-binding domain peptides of αCaMKII (17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or myosin light chain kinase (25.Török K. Trentham D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12807-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These peptides cause Ca2+/CaM, which exists in an equilibrium of extended and semi-compact conformations to bind in a compact conformation. Peptides—Cx32 (Gjb1) peptides were synthesized at the University of Rochester (Rochester, NY) and were purified to homogeneity by HPLC using previously described procedures (17.Török K. Tzortzopoulos A. Grabarek Z. Best S.L. Thorogate R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14878-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the two Cx32 N-terminal tail peptides representing residues 1–19 (MNWTGLYTLLSGVNRHSTA, mass 2121.4 Da) and 1–22 (MNWTGLYTLLSGVNRHSTAIGR, mass 2447.8 Da) were determined spectroscopically using a molar extinction coefficient ϵo of 7100 m–1 cm–1. The concentrations of the two Cx32 C-terminal tail peptides representing residues 208–226 and 208–227 (EVVYLIIRACARRAQRRSN and Ac-EVVYLIIRACARRAQRRSNP-NH2, masses 2274.7 and 2413.9 Da, respectively) were determined using a molar extinction coefficient ϵo of 1400 m–1 cm–1. Fluorescence excitation was set to 320 nm with 1-nm slit width and fluorescence emission from quin 2 (Molecular Probes) and a Hi-Tech Scientific SF-61DX2 stopped flow system as previously described (26.Tzortzopoulos A.

Briefly, fluorescence excitation was set to 320 m, with 1-nm slit width and fluorescence emission from quin 2 was collected using a 530-nm cutoff filter. The assay solution contained 50 mm K+-PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2. 90 μm quin 2 in assay solution with no added Ca2+ was mixed with 3 μm CaM or CaM·peptide complexes in 50 μm Ca2+-containing buffer solution (mixing chamber concentrations). Care was taken that all of the protein components were free of EGTA. Conformation Studies and Equilibrium Binding Measurements of Cx32 Peptides with DA-CaM—Equilibrium fluorescence titrations of DA-CaM and Cx32 peptide binding were carried out using an ISS-SLM spectrofluorimeter as previously described (17.Török K.

Software—Stopped flow kinetic data were fitted using the KinetAsyst software program (Hi-Tech Scientific). Equilibrium binding fluorescence data were analyzed using GraFit software program, version 4.0. CaM binding propensity prediction was obtained using software provided by the Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto. Statistical Analysis—For each data set the stopped flow kinetic experiments produced five to nine records; these records were averaged and can be seen in Figs. 2, 3, 4; for the averaged records an “S.D. fit” was determined that indicates the standard deviation of the data from the fit. From independent averages a mean was produced for each type of experiment; the number of independent averages included in the mean is displayed in the format n = number of experiments and can be found in Tables 1, 2, 3. The S.D. associated with all data under “Results” and in the tables is a measurement of the standard deviation of the mean from all the averages and is denoted by either S.D. or the ± symbol. Typically, data are presented in the format: koff value ± S.D. of mean (n = the number of independent experiments).FIGURE 3Ca2+ dissociation kinetics of wild type and Ca2+ binding-deficient mutant CaM complexes with Cx32 N-terminal peptides. 3 μm CaM or mutant CaM and 10 μm peptide (unless otherwise specified) in the presence of 50 μm CaCl2 was rapidly mixed with 90 μm quin-2 in the same solution (see “Materials and Methods”) without added Ca2+ (concentrations in mixing chamber are given) at 21 °C.

Open table in a new tab The interaction of CaM with Cx32 N-terminal and C-terminal tail peptides is Ca2+-dependent (12.Török K. Stauffer K. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); thus it was expected that Ca2+ dissociation rate constants of CaM Ca2+-binding sites were affected by peptide target binding. The fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent Ca2+ chelator compound quin 2 increases upon Ca2+ binding, and the rate of the quin 2 fluorescence intensity increase is limited by the dissociation of Ca2+ ions from CaM or its peptide complexes. Quin 2 is used in a large excess rendering Ca2+ rebinding to CaM insignificant and thus allowing the observed rates to be interpreted as the rate constants of dissociation. The amplitude of the quin 2 fluorescence increase, which corresponds to the increase in [Ca2+.quin 2], as seen in Figs. 2, 3, 4, is converted to relative fluorescence (RF). The time courses of the change in RF (ΔRF) are fitted to exponentials to give the rate constants of Ca2+ dissociation. ΔRF provides a measure of the binding sites involved in each reaction, in our conditions, a ΔRF of 0.04 corresponded to one Ca2+-binding site. This value was obtained using the data from the experiments with CaM, which showed only two measurable binding sites with a ΔRF of 0.08; these binding sites correspond to the two sites on the C-terminal lobe.

https://openalex.org/W2086985706,"Mature thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) is a highly unstable metallocarboxypeptidase that stabilizes blood clots by clipping C-terminal lysine residues from partially degraded fibrin. In accordance with its in vitro antifibrinolytic activity, animal studies have reported that inhibition of mature TAFI aids in the prevention of thrombosis. The level of TAFI activity is stringently regulated through (i) controlled proteolytic truncation of the zymogen (TAFI), generating the mature enzyme, TAFIa, and (ii) the short half-life of TAFIa. TAFI itself exhibits an intrinsic enzymatic activity, which is likely required to provide a baseline level of antifibrinolytic activity. The novel crystal structure presented here reveals that the active site of TAFI is accessible, providing the structural explanation for the its intrinsic activity. It also supports the notion that an ""instability region"" exists, in agreement with site-directed mutagenesis studies. Sulfate ions, bound to this region, point toward a potential heparin-binding site and could explain how heparin stabilizes TAFIa."
https://openalex.org/W2100674208,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 is activated by distinct cellular stresses including radiation, hypoxia, type I interferon, and DNA/RNA virus infection. The transactivation domain of p53 contains a phosphorylation site at Ser20 whose modification stabilizes the binding of the transcriptional co-activator p300 and whose mutation in murine transgenics induces B-cell lymphoma. Although the checkpoint kinase CHK2 is implicated in promoting Ser20 site phosphorylation after irradiation, the enzyme that triggers this phosphorylation after DNA viral infection is undefined. Using human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) as a virus that induces Ser20 site phosphorylation of p53 in T-cells, we sought to identify the kinase responsible for this virus-induced p53 modification. The p53 Ser20 kinase was fractionated and purified using cation, anion, and dye-ligand exchange chromatography. Mass spectrometry identified casein kinase 1 (CK1) and vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) as enzymes that coeluted with virus-induced Ser20 site kinase activity. Immunodepletion of CK1 but not VRK1 removed the kinase activity from the peak fraction, and bacterially expressed CK1 exhibited Ser20 site kinase activity equivalent to that of the virus-induced native CK1. CK1 modified p53 in a docking-dependent manner, which is similar to other known Ser20 site p53 kinases. Low levels of the CK1 inhibitor D4476 selectively inhibited HHV-6B-induced Ser20 site phosphorylation of p53. However, x-ray-induced Ser20 site phosphorylation of p53 was not blocked by D4476. These data highlight a central role for CK1 as the Ser20 site kinase for p53 in DNA virus-infected cells but also suggest that distinct stresses may selectively trigger different protein kinases to modify the transactivation domain of p53 at Ser20.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a key player in the survival or death decision that cells face after exposure to a variety of metabolic and genotoxic stresses (1Levine A.J. Hu W. Feng Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The transient accumulation and activation of p53 in response to various cellular stresses enables the protein to modulate the expression of numerous genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and/or apoptosis. The initiation of either transient cell cycle arrest and damage repair or apoptosis is dependent on the cell and damage type, the severity of damage, and the cellular microenvironment. Phosphorylation and acetylation events that control interactions between the transcription factor p53 and its negative regulators (Mdm2, COP1, and Pirh2) or co-activators (p300) are ultimately involved in modulating p53-dependent gene expression in response to cellular stress (2Hupp T.R. Walkinshaw M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 885-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In particular, phosphorylation at Thr18 within the N-terminal conserved BOX-I domain of p53 blocks the binding of Mdm2, whereas phosphorylation at Ser20, also within the BOX-I domain, enables the binding of p300 (3Dornan D.

In addition, phosphorylation at Ser392 within the C terminus of p53 stimulates the sequence-specific DNA-binding function of p53 (6Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The generation of transgenic mice with phosphoacceptor site mutations (to alanine) at the key regulatory phosphoacceptor sites of Ser20 and Ser392 equivalents in murine p53 results in elevated cancer incidence. Mutation of Ser20 results in enhanced spontaneous B-cell lymphoma and attenuated damage-induced apoptosis in B-cells (7MacPherson D. Kim J. Kim T. Rhee B.K. Van Oostrom C.T. DiTullio R.A. Venere M.

These biochemical and genetic results highlight the critical role that phosphorylation of p53 can play in modulating its tumor suppressor function and the likelihood that these phosphorylation events are “stress-” and/or cell type-specific. Presumably, the use of transgenic phosphomutated systems will further uncover the cell- and stress-specific function of these multiple covalent modifications. Although members of the calcium calmodulin kinase superfamily, particularly the checkpoint kinases 1 and 2 (CHK1 and CHK2) and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK-1), are genetic activators of the p53 pathway, other kinases have also been shown to phosphorylate and activate p53. For example, vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) and casein kinase 1 (CK1) have been reported to phosphorylate p53 at Thr18 (10Vega F.M. Sevilla A. Lazo P.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10366-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), although the latter requires prior phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 (11Dumaz N. Milne D.M. Meek D.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Controversy remains as to which kinases are most important for the activation of p53 in response to distinct cellular stress. It is possible that the exact kinase(s) involved and the residue(s) modified are specific to both the cell and damage type, which would explain the slight disparities in the results reported to date, and provide a mechanism for a context-based cellular survival versus death decision to be made. Nevertheless, the identification and characterization of the kinases involved in the phosphorylation of p53 are essential to the further elucidation of the regulation of p53. In addition to the well established activation of p53 by ionizing and nonionizing radiation, anoxia, hypoxia, and type I interferons, more recent research has shown that DNA and RNA viruses can activate the p53 response (12Takaoka A. Hayakawa S. Yanai H. Stoiber D. Negishi H. Kikuchi H. Sasaki S. Imai K. Shibue T. Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2003; 424: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 13Boutell C. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8068-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) infection of HCT116 and MOLT-3 cancer cell lines induced p53 phosphorylation (at Ser15, Ser20, Ser33, and Ser392) and p53 accumulation in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (14Oster B. Bundgaard B. Hollsberg P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1961-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Oster B. Bundgaard B. Hupp T.R. Hollsberg P. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that HHV-6B-infected cells were mostly non-apoptotic, and it has been suggested that in this context, p53 phosphorylation and accumulation may act as a survival factor rather than cell death inducer. Thus, p53 is a central sensor of both DNA damage and immune system perturbation. The DNA virus-induced stress provides a novel model to examine the kinases that target the Ser20 site of p53. The aim of this study was to identify the p53 Ser20 kinase that is activated after HHV-6B infection of MOLT-3 cells and to investigate whether the Ser20 kinase operates in a dual site docking-dependent manner, like members of the calcium calmodulin kinase superfamily. We show that the enzyme responsible for this virus-induced phosphorylation of p53 is the DNA damage-regulatory enzyme CK1. These data suggest a dominant role for CK1 in p53 activation after HHV-6B virus infection and highlight a specific kinase pathway for further integration into the antiviral sensing machinery of the cell.

Further fractionation of kinase activity from the positive fractions was performed using a Reactive Brown 10-agarose cation exchanger with a linear gradient of 10 mm to 2 m KCl in a 20-column volume of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets. Flow-through and 77 1.3-ml fractions were collected and assayed as above, and positive fractions were pooled. A final fractionation of kinase activity was performed using a HiTrap SP-Sepharose HP cation exchanger (GE Healthcare) with a linear gradient of 10 mm to 2 m KCl in a 20-column volume of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets. The flow-through and 100 1-ml fractions were collected and assayed as above. In Vitro Kinase Assays—FLp53 tetramer in vitro kinase assays were described previously (18Craig A.L. Chrystal J.A. Fraser J.A. Sphyris N. Lin Y. Harrison B.J. Scott M.T. Dornreiter I. Hupp T.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 3542-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the kinase source (0.2-2 μl of lysate or fraction or flow-through, 0.2 μl of DAPK-1 core domain, or 1 μl of recombinant GST-CK1δ) was incubated with p53 substrate (100 ng of FLp53 tetramers) in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 μm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 30 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 0.2 m DTT. Peptide kinase assays were performed by incubating p53 peptide fragments with the above described kinase reaction mixtures for 20 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the kinase source. p53 peptides fragments were added to a final concentration of 200 μm. Negative control reactions, lacking either the kinase source or the kinase substrate were included, along with DMSO solvent controls for peptide kinase assays. CK1 Inhibitor Experiments—Mock-infected and HHV-6B-infected MOLT-3 cells were treated with 10-100 μm CK1 inhibitor D4476, concomitantly with infection, for 48 h. Alternatively, MOLT-3 cells were pretreated with 10-60 μm D4476 for 44 h before exposure (or sham exposure) to a 6-gray x-ray and further culture for 4 h. DMSO solvent controls were included, and cells were lysed as described previously (15Oster B. Bundgaard B. Hupp T.R. Hollsberg P. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Lysates, flow-through, fractions, eluates, or kinase assay samples (10 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE through 10% (w/v) Tris-glycine gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL; GE Healthcare). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Bound antibody was detected by ECL. Mass Spectrometry—Fractions from the HiTrap SP-Sepharose HP cation exchanger column (1 ml each) were concentrated ∼25-fold using Centricon YM10 centrifugal devices (Millipore). Flow-through and fractions (10 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE through a 4-12% (w/v) bis-tris gel (Invitrogen) and stained with colloidal blue (Invitrogen). Proteins enriched in the peak fraction (fraction 31) were excised from the gel, protein in-gel digestions were performed with 0.1 pmol/μl trypsin gold (Promega, Southampton, UK), and extracted peptides were resuspended in 2% (v/v) formic acid. Samples were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Briefly, peptides were resolved in a gradient of 4-95% (v/v) MeCN using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, using the UltiMate 3000 system (Dionex, Camberley, UK). Samples were acquired on a 4000 Q TRAP® liquid chromatography/MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Data were analyzed using Analyst® software (Applied Biosystems). Immunoprecipitation—Peak fractions from the HiTrap SP-Sepharose HP cation exchanger column (25 μl) were incubated with primary antibody (0.25-2 μl VC1 antibody to VRK1 or antibody to CK1α) overnight at 4 °C in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) in a final volume of 50 μl. Protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (50 μl) were then added, and the reactions were incubated at 4 °C for a further 2 h. The flow-through was collected and assayed for in vitro kinase activity toward FLp53 tetramers, and the beads were washed six times in 100 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer. Bound protein was eluted after a 45-min incubation in 100 μl of elution buffer (SDS sample buffer containing 0.2 m DTT) at room temperature. Negative control reactions, where the antibody was omitted, were included. HHV-6B-infected MOLT-3 Cells Contain a Kinase That Displays Ser20 Site Activity toward p53 in Vitro—HHV-6B infection has previously been shown to induce Ser20 site phosphorylation of p53, although the kinase that mediates this stress-activated phosphorylation has not been identified (14Oster B. Bundgaard B. Hollsberg P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1961-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We set out to determine whether HHV-6B-infected MOLT-3 cell lysates were capable of mediating the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser20 in an in vitro assay. HHV-6B-infected MOLT-3 whole-cell lysates acted as the kinase source in an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant FLp53 tetramers as the substrate. Western blotting of the kinase assay products revealed that p53 was phosphorylated at Ser20 (Fig. 1, lanes 1-4) and that the amount of P-p53 Ser20 was proportional to the amount of kinase source used in the kinase assay. HHV-6B-infected MOLT-3 cell lysates therefore contain at least one kinase that is capable of mediating the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser20 in vitro. In order to identify the p53 Ser20 kinase, we subjected crude lysates to chromatographic fractionation to determine whether the kinase activity correlates with the known Ser20 site kinases, including CHK1/2 and DAPK-1. HHV-6B-infected and mock-infected MOLT-3 whole-cell lysates were applied onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow anion exchanger column, proteins were eluted in a linear gradient of 0-1 m KCl, and fractions were collected and assayed for kinase activity toward the Ser20 and Ser15 sites of FLp53 (Fig. 2). The induction of Ser20 site phosphorylation correlated with an increase in the specific activity of the Ser20 site kinase. The kinase eluted from fractions 14-18 in mock-infected cells (Fig. 2A, upper panels, lanes 9-11), whereas in HHV-6B-infected cells, the kinase eluted from fractions 10-20 (Fig. 2A, lower panels, lanes 7-12) and a broader elution peak from fractions 26-48 (lanes 15-26). By contrast, the induction of Ser15 site phosphorylation after HHV-6B infection did not exhibit the same qualitative increase in cell-free kinase activity (Fig. 2B). When these fractions containing the peak Ser20 site kinase activity were immunoblotted for the kinases known to phosphorylate p53 Ser20, none of the calcium calmodulin kinase superfamily members co-eluted precisely with the Ser20 site kinase activity (data not shown). Thus, we set up further chromatographic fractionations in order to enrich the HHV-6B-induced Ser20 site kinase activity sufficiently to identify candidate leads by identifying protein bands from SDS-PAGE gels using mass spectrometry (MS). Purification of the p53 Ser20 Kinase—Large scaled up samples of HHV-6B-infected MOLT-3 whole-cell lysates were applied onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow anion exchanger column, proteins were eluted in a linear gradient of 0-1 m KCl, and fractions were collected and assayed for kinase activity toward the Ser20 site of FLp53 (Fig. 3A). Fractions 9-14 containing the most activity (Fig. 3A, lanes 5-8) were pooled and applied onto a Reactive Brown 10-agarose cation exchange column. Proteins were eluted in a linear gradient of 10 mm to 2 m KCl, and fractions were collected and assayed for kinase activity toward FLp53 Ser20, as described previously (Fig. 3B). Fractions 17-23 containing the first peak of activity (Fig. 3B, lanes 11-14) were pooled and applied onto a HiTrap SP-Sepharose HP cation exchanger column. Proteins were eluted in a linear gradient of 10 mm to 2 m KCl, and fractions were again collected and assayed for kinase activity toward FLp53 Ser20 (Fig. 3C). Fraction 29 displayed the most activity toward FLp53 Ser20 (Fig. 3C, lane 11). The p53 Ser20 Kinase Is CK1α—None of the calcium calmodulin kinase superfamily members co-eluted with the fractions from the HiTrap SP-Sepharose HP cation exchanger column that displayed the peak of p53 Ser20 kinase activity (Fig. 4, lane 10). As such, we resolved protein from the peak fractions by SDS-PAGE, and after staining with colloidal blue (Fig. 5A, left), we excised and processed the proteins that were enriched in the peak fraction (Fig. 5A, right, lane 5 versus lane 4 or 6) for analysis by MS in order to acquire candidate kinase leads. MS identified VRK1 (47 kDa) and CK1α (38 kDa) as candidate kinases that eluted in fraction 31 (Fig. 5, B and C), a fraction that displayed strong kinase activity toward the Ser20 site of FLp53.FIGURE 5Mass spectrometry identifies VRK1 and CK1α as candidate p53 Ser20 kinases. A, the flow-through (FT; lane 2) and concentrated fractions 27, 28, 31, and 32 (lanes 3-6) from the HiTrap SP-Sepharose HP cation exchanger column were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with colloidal blue (left). An input control (I; lane 1), consisting of pooled fractions 17-23 from the Reactive Brown 10-agarose cation exchanger column, was included. Proteins enriched in fraction 31 (lane 5) were excised from the gel (right) and processed for analysis by MS/MS. B and C, MS identified VRK1 (B) and CK1α (C) as candidate kinases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western blotting confirmed that the elution profiles of CK1 or CK1α (Fig. 6, A and B) and VRK1 (Fig. 6C) matched the p53 Ser20 kinase activity profile. CK1 and CK1α eluted mostly in fraction 29 (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 10 and 9, respectively), and VRK1 eluted in fractions 29-33 (Fig. 6C, lanes 10 and 11), suggesting that either kinase could be responsible for the observed phosphorylation of FLp53 at Ser20 in the peak fraction 29 (Fig. 3C). Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the kinase activity toward FLp53 at Ser20 was attenuated after immunodepletion of CK1α (Fig. 7A, lanes 4-7 versus lane 3) and not after depletion of VRK1 (Fig. 7A, lanes 9-12 versus lane 8), implying that CK1α is the dominant p53 Ser20 kinase. This agrees with previous data showing that recombinant VRK1 does not exhibit Ser20 site kinase activity (10Vega F.M. Sevilla A. Lazo P.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10366-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, this does rule out VRK1 as a co-purifying subunit of CK1. As controls, we affirmed that increasing the antibody titration did result in reduced CK1α (Fig. 7B, lanes 2-5 versus lane 1) and VRK1 (Fig. 7C, lanes 2-5 versus lane 1) in the immunodepleted samples as well as elevated CK1α (Fig. 7B, lanes 7-10 versus lane 6) and VRK1 (Fig. 7C, lanes 7-10 versus lane 6) in the immune pellet.FIGURE 7Immunodepletion of CK1α, but not VRK1, abolishes p53 Ser20 kinase activity. CK1α or VRK1 were immunoprecipitated from a peak fraction from the HiTrap SP-Sepharose HP cation exchanger column using increasing amounts (0.25-2 μl) of antibody to CK1α or VRK1 bound to Protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads. A, immunodepleted fractions, or flow-through (FT; lanes 3-12), were assayed for in vitro kinase activity toward the Ser20 site of FLp53 tetramers, which was detected by Western blotting using P-p53 Ser20(top) and DO-12 (bottom) antibodies. Negative (-; lane 1) and input (I; lane 2) controls were included and consisted of distilled H2O and the peak fraction as the kinase source, respectively. Fractions depleted of CK1α and VRK1 are shown in lanes 4-7 and lanes 9-12, respectively, and negative control reactions, where the antibody was omitted, are shown in lanes 3 and 8. B and C, immunodepleted fractions, or flow-through (lanes 1-5), and the corresponding immune pellet, or eluate (lanes 6-10), were subjected to Western blotting with antibodies to CK1α (B) or VRK1 (C). Fractions depleted of CK1α and VRK1 are shown in B and C, respectively, and negative control reactions, where the antibody was omitted from the immunoprecipitation reactions, are shown in lanes 1 and 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Together, these results demonstrate that CK1α is the most likely cellular virus-induced Ser20 site kinase. However, we still set up assays to compare recombinant CK1δ kinase domain purified from Escherichia coli with the native enzyme purified from MOLT-3 cells in order to determine whether the native enzyme has the same properties as the recombinant CK1. Recombinant CK1δ was able to mimic the native enzyme and catalyze Ser20 site phosphorylation of FLp53 tetramers in vitro (Fig. 8A, lane 5 versus lane 3). This finding is consistent with the original data on CK1δ, which showed that mutation of p53 at Ser20 is sufficient to block completely p53 phosphorylation (11Dumaz N. Milne D.M. Meek D.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We could not detect p53 Thr18 phosphorylation induced by native or recombinant CK1 using a well validated Thr18-phosphospecific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 8B, lanes 3 and 5), which might be expected, since recombinant CK1δ-mediated phosphorylation at Thr18 requires a prior phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 by phosphoinositide 3-kinases (11Dumaz N. Milne D.M. Meek D.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser20 by Native CK1α Is Dependent on Interactions with the BOX-IV and BOX-V Domains of p53—All enzymes reported to modify the Thr18 or Ser20 sites within the BOX-I domain of p53 to date also interact with the multiprotein docking site in the BOX-V domain of p53 (Fig. 9). The three-dimensional proximity of the BOX-V motif to the BOX-I motif in tetrameric p53 is not known. However, synthetic peptide fragments from the BOX-V domain of p53 can alter in trans the BOX-I Ser20 site kinase activity of the respective enzymes (18Craig A.L. Chrystal J.A. Fraser J.A. Sphyris N.

https://openalex.org/W2081856536,"A cytoplasmic nontransport K+/Rb+ site in the P-domain of the Na+, K+-ATPase has been identified by anomalous difference Fourier map analysis of crystals of the [Rb2]⋅E2⋅MgF42− form of the enzyme. The functional roles of this third K+/Rb+ binding site were studied by site-directed mutagenesis, replacing the side chain of Asp742 donating oxygen ligand(s) to the site with alanine, glutamate, and lysine. Unlike the wild-type Na+, K+-ATPase, the mutants display a biphasic K+ concentration dependence of E2P dephosphorylation, indicating that the cytoplasmic K+ site is involved in activation of dephosphorylation. The affinity of the site is lowered significantly (30-200-fold) by the mutations, the lysine mutation being most disruptive. Moreover, the mutations accelerate the E2 to E1 conformational transition, again with the lysine substitution resulting in the largest effect. Hence, occupation of the cytoplasmic K+/Rb+ site not only enhances E2P dephosphorylation but also stabilizes the E2 dephosphoenzyme. These characteristics of the previously unrecognized nontransport site make it possible to account for the hitherto poorly understood trans-effects of cytoplasmic K+ by the consecutive transport model, without implicating a simultaneous exposure of the transport sites toward the cytoplasmic and extracellular sides of the membrane. The cytoplasmic K+/Rb+ site appears to be conserved among Na+, K+-ATPases and P-type ATPases in general, and its mode of operation may be associated with stabilizing the loop structure at the C-terminal end of the P6 helix of the P-domain, thereby affecting the function of highly conserved catalytic residues and promoting helix-helix interactions between the P- and A-domains in the E2 state.

The essential gradients for Na+ and K+ across the plasma membranes of mammalian cells are created by the Na+, K+-ATPase, a membranous enzyme that couples ATP hydrolysis to active extrusion of Na+ from the cells and uptake of K+ at a stoichiometry of three Na+ ions exchanged for two K+ ions per ATP molecule utilized (1Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. 1993; 462: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The Na+, K+-ATPase belongs to the family of P-type ATPases characterized by the formation of a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate through transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to a conserved aspartate residue in the enzyme. The ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled to ion translocation, because Na+ binding from the cytoplasmic side triggers phosphorylation of the enzyme from ATP, whereas K+ binding from the extracellular side leads to rapid dephosphorylation (3Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of the Na+, K+-ATPase was determined at 3.5 Å resolution (4Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. L.-M. Sørensen T. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), revealing two Rb+ ions bound as K+ congeners close together in a pocket formed by the transmembrane segments M4, 2The abbreviations used are: M1-M10, transmembrane segments numbered from the N terminus; K0.5, ligand concentration giving half-maximum effect; SERCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. 2The abbreviations used are: M1-M10, transmembrane segments numbered from the N terminus; K0.5, ligand concentration giving half-maximum effect; SERCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. M5, M6, and M8 of the catalytic α-subunit. The α-subunit consists of 10 transmembrane segments, M1-M10, and a large cytoplasmic part containing three distinct domains denoted A (actuator), N (nucleotide-binding), and P (phosphorylation), by analogy to the closely related sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). In contrast to the Ca2+-ATPase, which is a single subunit enzyme, the Na+, K+-ATPase complex crystallized consists of, in addition to the α-subunit, also a β-subunit, required for routing the α-subunit to the plasma membrane, and a γ-subunit known to have a regulatory role. The catalytic hydrolysis of ATP takes place in the cytoplasmic part of the α-subunit and appears to involve movements of the cytoplasmic domains that are transmitted to the transmembrane part, causing structural changes that expose the membranous cation binding sites alternatively toward the two sides of the membrane and switch their ion selectivity between Na+ and K+. Some of the residues involved in coordinating two of the three Na+ ions binding from the cytoplasmic side seem to be involved also in the coordination of the two K+ ions binding from the extracellular side (4Morth J.P.

Physiol. 2003; 65: 817-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and the functional cycle of the Na+, K+-ATPase has generally been described in terms of a consecutive (“ping-pong”) mechanism, where Na+ is translocated before K+ (“Post-Albers model”; Scheme 1 (3Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The conformational states showing Na+ and K+ selectivity are usually denoted E1 and E2, respectively.Although a large body of evidence seems to support the transport mechanism shown in Scheme 1, there are also observations that are not satisfactorily accounted for by the consecutive exposure of the ion binding sites toward the cytoplasmic and extracellular sides of the membrane. Hence, trans-effects requiring the simultaneous presence of ion-binding sites accessible from the cytoplasmic and the extracellular surface have been observed under certain conditions (13Skou J.C. Glynn I. Ellory C. The Sodium Pump. The Company of Biologists, Ltd., Cambridge, UK1985: 575-588Google Scholar, 14Cornelius F. Biochim. Biophys.

Rockefeller University Press, New York1991: 249-266Google Scholar) and are sometimes interpreted in terms of simultaneous binding of Na+ and K+ at transport sites in two “out of phase” subunits of a dimeric pump protein. For the present study, it is of particular importance that cytoplasmic K+ has been shown to stimulate Na+ transport toward the extracellular side (16Garay R.P. Garrahan P.J. J. Physiol. 1973; 231: 297-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 18Yoda A. Yoda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10320-10325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the processing of the phosphoenzyme involved in extracellular Na+ release and dephosphorylation activated by extracellular K+ (18Yoda A. Yoda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10320-10325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To account for these effects, it seems necessary to postulate the presence of at least one cytoplasmically facing K+ site existing simultaneously with the two extracellularly facing K+ transport sites. Such an additional K+ site with cytoplasmic access would also be consistent with the inhibitory effect of cytoplasmic K+ on the transition between E2 and E1 forms observed under some conditions (19Cornelius F. Skou J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1067: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This site might in some way be involved in transport or could be a structural or regulatory site. Indeed, in SERCA, the activity is under the influence of a cytoplasmic K+ site in the P-domain (20Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Olesen C. Sorensen T.L. Nielsen R.C. Moller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and a similar site has been identified in the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase by mutational analysis (23Buch-Pedersen M.J. Rudashevskaya E.L.B. Venema K. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38285-38292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the existence and functional role of a similar K+ site in the Na+, K+-ATPase has remained unresolved.In the present report, we reveal the existence of such an additional (third) Rb+/K+ binding site in the structure of the Na+, K+-ATPase α-subunit. This site is located in the cytoplasmic part of the α-subunit, in the P-domain, and is, thus, not directly involved in the binding of the translocated ions. By use of site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate its functional importance, both in connection with the dephosphorylation of E2P induced by K+ binding to the membranous transport sites in their extracellularly facing configuration and in connection with the E2 → E1 transition of the dephosphoenzyme. The affinity of the site for cytoplasmic K+ is relatively high, and it is therefore likely to be permanently saturated at the high internal K+ concentration present under physiological conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystallography—The Na+, K+-ATPase crystals were obtained with the pig α1-isoform in the presence of magnesium fluoride and Rb+ as described (4Morth J.P.

The active site concentration was determined by phosphorylation at 0 °C in the presence of 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 3 mm Mg2+, 150 mm Na+, and oligomycin (20 μg/ml) to block dephosphorylation and thereby obtain stoichiometric phosphorylation. The contribution from endogenous Na+, K+-ATPase in the functional assays was eliminated by including ouabain in the reaction media at a concentration sufficient to inhibit the endogenous enzyme but too low to affect the rat Na+, K+-ATPase.Each data point shown is the average value corresponding to at least two independent measurements.

Recently, the Na+, K+-ATPase was crystallized, and its structure was determined at 3.5 Å resolution in the [Rb2]⋅E2⋅MgF42− form, where two Rb+ ions are bound at the membranous transport sites in an occluded state (4Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. L.-M. Sørensen T. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Here we report that the [Rb2]⋅E2⋅MgF42− crystal structure in fact contains an additional, third Rb+ ion, which is bound in the cytoplasmic part of the molecule about 30 Å above the two membranous transport sites. As seen in Fig. 1A, the third Rb+ ion is located in a binding cavity at the boundary between the P-domain (green) and the transmembrane domain (blue) with open access to the cytoplasmic medium. The two Rb+ ions bound in the transmembrane region are not seen in the surface representation of Fig. 1A, because they are buried in an occluded state between the membrane segments. In Fig. 1D, all of the three Rb+ sites are identified by the anomalous difference Fourier map contoured at a 5σ level. One elongated, major peak encompasses the two, closely spaced transport sites with bound Rb+, and another peak is observed corresponding to the cytoplasmic surface. Both regions appear at the same position in the two Na+, K+-ATPase molecules of the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1D), and the corresponding peaks are related by noncrystallographic symmetry. At the concentration of 5 mm Rb+ applied here, the electron density corresponding to the cytoplasmic site is somewhat weaker than that observed for the transport sites but nevertheless high enough to suggest an affinity for the third Rb+ ion comparable to that of the transport sites. Under the present experimental conditions, Rb+ is the only anomalous scatterer of significance. The identification of the third site through anomalous difference Fourier density allows us to unambiguously assign the peak density as a Rb+ ion, as opposed to other monovalent cations present like Na+, K+ (both may be present in trace amounts) or choline+ (present at 100 mm concentration). Under physiological conditions at ∼150 mm intracellular K+, this site is probably occupied by K+. The Rb+/K+ ion seems to interact with at least four backbone carbonyl groups (residues 720, 3All numbering of Na+, K+-ATPase residues in this article refers to the sequence of the rat α1-isoform. 721, 723, and 724) and one or two side chain oxygen atoms from Asp742 (see close up in Fig. 1, B and E, and the alignment highlighting the coordinating residues in Fig. 1C), either by direct coordination or indirectly through an intervening water molecule. These P-domain residues show high conservation among Na+, K+-ATPases and among P-type ATPases in general, the aspartate that contributes side chain oxygen(s) being replaced by glutamate only in the SERCA type of Ca2+-ATPases (Fig. 1C). The backbone carbonyl oxygen ligands are donated by residues within the loop between the sixth helix of the P-domain (“P6 helix”) and the following β-strand. Asp742 is positioned in the loop between the seventh helix of the P-domain (“P7 helix”) and a β-strand that leads into the M5 transmembrane segment (Fig. 1E). The distances between the putative oxygen ligands and the Rb+ ion are indicated in Table 1 and compared with the corresponding distances in various Ca2+-ATPase crystal structures, where either K+ or Na+ is bound at the equivalent site. It is of notice that generally the distances corresponding to the first three carbonyl oxygen groups (720/711, 721/712, and 723/714) are longer in the Na+, K+-ATPase than in the Ca2+-ATPase, which may reflect the larger radius of the Rb+ ion (1.52 Å) relative to the radii of the K+ and Na+ ions (1.38 and 1.02 Å, respectively) bound in the Ca2+-ATPase crystal structures. The particularly large distance (4.92 Å) for Ser720 may imply second, aqueous sphere coordination.FIGURE 1Location of the cytoplasmic K+ site.

Open table in a new tab Expression and Catalytic Turnover Rate—To study the functional importance of the third Rb+/K+ binding site and of Asp742 in particular, we replaced the latter residue with alanine (to remove the side chain oxygen ligands), with glutamate (the residue present at the equivalent position in SERCA), and with lysine (to disrupt the site) and studied the effects on the overall and partial reactions of the Na+, K+-ATPase transport cycle. The mutations were introduced in the rat α1-isoform, which has an in-built low affinity for ouabain, allowing the wild-type and mutant rat enzymes to be expressed at high levels using the mammalian COS cell system under ouabain-selective pressure (8Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Jewell E.A. Lingrel J. B J. Biol.

The mutants were capable of sustaining cell growth in the presence of ouabain at a concentration inhibiting the endogenous COS cell Na+, K+-ATPase, indicating that the Na+ and K+ transport rates of the mutants were sufficiently high to be compatible with cell viability.The Na+- and K+-stimulated ATPase activity and the active site concentration (maximal phosphorylation capacity) were measured on isolated membranes containing the expressed exogenous enzyme, and the catalytic turnover rate was calculated as the ratio between these two numbers. Fig. 2 depicts the catalytic turnover rate in the presence of 130 mm Na+ and 20 or 100 mm K+. At 20 mm K+, all mutants displayed a reduction in the turnover rate relative to wild type, the most severe effect being observed for mutation D742K, causing a decrease to approximately one-third that of the wild type. In the wild type, the ATPase activity was maximally activated at 20 mm K+, whereas the ATPase activity of the mutants increased, when the K+ concentration was raised to 100 mm.FIGURE 2Catalytic turnover rate at 20 and 100 mm K+. The Na+, K+-ATPase activity was determined at 37 °C in the presence of 30 mm histidine buffer (pH 7.4), 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, ouabain to inhibit the endogenous enzyme and 20 or 100 mm KCl. The catalytic turnover rate was calculated as the ratio between the Na+, K+-ATPase activity and the active site concentration (maximum phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP measured at 0 °C in the presence of 150 mm NaCl and oligomycin) (29Toustrup-Jensen M.

Such an effect might be caused either by an increase of the intrinsic Na+ affinity of the E1 form or by a shift in the E1-E2 equilibrium of the dephosphoenzyme in favor of E1.TABLE 2Analysis of the E1-E2 equilibrium of the dephosphoenzymeK0.5(Na+)aATPase activity was measured at 37 °C in the presence of 20 mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 30 mm histidine buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, ouabain to inhibit the endogenous enzyme and various concentrations of NaCl (26).

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 shows the ATP dependence of the Na+, K+-ATPase activity (the K0.5 values are listed in Table 2). D742K showed a marked increase in the affinity for ATP, corresponding to about ∼11-fold reduction of the K0.5 value relative to that of the wild type, whereas the affinity was increased (K0.5 reduced) 2.3-fold for the D742A and D742E mutants. ATP has dual roles in the reaction cycle; binding with high affinity to the E1 form, it phosphorylates the enzyme, and binding with low affinity to the K+ occluded E2 form, it accelerates the K+ deoccluding E2 → E1 transition (indicated by the boxed ATP in Scheme 1) (1Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. 1993; 462: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because of the latter effect, the apparent affinity for ATP in the activation of Na+, K+-ATPase activity should increase, as observed, if the E2 → E1 step were accelerated by the mutation (29Toustrup-Jensen M.

https://openalex.org/W1988597925,"Most DNA replication systems include a sliding clamp that encircles the genomic DNA and links the polymerase to the template to control polymerase processivity. A loading complex is required to open the clamp and place it onto the DNA. In phage T4 this complex consists of a trimeric clamp of gp45 subunits and a pentameric loader assembly of four gp44 and one gp62 subunit(s), with clamp loading driven by ATP binding. We measure this binding as a function of input ligand concentration and show that four ATPs bind to the gp44/62 complex with equal affinity. In contrast, the ATPase rate profile of the clamp-clamp loader complex exhibits a marked peak at an input ATP concentration close to the overall Kd (approximately 30 microm), with further increases in bound ATP decreasing the ATPase rate to a much lower level. Thus the progressive binding of the four ATPs triggers a conformational change in the complex that markedly inhibits ATPase activity. This inhibition is related to ring opening by using a clamp that is covalently cross-linked across its subunit interfaces and thus rendered incapable of opening. Binding of this clamp abolishes substrate inhibition of the ATPase but leaves ATP binding unchanged. We show that four ATP ligands must bind to the T4 clamp loader before the loader can be fully ""activated"" and the clamp opened, and that ATP hydrolysis is required only for release of the loader complex after clamp loading onto the replication fork has been completed."

In this study, ATP increased MUC5AC mRNA in primary human nasal epithelial cells and in NCI-H292 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells in vitro. ATP-induced MUC5AC mRNA was mediated by phospholipase Cβ3. A dominant-negative mutation in the PDZ binding domain of PLCβ3 inhibited ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression. ATP sequentially activated the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, p38, RSK1, and cAMP-responding element-binding protein (CREB) in a protein kinase C-independent manner. ATP-induced MUC5AC mRNA levels were regulated by CREB via direct interaction with c-Ets1 on the MUC5AC gene promoter (located –938 to –930). Effects of CREB and c-Ets1 were additive. Inhibition of either CREB or c-Ets1 inhibited ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression. Stimulation with ATP caused the direct binding of CREB and c-Ets1 to the MUC5AC promoter, increasing the phosphorylation of c-Ets1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that in the presence of ATP, both c-Ets1 and CREB bound to the MUC5AC promoter. The effects of exogenous ATP on MUC5AC gene expression are mediated by a complex regulatory cascade controlling interactions between CREB and c-Ets1 that bind to a promoter element in the MUC5AC gene enhancing MUC5AC gene transcription.

ATP-dependent activation of MUC5AC gene expression via CREB-c-Ets1 may contribute to mucous cell hypersecretion associated with common respiratory disorders. Mucus hypersecretion in the airway epithelium is a major characteristic of a number of respiratory diseases, including rhinitis, sinusitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis (1.Rose M.C. Voynow J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 245-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Because bacteria, cytokines, and stimulants can interact with host epithelial cells and activate intracellular signaling pathways thereby causing a selective increase in specific mucin gene expression and Mucin production, it is important to clarify the molecular mechanism of these interactions. An understanding of the mechanisms that lead to increased mucus secretion in respiratory diseases is critical to improve future therapies. MUC5AC is one of the major mucin genes in the human respiratory tract, so clarification of the mechanisms regulating MUC5AC gene expression is essential for identifying strategies to prevent airway mucus hypersecretion. Until now, there have been no reports on ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression in the airway, because most of the studies on ATP have taken an electrophysiological approach to determine the role of agonist in inducing Mucin secretion (2.Kreda S.M. Okada S.F. van Heusden C.A. O'Neal W. Gabriel S. Abdullah L. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Lazarowski E.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 584: 245-259Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3.Zhu Y. Ehre C.

Thus, the mechanism by which ATP can induce mucin gene expression in the airway remains unclear. ATP signaling is processed through purinergic receptors. P2Y is a G-protein-coupled receptor, and P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, and P2Y11 receptors are highly expressed in NHNE cells (4.Kim C.H. Kim S.S. Choi J.Y. Shin J.H. Kim J.Y. Namkung W. Lee J.G. Lee M.G.

PLCβ isotypes have a long C-terminal region (∼400 residues) that has a relatively low homology among family members (6.Jhon D.Y. Lee H.H. Park D. Lee C.W. Lee K.H. Yoo O.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

We therefore examined the role of c-Ets1 in signal transduction facilitated by interactions with other nuclear transcription factors. Because increased MUC5AC gene expression during inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of airway diseases, we examined whether extracellular ATP up-regulates MUC5AC gene expression by activating specific signal transduction pathways. Here, we show that PLCβ3, Akt, MAPK, RSK1, and CREB are sequentially essential for ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression in airway epithelial cells. We also show that CREB mediates the phosphorylation of c-Ets1, which leads to the formation of a protein complex that binds the MUC5AC promoter. Materials—ATP and lipopolysaccharide were purchased from Sigma. All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), except for the antibody for c-Ets1, which was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All of the PLCβ3 isotypes were kindly provided by Dr. Pann-Ghill Suh (Department of Life Science, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea). PLCβ3 isotypes in pcDNA3.1 were constructed from the cDNA of each of the mutated PLCβ3 isotypes. Each of the individual residues of the PDZ-binding motif (NTQL) of PLCβ3 were mutated to Ala codons (8.Hwang J.I. Heo K. Shin K.J. Kim E. Yun C. Ryu S.H. Shin H.S. Suh P.G. J. Biol.

Cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of bronchial epithelial cell growth medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing all the supplements described previously (12.Yoon J.H. Kim K.S. Kim S.S. Lee G.J. Park I.Y. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 2000; 109: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown while submerged for the first 9 days, during which time the culture medium was changed on day 1 and every other day thereafter. The air-liquid interface was created on day 9 by removing the apical medium and feeding the cultures only from the basal compartment. The human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line (NCI-H292) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1848; Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. For serum deprivation, confluent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and recultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.2% fetal bovine serum. RT-PCR—Real time PCR was performed using an iQ iCycler detection system (Bio-Rad) with iQ SYBR Green Supermix. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl, which included 10 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 300 nm of each primer, and 1 μl of previously reverse-transcribed cDNA template. The following primers were used: MUC5AC, forward 5′-CAGCCACGTCCCCTTCAATA-3′ and reverse 5′-ACCGCATTTGGGCATCC-3′; and β2-microglobulin, used as a reference for normalization, forward 5′-CGCTCCGTGGCCTTAGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GAGTACGCTGGATAGCCTCCA-3′. Real time RT-PCR was performed on a MiniOption real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Parameters were 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. All reactions were performed in triplicate. The relative quantity of MUC5AC mRNA was obtained using the comparative cycle threshold method and was normalized using β2-microglobulin as an endogenous control. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—NCI-H292 cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates. After treatment with ATP, cells were lysed with 2× lysis buffer (250 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.5), 2% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by 10–15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated overnight with primary antibody in TTBS (0.5% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline). After washing with TTBS, blots were further incubated for 45 min at room temperature with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Cell Signaling) in TTBS and visualized using the ECL system (GE Healthcare). For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping into lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor tablet (Complete Mini; Roche Applied Science)), sonicated (four times each for 5 s), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatant lysates (230 μl) were pre-cleared with Gammabind G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 30 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, anti-Ets-1 antisera were added to pre-cleared lysates, incubated for 14 h at 4 °C, and microcentrifuged at 4 °C. The pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer. GST Pulldown Assay—GST fusion proteins were expressed in and purified from bacteria using a glutathione affinity matrix. The GST fusion proteins were eluted from the matrix with glutathione and desalted by centrifugation (Centricon YM-3; Millipore). For interaction assays with cell lysates, the GST fusion protein (250 nm) was incubated with cell lysate (∼4 mg of protein/ml) for 1 h at 24 °C in a total volume of 250 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 70 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 mm EDTA). A volume of 12.5 μl of packed glutathione-Sepharose slurry was added, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 20 min, after which the affinity matrix was pelleted and washed three times with 500 μl of incubation buffer. Proteins retained on the matrix were solubilized in 2× Laemmli loading buffer and separated by electrophoresis. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assays—For luciferase assays, cells were plated in 12-well plates 1 day prior to transfection using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with ATP for 24 h. For the MUC5AC promoter-driven luciferase assay, cells were maintained in serum-free RPMI media for 16–18 h before treatment with ATP. Cells were harvested 24 h after ATP treatment, and the luciferase activity in cell extracts was determined using a luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega; Madison, WI). Luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase. Transfection experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed with the EZ ChIP assay kit and protocol (Upstate). A total of 4.5 × 107 cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Isolated nuclei were lysed followed by chromatin shearing with the enzymatic shearing kit (Active Motif; Carlsbad, CA). A rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) was used as the control. After reverse cross-linking and DNA purification, DNA from input (1:20 diluted) or immunoprecipitated samples were assayed by PCR, and the products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The following were the primers used to detect the c-Ets1 element in the MUC5AC promoter: forward, GTGTTCATCACACAACAGCACC, and reverse, TCCAGAAATGCTCAGTACCCTCTG. This PCR product did not contain a CRE site. Control primers were for a site ∼2,200 bp upstream of c-Ets1 as follows: forward, GCCCCACTGACATAACCACCTGGC, and reverse, GGTCTGACTCGACCAGGTGTAGCC. Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Where appropriate, statistical differences were assessed by Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney tests. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Extracellular ATP Induces MUC5AC Gene Expression in Normal Human Nasal Epithelial Cells and NCI-H292 Cells—There has been no report on the induction of MUC5AC gene expression by extracellular ATP as ATP studies have primarily focused on electrophysiology. We examined whether ATP could induce mucin gene expression, because ATP stimulates Mucin secretion, and could participate as an inflammation mediator that can send a signal to nearby cells. First, to examine if ATP increases MUC5AC gene expression in normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells, real time PCR analysis was performed. NHNE cells were treated with various doses of ATP for 24 h. Increased MUC5AC gene expression occurred in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 9.4 ± 0.15 μm (Fig. 1A), and as a result, 10 μm ATP was used for all the subsequent experiments. In addition, MUC5AC gene expression increased in a time-dependent manner for up to 12 h after ATP treatment and then reached a plateau (Fig. 1B). These results show that extracellular ATP induces MUC5AC gene expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in NHNE cells. When the same experiments (Fig. 1) were performed using NCI-H292 cells, a human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line, the results were the same (data not shown). Thus, we used NCI-H292 cells for all subsequent molecular experiments. PLCβ3 and Akt Are Essential for ATP-induced MUC5AC Gene Expression—To determine which molecules are involved in the downstream signaling of Gαq in ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression, we investigated phospholipase C (PLC) β3 (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylation of PLCβ3 by ATP reached a maximum at 5 min. Interestingly, there are short consensus sequences known as postsynaptic density-95/discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding motifs that consist of the amino acids -X(S/T)X(V/L)-COOH at the immediate C terminus of the PLCβ3 isotype (13.Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain of PLCβ3 binds four amino acids of target proteins to the C terminus (8.Hwang J.I. Heo K. Shin K.J. Kim E. Yun C. Ryu S.H. Shin H.S. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16632-16637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14.Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 15.Hwang J.I. Kim H.S. Lee J.R. Kim E. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12467-12473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To identify whether the PDZ domain of the C terminus of PLCβ3 plays an important role in ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression, each of the last four amino acid residues of PLCβ3 (1231NTQL1234-COOH) was mutated to Ala. When treated with ATP, cells transfected with the construct expressing wild-type PLCβ3 showed an increase in MUC5AC gene expression, whereas the cells transfected with the construct expressing the dominant-negative mutant PLCβ3 NTQA (L1234A), but not PLCβ3 ATQL (N1231A), NAQL (T1232A), or NTAL (Q1233A), showed a dramatic suppression of MUC5AC gene expression (Fig. 2B). This result indicates that the Leu residue of the PDZ domain in PLCβ3 is essential for interacting with some target signaling molecule(s) to induce MUC5AC gene expression after ATP treatment. In addition, phosphorylation of PLCβ3 and Akt were suppressed when cells were transfected with the PLCβ3 NTQA dominant-negative construct (Fig. 2C). Even though many reports have shown that PLCβ3 regulates PKC activation, it appears that PKC is not involved in ATP-induced signaling (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, whereas PKC phosphorylation was not altered by ATP, Akt phosphorylation reached a maximum at 5 min. This result may indicate that ATP signaling is mediated through PLCβ3 and Akt. To examine the role of Akt in ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression in our system, we used both wild-type Akt and siRNA-Akt constructs. Wild-type Akt activated the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK, whereas an siRNA-Akt construct inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK but not PLCβ3. In addition, Akt levels were increased in cells transfected with construct expressing wild-type Akt and decreased in cells transfected with siRNA-Akt. However, MUC5AC gene expression increased when cells were transfected with wild-type Akt compared with treatment with ATP alone (Fig. 2F), and MUC5AC gene expression was significantly suppressed by siRNA-Akt. These results show that PLCβ3 and Akt appear to function together in a pathway mediating ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression and Akt functions downstream of PLCβ3 in NCI-H292 cells. Both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs Are Essential for ATP-induced MUC5AC Gene Expression—We also investigated whether the ERK1/2 or p38 pathways are involved in ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 peaked at 5 min after ATP treatment (Fig. 3A), and no change in phosphorylation of JNK was observed. To investigate the possible involvement of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs in ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression, either the siRNA-ERK1/2 or siRNA-p38 construct was applied before treatment with ATP. Western blot analysis showed that the siRNA-ERK1/2 and siRNA-p38 constructs clearly inhibit ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, respectively (Fig. 3B). We also examined the transcript level of MUC5AC by performing real time PCR analysis (Fig. 3C). Whereas ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression was higher in cells transfected with wild-type constructs compared with cells treated with ATP alone, MUC5AC gene expression was significantly suppressed by both siRNA constructs. These results suggest that both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs may be downstream signaling proteins of Akt and may be essential for ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression. ATP-induced MUC5AC Gene Expression Is Mediated by RSK1 and CREB Sequentially but Not by MSK1—To determine which molecules are involved in the nuclear signaling of ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression, we examined mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK) 1, p90 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (RSK) 1, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), which are all associated with calcium activation. As seen in Fig. 4A, alterations were seen in the phosphorylation status of RSK1 and CREB after ATP treatment, but no changes were observed for MSK1. RSK1 phosphorylation peaked at 5 min and then decreased back to base line 20 min after ATP treatment. This is in contrast to findings for other proinflammatory mediators like IL-1β or tumor necrosis factor-α, where RSK1 peaked 30 min after treatment (16.Song K.S. Seong J.K. Chung K.C. Lee W.J. Kim C.H. Cho K.N. Kang C.D. Koo J.S. Yoon J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34890-34896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), demonstrating that phosphorylation of RSK1 occurs more rapidly when stimulated by ATP. To examine the signaling molecules downstream of RSK1, we investigated CREB, a well known downstream molecule of RSK1. Transient phosphorylation of CREB was observed upon stimulation with ATP, reaching a maximum peak at 5–10 min. These results show the possible involvement of RSK1 and CREB in ATP-induced signaling during inflammation. To confirm the role of RSK1 and CREB at the cellular level, we used constructs expressing wild-type ERK1/2, p38, RSK1, and CREB, and we also used specific siRNAs for these proteins. Interestingly, inhibition of either ERK1/2 or p38 MAPK decreased RSK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B), suggesting that RSK1 activity is simultaneously controlled by both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs and that RSK1 may act as a downstream signaling molecule of these MAPKs. In addition, CREB phosphorylation was decreased by siRNA-RSK1. These results suggest that RSK1 acts upstream of CREB. Furthermore, siRNA-RSK1 and siRNA-CREB constructs also decreased the steady-state level of MUC5AC mRNA expression in NCI-H292 cells (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that RSK1 and CREB are controlled by ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs, sequentially, and may be involved in ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression in the nucleus. cis-Acting Regulatory Element, c-Ets1, Mediates ATP-induced MUC5AC Transcriptional Activity—To identify the ATP-responsive region within the MUC5AC promoter, cells were transiently transfected with various deletion mutants and treated with ATP for 24 h. ATP selectively increased the luciferase activity of the –950/–1 region of the MUC5AC promoter. ATP-induced luciferase activity of the –929/–1 region of the MUC5AC promoter was lower than that of the –950/–1 regions, indicating that the –950/–929 region of the MUC5AC promoter may be necessary for its response to ATP (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, there is no CRE site in the –950/–929 region. This finding suggests that a transcription factor other than CREB may have a crucial role. To identify the ATP-responsive cis-element in the MUC5AC promoter, we used the TFSEARCH version 1.3 data base. This search strategy identified a candidate, c-Ets1 (score = 91.2; threshold, 90.0). To date, more than 25 mammalian Ets family members have been characterized and are known to control important biological processes, including cellular proliferation, differentiation, lymphocyte development and activation, and transformation by recognizing a GCA core motif in the promoter or enhancer of their target genes (9.Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6514-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether c-Ets1, which was found within the –938/–930 region of the MUC5AC promoter, might act as a cis-element, three constructs for selective mutagenesis of the c-Ets1-binding site were generated. Only the –932 mutant construct decreased the responsiveness of the wild-type MUC5AC promoter construct (Fig. 5B). However, neither the –935 nor –938 mutant constructs were able to suppress luciferase activity. These results suggest that c-Ets1 (–938/–930 region) in the regulatory region of the MUC5AC promoter may be critical for ATP-induced up-regulation of MUC5AC transcriptional activity. To investigate whether c-Ets-mediated activity was affected by CREB, we co-transfected the –950/–1 construct as a wild type, a –929/–1 construct that did not contain a c-Ets1 site, or a –932m construct as a site-directed mutation of c-Ets1 site with either wild-type CREB, siRNA-CREB, wild-type c-Ets1, or siRNA-c-Ets1, respectively. The activity of the –950/–1 construct was not affected by wild-type CREB but was decreased in the presence of siRNA-CREB. In addition, the activity of the –950/–1 construct increased with the wild-type c-Ets1 but decreased with the siRNA-c-Ets1. However, the activity of the –929/–1 construct only slightly increased with wild-type CREB and decreased with the siRNA-CREB. The –932m construct activity was not affected by these genes. These results suggest that the activity of the –950/–1 construct is mainly regulated by c-Ets and is partially affected by CREB. c-Ets1 Up-regulates ATP-induced MUC5AC Gene Expression through Interaction with CREB—To examine whether c-Ets1 affects ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression, transient transfection with a plasmid construct encoding either wild-type c-Ets1 or siRNA-c-Ets1 was performed (Fig. 6A). Whereas wild-type c-Ets1 up-regulated ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression, siRNA-c-Ets1 attenuated MUC5AC gene expression, demonstrating that c-Ets1 may play an important role in ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression. Next, to further investigate the effect of ATP on c-Ets1 activity, cells were treated with ATP in a time-dependent manner, and c-Ets1 phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot analysis using a specific antibody against phosphorylated c-Ets1 (Ser(P)-282). c-Ets1 was rapidly phosphorylated 10 min after ATP treatment, and this persisted for up to 15 min (Fig. 6B). In addition, ATP could induce CREB and c-Ets1 activation in NHNE cells and in vivo (data not shown). Furthermore, to determine the effect of RSK1 or CREB on the phosphorylation of c-Ets1, we used both wild-type and siRNA constructs of RSK1, CREB, and c-Ets1 (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, siRNA-CREB suppressed the phosphorylation of c-Ets1, whereas siRNA of c-Ets1 had no effect the phosphorylation of CREB. In addition, RSK1 did not affect the phosphorylation of c-Ets1. These results suggest that CREB may activate c-Ets1 in an RSK1-independent manner. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between c-Ets1 and CREB in ATP-induced MUC5AC gene expression because both c-Ets1 and CREB are transcription factors, and c-Ets1 activity is selectively regulated by interactions with different transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-κB, and Pax family members (9.Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6514-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To explore the interaction between c-Ets1 and CREB using in vitro binding assays, we gen"
https://openalex.org/W2052676882,"First revealed in cancer studies, HURP (hepatoma up-regulated protein) is a cell cycle-associated gene with elevated expression in the G2/M phase. Cell culture studies have revealed that HURP is an essential factor required for spindle formation and chromosome congression during mitosis. However, the function of HURP in an in vivo context has not been explored. We generated a Hurp knock-out (Hurp–/–) mouse to investigate the role of HURP in development under normal physiological conditions. Hurp–/– mice develop normally and are indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates. Interestingly, breeding experiments revealed that Hurp–/– females are completely infertile, whereas the males reproduce normally. Ovulation, fertilization, and pre-implantation embryo development are normal; however, the Hurp–/– females are unable to form implantation sites due to an inability to undergo the decidual reaction. This is caused by a defect in endometrial stromal proliferation that leads to implantation failure. Additionally, HURP expression in the uterus coincides with the implantation stage and can be induced by estrogen treatment. Our results demonstrate for the first time that HURP affects endometrial stromal proliferation during implantation but is dispensable during normal development in mice; specifically, HURP has an essential function in uterine biology.

Specifically, HURP plays a crucial role during chromosome congression, which is the process whereby microtubules attach to the kinetochore of chromosomes and move the chromosomes to the metaphase plate during mitosis; depletion of HURP in cells results in chromosome misalignment at the metaphase plate (8Sanderson H.S.

Although cell culture studies have revealed that HURP is an essential factor required for mitosis, the role of HURP in development under normal physiological conditions has not been explored. In this study, we applied a mouse genetics approach and discovered, serendipitously, that HURP deficiency leads to female infertility caused by implantation failure. Implantation of embryos into the uterus is a sophisticated and important process for viviparous animals. In mice, decidualization, which is characterized by endometrial stromal proliferation and differentiation, is crucial for the establishment of a fetal-maternal interface during implantation (10Dey S.K.

Here, we demonstrated that HURP is an essential cell cycle regulator that is needed for successful stromal proliferation during the process of decidualization to transform the uterine endometrium into a receptive state for blastocyst implantation in mice. Most important, this is a newly discovered molecular influence of HURP on implantation and represents an example whereby a deficiency in a cell cycle-associated gene exhibits phenotypic effects specifically on certain tissues, in this case, the endometrial stroma, but seems to be dispensable in normal cell proliferation during mouse development.

Mating, Embryo Collection, and Implantation Sites—Female mice were bred with wild-type fertile males for uterus sampling at different pregnancy stages. Virginal plugs were checked in the morning before 10:00. Sampling of the pregnant uteri was carried out between 11:00 and 13:00. On day 4 of pregnancy (day 1 = vaginal plug), uteri were flushed with M2 medium to recover the pre-implantation blastocysts (13Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The collected blastocysts were examined under a dissecting microscope (Leica). Implantation sites on day 6 of pregnancy were visualized by intravenous injection of Chicago Blue B dye (1% in phosphate-buffered saline; 0.1 ml/mouse) through tail veins (14Tranguch S. Cheung-Flynn J. Daikoku T. Prapapanich V. Cox M.B. Xie H. Wang H. Das S.K. Smith D.F. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The number of implantation sites as demarcated by distinct blue bands was then recorded. Immunohistochemistry, DNA Synthesis, and Mitotic Index—Antibodies against bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Dako M0744) and phosphohistone H3 (pH3; Upstate 06-570) were used for DNA synthesis and mitotic index analyses. Rabbit anti-mouse HURP polyclonal antibody was generated and used for HURP immunohistochemistry (IHC). Detailed experimental procedures for RNA analysis, artificial decidualization, and IHC are described in the supplemental “Methods.” Hurp Expression Coincides with Cell Proliferation in Wild-type Mice—Multiple tissues of Northern blot analysis showed that a higher level of Hurp mRNA was expressed in the testis, spleen, and thymus. Lower expression of Hurp mRNA was detected in the colon, ovary, and small intestine (supplemental Fig. S1A). To study the relationship between Hurp expression and cell proliferation in an in vivo context, we examine the temporal expression pattern of Hurp in the embryonic and postnatal tissues and used the different developmental stages of livers as the example. In the fetal liver, a high expression level of Hurp mRNA was sustained until embryonic day 15.5. The signal declined gradually thereafter in the embryonic liver and in the postnatal newborn until expression was barely detectable in the adult liver (supplemental Fig. S1B). Interestingly, the temporal expression pattern of Hurp coincided with the expression of the proliferation marker Pena (supplemental Fig. S1B), implying that Hurp expression correlates with the ongoing cell proliferation of hepatocytes in mouse liver. Although most hepatocytes are arrested at the quiescent stage in the adult liver, quiescent hepatocytes are able to re-enter the cell cycle during liver regeneration, which is inducible by partial hepatectomy (15Greene A.K. Puder M. J. Investig. Surg. 2003; 16: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Fausto N. Campbell J.S. Riehle K.J. Hepatology. 2006; 43: S45-S53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Our data indeed demonstrate that the expression of Hurp mRNA and protein can be transiently induced at 2 days post-hepatectomy, which coincides with the G2/M phase during hepatocyte cell cycle progression, and then the level rapidly decreases to the basal level after 3 days post-hepatectomy (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). Normal Development without Overt Phenotype in Hurp–/– Mice—To study the role of Hurp involved in development under physiological conditions, we generated Hurp knock-out mice using gene targeting technology in embryonic stem cells (supplemental Fig. S2A). Southern blot and Northern blot analyses demonstrated that the Hurp gene was disrupted with undetectable mRNA expression in the homozygous knock-out (Hurp–/–) mice (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). Hurp–/– mice, derived from a Hurp+/– heterozygous cross, were born at the expected Mendelian ratio (supplemental Table 1). Both male and female Hurp–/– mice are phenotypically normal, with no observable changes in morphology, growth curve, and behavior. Previous studies have identified HURP as a component of the mitotic apparatus involved in spindle formation and chromosome congression using different approaches, including proteomics study of HeLa cells (4Silljé H.H. Nagel S. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 731-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), biochemical fractionation of microtubule-associated proteins from Xenopus eggs (5Koffa M.D. Casanova C.M. Santarella R. Köcher T. Wilm M. Mattaj I.W. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 743-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and functional genomic screen of mitotic regulators in human tumor cells (6Wong J. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, our gene knock-out experiment revealed that HURP is dispensable in normal mouse development from the embryonic stage to adulthood. This could be due to redundancy whereby another yet-to-be identified gene product compensates for the loss of HURP in the knock-out mice. Hurp Deficiency Leads to Female Infertility in Mice—To detect possible reproductive phenotypes, we performed a 6-month breeding study of Hurp–/– males and females mated with fertile Hurp+/– females and males, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the Hurp–/– females were completely infertile, with no pups at all being born over the 6 months of the breeding period, whereas the Hurp–/– males were fertile, showing no significant difference compared with the fertile Hurp+/– males (supplemental Table 1). To explore the underlying cause of this female infertility and to delineate whether HURP plays a critical role in female reproduction including ovarian and uterine functions, we first analyzed the early pregnancy events. The pre-implantation blastocysts recovered from the wild-type and Hurp–/– females mated with wild-type fertile males were examined. We found that the number of morphologically normal blastocysts recovered from the Hurp–/– females was comparable with that of wild-type females when examined on day 4 of pregnancy (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table 2); this indicated that ovulation, fertilization, and the preimplantation development of blastocysts were all normal in the Hurp–/– female. In addition, hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue sections revealed a normal histology of Hurp–/– ovary, which contained different stages of oocytes and corpus luteum similar to those in the normal female mice (supplemental Fig. S3). Together, these results indicate that the complete infertility observed in Hurp–/– females was not due to disruption of ovarian function or an absence of fertilization, but was due to either defective implantation and/or pregnancy failure following implantation. In mice, blastocyst attachment to the uterine luminal epithelium initiates the implantation process and is accompanied by increased endometrial vascular permeability at the implantation sites, which can be visualized by the Chicago Blue B method (14Tranguch S. Cheung-Flynn J. Daikoku T. Prapapanich V. Cox M.B. Xie H. Wang H. Das S.K. Smith D.F. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Using this staining method, we found that, although wild-type females (n = nine mice) had an expected number of implantation sites when examined on day 6 of pregnancy, the uteri of Hurp–/– females (n = 12 mice) showed no sign of implantation (Fig. 1B). This result clearly indicates that the Hurp–/– uterus is defective with respect to blastocyst implantation and implies an essential role for the HURP protein specifically in uterine receptivity. Hurp Expression in the Endometrial Stroma Coincides with the Implantation Stage and Can Be Induced by Estrogen Treatment—The crucial role of HURP in implantation was reinforced by studying the expression pattern of HURP in the pregnant uteri of normal mice. This expression pattern coincides with an increased stromal cell proliferation on days 4 and 5 of pregnancy (described below in Fig. 2), and this also coincides with the pre- to peri-implantation stages initiated by blastocyst attachment to the uterine luminal epithelium. In addition, IHC staining of HURP protein using a rabbit polyclonal antibody revealed the presence of strong expression of HURP in the stromal cells of the uterine endometrium (Fig. 1C). To study the temporal expression of Hurp mRNA, we performed realtime reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analyses using total RNA isolated from non-pregnant and pregnant uteri of wild-type mice at various stages of pregnancy. Our results showed that Hurp mRNA was induced on day 4 of pregnancy, and peak induction of Hurp mRNA expression was detected on day 5 of pregnancy; it decreased thereafter to a basal level during the late pregnant stage (Fig. 1D). The specificity of the antibodies against mouse HURP protein was confirmed by Western blotting using cellular extracts of regenerating livers (supplemental Fig. S1D). Moreover, our IHC staining of the uterine sections demonstrated the absence of HURP protein in the Hurp–/– uteri (Fig. 1C). To elucidate whether HURP can be induced by ovarian steroids such as E2, which is a mitogen for the uterine endometrium during implantation, we performed ovariectomy and E2 treatment experiments on wild-type adult mice. Uterine tissues were obtained from the ovariectomized mice that had received intraperitoneal injections of E2 or oil (vehicle) for 2, 24, and 72 h. We found that at 24 and 72 h following the injection of E2 into these mice, both protein and mRNA expression of Hurp was significantly induced in the endometrial stroma as detected by IHC staining and real-time RT-PCR, respectively (Fig. 1, E and F). Quantification revealed that there were 4- and 3-fold increases in the Hurp mRNA levels at 24 and 72 h after E2 treatment, respectively (Fig. 1F). This suggests that Hurp is an E2-responsive gene, the induction of which is regulated by the E2 signaling pathway in the stromal cells. Alternatively, this induction could be due to the mitogenic action of E2 on stromal proliferation, with up-regulation of Hurp expression being a consequence of cell cycle progression. Defective Decidualization of the Hurp–/– Uterus during Implantation—Decidualization is a process of stromal transformation that is characterized by endometrial stromal proliferation and differentiation to form morphologically and functionally distinct cells. This process is critical for the establishment of successful pregnancy (10Dey S.K. Lim H. Das S.K. Reese J. Paria B.C. Daikoku T. Wang H. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). To determine whether the infertility of Hurp–/– females is caused by impaired decidualization of the uterine stroma, we performed artificial induction of the decidual reaction (17Lee K.Y. Jeong J.W. Wang J. Ma L. Martin J.F. Tsai S.Y. Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5468-5478Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Ovariectomized wild-type and Hurp–/– females were first treated with E2 and P4. A decidualization reaction was then induced in one of the two uterine horns by an intraluminal infusion of oil, and the other horn was left unstimulated as a control. Uterine weight and gross morphology of the stimulated and control uterine horns were examined on day 5 after oil infusion. As shown in Fig. 2A, a robust reaction of decidualization was observed in the wild-type female. In contrast, the Hurp–/– uteri failed to show any significant induction of decidualization upon identical stimulation. The decidual reaction was quantified by measuring the ratio of the weight of the stimulated uterine horn to the control horn. Our results clearly indicate that the stimulated horn of the Hurp–/– uteri failed to increase in size compared with wild-type uteri (Fig. 2, A and B). To elucidate the decidualization defect in the Hurp–/– females, we studied the differential expression of genes crucial for the pre-implantation and post-implantation stages (10Dey S.K. Lim H. Das S.K. Reese J. Paria B.C. Daikoku T. Wang H. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 18Hewitt S.C. Deroo B.J. Hansen K. Collins J. Grissom S. Afshari C.A. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2070-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Total RNA samples isolated from the stimulated uterine horns of wild-type and Hurp–/– females were subjected to RT-PCR analysis. This RT-PCR experiment revealed that gene expression related to the pre-implantation stage of uterine function, such as the Egfr gene, showed no obvious differences. However, for the Hurp–/– uteri, there was a significant decrease in gene expression crucial to the peri- and post-implantation stages, such as the Ptgs2 gene (Fig. 2C). To further investigate the defective gene induction during decidualization, we performed an Affymetrix microarray analysis. Three independent microarray experiments were carried out using three RNA samples isolated from three individual mice of each group to obtain reproducible data. This analysis revealed significant differences between the wild-type and Hurp–/– uteri. In terms of cell cycle-associated gene expression, in the Hurp–/– uteri, a dramatic decrease in various G2/M markers such as Ccnb1 (cyclin B1) and Ccnb2 (cyclin B2) was noted, but this did not occur with G1 and S phase markers (supplemental Fig. S4A). This suggests cell cycle progress through the G1 and S phases but the presence of an impairment at the G2/M phase. In addition, gene products important to implantation and decidualization, such as the prostaglandin biosynthesis enzymes (19Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 20Matsumoto H. Ma W.G. Daikoku T. Zhao X. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. J. Biol.

Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 22Bao L. Tessier C. Prigent-Tessier A. Li F. Buzzio O.L. Callegari E.A. Horseman N.D. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2326-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were significantly decreased or absent in the Hurp–/– uteri (supplemental Fig. S4, B and C). Together, the results of the artificial decidualization experiments indicate that Hurp–/– females are unable to form implantation sites due to an inability to undergo the decidual reaction, and the later is likely to be due to a defect associated with cell proliferation, which leads to blockage of the further differentiation and development of the endometrium that supports embryo implantation. Impaired Stromal Proliferation Leads to Failure of the Decidual Reaction in the Hurp–/– Uteri—Because Hurp was originally identified as a cell cycle-regulated gene, the expression of which is up-regulated during the G2/M phase, we speculated that endometrial stromal proliferation may be affected in the Hurp–/– uteri and that this leads to a failure of the decidualization. To further illustrate the defect in stromal proliferation, we monitored the S and M phase cells by BrdUrd incorporation into the replicating DNA and IHC staining of pH3, respectively, using uterine samples prepared from wild-type and Hurp–/– females naturally mated with wild-type males. On day 4 of pregnancy, there was a comparably high percentage of S phase cells detected in the stromata of the Hurp–/– and wild-type uteri; only a few M phase cells were present in these uterine samples (Fig. 2, D–G). On day 5 of pregnancy, an elevated percentage of M phase cells was detected in the wild-type stroma. However, there was a significantly decreased percentage or near absence of M phase stromal cells detected in the Hurp–/– uteri (Fig. 2, D–G), which indicates that there was an impairment of cell cycle progression and that this would seem to caused by a block before the mitotic stage. This blockage further impaired cell progression into the next cell cycle as illustrated by the decreased S phase cells in the Hurp–/– stroma compared with the wild-type control on day 5 of pregnancy (Fig. 2, E and G). Thus, the Hurp deficiency causes a pre-mitotic block leading to impaired cell cycle progression of the endometrial stroma in the pregnant uteri. Previous cell culture studies revealed that HURP depletion leads to chromosome misalignment at the metaphase plate (4Silljé H.H. Nagel S. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 731-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 5Koffa M.D. Casanova C.M. Santarella R. Köcher T. Wilm M. Mattaj I.W. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 743-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 6Wong J. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In our mouse study, we have never seen stromal cells with visible condensed chromosomes in the uterine samples of Hurp knock-out mice; this may be attributable to cell cycle arrest at the pre-mitotic phase. However, we did find that HURP protein co-localized with condensed chromosomes in the wild-type uterine samples (supplemental Fig. S5). This observation is consistent with the role of HURP being involved in stabilizing and targeting K-fibers to the kinetochore of chromosomes (8Sanderson H.S. Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: R466-R468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Wilde A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 829-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To further determine whether the mitotic spindle checkpoint is activated in the Hurp–/– stroma rendering the cell cycle arrest, we examined the expression levels of Mad2 and BubR1, which are key components of the mitotic checkpoint complex (23Yu H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Chen R.H. J. Biomed. Sci. 2007; 14: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As expected, significantly higher levels of Mad2 and BubR1 were detected in the Hurp–/– uteri compared with wild-type controls; this was revealed as 2.1- and 2.2-fold increases in the mRNA levels of Mad2 and BubR1, respectively, on day 5 of pregnancy (Fig. 2H). These results indicate that, in the absence of HURP, checkpoint signaling is activated possibly because of lack of a functional mitotic apparatus in the stromal cells and that this causes an arrest of cell cycle progression; this activation of the mitotic checkpoint phenomenon is similar to that observed previously in HURP-depleted HeLa cells (6Wong J. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that Hurp deficiency in mice leads to female infertility caused by impaired cell cycle progression of the endometrial stroma, which is arrested at the premitotic phase. The lack of completion of stromal cell proliferation at an early stage of decidualization thus abrogates the latter events of stromal differentiation that follow the proliferation. This knock-out mouse model thus provides a useful system that allows the study of the in vivo effects of HURP on uterine physiology and the genetic pathways of HURP-mediated regulation of endometrial proliferation. This could be relevant to humans. We anticipate that a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate uterine receptivity and implantation is of clinical relevance to the improvement of infertility-related medical treatments and may lead to the development of a novel contraceptive method.

Here we describe a new member of the FGF-BP family, human BP3. We show that the hBP3 protein is secreted from cells, binds to FGF2 in vitro and in intact cells, and inhibits FGF2 binding to heparin. To determine the function of hBP3 in vivo, hBP3 was transiently expressed in chicken embryos and resulted in >50% lethality within 24 h because of vascular leakage. The onset of vascular permeability was monitored by recording the extravasation kinetics of FITC-labeled 40-kDa dextran microperfused into the vitelline vein of 3-day-old embryos. Vascular permeability increased as early as 8 h after expression of hBP3. The increased vascular permeability caused by hBP3 was prevented by treatment of embryos with PD173074, a selective FGFR kinase inhibitor. Interestingly, a C-terminal 66-amino acid fragment (C66) of hBP3, which contains the predicted FGF binding domain, still inhibited binding of FGF2 to heparin similar to full-length hBP3. However, expression of the C66 fragment did not increase vascular permeability on its own, but required the administration of exogenous FGF2 protein. We conclude that the FGF binding domain and the heparin binding domain are necessary for the hBP3 interaction with endogenous FGF and the activation of FGFR signaling in vivo.

Most recently, an analysis of somatic mutations in a large series of human cancer samples found that the FGF pathway had the highest enrichment for mutated kinases and concluded that this pathway is one of the “driver” pathways of cancer progression (7Greenman C.

Nature. 2007; 446: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar), further supporting the significance of FGFs. FGF1 and FGF2 (aka acidic and basic FGF) are the best-studied members of this family. Both are tightly bound to extracellular matrix (ECM) heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). For example, FGF2 is a quite abundant protein in numerous adult tissues, from which it can be extracted as a biologically active growth factor (8Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct endogenous mechanisms have been described by which locally stored FGFs can be delivered from their HSPG storage to their receptors: one mechanism involves digestion of the sugar backbone of HSPGs by heparinases or other glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes (9Bashkin P.

Another mechanism involves the binding of the extracellularly immobilized FGFs to secreted FGF-binding proteins (FGF-BP or BP) that serve as chaperones for FGFs. Wu et al. (11Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H.

Work from different laboratories has shown that BP1 interacts with FGF1, -2, -7, -10, and –22 (12Tassi E. Al-Attar A. Aigner A. Swift M.R. McDonnell K. Karavanov A. Wellstein A. J. Biol.

Interestingly, BP1 can supplement some of the functions of HSPGs in that it can restore FGF signaling in cells that have been depleted of their HSPGs (26Ray P.E. Tassi E. Liu X.H. Wellstein A. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2006; 290: R105-R113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). At a functional level, addition of recombinant human BP1 protein induced angiogenesis in a chorioallantoic membrane assay (12Tassi E. Al-Attar A. Aigner A. Swift M.R. McDonnell K. Karavanov A.

Also, expression of human BP1 in chicken embryos resulted in dose-dependent vascular leakage, hemorrhage, and embryonic lethality (28McDonnell K. Bowden E.T. Cabal-Manzano R. Hoxter B. Riegel A.T.

Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1747-1757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In support of the role of BP1 as an angiogenic modulator, depletion of endogenous BP1 from human squamous cell carcinoma and colon carcinoma cell lines inhibited the growth and angiogenesis of xenograft tumors in mice (30Rak J.

Commensurate with a potential role in tumor growth and angiogenesis, BP1 was found up-regulated dramatically during early stages of malignant transformation of skin, colorectal, and pancreatic epithelia and up-regulation was maintained through development into invasive carcinoma of the skin, colon, and pancreas (32Kurtz A.

Wellstein, unpublished data. 3A. Wellstein, unpublished data. In the present study, we describe a third human FGF-binding protein, hBP3, with structural homology to BP1 and a distinct genomic location on chromosome 10. We show that the human BP3 is secreted from cells, binds to FGF2, and inhibits heparin binding of FGF2. To evaluate the in vivo activity of hBP3, we monitored vascular permeability by recording the extravascular appearance of FITC-labeled dextran microperfused into chicken embryo vessels. We found a significant increase in vascular permeability within 8 h of expressing hBP3 in chicken embryos. This vascular leakiness is prevented by pretreatment of embryos with a specific inhibitor of FGFR, PD173074 (38Skaper S.D. Kee W.J. Facci L. Macdonald G. Doherty P. Walsh F.S. J.

Interestingly, expression of a C-terminal fragment of hBP3, which only contains the predicted FGF binding domain (41Xie B. Tassi E. Swift M.R. McDonnell K. Bowden E.T. Wang S. Ueda Y. Tomita Y. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but lacks the heparin binding domain, was still able to inhibit FGF2 binding to heparin. In contrast to full-length hBP3, this fragment was only able to increase vascular permeability in vivo with exogenous FGF2 protein. This suggests to us that both domains in hBP3 contribute to its mechanism of action and the in vivo function. Cell Lines and Transient Transfections—HEK293T from ATCC were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The transfections were carried out using FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, ∼5 × 105 cells/well were seeded in a 6-well plate and incubated overnight in growth medium. The next day, cells were transfected with FuGENE6-DNA complexes (3:1) for 24–48 h. Ex Ovo Cultivation of Chicken Embryos—Three-day-old fertilized chicken (Gallus gallus) eggs (CBT Farms, Chestertown, MD) were opened, and intact embryos with yolk were placed in 10-cm polystyrene culture dishes (Corning, New York). Embryos were maintained in a humidified water-jacketed incubator at 37 °C. Plasmid Constructs—The human BP3 encoding cDNA was isolated from human neuroblastoma (ATCC). PCR products (forward primer: 5′-ATGACTCCTCCGAAGCTGCG-3′, reverse primer: 5′-GCCGTTCCAGAAATTGACAA-3′) were cloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the in-frame insertion of hBP3 encoding cDNAs was verified by DNA sequencing. To generate the C-terminal 66-amino acid fragment of hBP3, the respective coding sequence was amplified by PCR from the full-length hBP3. (forward primer: 5′-AGTAAGCTTGCACCGCCCAAAGAAAACCCC-3′, reverse primer 5′-GCCGCCTCTAGATCAGCCGTTCCAGAAATTG-3′), and then subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pFLAG-CMV™-3 vector (Sigma). Detection of Proteins by Immunoblot—Immunoblot analyses were performed as previously described (12Tassi E. Al-Attar A. Aigner A. Swift M.R. McDonnell K. Karavanov A. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40247-40253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) using mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen), mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma), mouse anti-FGF2 (Upstate), and mouse anti-actin (Chemicon) antibodies. Immunoprecipitations—Conditioned media were passed through a 0.22-μm filter and centrifuged at 4,500 × g for 5 min in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were washed 2× in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Total cell lysate or media immunoprecipitations were run overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies or antibody-conjugated beads. Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC)—1-ml HiTrap heparin affinity columns (GE Healthcare) were equilibrated with 10 ml of binding buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and then loaded with cell supernatants from transfected HEK293T. Columns were then washed with 10 ml of binding buffer and eluted with 20 ml of a gradient of 0–2 m NaCl elution buffer in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) on an FPLC system (Pharmacia LKB). 1-ml fractions were collected for further analysis. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Proteins present in FPLC fractions containing hBP3 by immunoblot were resolved on a 4–12% NUPAGE gel (Invitrogen), visualized by a brief Coomassie Blue stain, and the protein bands migrating with the immunoreactive hBP3 were manually excised from the gel. The gel slices were washed with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 10 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol at 60 °C for 30 min. The tubes were cooled to room temperature, and 10 μl of 55 mm iodoacetamide were added and incubated further for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The solvent was discarded, and the gel slices were washed in 50% acetonitrile/100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, destained with 50% acetonitrile in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated with acetonitrile for 5 min, and vacuum-dried. Gel pieces were then rehydrated with 15 μl of ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (25 mm:10%) supplemented with trypsin (5 ng/μl; Promega) at 37 °C for 16 h. Afterward, tryptic peptides were extracted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/50% acetonitrile and mixed with equal volume of 5 mg/ml CHCA (Acros Organics). Mass spectra were recorded with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight, time of flight (MALDI-TOF-TOF) spectrometer (4800 Proteomics Analyzer, Framingham, MA) set in reflector positive mode after spotting the samples onto a MALDI plate. Peptide masses were compared with the theoretical masses derived from the sequences contained in SWISS-PROT/NCBI databases using MASCOT. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Protein-protein interaction of hBP3 and FGF2 was determined by solidphase immunoassays using microtiter polyvinyl chloride plates (Maxisorb, Nunc). A sandwich ELISA was carried out by coating the plates with purified hBP3 (100 μl; see Fig. 1B) per well. After blocking with 5% dry milk in PBS/0.05% Tween, FGF2 (100 ng) was added to each well and then detected using a monoclonal FGF2 antibody and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunocytochemistry—For visualization of proteins in in vivo studies, blood vessels were microinjected with 4% formaldehyde. Fixed tissues were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.18% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Fixed cells were stained with primary antibodies for 1 h and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min. Images were taken with a Nikon SMZ-1500 epifluorescence digital stereomicroscope. Microinjection of Embryos—The allantoic sac injection was described previously (28McDonnell K. Bowden E.T. Cabal-Manzano R. Hoxter B. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For injection into vitelline veins and measurement of vascular permeability, 100 μl of the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)/DNA mixture or 1 mg/ml dextran-FITC in PBS or 0.1 μg of PD173074 (Calbiochem) in PBS were microinjected into anterior or posterior vitelline vein of 3-day-old chicken embryos, using a microperfusion system with glass capillaries (Vestavia Scientific, Birmingham, AL). Data Analysis—Prism 5 (Graph-Pad Inc) software was used for graphing and for statistical comparisons across different data sets by Kaplan-Meier, analysis of variance or Student's t test as appropriate. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. In Silico Analysis of hBP3—A BLAST search with human fibroblast growth factor-binding protein 1 (hBP1, accession number NP_005121) showed 23% identity to hBP2 (NP_114156) over 186 amino acids (aa 42–227 of hBP1), and 24% identity to hBP3 (NP_689642) over 173 amino acids (aa 55–227 of hBP1). The alignment of hBP1, 2 and 3 by ClustalW shows that the spacing of 8 cysteine residues is conserved among the three BPs (Fig. 1A), which suggests that they may form similarly patterned disulfide bridges first described in a structural analysis of bovine BP1 protein isolated from prepartum mammary glands (36Lametsch R. Rasmussen J.T. Johnsen L.B. Purup S. Sejrsen K. Petersen T.E. Heegaard C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19469-19474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Also, the BP protein family has been assigned a conserved domain (CD) structure (PFAM06473, FGF-BP1), and hBP3 matched with the requirements of this CD. hBP3 Is Secreted and Binds to Heparin—Hydropathy plot analysis revealed one strongly hydrophobic region at the N terminus of hBP3, and a secretory signal sequence was predicted with a cleavage site between position 26 (A) and 27 (R) using the SignalP 3.0 Server. Indeed, hBP3 was found to migrate at an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa on SDS-PAGE using supernatants of HEK293T cells transfected with an expression vector that contains the hBP3 protein C-terminally tagged with a V5/His tag (Fig. 1, B–D). To assess binding of hBP3 to glycosaminoglycans originally described for BP1 (11Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), conditioned media from transfected HEK293T cells were loaded onto chromatography columns containing immobilized heparin, and hBP3 protein was eluted using a linear NaCl concentration gradient from 0 to 2.0 m (Fig. 1B). The elution peak of V5/His tagged hBP3 was at 0.7–0.9 m NaCl, similar to hBP1 (27Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This elution profile from heparin positions BPs between low affinity heparin binding growth factors such as PDGF (elution around 0.5 m NaCl, Ref. 42Shing Y. Folkman J. Sullivan R. Butterfield C. Murray J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1984; 223: 1296-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) and FGF2, which elutes around 1.5 m NaCl (see Fig. 2C and Refs. 42Shing Y. Folkman J. Sullivan R. Butterfield C. Murray J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1984; 223: 1296-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 43Gospodarowicz D. Cheng J. Lui G.M. Baird A. Böhlen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6963-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry Analysis of hBP3 Protein—To further analyze the hBP3 protein, the peak elution fractions from heparin affinity chromatography of hBP3 (Fig. 1B) were separated on a 4–12% NUPAGE gel and proteins stained with Coomassie Blue. The predominant protein present in this fraction migrated at the same position as immunoreactive hBP3 (Fig. 1D). This protein band was excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1E). 11 peptides, including the four most abundant peptides, were identified as hBP3 by peptide mass fingerprinting and MS/MS sequence analysis. The peptides identified are shown aligned with the corresponding portion of hBP3 (Fig. 1E, bottom panel) and cover 43.8% of the hBP3 protein. No post-translational modifications of the secreted protein were apparent from this analysis. Binding of hBP3 to FGF2—To determine the binding of hBP3 to FGF2, heparin affinity FPLC-purified hBP3 or control media were immobilized on 96-well plates and incubated with FGF2. The bound FGF2 was then detected by ELISA. FGF2 binding was >3-fold higher with hBP3 present (Fig. 2A, p < 0.001) suggesting a direct interaction between hBP3 and FGF2. In addition to this in vitro assay, the interaction of hBP3 with endogenous FGF2 was also examined in intact cells. Analysis of hBP3 immunoprecipitates from conditioned media revealed that FGF2 was associated with hBP3 present in the transfected cell supernatants (Fig. 2B). The hBP3/FGF2 association was also found when HEK293T cell lysates were co-immunoprecipitated for FGF2 and immunoblotted for the V5-tagged hBP3 (not shown). We conclude from this that hBP3 can bind to and mobilize cell-associated FGF2. Interaction of hBP3, FGF2, and Heparin—FGF2 is stored on glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix and this interaction is also reflected in its tight binding to immobilized heparin, a property that was crucial in the initial isolation of FGF2 by heparin affinity chromatography (42Shing Y. Folkman J. Sullivan R. Butterfield C. Murray J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1984; 223: 1296-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 43Gospodarowicz D. Cheng J. Lui G.M. Baird A. Böhlen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6963-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). As described in these earlier reports, recombinant FGF2 protein bound tightly to immobilized heparin and was eluted at >1.5 m NaCl (Fig. 2C, FGF2 only). In contrast, when FGF2 was preincubated with an excess of hBP3, the majority of both FGF2 and hBP3 were found in the flow from the column. A small portion of both proteins eluted at 0.6–0.8 m NaCl (Fig. 2C, FGF2+hBP3). The interaction of hBP3 and FGF2 present in the flow from the heparin affinity chromatography was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation for FGF2 and immunoblotting for V5 (not shown). From these experiments, we conclude that hBP3 binds to FGF2 and that this interaction reduces the binding affinity of either of the proteins for heparin likely due to steric hindrance of their respective heparin binding sites. Expression of hBP3 via Allantoic Sac Injection Decreases the Survival Rate of Chicken Embryos—To examine the functional role of hBP3 in vivo, we transfected chicken embryos with 4 μg of hBP3-V5/His by microinjection into the allantoic sac from which the Lipofectamine-DNA complex is absorbed into the embryo (28McDonnell K. Bowden E.T. Cabal-Manzano R. Hoxter B. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The position of the injection needle is shown in Fig. 3A. Quite strikingly, 60% of hBP3-transfected embryos died within the first 24 h after transfection (Fig. 3B). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant difference between the hBP3 and the control (pcDNA3.1) group over the 5-day observation period (p < 0.0001). Gene Expression in 3-Day-Old Chicken Embryos by Microperfusion of the Vitelline Vein—To explore the mechanism by which hBP3 caused embryonic lethality, we established transient transfection of the embryo vascular system in which the DNA-Lipofectamine complexes are delivered by microperfusion of the anterior or posterior vitelline vein of day 3 chicken embryos. For this, a glass pipette tip (<70 μm in diameter) was inserted into the vitelline vein (80–90 μm in diameter) using a micromanipulator, and 4 μg of DNA were delivered into each embryo. Fig. 4A shows the position of the pipette filled with Trypan Blue for better visibility. When a GFP-expressing plasmid was delivered into the circulation by microperfusion, the expression of GFP was detected in live embryos as early as 8 h after"

Although the effects of N2-Et-dG on DNA polymerases have been well studied, nothing is known about possible effects of this lesion on transcription by RNA polymerases (RNAPs). Using primer extension assays in vitro, we found that a single N2-Et-dG lesion is a strong block to both mammalian RNAPII and two other multisubunit RNAPs, (yeast RNAPII and Escherichia coli RNAP), as well as to T7 RNAP. However, the mechanism of transcription blockage appears to differ between the multisubunit RNAPs and T7 RNAP. Specifically, all three of the multisubunit RNAPs can incorporate a single rNTP residue opposite the lesion, whereas T7 RNAP is essentially unable to do so. Using the mammalian RNAPII, we found that CMP is exclusively incorporated opposite the N2-Et-dG lesion. In addition, we also show that the accessory transcription factor TFIIS does not act as a lesion bypass factor, as it does for other nonbulky DNA lesions; instead, it stimulates the polymerase to remove the CMP incorporated opposite the lesion by mammalian RNAPII. We also include models of the N2-Et-dG within the active site of yeast RNAPII, which are compatible with our observations.

Gomi T. Fujioka M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the most significant source of human exposure to ACD is via the metabolism of ethanol. In the human body, ethanol is first converted to ACD via the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, and ACD is further converted to acetate via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), primarily by the hepatic enzyme ALDH2. Approximately 50% of East Asian individuals are deficient in ALDH2 activity because of an amino acid substitution resulting in an inactive enzyme (4Crabb D.W. Matsumoto M. Chang D. You M. Proc. Nutr.

ALDH2-deficient individuals are at a substantially elevated risk of esophageal cancer when they drink heavily, and other mechanistic evidence indicates that ACD is responsible for the increased cancer risk (2Baan R.

One of the first identified and most well studied ACD-derived lesions is N2-ethyl-2′-deoxyguanosine (N2-Et-dG) (Fig. 1). N2-Et-dG is the stable form of N2-Eti-dG, the immediate product of the ACD reaction with dG. In the presence of basic compounds such as histones and polyamines, ACD can also give rise to other DNA adducts (13Inagaki S. Esaka Y. Goto M. Deyashiki Y. Sako M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Theruvathu J.A. Jaruga P. Nath R.G. Dizdaroglu M. Brooks P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3513-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of these ACD-related DNA adducts, including N2-Et-dG, have been observed in white blood cell DNA in humans following alcohol consumption, with significantly higher levels observed in ALDH2-deficient individuals (15Matsuda T. Yabushita H. Kanaly R.A. Shibutani S. Yokoyama A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological effects of these DNA lesions are of potential clinical relevance. In view of the relationship between alcohol and cancer, the effect of N2-Et-dG on DNA replication and mutagenesis have been well studied. N2-Et-dG is a strong block to DNA polymerase α (16Perrino F.W. Blans P. Harvey S. Gelhaus S.L. McGrath C. Akman S.A. Jenkins G.S. LaCourse W.R. Fishbein J.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) but is efficiently bypassed by the replicative polymerase δ (17Choi J.Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (see also Ref. 18Matsuda T. Terashima I. Matsumoto Y. Yabushita H. Matsui S. Shibutani S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). No published data are available for this lesion with the replicative polymerase ϵ. In addition, cells have specialized DNA polymerases that can bypass N2-Et-dG in an error-free manner (16Perrino F.W. Blans P. Harvey S. Gelhaus S.L. McGrath C. Akman S.A. Jenkins G.S. LaCourse W.R.

Chem. 2006; 281: 12315-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In human cells in vivo, the major genotoxic effects of the lesion appear to be the result of replication blockage, with some capacity for generating mutations including single base deletions and transversions (21Upton D.C. Wang X. Blans P. Perrino F.W. Fishbein J.C. Akman S.A. Mutat. Res. 2006; 599: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast to the effect on DNA polymerases, no studies have been done to examine the effects of this lesion on transcription by RNA polymerases (RNAPs). Therefore, in the present work we investigated the effects of N2-Et-dG on transcription by mammalian RNAPII, as well as two other multisubunit RNAPs, yeast RNAPII and Escherichia coli RNAP. To address the possibility of bypass factors, we also tested the effect of the transcription factor TFIIS, which has been recently shown to stimulate lesion bypass during transcription past the oxidized guanosine lesion 8-oxo-dG (22Charlet-Berguerand N. Feuerhahn S. Kong S.E. Ziserman H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5481-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Kuraoka I. Suzuki K. Ito S. Hayashida M. Kwei J.S. Ikegami T. Handa H. Nakabeppu Y. Tanaka K. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), to allow mammalian RNAPII to bypass N2-Et-dG. As noted above, ALDH2 plays a key role on the metabolism of ACD. Because ALDH2 is localized to the mitochondria (4Crabb D.W. Matsumoto M. Chang D. You M. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2004; 63: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), it follows that ACD formed from ethanol metabolism must be able to enter mitochondria to be a substrate for the enzyme. As a result, it is likely that, especially in ALDH2-deficient individuals, ACD adduction of hepatic mitochondrial DNA could be significant. Therefore, in addition to investigating the effect of N2-Et-dG on transcription by RNAPII, we also examined the effect of the lesion on transcription by T7RNAP, as a model for mitochondrial RNAP. Eukaryotic mitochondrial RNAPs are single subunit polymerases that are highly homologous to T7 and other single subunit phage polymerases, especially in the residues and overall structure of the active site (24Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 89-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We found that a single N2-Et-dG lesion is a strong block to both mammalian and other multisubunit RNAPII, as well as to T7 RNAP. Interestingly, however, all three of the multisubunit RNAPs can incorporate a single rNTP residue opposite the lesion, whereas T7 RNAP is unable to do so. Using the mammalian RNAPII, we found that CMP is exclusively incorporated opposite the N2-Et-dG lesion. We also show that the accessory transcription factor TFIIS does not act as a lesion bypass factor, as it does for other nonbulky DNA lesions; instead, it stimulates the polymerase to remove the CMP incorporated opposite the lesion. Oligonucleotide Synthesis—A phospohoramidite containing N2-Et-dG was synthesized by Glen Research (Sterling, VA). Oligonucleotides containing the lesion were synthesized on an ABI DNA synthesizer using standard chemistry and deprotection and purified by denaturing PAGE. The sequence of the DNA template strand used in the in vitro transcription was: 5′-CATGCTGATGAATTCCTTCNCTACTTTCCTCTCCATTT-3′. The underlined N indicates the position of either deoxyguanosine or the N2-Et-dG. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified RNA primers were obtained from IDT (Coralville, IA). The sequence of the RNA oligonucleotide used for running start transcription was 5′-AGAGGAAAGU-3′, and that for standing start transcription was 5′-AGGAAAGUAG-3′. The sequence of the 30-mer RNA marker was 5′-UAGGUUCCACCUUACCAGCCUUUUACAGAU-3′ RNA Primer Labeling with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 Polynucleotide Kinase—RNA primers were labeled with 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 5′ end by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 15 min. The unincorporated nucleotides were removed by NucAway spin column (Ambion, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins—Mammalian RNAPII (from calf thymus) and yeast RNAPIIs were purified as described (25Hu X. Malik S. Negroiu C.C. Hubbard K. Velalar C.N. Hampton B. Grosu D. Catalano J. Roeder R.G. Gnatt A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9506-9511Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Full-length N-terminal histidine-tagged human TFIIS was expressed in the bacterial expression vector pET21 in BL-21 cells (Invitrogen). TFIIS was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as per company recommendations (Qiagen), followed by a final column employing MonoS (Bio-Rad) (supplemental Fig. S1). E. coli RNAP and T7 RNAP were purchased from Epicenter (Madison, WI). In Vitro Transcription—The methodology for analyzing the effects of DNA lesions on transcription was based on the direct assembly of transcription elongation complexes introduced by Kashlev and co-workers (26Komissarova N. Kireeva M.L. Becker J. Sidorenkov I. Kashlev M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNA template was used at 2 μm, and mixed with the RNA primer (2 μm) in the reaction buffer specific for each polymerase. The amount of RNA primer used assumed complete recovery after the spin column purification step. Mammalian RNAPII buffer was: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2 and 40 mm (NH4)2SO4. The same buffer was also used for yeast RNAPII. E. coli RNAP reaction buffer was 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 40 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. T7 RNAP reaction buffer was 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. To set up the reactions, 1 μl of RNA primer (2 pmol) was annealed to the template in a volume of 8 μl by first heating the mixture to 45 °C for 5 min and then cooled to room temperature (approximately 24 °C) 2 °C every 2 min (26Komissarova N. Kireeva M.L. Becker J. Sidorenkov I. Kashlev M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Then 1 μl of a 1.13 μm solution of mammalian RNAPII or yeast RNAPII was added to the reaction and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. These conditions give a nominal molar ratio of primer:template to polymerase of ≈2. For the prokaryotic enzymes, the reactions contained 10 units (1 μl) of E. coli RNAP or 50 units (1 μl) of T7 RNAP. In vitro transcription was started by adding the indicated ribonucleotide(s) (final concentration, 100 μm) and stopped by removing samples and mixing with 2× formamide gel loading dye (95% (v/v) formamide, 025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at the specific time points. The transcription products were separated on 20% acrylamide, 7 m urea gels and detected by autoradiography. Quantitative Analysis of Apparent Km Values—The apparent Km is the concentration of NTP at which the rate of incorporation opposite dG or N2-Et-dG is half-maximal during a fixed reaction time (27Wang D. Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Kaplan C.D. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 941-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To determine the apparent Km values for CTP incorporation opposite dG or N2-Et-dG, standing start experiments were performed with varying concentrations of CTP as shown in Fig. 3, with incubation for 20 min at 25 °C. The resulting gels were dried, and the results were quantified using a Typhoon Imager (Molecular Dynamics), with subtraction of the background values at time 0 (27Wang D. Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Kaplan C.D. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 941-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Apparent Km values were obtained by nonlinear curve fitting using GraphPad Prism. The values given are the means ± S.E., based on two independent determinations. N2-Et-dG Is a Strong Block to Transcription Elongation by Mammalian RNAPII—To study the effects of N2-Et-dG on transcription, we utilized a primer extension assay, in which an RNA primer is first annealed to a lesion-containing or control (lesion-free) oligonucleotide DNA template. RNAP is then added, and transcription is initiated by the addition of rNTPs. This strategy is adapted from the methodology of Kashlev and co-workers (26Komissarova N. Kireeva M.L. Becker J. Sidorenkov I. Kashlev M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and is analogous to the methodology used to study the effects of DNA lesions on DNA polymerases (16Perrino F.W. Blans P. Harvey S. Gelhaus S.L. McGrath C. Akman S.A. Jenkins G.S. LaCourse W.R. Fishbein J.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Choi J.Y. Angel K.C.

Chem. 2006; 281: 12315-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). During transcription by RNAPs under these conditions, the nontemplate DNA strand is not required for transcription (26Komissarova N. Kireeva M.L. Becker J. Sidorenkov I. Kashlev M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Kashkina E. Anikin M. Brueckner F. Pomerantz R.T. McAllister W.T. Cramer P. Temiakov D. Mol.

Cell. 2006; 24: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the absence of the nontemplate strand does not affect the stability of eukaryotic RNAPII transcription elongation complexes (31Kireeva M.L. Komissarova N. Waugh D.S. Kashlev M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6530-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In our initial experiments, we used a “running start” set-up in which a 10-mer primer was annealed to a 38-mer DNA template two nucleotides 3′ to the lesion (Fig. 2a). As shown in Fig. 2b, the N2-Et-dG lesion poses as a strong blockage for transcription by calf RNAPII. Over time, a slow incorporation of nucleotides opposite the lesion base is observed. We repeated these experiments using two other purified multisubunit RNAPs. As shown in Fig. 2c, similar to the results using mammalian RNAPII, both yeast RNAPII and E. coli RNAP were also able to incorporate a single nucleotide opposite the N2-Et-dG lesion before stalling. Also, in contrast to mammalian RNAPII, with these enzymes, a minimal amount of bypass product was observable. Inspection of the results shown in Fig. 2c indicated that the three polymerases differ in their ability to incorporate a nucleotide opposite the lesion. These differences are illustrated by comparing the relative amount of the 13-mer band (which represents nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion) to the 12-mer, which represents transcription up to the site of the lesion. Because the 12-mer band is by definition the result of active polymerization, the relative amount of the 13-mer band to the 12-mer band is a measure of the fraction of active polymerases that were able to incorporate nucleotide opposite the lesion. From the results shown in Fig. 2 as well as other analyses (not shown) the 13-mer/12-mer ratio at the 40-min time point for the yeast polymerase is 2.7-4.5, compared with 0.34-0.83 for the calf polymerase and 0.6-0.85 for the E. coli polymerase. On the basis of these differences, as well as the faster time course of nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion for the E. coli polymerase compared with the calf (Fig. 2), our results indicate that the ability to incorporate nucleotide opposite the N2-Et-dG lesion is highest for yeast RNAPII, followed by the E. coli RNAP and then the calf RNAPII. It should be noted that using the 13-mer/12-mer ratio as a basis for comparison normalizes for any variation in amount of transcription in different samples. Such variation, which is seen in Figs. 2 and 5, may be due to differences in the number of active polymerase molecules in a given enzyme preparation and/or to the efficiency of formation of the primer-template-enzyme complexes. Together, our results show that under running start conditions, the N2-Et-dG lesion is a very strong block to transcription elongation by mammalian RNAP II, as well as yeast RNAPII and E. coli RNAP. All three multisubunit polymerases are able to incorporate nucleotide opposite the lesion, prior to stalling, although the ability to incorporate nucleotide opposite the lesion varies between the three enzymes. Mammalian RNAP II Incorporates CMP Opposite N2-Et-dG during Transcription—We next carried out a standing start RNA extension study using mammalian RNAPII with template containing either dG or N2-Et-dG as the first template base to be transcribed. Fig. 3b shows that under standing start conditions, mammalian RNAPII was also able to slowly incorporate a single nucleotide opposite the lesion before stalling, consistent with the running start results. In Fig. 3b, we note that a limited degree of read-through product beyond the lesion site is clearly observable, in contrast to the results with the running start set-up (Fig. 2b). Because the template is identical in both cases, but the primer is annealed to different locations in the running start versus the standing start experiments, the difference between the two is most likely due in part to different initial RNAPII/nucleic acid structures. Such an interpretation is fully compatible with previous findings (32Gnatt A. Fu J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30799-30805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The difference may also reflect differences in the number of possible configurations that the ethyl group can assume in the running versus standing start modes, an issue we will return to under “Discussion.” The important point here is that the results from the running and standing start experiments are in agreement in that in both conditions, the polymerase is able to slowly incorporate 1 nucleotide opposite the lesion. To determine which nucleotide was incorporated opposite the N2-Et-dG lesion, the standing start RNA extension study was conducted as in Fig. 3b, but with each of the four ribonucleotides added separately at a concentration of 100 μm. As expected, under these conditions, mammalian RNAPII prefers to incorporate CMP opposite the unmodified template dG (Fig. 3c). With N2-Et-dG lesion as the template, only cytosine incorporation was observed, although clearly more slowly than with a template dG (Fig. 3d). These results suggest that Watson-Crick base pairing specificity was still preserved during nucleotide incorporation opposite N2-Et-dG. To quantify the magnitude of the effect of the lesion on nucleotide incorporation, we determined the concentration of NTP at which the rate of incorporation opposite dG or N2-Et-dG is half-maximal during a fixed reaction time (27Wang D. Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Kaplan C.D. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 941-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This value, the apparent Km, has been used by other workers to compare the relative rates of nucleotide incorporation by RNAPs under various experimental conditions (27Wang D. Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Kaplan C.D. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 941-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 33Svetlov V. Vassylyev D.G. Artsimovitch I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38087-38090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Representative data from these initial experiments, which used a wide range of CTP concentrations, are shown in Fig. 3d. Based on these analyses, the apparent Km for CTP incorporation opposite template dG was in the low nanomolar range, in good agreement with the apparent Km values obtained by Kornberg and co-workers (27Wang D. Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Kaplan C.D. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 941-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) for yeast RNAPII using a similar analysis. In contrast, with the N2-Et-dG template, the apparent Km for CTP incorporation was in the low micromolar range. To increase the accuracy of our apparent Km determinations, we carried out additional experiments using a smaller range of CTP concentrations around the apparent Km values predicted for the dG and N2-Et-dG templates based on the initial analysis. As shown in Fig. 3e, these experiments gave an apparent Km for CTP incorporation opposite template dG of 3.95 nm, compared with 5.76 μm for the N2-Et-dG template, indicating that the N2-Et-dG reduces CTP incorporation by ≈1500-fold. TFIIS Does Not Stimulate Transcription Past the N2-Et-dG Lesion—The general transcription elongation factor TFIIS is known for its role in stimulating the arrested RNAPII to cleave the nascent mRNA during transcription (34Fish R.N. Kane C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 287-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 35Wind M. Reines D. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This generates a new 3′ end that allows transcription to resume. On helix-distorting DNA lesions such as a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, the addition of TFIIS stimulates the polymerase stalled at the lesion to backtrack (36Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 37Tornaletti S. Mutat. Res. 2005; 577: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, other data indicate that TFIIS can act as a bypass factor by stimulating transcription past nonbulky DNA lesions such as 8-oxo-dG (22Charlet-Berguerand N. Feuerhahn S. Kong S.E. Ziserman H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5481-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Kuraoka I. Suzuki K. Ito S. Hayashida M. Kwei J.S. Ikegami T. Handa H. Nakabeppu Y. Tanaka K. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To investigate whether TFIIS can affect the ability of mammalian RNAPII to bypass N2-Et-dG, we first carried out a running start experiment similar to that described above (Fig. 2), including increasing amounts of TFIIS (Fig. 4a). This condition is most analogous to the in vivo situation, in which transcription takes place in the presence of rNTPs and TFIIS is present. When the template with N2-Et-dG lesion was transcribed in the absence of TFIIS, mammalian RNAPII alone was able to incorporate some nucleotide opposite the lesion, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2b. However, with increasing TFIIS concentrations, the band corresponding to nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion was reduced and completely abolished at high TFIIS concentrations. Importantly, TFIIS alone in the absence of RNAPII did not produce any transcript cleavage (Fig. 4a, IIS lanes). The effect of TFIIS observed in Fig. 4a could be due to either TFIIS preventing incorporation of nucleotide opposite the lesion or the stimulation of transcript cleavage following nucleotide incorporation. To address this issue, we carried out another experiment using an RNA primer with a cytosine opposite the N2-Et-dG or dG and incubation in the presence of rNTPs. As shown in Fig. 4b, in the absence of TFIIS, small amounts of extension products are visible with the N2-Et-dG template. However, with increasing TFIIS concentrations, the amount of extension is reduced, with the concomitant appearance of a product 1 nucleotide shorter than the original primer (Fig. 4b). This result indicates that even in the presence of rNTPs, TFIIS stimulates the removal of CMP incorporated opposite the lesion. To determine the extent of TFIIS-stimulated transcript cleavage, we repeated the experiment shown in Fig. 4b in the absence of rNTPs (Fig. 4c). Under these conditions, we observed the appearance of an additional TFIIS-dependent band 2 nucleotides shorter than the starting RNA primer, with both the control and lesion-containing templates. This observation is consistent with others showing that TFIIS stimulated cleavage of transcription complexes stalled because of the absence of rNTPs occurs in dinucleotide increments (38Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that TFIIS does not act as a bypass factor for transcription past N2-Et-dG by mammalian RNAPII. Rather, the TFIIS-induced cleavage activity reduced the steady-state level of nucleoside incorporation opposite the lesion. The N2-Et-dG Lesion Blocks Nucleotide Incorporation by T7 RNAP—As mentioned earlier, the mitochondrial localization of ALDH2 indicates that ACD can enter the mitochondrion and therefore might adduct mitochondrial DNA, especially in ALDH2-deficient individuals. To evaluate the blockage effect of the lesion on mitochondrial DNA transcription, we used T7 RNAP as a model enzyme, based on its homology to mitochondrial RNAP. The T7 reactions were conducted in a similar fashion as reactions employing the multisubunit RNAPs. Under running start conditions, transcription of the N2-Et-dG template by T7 RNAP results in a 12-mer. However, in contrast to the results using multisubunit RNAPs (Fig. 2), no 13-mer product resulting from nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion is detectable under these conditions (Fig. 5a). Consistent with this result, we were also unable to detect nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion in the standing start set-up (Fig. 5b), although with very long film exposures, some bypass transcripts can be detected (data not shown). We provide herein data that show that the ACD-derived DNA lesion N2-Et-dG is a strong block to both multisubunit and single-subunit RNAPs. Mammalian RNAPII, as well two other multisubunit RNAPs, are able to slowly incorporate a nucleoside opposite the N2"

Turley S. Adman E.T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5246-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cytochromes cd1 belong to a second group of nitrite reductase (1Allen J.W.A.

Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 97-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). These are heme-containing enzymes with one c heme and one d1 heme per monomer. The c heme is the site of electron donation from external electron donor proteins; for the enzyme from P. pantotrophus, these have been shown to be pseudoazurin and cytochrome c550 (4Pearson I.V. Page M.D. van Spanning R.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6308-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The d1 heme forms the active site of the enzyme. The 1.55-Å crystal structure of oxidized cytochrome cd1 from P. pantotrophus reveals that in its oxidized as-isolated state, the c heme is axially ligated by histidines 69 and 17, and the d1 heme binds histidine 200 and tyrosine 25 (5Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The c heme is located in a predominantly α-helical domain of the enzyme, whereas the d1 heme resides in a β-propeller structure. The tyrosine ligand to the d1 heme is part of the N-terminal c heme domain and is connected to the c heme distal ligand, His-17, by a short polypeptide loop of just 8 amino acids. Upon reduction of the enzyme, His-17 is replaced by Met-106, and Tyr-25 dissociates leaving the active site pentacoordinate and able to bind substrate (5Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).Our previous study of nitrite reduction by P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 described the use of stopped flow methodology to study the kinetics of nitrite reduction by P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 (6Sam K.A.

At the earliest time point (2–3 ms) using a conventional stopped flow apparatus, at pH 6.0, a significant proportion of the enzyme had already undergone one turnover. At this time point three separate species were assigned at the d1 heme, Fe(II)-NO, Fe(II)-NO+, and ferrous d1 heme, with neither substrate nor NO bound (6Sam K.A. Tolland J.D. Fairhurst S.A.

The latter, it was postulated, was an intermediate of the enzyme that had released product generated in the first turnover. The findings of this conventional stopped flow study indicated that a faster technique was required to observe intermediates of the first turnover.A rapid freezing technique known as microsecond freeze-hyperquenching (MHQ) 2The abbreviations used are: MHQ, microsecond freeze-hyperquenching; FTIR, Fourier-transform infrared. 2The abbreviations used are: MHQ, microsecond freeze-hyperquenching; FTIR, Fourier-transform infrared. has been developed in the de Vries laboratory (7Cherepanov A.V.

This technique allows mixing and freezing of enzyme and substrate on a microsecond time scale, with an effective dead time of 75 μs (8Wiertz F.G. Richter O.M. Ludwig B. de Vries S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31580-31591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and thus enables previously undetectable intermediates to be observed. We report a completely novel species observed at the d1 heme just 130 μs after mixing of the fully reduced enzyme with nitrite in the absence of excess reductant. The formation of other early intermediates was also observed within the first 800 μs of the reaction, and novel insight into their involvement in the catalytic cycle is presented; these intermediates provide evidence that the long standing assumption that the two monomers are independent needs reappraisal.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction of Cytochrome cd1—P. pantotrophus was grown under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C. Cytochrome cd1 was purified from the periplasm of the cells according to the method of Moir et al. (9Moir J.W.B. Baratta D. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) as modified by Koppenhöfer et al. (10Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzyme was determined by the Rz value (A406/A280), and all cytochrome cd1 used in this work had an Rz of >1.25. The concentration of the enzyme was determined at 406 nm for the oxidized enzyme and 418 nm for the reduced, with the respective extinction coefficients of 142.5 mm–1 (11Kobayashi K. Koppenhöfer A. Ferguson S.J. Tagawa S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and 161.5 mm–1 (10Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These extinction coefficients refer to the concentration of the enzyme monomer. Throughout this work the monomeric concentration will be reported.Anaerobic Preparation of the Enzyme for Rapid Kinetic Experiments—The purified enzyme was transferred to an anaerobic glove box (Coy Laboratory Products Inc.) that was maintained at less than 2 ppm O2. Cytochrome cd1 was reduced with a small excess of sodium dithionite and then passed down a desalting column packed with P6-DG resin (Bio-Rad) and equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate of the desired pH. All buffers were sparged overnight in the anaerobic glove box to remove oxygen. The enzyme was loaded into a gas-tight syringe that had been presoaked in sodium dithionite and washed to remove traces of excess reductant. The absence of excess dithionite was confirmed by testing buffer expelled from the syringe with methyl viologen, which turns blue on contact with dithionite. 10 mm potassium nitrite was made up in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer of the desired pH and loaded into a second gas-tight syringe that had undergone the same process as the enzyme-containing syringe to remove traces of oxygen. This was important because cytochrome cd1 also functions as an oxidase (10Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).MHQ—MHQ measurements were performed as described previously (7Cherepanov A.V. De Vries S. Biochim. Biophys.

Optical measurements were performed on an SLM-Aminco DW2000 scanning spectrophotometer, which was adapted for low temperature measurements of spectra of the frozen powders obtained from the MHQ experiments; the entire MHQ design and set up of the spectrophotometer are described in Ref. 7Cherepanov A.V.

Because cytochrome cd1 also functions as an oxidase (10Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), great care was taken to ensure the equipment was sufficiently anaerobic to prevent re-oxidation of the enzyme, from which excess reductant had been removed, before mixing. To test that this requirement had been met, the enzyme was mixed with anaerobic phosphate buffer in the absence of excess reductant, and the optical spectrum produced was compared with the spectrum recorded when the enzyme was mixed with phosphate buffer in the presence of excess reductant. The position of the c heme Soret band (418 nm), which is characteristic of reduced c heme in this enzyme, and the d1 heme spectral features at 460 and 653 nm both indicated that the enzyme remained fully reduced in the apparatus, even in the absence of excess reductant (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 (t = 0 spectra)).FIGURE 3Optical spectra measured at the times indicated after mixing of fully reduced P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 (in the absence of excess reductant) and 10 mm potassium nitrite (which was in at least 10-fold excess over enzyme monomer) at pH 6.0. The dashed lines indicate 653 nm, the position of the d1 heme peak in the fully reduced spectrum. The dotted lines indicate 620 nm. The region between 500 and 700 nm is multiplied by 2.5.

Spectra were measured at 77 K.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fully reduced cytochrome cd1 was mixed with potassium nitrite in the MHQ apparatus at pH 7.0, and the reaction was quenched at various time points between 130 μs and 11 ms after mixing to build up a profile of the early reaction intermediates (Fig. 1). A spectrum taken at the fastest possible time point (∼75 μs) was not different from the 130-μs spectrum, and therefore we have concentrated our analysis on time points ≥130 μs, which can be reported with the greatest accuracy (±5%). 130 μs after mixing of enzyme and substrate, a peak at 620 nm was observed. This peak is shifted by 33 nm from the corresponding d1 heme absorbance at 653 nm in the starting spectrum of the fully reduced enzyme (Fig. 1). The d1 heme peak at 460 nm became a shoulder. Complexes of NO and CO bound to the ferrous enzyme from P. aeruginosa lose absorbance at 460 nm altogether (12Das T.K. Wilson E.K. Cutruzzolà F. Brunori M. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10774-10781Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the spectrum of the complex of CN– bound to ferrous P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 is also significantly perturbed in this region (13Jafferji A. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Fülöp V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25089-25094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore interpret the loss of absorbance at 460 nm as ligand binding at the active site. At this time point, the c heme was still fully reduced, is judged by the position of the Soret band. The kcat of cytochrome cd1 is 72 s–1 per enzyme monomer at pH 7.0 (14Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Koppenhöfer A. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3093-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which means that the catalytic cycle takes place over a period of about 14 ms. 130 μs was therefore extremely early in the catalytic cycle of cytochrome cd1-catalyzed nitrite reduction. An absorbance maximum at around 620 nm has not been observed during conventional studies of the kinetics or ligand binding for this enzyme, and thus it is concluded that the species observed 130 μs after mixing of enzyme and substrate was very probably the Michaelis complex of fully reduced cytochrome cd1 with nitrite bound at the d1 heme. This assignment is supported by further spectroscopic evidence that will be discussed later. At pH 7.0, between 130 and 780 μs, the 620 nm peak began to red shift but was still predominant in the spectrum until 780 μs. By 1.31 ms, two separate peaks of roughly equal intensity were visible at 630 and 660 nm. This spectrum is comparable with that seen in the earliest time point, ∼3 ms, observed in conventional stopped flow studies (6Sam K.A. Tolland J.D. Fairhurst S.A. Higham C.W. Lowe D.J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, presumably because the current spectra were recorded at low temperature, the two separate peaks observed at this time point are much more clearly resolved than in the room temperature spectrum. The 630-nm peak can be assigned with confidence as arising from d1 Fe(II)-NO+ because its formation has previously been observed to occur with the same rate constant as the species shown to be Fe(II)-NO+ by FTIR; note that Fe(II)-NO+, while isoelectronic with Fe(III)-NO, is a distinct species, and the previously reported FTIR band observed at 1913 cm–1 is assigned to the former (15George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has not proved possible to assign unequivocally the 660 nm species to date. However, the best current interpretation is that it arises from a high spin ferrous d1 heme that is pentacoordinate or more probably has a 6th weak field ligand such as water (6Sam K.A. Tolland J.D. Fairhurst S.A. Higham C.W. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 371: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).The c heme remained essentially reduced for the first 410 μs of the reaction and then underwent oxidation between 410 μs and 1.31 ms. It then continued to oxidize further but at a much slower rate until the final time point at 11 ms. This second slower phase of oxidation was interpreted as a balance of continued oxidation in conjunction with the back reduction of the c heme shown by George et al. (15George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After 11 ms, the c heme had reached ∼55% oxidation (Fig. 1), which is again in good agreement with the conventional stopped flow studies of the nitrite reduction reaction at this pH (6Sam K.A. Tolland J.D. Fairhurst S.A. Higham C.W. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 371: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15George S.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Conventionally, the percentage oxidation of P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 is judged by the relative intensity of the c heme α-band. However, this requires that spectra are first normalized according to protein concentration. Using the MHQ technique, it was not possible to determine the concentration of the enzyme in the final sample from which the optical spectra were produced because an unknown and slightly variable amount of cold reacted powder was mixed with cold isopentane. The percentage oxidation of the c heme of the enzyme can therefore only be judged by the position of the Soret band. The Soret band of P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 shifts from 410 to 418 nm between its fully oxidized (His/Met coordinated) and fully reduced forms. Assuming a linear relationship between oxidation state and Soret position, the extent of c heme oxidation was estimated from the percentage Soret shift; however, the values obtained are inevitably approximate.The final species seen after 11 ms at pH 7.0 still contains clear contributions from the 630 and 660 nm species that are also observed in the conventional time stopped flow experiments at this time point. It has been shown previously from later time points (6Sam K.A. Tolland J.D. Fairhurst S.A. Higham C.W. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that this species decays over a period of 100 ms to produce a spectrum containing a single peak in the d1 heme region with maximum absorbance at 630 nm. Stopped flow FTIR shows that the peak corresponding to d1 Fe(II)-NO+ forms at the same rate as the optical species at 630 nm, and therefore, as previously explained, the 630 nm absorbing species is assigned as containing d1 Fe(II)-NO+ (15George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).The mixing of fully reduced cytochrome cd1 (in the absence of excess reductant) with potassium nitrite was repeated at pH 6.0 because our recent study of the pH dependence of the nitrite reduction reaction on a slower time scale showed that at pH 6.0 the final reaction product was different and formed approximately three times faster compared with pH 7.0. The data in the current ultra-rapid reaction study show that at pH 6.0 a similar pattern of early intermediates to those at pH 7.0 was observed (Fig. 3). However, their lifetimes differed significantly from those at pH 7.0. As with the reaction at pH 7.0, a 620-nm peak was observed in the optical spectrum of the fastest time point (130 μs), which as before is assigned as the Michaelis complex of c Fe(II)·d1Fe(II)-NO–2. At pH 6.0, oxidation of the c heme was similar to pH 7.0 with the majority of this oxidation occurring between 780 μs and 1.31 ms (Fig. 2). The most notable difference between pH 6.0 and 7.0 is that at pH 6.0 the species with a peak at 660 nm decayed on a much faster time scale (compare Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). At both pH 6.0 and pH 7.0, a small amount of absorbance at 660 nm was evident in the spectrum at 780 μs. By 1.31 ms in the pH 6.0 reaction, which is the time point at which the greatest level of c heme oxidation was observed, clear resolution of a peak at 630 nm, which was assigned as d1 Fe(II)-NO+, and an increase in intensity of the 660 nm peak occurred. Unlike at pH 7.0, where both the 660 and 630 nm absorbance peaks remained for longer than 11 ms after mixing of enzyme and substrate, at pH 6.0, the 660 nm peak decayed much faster and had substantially disappeared by 2.2 ms, leaving a species generating a single 630 nm peak by 11 ms.FIGURE 2Percentage oxidation of the c heme at pH 6.0 (—) and pH 7.0 (- - -) at specific time points (indicated in Figs. 1 and 3) during the reaction of P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 with potassium nitrite, which was in ∼10-fold excess to enzyme monomer. Enzyme and substrate were mixed in the MHQ apparatus at 25 °C, and the reaction was quenched at various time points. The percentage oxidation of the c heme was measured as the % shift between 418 nm (fully reduced His/Met coordinated) and 410 nm (fully oxidized His/Met coordinated).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThis work exemplifies the novel insight into enzyme mechanisms, in this case cytochrome cd1, which is available through the use of the recently developed MHQ apparatus. The novel species observed just 130 μs after mixing of enzyme and substrate, with an optical d1 heme signature at 620 nm, is argued to be the Michaelis complex of fully reduced enzyme with nitrite bound at the d1 heme, cFe(II)⋅d1Fe(II)−NO2−. A peak at 620 nm has not previously been observed during the catalytic cycle of cytochrome cd1, and indeed there are very few references to d1 heme complexes with absorbance maxima below 630 nm. The closest reported d1 heme absorbance maximum to 620 nm is that of the d1 heme pyridine hemochrome, d1Fe(II)-bis-pyr, the absorbance maximum of which has been reported at 617 nm (16Newton N. Biochem. J. 1967; 105: C21-C23Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and 620 nm (17Yamanaka T. Okunuki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 407-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also of note is that ferrous, cyanide-bound cytochrome cd1 has an absorbance maximum at 628 nm (13Jafferji A. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Fülöp V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25089-25094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Allen J.W. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 883-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the pyridine hemochrome and the ferrous CN–-bound species are examples of ferrous d1 heme with strong field ligands. Nitrite is a strong field π -acceptor ligand, and the fact that these two complexes of ferrous d1 heme, with strong field axial ligands, result in observed absorbance maxima below 630 nm supports the proposal that the 620-nm peak seen in this study arises from nitrite bound to ferrous d1 heme, the Michaelis complex. The time scale on which the 620-nm peak is present (between 130 and 780 μs after mixing of enzyme and substrate) is also consistent with it being the Michaelis complex, given the length of the catalytic cycle, which is in the order of 14 ms at pH 7.0 and 8 ms at pH 6.0, as determined by Richter et al. (14Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Koppenhöfer A. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3093-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This also makes it unlikely that the first molecule of product NO is formed within the first 130 μs. The c heme apparently remains fully reduced at the first time point of 130 μs; thus no intramolecular electron transfer has occurred by this stage. Therefore, the only possibilities, other than the Michaelis complex, for the species absorbing at 620 nm, are ferric d1 heme with either NO or nitrite bound; however, the above discussion of kinetic parameters argues against these possibilities. As reported in previous work (19Sam K.A. Fairhurst S.A. Thorneley R.N.F. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12555-12563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), model spectra were obtained for the oxidized Y25S cytochrome cd1 with nitrite and NO bound; it was not possible to use the wild type enzyme for these experiments because tyrosine 25 blocks the active site preventing exogenous ligand coordination to the oxidized enzyme. The Y25S enzyme is competent to exogenous ligand binding in its oxidized as-isolated state, and therefore circumvents this problem. No peak between 550 and 630 nm was seen for the Y25S enzyme with either nitrite or NO bound, further indicating that the 620 nm peak does not arise from either of these ligands bound to ferric d1 heme. Recent work has invoked the possibility of electron donation from an amino acid side chain during nitrite reduction by cytochrome cd1 (20van Wonderen J.H. Knight C. Oganesyan V.S. George S.J. Zumft W.G. Cheesman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28207-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and therefore formation of cFe(II)·d1Fe(II)-NO was also addressed. However, when the 130-μs sample was subjected to EPR, no signal arising from Fe(II)-NO was observed. The only logical assignment of the 620 nm peak, therefore, remains the Michaelis complex.At pH 7.0, following observation of the proposed Michaelis complex at 130 μs, the 620 nm absorbance maximum is seen to red shift and flatten. This is concurrent with another species being formed at the d1 heme, the absorbance of which is not sufficiently separated from 620 nm to distinguish formation of a separate peak. There is considerable evidence for non-equivalence between monomers of P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 (13Jafferji A. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Fülöp V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25089-25094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Sjögren T. Hajdu J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), but the general assumption has been that the monomers are kinetically independent. However, it is possible that the residual absorbance at 620 nm, in conjunction with increased absorbance at longer wavelength, reflects nitrite reduction occurring at monomer 1, whereas the Michaelis complex remains at monomer 2. By 1.31 ms, significant absorbance has become apparent at 660 nm, and the absorbance between 620 and 630 nm remains broad and flat although it is further shifted toward 630 nm. By 2.2 ms, the previously apparent absorbance at 620 nm appears to have significantly diminished, with the emergence of a much sharper peak at 630 nm and further increase in the absorbance at 660 nm. In previous work we have tentatively assigned the species with 660 nm absorbance as a high spin ferrous d1 heme, which is either pentacoordinate or which has a 6th weak field ligand such as a water (6Sam K.A. Tolland J.D. Fairhurst S.A. Higham C.W. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 371: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reason for the uncertainty of this assignment was because it is hard to justify how the d1 heme, in the presence of a large excess of nitrite, could have anything bound other than this anion. However, in light of these new insights into much earlier time points in the reaction, several steps in the nitrite reduction reaction may, in fact, be gated by events occurring at the other cytochrome cd1 monomer. The evidence for this is as follows: as already discussed, the earliest time point is assigned as the Michaelis complex of fully reduced enzyme with nitrite bound at the d1 heme. Later time points show that this absorbance shifts to longer wavelengths, but no clear decrease in absorbance at 620 nm is observed until formation of the 660 nm species, at which time, clear absorbance at 630 nm is observed with a marked decrease in absorbance at 620 nm. A peak at 630 nm, later on in the reaction between cytochrome cd1 and nitrite, has been shown to correspond to ferric d1 heme with NO bound, formally d1 Fe(II)-NO+. An interpretation of the observed absorbance changes at the d1 heme is that reduction of nitrite to NO at monomer 2 cannot occur until product has dissociated from monomer 1. Hence, residual absorbance at 620 nm, arising from the Michaelis complex at monomer 2, is observed until product dissociation occurs at monomer 1. If the assignment of the 660 nm species as ferrous pentacoordinate d1 heme is accurate, then the product dissociated state of monomer 1 is evident from the 6"
