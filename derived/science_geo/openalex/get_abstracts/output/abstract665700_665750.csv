https://openalex.org/W3115548486,"Background COVID-19 rapidly escalated into a pandemic, threatening 213 countries, areas, and territories the world over. We aimed to identify potential province-level socioeconomic determinants of the virus’s dissemination, and explain between-province differences in the speed of its spread, based on data from 36 provinces of Northern Italy. Methods This is an ecological study. We included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported between February 24th and March 30th, 2020. For each province, we calculated the trend of contagion as the relative increase in the number of individuals infected between two time endpoints, assuming an exponential growth. Pearson’s test was used to correlate the trend of contagion with a set of healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters by province. The virus’s spread was input as a dependent variable in a stepwise OLS regression model to test the association between rate of spread and province-level indicators. Results Multivariate analysis showed that the spread of COVID-19 was correlated negatively with aging index (p-value = 0.003), and positively with public transportation per capita (p-value = 0.012), the % of private long-term care hospital beds and, to a lesser extent (p-value = 0.070), the % of private acute care hospital beds (p-value = 0.006). Conclusion Demographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables were found associated with a significant difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces of Northern Italy. An aging population seemed to naturally contain social contacts. The availability of healthcare resources and their coordination could play an important part in spreading infection."
https://openalex.org/W3114801958,"This paper reports the results of a Bayesian analysis on large-scale empirical data to assess the effectiveness of eleven types of COVID-control policies that have been implemented at various levels of intensity in 40 countries and U.S. states since the onset of the pandemic. The analysis estimates the marginal impact of each type and level of policy as implemented in concert with other policies. The purpose is to provide policymakers and the general public with an estimate of the relative effectiveness of various COVID-control strategies. We find that a set of widely implemented core policies reduces the spread of virus but not by enough to contain the pandemic except in a few highly compliant jurisdictions. The core policies include the cancellation of public events, restriction of gatherings to fewer than 100 people, recommendation to stay at home, recommended restrictions on internal movement, implementation of a partial international travel ban, and coordination of information campaigns. For the median jurisdiction, these policies reduce growth rate in new infections from an estimated 270% per week to approximately 49% per week, but this impact is insufficient to prevent eventual transmission throughout the population because containment occurs only when a jurisdiction reduces growth in COVID infection to below zero. Most jurisdictions must also implement additional policies, each of which has the potential to reduce weekly COVID growth rate by 10 percentage points or more. The slate of these additional high-impact policies includes targeted or full workplace closings for all but essential workers, stay-at-home requirements, and targeted school closures."
https://openalex.org/W3115049237,"Introduction Protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a priority to maintain a safe and functioning healthcare system. Our objective was to describe and compare the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs compared to non-HCWs. Methods Using reportable disease data at Public Health Ontario, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study comparing demographic, exposure, and clinical variables between HCWs and non-HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 infections as of 30 September 2020. We calculated rates of infections over time and determined the frequency of within household transmissions using natural language processing based on residential address. We evaluated the risk of death using a multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, symptoms, and long-term care home exposure. Results There were 7,050 (12.5%) HCW SARS-CoV-2 infections in Ontario, Canada, of whom 24.9% were nurses, 2.3% were physicians, and the remaining 72.8% other specialties, including personal support workers. Overall HCWs had an infection rate of 1,276 per 100,000 compared to non-HCWs of 346 per 100,000 (3.7 times higher). This difference decreased from a 7 times higher rate in April to no difference in September 2020. Twenty-six percent of HCWs had a household member with SARS-CoV-2 infection; 6.8% were probable acquisitions, 12.3% secondary transmissions, and 6.9% unknown direction of transmission. Death among HCWs was 0.2% compared to 6.1% of non-HCWs. The risk of death in HCWs remained significantly lower than non-HCWs after adjustment (adjusted odds ratio 0.09; 95%CI 0.05–0.17). Conclusion HCWs represent a disproportionate number of diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections in Ontario, however this discrepancy is at least partially explained by limitations in testing earlier in the pandemic for non-HCWs. We observed a low risk of death in HCWs which could not be completely explained by other factors."
https://openalex.org/W3116336904,"Objective Our objective is to compare the predictive accuracy of four recently established outcome models of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) published between January 1 st and May 1 st 2020. Methods We used data obtained from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) between January 1 st , 2020, and May 1 st 2020 as an external validation cohort. The outcome measure was hospital mortality. Areas under the ROC (AUC) curves were used to evaluate discrimination of the four predictive models. The Hosmer–Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test and calibration curves assessed applicability of the models to individual cases. Results During the study period, 1634 unique patients were identified. The mean age of the study cohort was 68.8±13.4 years. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and heart disease were the most common comorbidities. The crude hospital mortality was 29% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27–0.31). Evaluation of the predictive models showed an AUC range from 0.63 (95% CI 0.60–0.66) to 0.72 (95% CI 0.69–0.74) indicating fair to poor discrimination across all models. There were no significant differences among the AUC values of the four prognostic systems. All models calibrated poorly by either overestimated or underestimated hospital mortality. Conclusions All the four prognostic models examined in this study portend high-risk bias. The performance of these scores needs to be interpreted with caution in hospitalized patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3117756698,"Achondroplasia is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the Fibroblast Growth Factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). These mutations lead to aberrant increase of inhibitory signaling in proliferating chondrocytes at the growth plate. Recifercept is a potential treatment for this disease using a decoy approach to sequester FGFR3 ligands subsequently normalizing activation of the mutated FGFR3 receptor. Recifercept binds to FGF isoforms in vitro and in cellular model systems and reduces FGFR3 signaling. In addition, in a transgenic mouse model of achondroplasia, Recifercept restores reduced body weight and long bone growth in these mice. These data suggest that Recifercept treatment could lead to clinical benefits in children treated with this molecule."
https://openalex.org/W3116185563,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most severe gastrointestinal diseases affecting premature infants. It has been shown that NEC is associated with disrupted intestinal barrier and dysregulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress response. It has also been shown that stem cells derived from amniotic fluid (AFSC) rescued intestinal injury in experimental NEC. Herein, we hypothesized that the beneficial effects of AFSC in the injured intestine are due to the restoration of intestinal barrier function. We evaluated intestinal barrier function using an ex vivo intestinal organoid model of NEC. We found that AFSC restored the expression and localization of tight junction proteins in intestinal organoids, and subsequently decreased epithelial permeability. AFSC rescued tight junction expression by inducing a protective ER stress response that prevents epithelial cell apoptosis in injured intestinal organoids. Finally, we validated these results in our experimental mouse model of NEC and confirmed that AFSC induced sustained ER stress and prevented intestinal apoptosis. This response led to the restoration of tight junction expression and localization, which subsequently reduced intestinal permeability in NEC pups. These findings confirm that intestinal barrier function is disrupted during NEC intestinal injury, and further demonstrate the disruption can be reversed by the administration of AFSC through the activation of the ER stress pathway. This study provides insight into the pathogenesis of NEC and highlights potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of NEC."
https://openalex.org/W3116476643,"Habits such as smoking and alcohol drinking and existing esophageal malfunction are considered the main risk factors for esophageal carcinogenesis. Caustic ingestion of acidic or alkaline agents or strong irritants can induce severe esophageal corrosive injury and increase esophageal cancer risk. We studied the relationship between esophageal carcinoma and acute detergent or pesticide poisoning by using nationwide health insurance data. Methodology/Principle findings : We compared a pesticide/detergent intoxication cohort (N = 21,840) and an age- and gender-matched control cohort (N = 21,840) identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2011. We used the multivariable Cox proportional model to determine esophageal carcinoma risk. The overall incidence density of esophageal cancer was 1.66 per 10,000 person-years in the comparison cohort and 4.36 per 10,000 person-years in the pesticide/detergent intoxication cohort. The corresponding adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for esophageal cancer was 2.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.41–3.86) in the pesticide/detergent intoxication cohort compared with the control cohort. Patients with corrosive and detergent intoxication did not have a higher risk of esophageal cancer (adjusted HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.29–3.33) than those without pesticide/detergent intoxication. However, patients with pesticide intoxication had a significantly higher risk of esophageal cancer (adjusted HR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.52–4.18) than those without pesticide/detergent intoxication. Conclusion : In the present study, after adjusting for conventional risk factors, we observed that pesticide intoxication could exert substantial effects through increased esophageal cancer risk. However, patients with detergent intoxication may not have an increased risk of esophageal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3114010285,"Background Studies from high-income countries reported reduced life expectancy in children with cerebral palsy (CP), while no population-based study has evaluated mortality of children with CP in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to estimate the mortality rate (MR) of children with CP in a rural region of Uganda and identify risk factors and causes of death (CODs). Methods and findings This population-based, longitudinal cohort study was based on data from Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance System in eastern Uganda. We identified 97 children (aged 2–17 years) with CP in 2015, whom we followed to 2019. They were compared with an age-matched cohort from the general population (n = 41 319). MRs, MR ratios (MRRs), hazard ratios (HRs), and immediate CODs were determined. MR was 3952 per 100 000 person years (95% CI 2212–6519) in children with CP and 137 per 100 000 person years (95% CI 117–159) in the general population. Standardized MRR was 25·3 in the CP cohort, compared with the general population. In children with CP, risk of death was higher in those with severe gross motor impairments than in those with milder impairments (HR 6·8; p = 0·007) and in those with severe malnutrition than in those less malnourished (HR = 3·7; p = 0·052). MR was higher in females in the CP cohort, with a higher MRR in females (53·0; 95% CI 26·4–106·3) than in males (16·3; 95% CI 7·2–37·2). Age had no significant effect on MR in the CP cohort, but MRR was higher at 10–18 years (39·6; 95% CI 14·2–110·0) than at 2–6 years (21·0; 95% CI 10·2–43·2). Anaemia, malaria, and other infections were the most common CODs in the CP cohort. Conclusions Risk of premature death was excessively high in children with CP in rural sub-Saharan Africa, especially in those with severe motor impairments or malnutrition. While global childhood mortality has significantly decreased during recent decades, this observed excessive mortality is a hidden humanitarian crisis that needs to be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W3116967915,"Effectively communicating risk is critical to reducing conflict in human-wildlife interactions. Using a survey experiment fielded in the midst of contentious public debate over flying fox management in urban and suburban areas of Australia, we find that stories with characters (i.e., narratives) are more effective than descriptive information at mobilizing support for different forms of bat management, including legal protection, relocation, and habitat restoration. We use conditional process analysis to show that narratives, particularly with accompanying images, are effective because they cause emotional reactions that influence risk perception, which in turn drives public opinion about strategies for risk mitigation. We find that prior attitudes towards bats matter in how narrative messages are received, in particular in how strongly they generate shifts in affective response, risk perception, and public opinion. Our results suggest that those with warm prior attitudes towards bats report greater support for bat dispersal when they perceive impacts from bats to be more likely, while those with cool priors report greater support for bat protection when they perceive impacts from bats to be more positive, revealing 1) potential opportunities for targeted messaging to boost public buy-in of proposals to manage risks associated with human-wildlife interactions, and 2) potential vulnerabilities to disinformation regarding risk."
https://openalex.org/W3113384463,"Aims To compare the value of pre-treatment axial elongation (AE) and changes in refractive sphere (M change) for predicting the success in orthokeratology (ortho-k), in order to better identify suitable candidates for myopia control. Methods This study further analysed the data of 66 subjects receiving 7-month ortho-k treatment, following a 7-month observation period, during which single-vision spectacles were worn. Rate of myopia progression was determined by AE and M change and subjects categorised as slow, moderate, or rapid progressors based on these changes. Outcomes of myopia control, based on the AE reduction after ortho-k, were classified as ‘ineffectual’, ‘clinically insignificant’, or ‘beneficial’. Results Of the 20 subjects, initially categorised as slow by AE and, of whom 95% were similarly categorised by M change, none benefitted from ortho-k. In contrast, of the 22 subjects with moderate AE, 77% and 23% displaying slow and moderate M change, respectively, the majority (73%) benefitted from ortho-k lens wear. The 24 subjects with rapid AE were poorly identified by M change, with only 21% correctly categorised. The vast majority of rapid progressors showed significant benefit after ortho-k. Conclusion Progression of AE is a good indicator of subsequent success of ortho-k treatment. Delaying commencement of therapy is prudent for children with slow progression as results indicate that they would be unlikely to benefit from this intervention. As change in refractive error frequently underestimates rapid progression of AE, its value for identifying appropriate candidates for myopia control is poor."
https://openalex.org/W3115032492,"The genus Rotavirus comprises eight species, designated A to H , and two recently identified tentative species I in dogs and J in bats. Species Rotavirus A , B , C and H (RVA, RVB, RVC and RVH) have been detected in humans and animals. While human and animal RVA are well characterized and defined, complete porcine genome sequences in the GenBank are limited compared to human strains. Here, we used a metagenomic approach to sequence the 11 segments of RVA, RVC and RVH strains from piglets in the United States (US) and explore the evolutionary relations of these RV species. Metagenomics identified Astroviridae , Picornaviridae , Caliciviridae , Coronoviridae in samples MN9.65 and OK5.68 while Picobirnaviridae and Arteriviridae were only identified in sample OK5.68. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses identified multiple genotypes with the RVA of strain MN9.65 and OK5.68, with the genome constellation of G5/G9-P[7]/P[13]-I5/I5- R1/R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T7-E1/E1-H1 and G5/G9-P[6]/P[7]-I5-R1/R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1/T7-E1/E1-H1, respectively. The RVA strains had a complex evolutionary relationship with other mammalian strains. The RVC strain OK5.68 had a genome constellation of G9-P[6]-I1-R1-C5-M6-A5-N1-T1-E1-H1, and shared an evolutionary relationship with porcine strains from the US. The RVH strains MN9.65 and OK5.68 had the genome constellation of G5-P1-I1-R1-C1-M1-A5-N1-T1-E4-H1 and G5-P1-I1-R1-C1-M1-A5-N1-T1-E1-H1, indicating multiple RVH genome constellations are circulating in the US. These findings allow us to understand the complexity of the enteric virome, develop improved screening methods for RVC and RVH strains, facilitate expanded rotavirus surveillance in pigs, and increase our understanding of the origin and evolution of rotavirus species."
https://openalex.org/W3115626706,"The tumour micro-environment (TME) plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). Here we studied the potential of a selected panel of TME-markers to predict clinical recurrence (CLR) in PCa. Patient cohorts were matched for the presence or absence of CLR 5 years post-prostatectomy. Tissue micro-arrays (TMA) were composed with both prostate non-tumour (PNT) and PCa tissue and subsequently processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The IHC panel included markers for cancer activated fibroblasts (CAFs), blood vessels and steroid hormone receptors ((SHR): androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen receptor (ER)). Stained slides were digitalised, selectively annotated and analysed for percentage of marker expression with standardized and validated image analysis algorithms. A univariable analysis identified several TME markers with significant impact on CR: expression of CD31 (vascular marker) in PNT stroma, expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) in PCa stroma, and PR expression ratio between PCa stroma and PNT stroma. A multivariable model, which included CD31 expression (vascular marker) in PNT stroma and PR expression ratio between PCa stroma and PNT stroma, could significantly stratify patients for CLR, with the identification of a low risk and high-risk subgroup. If validated and confirmed in an independent prospective series, this subgroup might have clinical potential for PCa patient stratification."
https://openalex.org/W3117867081,"Sesuvium portulacastrum is a well-known halophyte with considerable Cd accumulation and tolerance under high Cd stress. This species is also considered as a good candidate of Cd phytoremediation in the polluted soils. However, the mechanism of Cd accumulation, distribution and fractionation in different body parts still remain unknown. Seedlings of Sesuvium portulacastrum were studied hydroponically under exposure to a range of Cd concentrations (50 μM or μmol/L to 600 μM or μmol/L) for 28 days to investigate the potential accumulation capability and tolerance mechanisms of this species. Cd accumulation in roots showed that the bio-concentration factor was &gt; 10, suggesting a strong ability to absorb and accumulate Cd. Cd fractionation in the aboveground parts showed the following order of distribution: soluble fraction &gt; cell wall &gt; organelle &gt; cell membrane. In roots, soluble fraction was mostly predominant than other fractions. Cd speciation in leaves and stems was mainly contained of sodium chloride and deionised water extracted forms, suggesting a strong binding ability with pectin and protein as well as with organic acids. In the roots, inorganic form of Cd was dominant than other forms of Cd. It could be suggested that sodium chloride, deionised water and inorganic contained form of Cd are mainly responsible for the adaption of this plant in the Cd stress environment and alleviating Cd toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3115881880,"Spread of pathogens on contaminated surfaces plays a key role in disease transmission. Surface technologies that control pathogen transfer can help control fomite transmission and are of great interest to public health. Here, we report a novel bead transfer method for evaluating fomite transmission in common laboratory settings. We show that this method meets several important criteria for quantitative test methods, including reasonableness, relevancy, resemblance, responsiveness, and repeatability, and therefore may be adaptable for standardization. In addition, this method can be applied to a wide variety of pathogens including bacteria, phage, and human viruses. Using the bead transfer method, we demonstrate that an engineered micropattern limits transfer of Staphylococcus aureus by 97.8% and T4 bacteriophage by 93.0% on silicone surfaces. Furthermore, the micropattern significantly reduces transfer of influenza B virus and human coronavirus on silicone and polypropylene surfaces. Our results highlight the potential of using surface texture as a valuable new strategy in combating infectious diseases."

We aimed to establish predictive models for COVID-19 pneumonia severity in hospitalized patients. Methods Retrospective study of 430 patients admitted in Vall d’Hebron Hospital (Barcelona) between 03-12-2020 and 04-28-2020 due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Two models to identify the patients who required high-flow-oxygen-support were generated, one using baseline data and another with also follow-up analytical results. Calibration was performed by a 1000-bootstrap replication model. Results 249 were male, mean age 57.9 years. Overall, 135 (31.4%) required high-flow-oxygen-support . The baseline predictive model showed a ROC of 0.800 based on: SpO2/FiO2 (adjusted Hazard Ratio-aHR = 8), chest x-ray (aHR = 4), prior immunosuppressive therapy (aHR = 4), obesity (aHR = 2), IL-6 (aHR = 2), platelets (aHR = 0.5). The cut-off of 11 presented a specificity of 94.8%. The second model included changes on the analytical parameters: ferritin (aHR = 7.5 if ≥200ng/mL) and IL-6 (aHR = 18 if ≥64pg/mL) plus chest x-ray (aHR = 2) showing a ROC of 0.877. The cut-off of 12 exhibited a negative predictive value of 92%. Conclusions SpO2/FiO2 and chest x-ray on admission or changes on inflammatory parameters as IL-6 and ferritin allow us early identification of COVID-19 patients at risk of high-flow-oxygen-support that may benefit from a more intensive disease management."
https://openalex.org/W3114940228,"Myosin VI ensembles on endocytic cargo facilitate directed transport through a dense cortical actin network. Myosin VI is recruited to clathrin-coated endosomes via the cargo adaptor Dab2. Canonically, it has been assumed that the interactions between a motor and its cargo adaptor are stable. However, it has been demonstrated that the force generated by multiple stably attached motors disrupts local cytoskeletal architecture, potentially compromising transport. In this study, we demonstrate that dynamic multimerization of myosin VI-Dab2 complexes facilitates cargo processivity without significant reorganization of cortical actin networks. Specifically, we find that Dab2 myosin interacting region (MIR) binds myosin VI with a moderate affinity (184 nM) and single-molecule kinetic measurements demonstrate a high rate of turnover (1 s−1) of the Dab2 MIR–myosin VI interaction. Single-molecule motility shows that saturating Dab2-MIR concentration (2 μM) promotes myosin VI homodimerization and processivity with run lengths comparable with constitutive myosin VI dimers. Cargo-mimetic DNA origami scaffolds patterned with Dab2 MIR-myosin VI complexes are weakly processive, displaying sparse motility on single actin filaments and “stop-and-go” motion on a cellular actin network. On a minimal actin cortex assembled on lipid bilayers, unregulated processive movement by either constitutive myosin V or VI dimers results in actin remodeling and foci formation. In contrast, Dab2 MIR–myosin VI interactions preserve the integrity of a minimal cortical actin network.

Taken together, our study demonstrates the importance of dynamic motor–cargo association in enabling cargo transportation without disrupting cytoskeletal organization. Cytoskeletal molecular motors play essential roles in maintaining the subcellular architecture of eukaryotic cells. Through their engagement to distinct cargo adaptor proteins, they are targeted to distinct subcellular compartments (1Vale R.D. The molecular motor toolbox for intracellular transport.Cell. 2003; 112: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar, 2Akhmanova A. Hammer J.A. Linking molecular motors to membrane cargo.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Despite our detailed understanding of motor structure and the cargo adaptors that link motors to scaffolds, the structural and biochemical mechanisms that confer functional selectivity in diverse cellular contexts remain poorly understood. Functional selectivity of motor function emerges from the collective interactions between cargo complexes, motors, and the unique cytoskeletal architecture in distinct microenvironments inside the cell. This study focuses on adaptor proteins that bridge the interaction between motors and cargo and serve as the first point in cargo interface-mediated motor regulation. Initially thought to be passive connectors of motors to cargoes, adaptor proteins have since emerged as active modulators of motor structure and function. Studies focused on individual motor–cargo adaptor interactions have identified the release of autoinhibition (3Yao L.-L. Cao Q.-J. Zhang H.-M. Zhang J. Cao Y. Li X.-D.

However, it is unclear whether these established mechanisms provide sufficient modes of regulation to tune motor function inside cells. Additionally, the interplay between distinct modes of motor regulation that together confer functional selectivity remains an outstanding challenge. The multifunctional, actin-based, molecular motor, myosin VI, displays functional selectivity in diverse cellular contexts (6Buss F. Spudich G. Kendrick-jones J.

Additionally, the structural influence of distinct adaptors on myosin VI function remains an outstanding challenge. Specifically, myosin VI has a number of unique structural features, including a flexible extensible lever arm (16Spudich J.A. Sivaramakrishnan S.

A precise understanding of how adaptors leverage these structural mechanisms to tune functional selectivity in cells remains unclear and is systematically dissected here. In this study, we examine the regulation of myosin VI through the endocytic adaptor Dab2. The Dab2–myosin VI interaction occurs on clathrin-coated vesicles in the dense actin cortex near the plasma membrane (9Hasson T. Myosin VI: two distinct roles in endocytosis.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3453-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Early studies had defined the myosin VI interaction region (MIR) of Dab2 (11Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C.

Subsequent studies examined the structural effect of Dab2 MIR binding on myosin VI (4Yu C. Feng W. Wei Z. Miyanoiri Y. Wen W. Zhao Y. Zhang M. Myosin VI undergoes cargo-mediated dimerization.Cell. 2009; 138: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Phichith D. Travaglia M. Yang Z. Liu X. Zong A.B.

In particular, using NMR and X-ray crystallographic structural analysis, Yu et al. showed that Dab2-MIR region comprises a 21 a.a. peptide ranging from a.a. 649 to 670 at the C terminus of Dab2 and consists of two α-helical motifs (defined as αA and αB in the paper) connected by a stalk. The αA and αB motifs bind distinct regions within a single myosin VI cargo-binding domain (CBD), resulting in a 2:2 Dab2-MIR-CBD complex with an apparent affinity of ∼0.5 μM. However, the functional implications of the Dab2 MIR:myosin VI CBD complex on myosin VI motility have not yet been elucidated and form the focus of this study. Cytoskeletal motors are presumed to be stably bound to cargo during processive transport. However, multiple studies suggest the potential for motor–cargo turnover, given the weak Dab2–myosin VI interaction affinity (4Yu C. Feng W. Wei Z. Miyanoiri Y. Wen W. Zhao Y. Zhang M.

Chem. 2020; 295: 337-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Indeed, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)-based measurements of myosin VI and Dab2 on endosomes inside cells confirmed a high rate of motor turnover with a half-life of ∼13 s of myosin VI (22Bond L.M. Arden S.D. Kendrick-Jones J. Buss F. Sellers J.R. Dynamic exchange of myosin VI on endocytic structures.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 38637-38646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The consequences of motor–cargo interaction turnover on motor function remain unclear and are dissected here using single-molecule motility, programmable synthetic cargos, cellular actin networks, and actin reorganization in a minimal actin cortex. In this study, the MIR of Dab2 was first confirmed to be sufficient to dimerize the CBD of myosin VI. Single-molecule analysis of the binding kinetics of this interaction indicated a high turnover of the motor–cargo interaction, which is on par with the catalytic rate of the motor. Single-molecule motility assays suggested that adaptor-bound processive events are driven by motor dimers. Adaptor-bound motors were also found to be processive in surface actin gliding assays and contributed to processive ensemble movement of synthetic, programmable DNA nanostructure cargos. However, while this processive movement of cargo was found to have similar run lengths on a cellular actin network, the trajectories of adaptor-mediated cargo movement were found to have more pauses and to remain paused for longer. Interestingly, these features were found to combine to make Dab2-myosin VI motility less likely to destructively rearrange a minimal actin cortex into actin foci on supported lipid bilayers, as compared with constitutively dimerized and processive motors. Together, these findings indicate that Dab2 interactions with myosin VI are uniquely adapted to efficiently transport cargo through the dense cortical actin network at the periphery of the cell, without compromising actin network architecture. The myosin VI binding interface for the endocytic adaptor proteins Dab2 has been well characterized (4Yu C. Feng W. Wei Z. Miyanoiri Y. Wen W. Zhao Y. Zhang M. Myosin VI undergoes cargo-mediated dimerization.Cell. 2009; 138: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Bond L.M. Arden S.D. Kendrick-Jones J. Buss F. Sellers J.R. Dynamic exchange of myosin VI on endocytic structures.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 38637-38646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To minimize regulatory effects arising from nonmotor interacting domains of the adaptor, we have used the minimal myosin VI interaction region (MIR) of Dab2 in this study. The Dab2 MIR has been demonstrated to dimerize myosin VI through a 2:2 interaction with its CBD (4Yu C. Feng W. Wei Z. Miyanoiri Y. Wen W. Zhao Y. Zhang M. Myosin VI undergoes cargo-mediated dimerization.Cell. 2009; 138: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A FRET binding assay was conducted between fluorescently labeled Dab2 MIR and myosin VI to determine the concentrations at which saturable binding occurs, regardless of dimerization state (Fig. 1, A–B; Kd ∼ 184 nM). Future experiments used a saturating concentration of 2 μM (tenfold higher than Kd) to drive 2:2 complex formation. Ratiometric FRET measurements using donor/acceptor-labeled myosin VI CBD showed that saturating concentrations of Dab2 MIR were sufficient to induce myosin VI CBD dimerization (Fig. 1, C–D). Most experimental and theoretical studies of multimotor transport have been conducted by presuming the attachment of motors to cargoes as stable linkages that are maintained through the duration of cargo transport (23Klumpp S. Lipowsky R. Cooperative cargo transport by several molecular motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17284-17289Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, FRAP measurements on cellular cargoes have shown that there is a turnover of motors on cargo inside cells (22Bond L.M. Arden S.D. Kendrick-Jones J. Buss F. Sellers J.R. Dynamic exchange of myosin VI on endocytic structures.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 38637-38646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is essential to understand the kinetics of association and dissociation of the cargo–motor interaction. The binding kinetics of the adaptor–motor complex were probed using a single-molecule TIRF binding assay (Fig. 1E). Representative intensity-time traces show myosin VI binding events to single molecules of Dab2 tethered to a DNA nanotube (Fig. 1F). Analysis of the bound (tbound) and rebinding time (trebind, the time between two sequential binding events at a single spot) revealed both a high turnover rate and a low rate of rebinding of the Dab2–myosin VI interaction (Fig. 1, G–H). The high rate of turnover observed (0.91 s−1) is on par with the reported acto-myosin ATPase cycle (∼1 s−1) (24Heissler S.M. Selvadurai J. Bond L.M. Fedorov R. Kendrick-Jones J. Buss F. Manstein D.J. Kinetic properties and small-molecule inhibition of human myosin-6.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 3208-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that on average only one ATPase cycle is likely to occur during the bound time of the adaptor. In summary, our data suggests that the Dab2 MIR/myosin VI interaction is dynamic, resulting in multiple possible states (Fig. 1I). The effect of Dab2 on myosin VI processivity was probed using single-molecule motility of the adaptor–motor complex (Fig. 2A). Complex formation between Dab2 MIR and myosin VI was assessed using two-color single-molecule imaging of GFP-tagged Dab2 MIR and Cy3-labeled full-length myosin VI (Fig. S1; Movies S1–S3). A GCN4 dimer of myosin VI HMM (HMM dimer) and a myosin VI HMM monomer (HMM monomer) were used to mimic processive and nonprocessive myosin VI motility respectively. The Dab2–myosin VI complex showed processive runs similar to the HMM dimer, while myosin VI alone displayed nonprocessive behavior akin to a monomer of myosin VI (Fig. 2, B–C). While previous studies have documented single-molecule processivity of myosin VI in the presence of Dab2, the dimerization state of the motor during motile events remains unclear. To assess this in our assay, the correlation of Cy3-labeled myosin VI spot intensity with run length during single-molecule motility events was used to determine the dimerization state of the motor. As expected, the Cy3-labeled HMM dimer had a spot intensity twice that of the HMM monomer and a significantly longer run length (Fig. 2D). Similarly, full-length myosin VI had a spot intensity and run length that was not significantly different from the HMM monomer (Fig. 2D). However, full-length myosin VI in the presence of Dab2 MIR was similar to the HMM dimer in terms of both run length and spot intensity (Fig. 2D). To further study the effect of Dab2 MIR binding on myosin VI motility, we reconstituted adaptor-mediated myosin VI motility using a surface actin gliding assay (Fig. 3A). Analysis of actin landing rates as a function of motor density on the surface is an established approach to infer motor processivity in surface motility assays (25Sakamoto T. Wang F. Schmitz S. Xu Y. Xu Q. Molloy J.E. Veigel C. Sellers J.R. Neck length and processivity of myosin V.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29201-29207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The slope of a linear fit to a logarithmic plot of landing rate versus motor density is used to interpret processive behavior in landing rate assays (26Hancock W.O. Howard J. Processivity of the motor protein kinesin requires two heads.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Processive motors are characterized as having a slope ≤1. Constitutively dimerized myosin VI HMM was found to have a slope of 0.21, indicating a high degree of processivity (Fig. 3B). However, full-length myosin VI was found to have a slope of 1.46, demonstrating a lack of processivity. When Dab2 MIR was added, the slopes again dropped below one, regardless of whether the motor was patterned on the surface through surface-bound Dab2 MIR (0.76) or premixed with Dab2 MIR (0.40). In order to understand the functional significance of ensemble processivity on collective myosin VI transport, we examined the motility of DNA nanostructures patterned with single (one-site) and multiple (four-site) cargo adaptors on single actin filaments (Fig. 4A) (27Hariadi R.F. Sommese R. Sivaramakrishnan S. Tuning myosin-driven sorting on cellular actin networks.Elife. 2015; 2015: 1-16Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated precise labeling of DNA nanostructures with predetermined numbers of proteins (27Hariadi R.F. Sommese R. Sivaramakrishnan S. Tuning myosin-driven sorting on cellular actin networks.Elife. 2015; 2015: 1-16Google Scholar, 28Hariadi R.F. Cale M. Sivaramakrishnan S. Myosin lever arm directs collective motion on cellular actin network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 4091-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In agreement with the low binding affinity of Dab2 for myosin VI, we observed a significantly lower number of motile events with Dab2 as compared with HMM dimer, on both one-site and four-site nanostructures (Fig. 4B). The run length of Dab2 cargo movement significantly scales up from one-site to four-site nanostructures, similar to the constitutively processive HMM dimer (Fig. 4C). Together, these results demonstrate that Dab2 is able to drive sparse processive motility of myosin VI cargo at both single and ensemble motor levels. Using the same nanoarchitecture, we examined the effects of Dab2 MIR–myosin VI interactions in the context of cortical actin networks derived from fish-scale keratocytes (Fig. 5, A–B) (28Hariadi R.F. Cale M. Sivaramakrishnan S. Myosin lever arm directs collective motion on cellular actin network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 4091-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Sivaramakrishnan S. Spudich J.A. Coupled myosin VI motors facilitate unidirectional movement on an F-actin network.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similar to observations made on single actin filaments, more motile events were observed with four-site origami labeled with myosin VI HMM dimers than with full-length myosin VI attached through Dab2 MIR (Fig. 5C). However, the observed run lengths of the two origami arrangements were similar, indicating the processive nature of Dab2-mediated motility (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, a pattern of more frequent pauses was observed in the trajectories of the Dab2 origami (Fig. 5, E–F). Additionally, these pauses were observed to last ∼1.5 times longer than with myosin VI HMM (Fig. 5G). Dab2 is present on clathrin-coated vesicles in the dense actin cortex near the plasma membrane (9Hasson T. Myosin VI: two distinct roles in endocytosis.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3453-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 30Dance A.L. Miller M. Seragaki S. Aryal P. White B. Aschenbrenner L. Hasson T. Regulation of myosin-VI targeting to endocytic compartments.Traffic. 2004; 5: 798-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Given the weak binding of Dab2 with myosin VI, we wanted to examine the effect of processive myosin VI movement on reorganization of a dense actin network. To mimic the cellular actin network, we assembled a minimal actin cortex (MAC) on a supported lipid bilayer to examine the effects of motor movement on actin organization (Fig. 6A) (31Vogel S.K. Petrasek Z. Heinemann F. Schwille P. Myosin motors fragment and compact membrane-bound actin filaments.Elife. 2013; 2013: 1-18Google Scholar, 32Vogel S.K. Heinemann F. Chwastek G. Schwille P. The design of MACs (minimal actin cortices).Cytoskeleton. 2013; 70: 706-717Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Constitutively dimerized HMM dimer of myosin VI causes a drastic reorganization of the MAC, resulting in the formation of actin foci, whereas monomeric myosin VI was unable to form actin foci (Fig. 6, B–C; Movies S4 and S5). To further understand the mechanistic basis of actin foci formation, we performed two-color imaging of actin and myosin VI in the actin remodeling assay. The HMM dimer but not the monomer displayed a centripetal accumulation toward the center of the actin foci (Fig. 6, B–C; Movies S6 and S7). The correlation between myosin accumulation and foci formation suggests that the actin remodeling of MAC is driven by dimeric, processive myosin VI. To expand these observations to Dab2, we performed the assays with full-length myosin VI and Dab2 MIR (Fig. 7A). Dimeric myosin VI HMM was able to cause the formation of actin foci only in the presence of ATP and not in its absence or the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue (AMP-PNP, Fig. 7B). The requirement for ATP suggests that processive myosin VI movement mediates actin foci formation. The processive dimeric myosin V, which moves in the opposite direction as myosin VI (myosin V – plus-end; myosin VI – minus-end), was also able to generate actin foci (Fig. 7B). In contrast, full-length myosin VI was unable to form foci by itself (Fig. 7B). These findings suggest that a constitutive dimeric myosin is sufficient to drive actin foci formation. However, while in complex with Dab2 MIR, full-length myosin VI was observed to generate foci, although significantly fewer than observed with dimeric myosin VI (Fig. 7, B–C). Taken together, these data suggest that the dynamic interaction of myosin VI with Dab2 results in an equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric states of myosin VI that allows for processive motor movement on a dense actin network without significant remodeling of the underlying cytoskeletal network (Fig. 8).Figure 7Dynamic adaptor–motor interactions preserve actin organization in a minimal actin cortex.

Despite the high turnover of the motor–adaptor interaction, Dab2–myosin VI ensembles retain sufficient acto–myosin interactions to maintain long-range processive movement on a cellular actin network. Interestingly, weak binding of Dab2 to myosin VI is necessary to minimize disruption of a minimal actin cortex resulting from the unregulated motor dimerization. Our findings suggest that dynamic multimerization of myosin VI by Dab2 tunes processive endosomal transport in cells. Homo-dimerization of myosin VI has been a contentious issue (16Spudich J.A. Sivaramakrishnan S. Myosin VI: an innovative motor that challenged the swinging lever arm hypothesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), with initial studies identifying potential dimerization motifs within the full-length motor (33Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. Porcine myosin-VI: characterization of a new mammalian unconventional myosin.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and later studies confirming that full-length myosin VI was incapable of dimerizing on its own and needed cargo-assisted dimerization to function as a processive motor (34Lister I.

Our previous study showed that continuous auditory biofeedback was more effective than continuous visual biofeedback to improve postural sway while standing. However, it has also been reported that both discrete visual and auditory biofeedback training, presented intermittently, improves bimanual task performance more than continuous visual biofeedback training. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relative effectiveness of discrete visual biofeedback versus discrete auditory biofeedback to improve postural control. Twenty-two healthy young adults were randomly assigned to either a visual or auditory biofeedback group. Participants were asked to shift their center of pressure (COP) by voluntary postural sway forward and backward in line with a hidden target, which moved in a sinusoidal manner and was displayed intermittently. Participants were asked to decrease the diameter of a visual circle (visual biofeedback) or the volume of a sound (auditory biofeedback) based on the distance between the COP and the target in the training session. The feedback and the target were given only when the target reached the inflection points of the sine curves. In addition, the perceptual magnitudes of visual and auditory biofeedback were equalized using Stevens’ power law. Results showed that the mean and standard deviation of the distance between COP and the target were reduced int the test session, removing the augmented sensory biofeedback, in both biofeedback training groups. However, the temporal domain of the performance improved in the test session in the auditory biofeedback training group, but not in the visual biofeedback training group. In conclusion, discrete auditory biofeedback training was more effective for the motor learning of voluntarily postural swaying compared to discrete visual biofeedback training, especially in the temporal domain."

However, knowledge of the molecular mechanism underlying high temperature promotes premature bolting is lacking. In this study, we compared lettuce during the bolting period induced by high temperatures (33/25 °C, day/night) to which raised under controlled temperatures (20/13 °C, day/night) using iTRAQ-based phosphoproteomic analysis. A total of 3,814 phosphorylation sites located on 1,766 phosphopeptides from 987 phosphoproteins were identified after high-temperature treatment,among which 217 phosphoproteins significantly changed their expression abundance (116 upregulated and 101 downregulated). Most phosphoproteins for which the abundance was altered were associated with the metabolic process, with the main molecular functions were catalytic activity and transporter activity. Regarding the functional pathway, starch and sucrose metabolism was the mainly enriched signaling pathways. Hence, high temperature influenced phosphoprotein activity, especially that associated with starch and sucrose metabolism. We suspected that the lettuce shorten its growth cycle and reduce vegetative growth owing to changes in the contents of starch and soluble sugar after high temperature stress, which then led to early bolting/flowering. These findings improve our understanding of the regulatory molecular mechanisms involved in lettuce bolting."
https://openalex.org/W3118081515,"Urban grasslands are usually managed as short-cut lawns and have limited biodiversity. Urban grasslands with low-intensity management are species rich and can perform numerous ecosystem services, but they are not accepted by citizens everywhere. Further, increasing and/or maintaining a relatively high level of plant species richness in an urban environment is limited by restricted plant dispersal. In this study, we examined the connectivity of urban grasslands and prioritized the grassland patches with regard to their role in connectivity in an urban landscape. We used high-resolution data from a land use system to map grassland patches in Wrocław city, Silesia, southwest Poland, Central Europe, and applied a graph theory approach to assess their connectivity and prioritization. We next constructed a model for several dispersal distance thresholds (2, 20, 44, 100, and 1000 m), reflecting plants with differing dispersal potential. Our results revealed low connectivity of urban grassland patches, especially for plants with low dispersal ability (2–20 m). The priority of patches was correlated with their area for all dispersal distance thresholds. Most of the large patches important to overall connectivity were located in urban peripheries, while in the city center, connectivity was more restricted and grassland area per capita was the lowest. The presence of a river created a corridor, allowing plants to migrate along watercourse, but it also created a barrier dividing the system. The results suggest that increasing the plant species richness in urban grasslands in the city center requires seed addition."

Their deficiency is responsible for the conjunctivization of the cornea that is seen in different ocular pathologies, both in humans and in the canine species. The canine species represents an interesting preclinical animal model in ocular surface pathologies. However, the role of LSCs in physiological and pathological conditions in canine species is not well understood. Our objective was to characterize for the first time the soluble factors and the proteomic profile of the secretome and exosomes of canine LSCs (cLSCs). In addition, given the important role that fibroblasts play in the repair of the ocular surface, we evaluated the influence of the secretome and exosomes of cLSCs on their proliferation in vitro. Our results demonstrated a secretory profile of cLSCs with high concentrations of MCP-1, IL-8, VEGF-A, and IL-10, as well as significant production of exosomes. Regarding the proteomic profile, 646 total proteins in the secretome and 356 in exosomes were involved in different biological processes. Functionally, the cLSC secretome showed an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of fibroblasts in vitro, which the exosomes did not. These results open the door to new studies on the possible use of the cLSC secretome or some of its components to treat certain pathologies of the ocular surface in canine species."

Injected mice were subjected to short term (3 weeks) treadmill running, specifically moderate treadmill running (MTR) and intensive treadmill running (ITR). In MTR mice, both GFP-TSC and GFP-TNC injected tendons maintained normal cell morphology with elevated expression of tendon related markers collagen I and tenomodulin. In ITR mice injected with GFP-TNCs, cells also maintained an elongated shape similar to the shape found in normal/untreated control mice, as well as elevated expression of tendon related markers. However, ITR mice injected with GFP-TSCs showed abnormal changes, such as cell morphology transitioning to a round shape, elevated chondrogenic differentiation, and increased gene expression of non-tenocyte related genes LPL, Runx-2, and SOX-9. Increased gene expression data was supported by immunostaining showing elevated expression of SOX-9, Runx-2, and PPARγ. This study provides evidence that while MTR maintains tendon homeostasis by promoting the differentiation of TSCs into TNCs, ITR causes the onset of tendinopathy development by inducing non-tenocyte differentiation of TSCs, which may eventually lead to the formation of non-tendinous tissues in tendon tissue after long term mechanical overloading conditions on the tendon."
https://openalex.org/W3117867564,"Activation of the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) contributes to the aversive properties of stress, and modulates key neuronal circuits underlying many neurobehavioral disorders. KOR agonists directly inhibit ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, contributing to aversive responses (Margolis et al. 2003, 2006); therefore, selective KOR antagonists represent a novel therapeutic approach to restore circuit function. We used whole cell electrophysiology in acute rat midbrain slices to evaluate pharmacological properties of four novel KOR antagonists: BTRX-335140, BTRX-395750, PF-04455242, and JNJ-67953964. Each compound concentration-dependently reduced the outward current induced by the KOR selective agonist U-69,593. BTRX-335140 and BTRX-395750 fully blocked U-69,593 currents (IC 50 = 1.2 ± 0.9 and 1.2 ± 1.3 nM, respectively). JNJ-67953964 showed an IC 50 of 3.0 ± 4.6 nM. PF-04455242 exhibited partial antagonist activity asymptoting at 55% blockade (IC 50 = 6.7 ± 15.1 nM). In 3/8 of neurons, 1 μM PF-04455242 generated an outward current independent of KOR activation. BTRX-335140 (10 nM) did not affect responses to saturating concentrations of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist DAMGO or the delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonist DPDPE, while JNJ-67953964 (10 nM) partially blocked DAMGO and DPDPE responses. Importantly, BTRX-335140 (10 nM) rapidly washed out with complete recovery of U-69,593 responses within 10 min. Collectively, we show electrophysiological evidence of key differences amongst KOR antagonists that could impact their therapeutic potential and have not been observed using recombinant systems. The results of this study demonstrate the value of characterizing compounds in native neuronal tissue and within circuits implicated in the neurobehavioral disorders of interest."

A non-parametric technique known as Data Envelopment Analysis is applied to investigate the Partner Organizations' efficiency throughout 2005–2015. The required data was obtained from the database of the Mix-Market and Pakistan Microfinance Network. The social and financial efficiency was estimated assuming Constant Return to Scale, Variable Return to Scale, and with respect to the Operational Scale of the Partner Organizations. Results revealed that the partner organizations are more scale efficient (median = 75%) than pure technically efficient (median = 55%). Further, graphical representations show a decreasing linear trend and negative serial correlation in the percentage of efficient partner organizations. The model fit results show that institutional characteristics that influence partner organizations' efficiencies significantly include their age, Operational Self-Sufficiency, personnel, loan officers, assets and debt. Finally, the diagnostic tests for endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, heterogeneity, and cross-sectional dependence were performed."
https://openalex.org/W3118043377,"Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) is considered the most frequent congenital malformations of the head and neck, with cleft individuals exhibiting more chances of presenting abnormalities such as developmental defects of enamel (DDE). Matrix metallopeptidase 2 ( MMP2 ) is a membrane-bound protein with collagen-degrading ability and has important roles in tooth formation and mineralization. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency, location, severity and extent of DDE found in the maxillary incisors for groups of individuals born with CLP, as well as understanding their relationship with the cleft side. Besides, this study addresses the hypothesis that DDE can be influenced by variation in the MMP2 genes (rs9923304). Individual samples, clinical history, intraoral photographs and panoramic radiographs were obtained from 233 patients under treatment at the Cleft Lip and Palate Service of the University Hospital Lauro Wanderley at the Federal University of Paraíba. Digital images were examined by the same evaluator using the Classification of Defects According to the Modified DDE Index, and then loaded into the Image Tool software, where two measurements were made: total area of the buccal surface (SA) and the area of the DDE (DA), obtaining the percentage of the surface area affected (%SAD) (ICC = 0.99). Genomic DNA was extracted from saliva samples from 124 participants. Genotyping was carried out using TaqMan chemistry for one marker in MMP2 (rs9923304). Statistical analyses were performed by The Jamovi Project software. The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied, followed by the Student’s t-test and the Mann-Whitney test. Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests, and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) calculations were used to determine Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and statistically significant differences with an alpha of 0.05. No significant differences in the prevalence and extent of enamel defects were found between male and female individuals born with CLP (p = 0.058256). The frequency of individuals presenting teeth with DDE, in relation to the cleft and non-cleft side, was statistically different (p &lt;0.001; OR = 7.15, CI: 4.674&gt; 7.151&gt; 10.942). However, the averages of %SAD were similar (p = 0.18). The highest means of the %SAD were found in individuals with bilateral cleft lip with or without cleft palate (BCLP) when compared to individuals with unilateral cleft lip with or without cleft palate (UCLP), for the teeth inside (IA) and outside the cleft area (OA) (p &lt;0.001). Regardless of the cleft side, individuals with BCLP were 7.85 times more likely to have more than one third of the tooth surface affected, showing more frequently defects in the three thirds (OA: p &lt;0.001) (IA: p = 0.03), as well as a higher frequency of more than one type of defect (OA: p = 0.000358) (IA: p = 0.008016), whereas in UCLP, defects were isolated and restricted to only one third, more frequently, the incisal third (OA: p = 0.009) (IA: p = 0.001), with greater frequency of milder defects, such as demarcated (p = 0.02) and diffuse (p = 0.008) opacities. A higher frequency of the T allele, less common, was observed in the group of CLP individuals who had all the affected teeth or at least two teeth with %SAD greater than 20% (p = 0.019843). Our results suggest that MMP2 may have a role in the cases that presented DDE and genotyping rs9923304 could serve as the basis for a genomic approach to define risks for individuals born with CLP. Frequency and severity of DDE is strongly related to the CLP phenotype, since the highest values were found for BCLP. However, the extent of the DDE is independent of its relationship with the side of the cleft."
https://openalex.org/W3113667044,"Approaches for systematizing information of relatedness between organisms is important in biology. Phylogenetic analyses based on sets of highly conserved genes are currently the basis for the Tree of Life. Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions contain high-quality information regarding the metabolic capability of an organism and are typically restricted to metabolically active enzyme-encoding genes. While there are many tools available to generate draft reconstructions, expert-level knowledge is still required to generate and manually curate high-quality genome-scale metabolic models and to fill gaps in their reaction networks. Here, we use the tool AutoKEGGRec to construct 975 genome-scale metabolic draft reconstructions encoded in the KEGG database without further curation. The organisms are selected across all three domains, and their metabolic networks serve as basis for generating phylogenetic trees. We find that using all reactions encoded, these metabolism-based comparisons give rise to a phylogenetic tree with close similarity to the Tree of Life. While this tree is quite robust to reasonable levels of noise in the metabolic reaction content of an organism, we find a significant heterogeneity in how much noise an organism may tolerate before it is incorrectly placed in the tree. Furthermore, by using the protein sequences for particular metabolic functions and pathway sets, such as central carbon-, nitrogen-, and sulfur-metabolism, as basis for the organism comparisons, we generate highly specific phylogenetic trees. We believe the generation of phylogenetic trees based on metabolic reaction content, in particular when focused on specific functions and pathways, could aid the identification of functionally important metabolic enzymes and be of value for genome-scale metabolic modellers and enzyme-engineers."
https://openalex.org/W3113918231,"Purpose &amp; methods Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the TNF-α gene can cause variations in the gene regulatory sites and act as risk factors for some autoimmune disorders as alopecia areata (AA) and vitiligo. This study aimed to detect the serum TNF-α (sTNF) level (by ELISA) and the rs1800629 (by real-time PCR) among AA and vitiligo Egyptian patients and to determine their relation with disease duration and severity. In silico analysis of this SNP to study the molecular regulation of the mutant genotypes was also done. Results In AA patients, no risk was associated with the mutant genotypes vs . the normal genotype, or with A allele vs . G allele. The risk of vitiligo was significantly higher with the G/A and A/A genotypes compared with HCs ( p = 0.011). Similarly, a significantly increased risk was noted in patients with A allele vs . G allele (p &lt;0.0001). In AA and vitiligo patients, a significant increase in sTNF-α levels was noted in the mutant G/A genotypes vs . the normal G/G genotype ( p &lt;0.0001) and in the A allele vs the G allele (p &lt;0.0001). According to the in silico analysis, this SNP could mainly affect the SP1 transcription factor binding site with subsequent effect on TNF-α expression. Conclusion According to results of the laboratory and the in silico study, the mutant TNF-α (308) genotypes were risk factors that conferred susceptibility to vitiligo among Egyptian patients but had no effect on the susceptibility to AA."
https://openalex.org/W3116174693,"Background Little attention has been paid to whether CBHIs improve awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in the contexts of low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). This study therefore aims to examine participation in CBHIs for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and its association with awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension among Indonesians. Methods This study used data from the 2014 Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), drawn from 30,351 respondents aged 18 years and older. Participation in CBHIs was measured by respondents’ participation in CBHIs for NCDs ( Posbindu PTM and Posbindu Lansia ) during the 12 months prior to the survey. Logistic regressions were used to identify the relationships between participation in CBHIs for NCDs and awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure among respondents with hypertension. Results The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 31.2% and 29.2% in urban and rural areas, respectively. The overall age-adjusted prevalence was 30.2%. Approximately 41.8% of respondents with hypertension were aware of their condition, and only 6.6% of respondents were receiving treatment. Participation in CBHIs for NCDs was associated with 50% higher odds of being aware and 118% higher odds of receiving treatment among adults with hypertension. There was no significant association between participation in CBHIs for NCDs and controlled hypertension. Conclusion Our data emphasise the importance of CBHIs for NCDs to improve the awareness and treatment of hypertension in the Indonesian population."
https://openalex.org/W3115073966,"The Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring individuals’ intercultural competences. The original version consists of 91 items, divided into five subscales, and has been shown to predict attitudes, behavior, and outcomes in a variety of intercultural contexts. Recently, a 40-item short form of the MPQ was developed (MPQ-SF), which may be particularly useful in settings in which time or survey space are limited, or where respondent drop-out is likely to occur. For example, the MPQ-SF would be a valuable tool for assessing longitudinal development of multicultural personality traits in training or educational settings. A prerequisite for such research is to establish measurement invariance of the MPQ-SF between different respondent groups, as well as across time points. Using a sample of students in an international university program ( n = 519), the present study examines how the scales perform among male and female respondents, between students of Western and Non-Western background, and across two time points, five months apart. Based on our findings, we conclude that all five subscales of the MPQ-SF display sufficient measurement invariance to be reliably used in this and similar contexts, in comparative as well as longitudinal study designs."

In China, adulteration of donkey meat products with the similar species (horse and mule/hinny) meat and mislabeling are becoming widespread concerns. In this study, a sensitive and species-specific duplex real-time PCR assay based on the simultaneous amplification of fragments of the creatine kinase muscle gene family, was developed and optimized for the identification of horse, donkey and mule /hinny species in raw and heat-processed meat products. Duplex real-time PCR results showed different fluorescence amplification curves for horse and donkey. Both kinds of fluorescence amplification curves appeared simultaneously for mule/hinny. The limit of detection (LOD) of the method was up to 0.01 ng /μL. The method and strategy developed in this study could be applied to detect the presence of adulterants from horse and mule /hinny meat in raw donkey meat and meat products."
https://openalex.org/W3115494711,"With the outbreak of COVID-19, the importance of rural areas has been gradually highlighted, and the importance of rural ecological livability has been gradually recognized. A growing body of literature recognizes the importance of building a rural ecological livability (REL) system. It is urgent that we clarify the status quo and spatial-temporal differences in and distributional characteristics of rural ecological livability and that we carry out targeted and differentiated construction to promote rural ecological livability in post-epidemic China. This study proposes a conceptual model that incorporates various economic, social and environmental factors and develops a comprehensive multifactor (production-living-ecology) evaluation system. Using Fujian Province as an example, the entropy weight method is used to measure the REL level of 55 counties and cities, which are comprehensively evaluated from 2015 to 2019. Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* are used to analyze the spatial and distributional characteristics of the REL level in Fujian. The results show that the level of REL in Fujian Province has been relatively flat over the past five years, with a slight downward trend. The overall value of the rural ecological livability index in 2015 was 0.345, and its overall value in 2019 was 0.334, with an average value of 0.343. The REL of Fujian Province is spatially correlated, with high levels of livability in the southeast and low levels in the northeast. The autocorrelation in the level of ecological livability in Fujian's counties and cities continues to increase."
https://openalex.org/W3035381268,"Use of seed-applied fungicides has become commonplace in the United States soybean production systems. Although fungicides have the potential to protect seed/seedlings from critical early stage diseases such as damping-off and root/stem rots, results from previous studies are not consistent in terms of seed-applied fungicide’s ability to mitigate yield losses. In the current study, the relationship between estimated soybean production losses due to seedling diseases and estimated seed-applied fungicide use was investigated using annual data from 28 soybean growing states in the U.S. over the period of 2006 to 2014. National, regional (northern and southern U.S.), state, and temporal scale trends were explored using mixed effects version of the regression analysis. Mixed modeling allowed computing generalized R 2 values for conditional ( R 2 GLMM( c ) ; contains fixed and random effects) and marginal ( R 2 GLMM( m ) ; contains only fixed effects) models. Similar analyses were conducted to investigate how soybean production was related to fungicide use. National and regional scale modeling revealed that R 2 GLMM( c ) values were significantly larger compared to R 2 GLMM( m ) values, meaning fungicide use had limited utility in explaining the national/regional scale variation of yield loss and production. The state scale analysis revealed the usefulness of seed-applied fungicides to mitigate seedling diseases-associated soybean yield losses in Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, and Ohio. Further, fungicide use positively influenced the soybean production and yield in Illinois and South Dakota. Taken together, use of seed-applied fungicide did not appear to be beneficial to many of the states. Our findings corroborate the observations made by a number of scientists through field scale seed-applied fungicide trials across the U.S and reiterate the importance of need base-use of seed-applied fungicides rather than being a routine practice in soybean production systems."
https://openalex.org/W3113813636,"Background Smoking cigarette/bidi, is a serious health threat, causes preventable premature morbidity and mortality. Higher prevalence of smoking among the youth hampers a country’s development, as the youth are the main drivers of socio-economic development. An effective understanding of factors associated with youth smoking is precious to prevent youth smoking. This study aims to identify the determinants of smoking cigarette/bidi among the youth male of the rural areas of Mymensingh district in Bangladesh. Methods The primary data from the project “Knowledge, awareness and practices among youth smokers in Trishal Upazila under Mymensingh district: A micro-survey study”, funded by the Research and Extension Center, Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University, Bangladesh was utilized in the current study. The data consists of 385 youth males aged 15–24 years who were interviewed face-to-face from the rural areas of Mymensingh district in Bangladesh. Univariate distribution, chi-square tests, and binary logistic regression model were employed to identify the factors associated with smoking cigarette/bidi among the youth male. Results The prevalence of smoking cigarette/bidi among the youth male is 40.3% [95% CI: 35.0%-45.0%]. Age, occupation, monthly income, family’s monthly income, cigarette/bidi smoking status of father, brother and close friends, and knowledge about harmfulness of smoking are revealed as the determinants of cigarette/bidi smoking. For instance, the odds of being smoker increases with the increase in age (Odds ratio [OR]: 1.33 [1.17–1.51]). Business owner is less likely (OR: 0.15 [0.03–0.68]) to smoke than the day labourer. Having smoker fathers (OR: 2.51 [1.39–4.53]), smoker brothers (OR: 2.88 [1.39–5.96]), smoker friends (OR: 9.85 [5.85–1.27]) are significantly associated with smoking cigarette/bidi. Conclusion As the first study, it provides the determinants of cigarette/bidi smoking among youth male of the rural areas of Mymensingh district in Bangladesh. Relevant authorities are suggested to consider the study’s findings and recommendations to revise the existing smoking policies so that smoking among youth can be prevented for future development of the country."
https://openalex.org/W3114367932,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the age of trees, daily sap volume as well as the term of tapping birch sap collected in the forest environment on the content of selected minerals (zinc, copper and manganese) and heavy metals (lead, nickel, chromium and cadmium). The study was performed on material taken from two stands (aged 34 and 84 years) in a moist broadleaved forest habitat with a dominant share of silver birch ( Betula pendula Roth). The research results confirmed the presence of both nutritional essential minerals and hazardous heavy metals in the birch sap. At the same time, the content of minerals and heavy metals was found to be very variable and the differences between their concentrations, recorded on the same day of collecting in several trees of the same age group, can be even several dozen times higher. Depending on the examined elements, the factors influencing their content vary. The age of the trees determines only the manganese content; daily sap volume significantly affects the content of manganese and copper, and date of collection differentiates the content of zinc, lead, nickel and cadmium. The results may be interesting in the context of developing procedures for collecting birch sap for the purpose of obtaining raw material with beneficial nutritional values and a high level of health safety. For this reason, our recommendation for guaranteeing the health safety and high nutritional value of birch sap is to combine batches of raw material taken from as many trees as possible, and at the same time to publicize the fact that collecting birch sap from just one single tree may result in a raw material that is both dangerous and has no nutritional benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3114703365,"Background The clinical presentation of neck-arm pain is heterogeneous with varying underlying pain types (nociceptive/neuropathic/mixed) and pain mechanisms (peripheral/central sensitization). A mechanism-based clinical framework for spinally referred pain has been proposed, which classifies into (1) somatic pain, (2) neural mechanosensitivity, (3) radicular pain, (4) radiculopathy and mixed pain presentations. This study aims to (i) investigate the application of the clinical framework in patients with neck-arm pain, (ii) determine their somatosensory, clinical and psychosocial profile and (iii) observe their clinical course over time. Method We describe a study protocol. Patients with unilateral neck-arm pain (n = 180) will undergo a clinical examination, after which they will be classified into subgroups according to the proposed clinical framework. Standardized quantitative sensory testing (QST) measurements will be taken in their main pain area and contralateral side. Participants will have to complete questionnaires to assess function (Neck Disability Index), psychosocial factors (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Depression, anxiety and stress scale), neuropathic pain (Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions, Pain DETECT Questionnaire) and central sensitization features (Central Sensitization Inventory). Follow-ups at three, six and 12 months include the baseline questionnaires. The differences of QST data and questionnaire outcomes between and within groups will be analyzed using (M)AN(C)OVA and/or regression models. Repeated measurement analysis of variance or a linear mixed model will be used to calculate the differences between three, six, and 12 months outcomes. Multiple regression models will be used to analyze potential predictors for the clinical course. Conclusion The rationale for this study is to assess the usability and utility of the proposed clinical framework as well as to identify possible differing somatosensory and psychosocial phenotypes between the subgroups. This could increase our knowledge of the underlying pain mechanisms. The longitudinal analysis may help to assess possible predictors for pain persistency."
https://openalex.org/W3116299899,"Microbial communities associated with freshwater aquatic habitats and resident species are both critical to and indicative of ecosystem status and organismal health. External surfaces of turtle shells readily accumulate microbial growth and could carry representation of habitat-wide microbial diversity, since they are in regular contact with multiple elements of freshwater environments. Yet, microbial diversity residing on freshwater turtle shells is poorly understood. We applied 16S and 18S metabarcoding to characterize microbiota associated with external shell surfaces of 20 red-eared slider ( Trachemys scripta ) turtles collected from varied habitats in central and western Oklahoma, and ranging to southeast Iowa. Shell-associated microbial communities were highly diverse, with samples dominated by Bacteroidia and alpha-/gamma-proteobacteria, and ciliophoran alveolates. Alpha diversity was lower on turtle shells compared to shallow-water-associated environmental samples, likely resulting from basking-drying behavior and seasonal scute shedding, while alpha diversity was higher on carapace than plastron surfaces. Beta diversity of turtle shells was similarly differentiated from environmental samples, although sampling site was consistently a significant factor. Deinococcus-Thermus bacteria and ciliophoran alveolates were recovered with significantly higher abundance on turtle shells versus environmental samples, while bacterial taxa known to include human-pathogenic species were variably more abundant between shell and environmental samples. Microbial communities from a single, shared-site collection of the ecologically similar river cooter ( P . concinna ) largely overlapped with those of T . scripta . These data add to a foundation for further characterization of turtle shell microbial communities across species and habitats, with implications for freshwater habitat assessment, microbial ecology and wildlife conservation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3116963203,"Numerous cropping systems of the world are experiencing the emergence of new weed species in response to conservation agriculture. Conyza stricta Willd. is being a newly emerging weed of barley-based cropping systems in response to conservational tillage practices. Seed germination ecology of four populations (irrigated, rainfed, abandoned and ruderal habitats) was studied in laboratory and greenhouse experiments. The presence/absence of seed dormancy was inferred first, which indicated seeds were non-dormant. Seed germination was then recorded under various photoperiods, constant and alternating day/night temperatures, and pH, salinity and osmotic potential levels. Seedling emergence was observed from various seed burial depths. Seeds of all populations proved photoblastic and required 12-hour light/dark period for germination. Seeds of all populations germinated under 5–30°C constant temperature; however, peak germination was recorded under 17.22–18.11°C. Nonetheless, the highest germination was noted under 20/15°C alternating day/night temperature. Ruderal and irrigated populations better tolerated salinity and germinated under 0–500 mM salinity. Similarly, rainfed population proved more tolerant to osmotic potential than other populations. Seeds of all populations required neutral pH for the highest germination, whereas decline was noted in germination under basic and alkaline pH. Seedling emergence was retarded for seeds buried &gt;2 cm depth and no emergence was recorded from &gt;4 cm depth. These results add valuable information towards our understanding of seed germination ecology of C . stricta . Seed germination ability of different populations under diverse environmental conditions suspects that the species can present severe challenges in future if not managed. Deep seed burial along with effective management of the emerging seedlings seems a pragmatic option to manage the species in cultivated fields. However, immediate management strategies are needed for rest of the habitats."
https://openalex.org/W3117121327,"Objectives To determine rates of annual and durable retention in medical care and viral suppression among patients enrolled in the Peter Ho Clinic, from 2013–2017. Methods This is a retrospective review of medical record data in an urban clinic, located in Newark, New Jersey, a high prevalence area of persons living with HIV. Viral load data were electronically downloaded, in rolling 1-year intervals, in two-month increments, from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2019. Three teams were established, and every two months, they were provided with an updated list of patients with virologic failure. Retention and viral suppression rates were first calculated for each calendar-year. After patients were determined to be retained/suppressed annually, the proportion of patients with durable retention and viral suppression were calculated in two, three, four, five and six-year periods. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sample characteristics by retention in care, virologic failure and viral suppression with Pearson Chi-square; p-value &lt;0.05 was statistically significant. Multiple logistic regression models identified patient characteristics associated with retention in medical care, virologic failure and suppression. Results As of December 31, 2017, 1000 (57%) patients were retained in medical care of whom 870 (87%) were suppressed. Between 2013 and 2016, decreases in annual (85% to 77%) and durable retention in care were noted: two-year (72% to 70%) and three-year (63% to 59%) periods. However, increases were noted for 2017, in annual (89%) and durable retention in the two-year period (79%). In the adjusted model, when compared to current patients, retention in care was less likely among patients reengaging in medical care (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 0.77, 95% CI: 0.61–0.98) but more likely among those newly diagnosed from 2014–2017 (aOR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.08–2.29), compared to those in care since 2013. A higher proportion of patients re-engaging in medical care had virologic failure than current patients (56% vs. 47%, p &lt; 0.0001). As age decreased, virologic failure was more likely (p&lt;0.0001). Between 2013 and 2017, increases in annual (74% to 87%) and durable viral suppression were noted: two-year (59% to 73%) and three-year (49% to 58%) periods. Viral suppression was more likely among patients retained in medical care up to 2017 versus those who were not (aOR: 5.52, 95% CI: 4.08–7.46). Those less likely to be suppressed were 20–29 vs. 60 years or older (aOR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28–0.97), had public vs. private insurance (aOR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.15–0.55) and public vs. private housing (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40–0.87). Conclusions Restructuring clinical services at this urban clinic was associated with improved viral suppression. However, concurrent interventions to ensure retention in medical care were not implemented. Both retention in care and viral suppression interventions should be implemented in tandem to achieve an end to the epidemic. Retention in care and viral suppression should be measured longitudinally, instead of cross-sectional yearly evaluations, to capture dynamic changes in these indicators."
https://openalex.org/W3117178630,"Several studies have shown that child maltreatment is associated with both positive and negative effects on the recognition of facial emotions. Research has provided little evidence of a relation between maltreatment during childhood and young adults’ ability to recognize facial displays of emotion in children, an essential skill for a sensitive parental response. In this study, we examined the consequences of different forms of maltreatment experienced in childhood on emotion recognition during parenthood. Participants included sixty-three mothers of children aged 2 to 5 years. Retrospective self-reports of childhood maltreatment were assessed using the short form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Emotion recognition was measured using a morphed facial emotion identification task of all six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise). A Path Analysis via Structural Equation Model revealed that a history of physical abuse is related to a decreased ability to recognize both fear and sadness in children, whereas emotional abuse and sexual abuse are related to a decreased ability to recognize anger in children. In addition, emotional neglect is associated with an increased ability to recognize anger, whereas physical neglect is associated with less accuracy in recognizing happiness in children’s facial emotional expressions. These findings have important clinical implications and expand current understanding of the consequences of childhood maltreatment on parents’ ability to detect children’s needs."
https://openalex.org/W3114463277,"Adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) are critical mediators of vascular remodeling. However, the contributions of AFs towards development of vasculature and the specific mechanisms by which these cells regulate physiological expansion of the vasa vasorum, the specialized microvasculature that supplies nutrients to the vascular wall, are not well understood. To determine the regulatory role of AFs in microvascular endothelial cell (MVEC) neovasculogenesis and to investigate the regulatory pathways utilized for communication between the two cell types, AFs and MVECs were cultured together in poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogels. Following preliminary evaluation of a set of cell adhesion peptides (AG10, AG73, A2G78, YIGSR, RGD), 7.5wt% hydrogels containing 3 mM RGD were selected as these substrates did not initiate primitive tubule structures in 3D MVEC monocultures, thus providing a passive platform to study AF-MVEC interaction. The addition of AFs to hydrogels promoted MVEC viability; however, increasing AF density within hydrogels stimulated MVEC proliferation, increased microvessel density and size, and enhanced deposition of basement membrane proteins, collagen IV and laminin. Importantly, AF-MVEC communication through the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)/activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) signaling pathway was observed to mediate microvessel formation, as inhibition of ALK5 significantly decreased MVEC proliferation, microvessel formation, mural cell recruitment, and basement membrane production. These data indicate that AFs regulate MVEC neovasculogenesis and suggest that therapeutics targeting the TGF-β/ALK5 pathway may be useful for regulation of vasculogenic and anti-vasculogenic responses."

https://openalex.org/W3114607071,"Identification of the target genes of microRNAs (miRNAs), trans -acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is an important step for understanding their regulatory roles in plants. In recent years, many bioinformatics software packages based on small RNA (sRNA) high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and degradome sequencing data analysis have provided strong technical support for large-scale mining of sRNA-target pairs. However, sRNA-target regulation is achieved using a complex network of interactions since one transcript might be co-regulated by multiple sRNAs and one sRNA may also affect multiple targets. Currently used mining software can realize the mining of multiple unknown targets using known sRNA, but it cannot rule out the possibility of co-regulation of the same target by other unknown sRNAs. Hence, the obtained regulatory network may be incomplete. We have developed a new mining software, sRNATargetDigger, that includes two function modules, “Forward Digger” and “Reverse Digger”, which can identify regulatory sRNA-target pairs bidirectionally. Moreover, it has the ability to identify unknown sRNAs co-regulating the same target, in order to obtain a more authentic and reliable sRNA-target regulatory network. Upon re-examination of the published sRNA-target pairs in Arabidopsis thaliana , sRNATargetDigger found 170 novel co-regulatory sRNA-target pairs.

https://openalex.org/W3114837719,"Using maps effectively requires the ability to scale distances while preserving angle and orientation, the three properties of Euclidean geometry. The aim of the current study was twofold: first, to examine how the ability to represent and use these Euclidean properties changes with development when scaling maps in object-to-object relationships and, second, to explore the effects on the scaling performance of two variables of the array of objects, type of angular configuration and relative vector length. To this end, we tested seventy-five 4-, 6-, and 8-year-old children, as well as twenty-five adults, in a simple completion task with different linear and triangular configurations of objects. This study revealed important developmental changes between 4 and 6 years of age and between 8 years of age and adulthood for both distance and angle representation, while it also showed that the configuration variables affected younger and older children’s performances in different ways when scaling distances and preserving angles and orientation. This study was instrumental in showing that, from an early age, children are able to exploit an intrinsic system of reference to scale geometrical configurations of objects."
https://openalex.org/W3116535321,"We consider the problem of constructing a complete set of parameters that account for all of the degrees of freedom for point-biserial variation. We devise an algorithm where sort as an intrinsic property of both numbers and labels, is used to generate the parameters. Algebraically, point-biserial variation is represented by a Cartesian product of statistical parameters for two sets of <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant=""double-struck"">R</mml:mi> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math> data, and the difference between mean values ( δ ) corresponds to the representation of variation in the center of mass coordinates, ( δ , μ ). The existence of alternative effect size measures is explained by the fact that mathematical considerations alone do not specify a preferred coordinate system for the representation of point-biserial variation. We develop a novel algorithm for estimating the nonoverlap proportion ( ρ pb ) of two sets of <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M2""><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant=""double-struck"">R</mml:mi> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math> data. ρ pb is obtained by sorting the labeled <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M3""><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant=""double-struck"">R</mml:mi> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math> data and analyzing the induced order in the categorical data using a diagonally symmetric 2 × 2 contingency table. We examine the correspondence between ρ pb and point-biserial correlation ( r pb ) for uniform and normal distributions. We identify the <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M4""><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant=""double-struck"">R</mml:mi> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math> , <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M5""><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant=""double-struck"">P</mml:mi> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math> , and <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M6""><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant=""double-struck"">S</mml:mi> <mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:math> representations for Pearson product-moment correlation, Cohen’s d , and r pb . We compare the performance of r pb versus ρ pb and the sample size proportion corrected correlation ( r pbd ), confirm that invariance with respect to the sample size proportion is important in the formulation of the effect size, and give an example where three parameters ( r pbd , μ , ρ pb ) are needed to distinguish different forms of point-biserial variation in CART regression tree analysis. We discuss the importance of providing an assessment of cost-benefit trade-offs between relevant system parameters because ‘substantive significance’ is specified by mapping functional or engineering requirements into the effect size coordinates. Distributions and confidence intervals for the statistical parameters are obtained using Monte Carlo methods."
https://openalex.org/W3117246411,"The shape of the male genitalia in many taxa is the most rapidly evolving morphological structure, often driving reproductive isolation, and is therefore widely used in systematics as a key character to distinguish between sibling species. However, only a few studies have used the genital arch of the male copulatory organ as a model to study the genetic basis of species-specific differences in the Drosophila copulatory system. Moreover, almost nothing is known about the effects of the sex chromosomes on the shape of the male mating organ. In our study, we used a set of crosses between D . virilis and D . lummei and applied the methods of quantitative genetics to assess the variability of the shape of the male copulatory organ and the effects of the sex chromosomes and autosomes on its variance. Our results showed that the male genital shape depends on the species composition of the sex chromosomes and autosomes. Epistatic interactions of the sex chromosomes with autosomes and the species origin of the Y-chromosome in a male in interspecific crosses also influenced the expression of species-specific traits in the shape of the male copulatory system. Overall, the effects of sex chromosomes were comparable to the effects of autosomes despite the great differences in gene numbers between them. It may be reasonably considered that sexual selection for specific genes associated with the shape of the male mating organ prevents the demasculinization of the X chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W3117990982,"Segmented cine cardiac MRI combines data from multiple heartbeats to achieve high spatiotemporal resolution cardiac images, yet predefined k-space segmentation trajectories can lead to suboptimal k-space sampling. In this work, we developed and evaluated an autonomous and closed-loop control system for radial k-space sampling (ARKS) to increase sampling uniformity.The closed-loop system autonomously selects radial k-space sampling trajectory during live segmented cine MRI and attempts to optimize angular sampling uniformity by selecting views in regions of k-space that were not previously well-sampled. Sampling uniformity and the ability to detect cardiac phase in vivo was assessed using ECG data acquired from 10 normal subjects in an MRI scanner. The approach was then implemented with a fast gradient echo sequence on a whole-body clinical MRI scanner and imaging was performed in 4 healthy volunteers. The closed-loop k-space trajectory was compared to random, uniformly distributed and golden angle view trajectories via measurement of k-space uniformity and the point spread function. Lastly, an arrhythmic dataset was used to evaluate a potential application of the approach.The autonomous trajectory increased k-space sampling uniformity by 15±7%, main lobe point spread function (PSF) signal intensity by 6±4%, and reduced ringing relative to golden angle sampling. When implemented, the autonomous pulse sequence prescribed radial view angles faster than the scan TR (0.98 ± 0.01 ms, maximum = 1.38 ms) and increased k-space sampling mean uniformity by 10±11%, decreased uniformity variability by 44±12%, and increased PSF signal ratio by 6±6% relative to golden angle sampling.The closed-loop approach enables near-uniform radial sampling in a segmented acquisition approach which was higher than predetermined golden-angle radial sampling. This can be utilized to increase the sampling or decrease the temporal footprint of an acquisition and the closed-loop framework has the potential to be applied to patients with complex heart rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W3117926203,"Under the background of excess capacity and energy saving in iron and steel enterprises, the hot rolling batch scheduling problem based on energy saving is a multi-objective and multi constraint optimization problem. In this paper, a hybrid multi-objective prize-collecting vehicle routing problem (Hybrid Price Collect Vehicle Routing Problem, HPCVRP) model is established to ensure minimum energy consumption, meet process rules, and maximize resource utilization. A two-phase Pareto search algorithm (2PPLS) is designed to solve this model. The improved MOEA/D with a penalty based boundary intersection distance (PBI) algorithm (MOEA/D-PBI) is introduced to decompose the HPCVRP in the first phase. In the second phase, the multi-objective ant colony system (MOACS) and Pareto local search (PLS) algorithm is used to generate approximate Pareto-optimal solutions. The final solution is then selected according to the actual demand and preference. In the simulation experiment, the 2PPLS is compared with five other algorithms, which shows the superiority of 2PPLS. Finally, the experiment was carried out on actual slab data from a steel plant in Shanghai. The results show that the model and algorithm can effectively reduce the energy consumption in the process of hot rolling batch scheduling."
https://openalex.org/W3117974206,"The Egyptian or Common spiny mouse ( A . cahirinus ) is the first rodent species to show human-like menstruation and spontaneous decidualisation. We consider from these, and its other, human-like characteristics that this species will be a more useful and appropriate small animal model for human reproductive studies. Based on this, there is a need to develop specific laboratory-based assisted reproduction protocols including superovulation, in-vitro fertilisation, embryo cryopreservation and transfer to expand and make this model more relevant. Because standard rodent superovulation has not been successful in the spiny mouse, we have selected to test a human protocol. Female spiny mice will receive a subcutaneous GnRH agonist implant and be allowed to recover. Menstrual cycle lengths will then be allowed to stabilize prior to ovarian stimulation. After recovery, females will be injected IP once a day for 4 days with a FSH analogue, to induce follicular growth, and on day 5 will be injected IP with a hCG analogue to trigger ovulation. Females will either be culled 36hrs after trigger to collect oocytes or immediately paired with a stud male and two cell embryos collected 48hrs later. Mature oocytes will be inseminated using fresh spiny mouse spermatozoa and all in-vitro grown and in-vivo collected two cell embryos will be cryopreserved using methods developed in a close spiny mouse relative, the Mongolian gerbil. For embryo transfer, vitrified embryos will be rapidly warmed and non-surgically transferred to surrogate mice. Surrogates will be monitored until pregnancy is apparent (roughly 30 days) and then left undisturbed until birth, 38–40 days after transfer. By successfully developing robust assisted reproduction protocols in A . cahirinus we will be able to use this rodent as a more effective model for human reproduction."
