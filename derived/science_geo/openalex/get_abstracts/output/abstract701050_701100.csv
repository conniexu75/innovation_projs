https://openalex.org/W4296766770,"Realizing solution-processed heterostructures is a long-enduring challenge in halide perovskites because of solvent incompatibilities that disrupt the underlying layer. By leveraging the solvent dielectric constant and Gutmann donor number, we could grow phase-pure two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskite stacks of the desired composition, thickness, and bandgap onto 3D perovskites without dissolving the underlying substrate. Characterization reveals a 3D-2D transition region of 20 nanometers mainly determined by the roughness of the bottom 3D layer. Thickness dependence of the 2D perovskite layer reveals the anticipated trends for n-i-p and p-i-n architectures, which is consistent with band alignment and carrier transport limits for 2D perovskites. We measured a photovoltaic efficiency of 24.5%, with exceptional stability of T99 (time required to preserve 99% of initial photovoltaic efficiency) of >2000 hours, implying that the 3D/2D bilayer inherits the intrinsic durability of 2D perovskite without compromising efficiency."

We use a transmission model fitted to empirical sexual partnership data to show that the heavy-tailed sexual partnership distribution, in which a handful of individuals have disproportionately many partners, can explain the sustained growth of monkeypox among MSM despite the absence of such patterns previously. We suggest that the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for monkeypox over the MSM sexual network may be substantially above 1, which poses challenges to outbreak containment. Ensuring support and tailored messaging to facilitate prevention and early detection among MSM with high numbers of partners is warranted."

Although preserving genetic diversity is key to maintaining species' adaptability, we lack predictive tools and global estimates of genetic diversity loss across ecosystems. We introduce a mathematical framework that bridges biodiversity theory and population genetics to understand the loss of naturally occurring DNA mutations with decreasing habitat. By analyzing genomic variation of 10,095 georeferenced individuals from 20 plant and animal species, we show that genome-wide diversity follows a mutations-area relationship power law with geographic area, which can predict genetic diversity loss from local population extinctions. We estimate that more than 10% of genetic diversity may already be lost for many threatened and nonthreatened species, surpassing the United Nations' post-2020 targets for genetic preservation."
https://openalex.org/W4296794220,"Classical machine learning (ML) provides a potentially powerful approach to solving challenging quantum many-body problems in physics and chemistry. However, the advantages of ML over traditional methods have not been firmly established. In this work, we prove that classical ML algorithms can efficiently predict ground-state properties of gapped Hamiltonians after learning from other Hamiltonians in the same quantum phase of matter. By contrast, under a widely accepted conjecture, classical algorithms that do not learn from data cannot achieve the same guarantee. We also prove that classical ML algorithms can efficiently classify a wide range of quantum phases. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical results in a variety of scenarios, including Rydberg atom systems, two-dimensional random Heisenberg models, symmetry-protected topological phases, and topologically ordered phases."
https://openalex.org/W4296802323,"Nitrate is an essential nutrient and signaling molecule for plant growth. Plants sense intracellular nitrate to adjust their metabolic and growth responses. Here we identify the primary nitrate sensor in plants. We found that mutation of all seven Arabidopsis NIN-like protein (NLP) transcription factors abolished plants' primary nitrate responses and developmental programs. Analyses of NIN-NLP7 chimeras and nitrate binding revealed that NLP7 is derepressed upon nitrate perception via its amino terminus. A genetically encoded fluorescent split biosensor, mCitrine-NLP7, enabled visualization of single-cell nitrate dynamics in planta. The nitrate sensor domain of NLP7 resembles the bacterial nitrate sensor NreA. Substitutions of conserved residues in the ligand-binding pocket impaired the ability of nitrate-triggered NLP7 to control transcription, transport, metabolism, development, and biomass. We propose that NLP7 represents a nitrate sensor in land plants."
https://openalex.org/W4296693022,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly dispersed, millisecond-duration radio bursts1-3. Recent observations of a Galactic FRB4-8 suggest that at least some FRBs originate from magnetars, but the origin of cosmological FRBs is still not settled. Here we report the detection of 1,863 bursts in 82 h over 54 days from the repeating source FRB 20201124A (ref. 9). These observations show irregular short-time variation of the Faraday rotation measure (RM), which scrutinizes the density-weighted line-of-sight magnetic field strength, of individual bursts during the first 36 days, followed by a constant RM. We detected circular polarization in more than half of the burst sample, including one burst reaching a high fractional circular polarization of 75%. Oscillations in fractional linear and circular polarizations, as well as polarization angle as a function of wavelength, were detected. All of these features provide evidence for a complicated, dynamically evolving, magnetized immediate environment within about an astronomical unit (AU; Earth-Sun distance) of the source. Our optical observations of its Milky-Way-sized, metal-rich host galaxy10-12 show a barred spiral, with the FRB source residing in a low-stellar-density interarm region at an intermediate galactocentric distance. This environment is inconsistent with a young magnetar engine formed during an extreme explosion of a massive star that resulted in a long gamma-ray burst or superluminous supernova."
https://openalex.org/W4296552195,"Additive manufacturing methods1-4 using static and mobile robots are being developed for both on-site construction5-8 and off-site prefabrication9,10. Here we introduce a method of additive manufacturing, referred to as aerial additive manufacturing (Aerial-AM), that utilizes a team of aerial robots inspired by natural builders11 such as wasps who use collective building methods12,13. We present a scalable multi-robot three-dimensional (3D) printing and path-planning framework that enables robot tasks and population size to be adapted to variations in print geometry throughout a building mission. The multi-robot manufacturing framework allows for autonomous three-dimensional printing under human supervision, real-time assessment of printed geometry and robot behavioural adaptation. To validate autonomous Aerial-AM based on the framework, we develop BuilDrones for depositing materials during flight and ScanDrones for measuring the print quality, and integrate a generic real-time model-predictive-control scheme with the Aerial-AM robots. In addition, we integrate a dynamically self-aligning delta manipulator with the BuilDrone to further improve the manufacturing accuracy to five millimetres for printing geometry with precise trajectory requirements, and develop four cementitious-polymeric composite mixtures suitable for continuous material deposition. We demonstrate proof-of-concept prints including a cylinder 2.05 metres high consisting of 72 layers of a rapid-curing insulation foam material and a cylinder 0.18 metres high consisting of 28 layers of structural pseudoplastic cementitious material, a light-trail virtual print of a dome-like geometry, and multi-robot simulations. Aerial-AM allows manufacturing in-flight and offers future possibilities for building in unbounded, at-height or hard-to-access locations."
https://openalex.org/W4296793527,"Tissue-tissue communication by endocrine factors is a vital mechanism for physiologic homeostasis. A systems genetics analysis of transcriptomic and functional data from a cohort of diverse, inbred strains of mice predicted that coagulation factor XI (FXI), a liver-derived protein, protects against diastolic dysfunction, a key trait of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This was confirmed using gain- and loss-of-function studies, and FXI was found to activate the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-SMAD1/5 pathway in the heart. The proteolytic activity of FXI is required for the cleavage and activation of extracellular matrix-associated BMP7 in the heart, thus inhibiting genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Our results reveal a protective role of FXI in heart injury that is distinct from its role in coagulation."
https://openalex.org/W4296552404,"Dynamic shape-morphing soft materials systems are ubiquitous in living organisms; they are also of rapidly increasing relevance to emerging technologies in soft machines, flexible electronics, and smart medicines. Soft matter equipped with responsive components can switch between designed shapes or structures, but cannot support the types of dynamic morphing capabilities needed to reproduce natural, continuous processes of interest for many applications. Challenges lie in the development of schemes to reprogram target shapes post fabrication, especially when complexities associated with the operating physics and disturbances from the environment can prohibit the use of deterministic theoretical models to guide inverse design and control strategies. Here, we present a mechanical metasurface constructed from a matrix of filamentary metal traces, driven by reprogrammable, distributed Lorentz forces that follow from passage of electrical currents in the presence of a static magnetic field. The resulting system demonstrates complex, dynamic morphing capabilities with response times within 0.1 s. Implementing an in-situ stereo-imaging feedback strategy with a digitally controlled actuation scheme guided by an optimization algorithm, yields surfaces that can self-evolve into a wide range of 3-dimensional (3D) target shapes with high precision, including an ability to morph against extrinsic or intrinsic perturbations. These concepts support a data-driven approach to the design of dynamic, soft matter, with many unique characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W4296807574,"Large volcanic eruptions, although rare events, can influence the chemistry and the dynamics of the stratosphere for several years after the eruption. Here we show that the eruption of the submarine volcano Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai on 15 January 2022 injected at least 50 teragrams of water vapor directly into the stratosphere. This event raised the amount of water vapor in the developing stratospheric plume by several orders of magnitude and possibly increased the amount of global stratospheric water vapor by more than 5%. This extraordinary eruption may have initiated an atmospheric response different from that of previous well-studied large volcanic eruptions."
https://openalex.org/W4296793417,"Tissue-specific stem cells persist for a lifetime and can differentiate to maintain homeostasis or transform to initiate cancer. Despite their importance, there are no described quality assurance mechanisms for newly formed stem cells. We observed intimate and specific interactions between macrophages and nascent blood stem cells in zebrafish embryos. Macrophage interactions frequently led to either removal of cytoplasmic material and stem cell division or complete engulfment and stem cell death. Stressed stem cells were marked by surface Calreticulin, which stimulated macrophage interactions. Using cellular barcoding, we found that Calreticulin knock-down or embryonic macrophage depletion reduced the number of stem cell clones that established adult hematopoiesis. Our work supports a model in which embryonic macrophages determine hematopoietic clonality by monitoring stem cell quality."
https://openalex.org/W4296800245,"Recent evidence has shown that even mild mutations in the Huntingtin gene that are associated with late-onset Huntington’s disease (HD) disrupt various aspects of human neurodevelopment. To determine whether these seemingly subtle early defects affect adult neural function, we investigated neural circuit physiology in newborn HD mice. During the first postnatal week, HD mice have less cortical layer 2/3 excitatory synaptic activity than wild-type mice, express fewer glutamatergic receptors, and show sensorimotor deficits. The circuit self-normalizes in the second postnatal week but the mice nonetheless develop HD. Pharmacologically enhancing glutamatergic transmission during the neonatal period, however, rescues these deficits and preserves sensorimotor function, cognition, and spine and synapse density as well as brain region volume in HD adult mice."
https://openalex.org/W4296797773,"Deadwood is a large global carbon store with its store size partially determined by biotic decay. Microbial wood decay rates are known to respond to changing temperature and precipitation. Termites are also important decomposers in the tropics but are less well studied. An understanding of their climate sensitivities is needed to estimate climate change effects on wood carbon pools. Using data from 133 sites spanning six continents, we found that termite wood discovery and consumption were highly sensitive to temperature (with decay increasing &gt;6.8 times per 10°C increase in temperature)—even more so than microbes. Termite decay effects were greatest in tropical seasonal forests, tropical savannas, and subtropical deserts. With tropicalization (i.e., warming shifts to tropical climates), termite wood decay will likely increase as termites access more of Earth’s surface."
https://openalex.org/W4296809310,"Forestation of the vast global drylands has been considered a promising climate change mitigation strategy. However, its actual climatic benefits are uncertain because the forests' reduced albedo can produce large warming effects. Using high-resolution spatial analysis of global drylands, we found 448 million hectares suitable for afforestation. This area's carbon sequestration potential until 2100 is 32.3 billion tons of carbon (Gt C), but 22.6 Gt C of that is required to balance albedo effects. The net carbon equivalent would offset ~1% of projected medium-emissions and business-as-usual scenarios over the same period. Focusing forestation only on areas with net cooling effects would use half the area and double the emissions offset. Although such smart forestation is clearly important, its limited climatic benefits reinforce the need to reduce emissions rapidly."

https://openalex.org/W4296741012,"The paper investigates the factors underlying COVID-19 vaccine and booster hesitancy in the United States, and the efficacy of various incentives or disincentives to expand uptake. We use cross-sectional, national survey data on 3,497 U.S. adults collected online from September 10, 2021 to October 20, 2021 through the Qualtrics platform. Results from a multinomial logistic regression reveal that hesitancy and refusal were greatest among those who expressed a lack of trust either in government or in the vaccine's efficacy (hesitancy relative risk ratio, or RRR: 2.86, 95% CI: 2.13-3.83, p<0.001). Hesitancy and refusal were lowest among those who typically get a flu vaccine (hesitancy RRR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.36, p<0.001; refusal RRR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.05-0.13, p<0.001). Similar results hold for the intention to get a booster shot among the fully vaccinated. Monetary rewards (i.e., lottery ticket and gift cards) fared poorly in moving people toward vaccination. In contrast, the prospect of job loss or increased health insurance premiums was found to significantly increase vaccine uptake, by 8.7 percentage points (p<0.001) and 9.4 percentage points (p<0.001), respectively. We also show that the motivations underlying individuals' hesitancy or refusal to get vaccinated vary, which, in turn, suggests that messaging must be refined and directed accordingly. Also, moving forward, it may be fruitful to more deeply study the intriguing possibility that expanding flu vaccine uptake may also enhance willingness to vaccinate in times of pandemics. Last, disincentives such as work-based vaccination mandates that would result in job loss or higher health insurance premiums for those who refuse vaccination should be strongly considered to improve vaccine uptake in the effort to address the common good."
https://openalex.org/W4296552506,"Electrostriction is a property of dielectric materials whereby an applied electric field induces a mechanical deformation proportional to the square of that field. The magnitude of the effect is usually minuscule (<10-19 m2 V-2 for simple oxides). However, symmetry-breaking phenomena at the interfaces can offer an efficient strategy for the design of new properties1,2. Here we report an engineered electrostrictive effect via the epitaxial deposition of alternating layers of Gd2O3-doped CeO2 and Er2O3-stabilized δ-Bi2O3 with atomically controlled interfaces on NdGaO3 substrates. The value of the electrostriction coefficient achieved is 2.38 × 10-14 m2 V-2, exceeding the best known relaxor ferroelectrics by three orders of magnitude. Our theoretical calculations indicate that this greatly enhanced electrostriction arises from coherent strain imparted by interfacial lattice discontinuity. These artificial heterostructures open a new avenue for the design and manipulation of electrostrictive materials and devices for nano/micro actuation and cutting-edge sensors."
https://openalex.org/W4296804190,"The vertebrate intestine forms by asymmetric gut rotation and elongation, and errors cause lethal obstructions in human infants. Rotation begins with tissue deformation of the dorsal mesentery, which is dependent on left-sided expression of the Paired-like transcription factor Pitx2 . The conserved morphogen Nodal induces asymmetric Pitx2 to govern embryonic laterality, but organ-level regulation of Pitx2 during gut asymmetry remains unknown. We found Nodal to be dispensable for Pitx2 expression during mesentery deformation. Intestinal rotation instead required a mechanosensitive latent transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ), tuning a second wave of Pitx2 that induced reciprocal tissue stiffness in the left mesentery as mechanical feedback with the right side. This signaling regulator, an accelerator (right) and brake (left), combines biochemical and biomechanical inputs to break gut morphological symmetry and direct intestinal rotation."

https://openalex.org/W4296793820,"Information processing in neuronal networks involves the recruitment of selected neurons into coordinated spatiotemporal activity patterns. This sparse activation results from widespread synaptic inhibition in conjunction with neuron-specific synaptic excitation. We report the selective recruitment of hippocampal pyramidal cells into patterned network activity. During ripple oscillations in awake mice, spiking is much more likely in cells in which the axon originates from a basal dendrite rather than from the soma. High-resolution recordings in vitro and computer modeling indicate that these spikes are elicited by synaptic input to the axon-carrying dendrite and thus escape perisomatic inhibition. Pyramidal cells with somatic axon origin can be activated during ripple oscillations by blocking their somatic inhibition. The recruitment of neurons into active ensembles is thus determined by axonal morphological features."

https://openalex.org/W4296741934,"Sweet corn has become a popular food worldwide. It possesses six-times more sugar than field corn due to the presence of recessive shrunken2 (sh2) gene. Despite availability of diverse sweet corn germplasm, comprehensive characterization of sh2 has not been undertaken so far. Here, entire Sh2 gene (7320 bp) among five field corn-(Sh2Sh2) and six sweet corn-(sh2sh2) inbreds was sequenced. A total of 686 SNPs and 372 InDels were identified, of which three SNPs differentiated the wild-(Sh2) and mutant-(sh2) allele. Ten InDel markers were developed to assess sh2 gene-based diversity among 23 sweet corn and 25 field corn lines. Twenty-five alleles and 47 haplotypes of sh2 were identified among 48 inbreds. Among markers, MGU-InDel-2, MGU-InDel-3, MGU-InDel-5 and MGU-InDel-8 had PIC>0.5. Major allele frequency varied from 0.458-0.958. The gene sequence of these maize inbreds was compared with 25 orthologues of monocots. Sh2 gene possessed 15-18 exons with 6-225bp among maize, while it was 6-21 exons with 30-441bp among orthologues. While intron length across maize genotypes varied between 67-2069bp, the same among orthologues was 57-2713 bp. Sh2-encoded AGPase domain was more conserved than NTP transferase domain. Nucleotide and protein sequences of sh2 in maize and orthologues revealed that rice orthologue was closer to maize than other monocots. The study also provided details of motifs and domains present in sh2 gene, physicochemical properties and secondary structure of SH2 protein in maize inbreds and orthologues. This study reports detailed characterization and diversity analysis in sh2 gene of maize and related orthologues in various monocots."

All cerebral blood flow passes through these retia, and we hypothesize that they protect cetacean brains from locomotion-generated pulsatile blood pressures. We propose that cetaceans have evolved a pulse-transfer mechanism that minimizes pulsatility in cerebral arterial-to-venous pressure differentials without dampening the pressure pulses themselves. We tested this hypothesis using a computational model based on morphology from 11 species and found that the large arterial capacitance in the retia, coupled with the small extravascular capacitance in the cranium and vertebral canal, could protect the cerebral vasculature from 97% of systemic pulsatility. Evolution of the retial complex in cetaceans-likely linked to the development of dorsoventral fluking-offers a distinctive solution to adverse locomotion-generated vascular pulsatility."

Therefore, the study aimed to determine if IL-17 level in saliva mirrors its circulatory level and hence can be used as a non-invasive biomarker for disease severity.Interleukin-17 (IL-17) level was evaluated by ELISA in saliva and blood of 201 adult COVID-19 patients with different levels of severity. The IL-17 saliva level was also associated with COVID-19 disease severity, and need for mechanical ventilation and/or death within 29 days after admission of severe COVID-19 patients.We found that IL-17 level in saliva of COVID-19 patients reflected its circulatory level. High IL-17 level in saliva was associated with COVID-19 severity (P<0.001), need for mechanical ventilation (P = 0.002), and/or death by 29 days (P = 0.002), after adjusting for patients' demographics, comorbidity, and COVID-19 serum severity markers such as D-Dimer, C-reactive protein, and ferritin.We propose that saliva IL-17 level could be used as a biomarker to identify patients at risk of developing severe COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4296552595,"Abstract Many essential processes in the cell depend on proteins that use nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Methods that directly monitor the often-complex dynamics of these proteins at the single-molecule level have helped to uncover their mechanisms of action. However, the measurement throughput is typically limited for NTP-utilizing reactions, and the quantitative dissection of complex dynamics over multiple sequential turnovers remains challenging. Here we present a method for controlling NTP-driven reactions in single-molecule experiments via the local generation of NTPs (LAGOON) that markedly increases the measurement throughput and enables single-turnover observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAGOON in single-molecule fluorescence and force spectroscopy assays by monitoring DNA unwinding, nucleosome sliding and RNA polymerase elongation. LAGOON can be readily integrated with many single-molecule techniques, and we anticipate that it will facilitate studies of a wide range of crucial NTP-driven processes."

It is the first law named after the ""Code"" and occupies a fundamental position in the China's legal system. Therefore, translation of legal terms is vital in making target readers familiar with the China's civil system and contributes to cultural communication and academic exchange. Previous research on translations of legal terms provides various translation principles and strategies. However, culture connotation in Chinese is usually implicit or lacks counterparts, leading to the difficulties in the equivalent translation of legal terms with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, this paper concentrates on the selection of legal term translation principles from the perspective of the Skopos theory and a Chinese translation theory named Eco-translatology, to explore the application and effect of selected principles in the translation of legal terms with Chinese characteristics. Guided by the Skopos theory and Eco-translatology, this paper collects 42 legal terms with Chinese characteristics from the The Civil Code of the People's Republic of China and analyzes the application of 5 translation principles of accuracy, readability, traceability, conventionality, and unification. Through analysis, the legal terms are classified into newly-coined and inherited terms and rules of strategy application are therefore summarized. It is expected that this paper would provide systematic principles for the translation of legal terms with Chinese characteristics."

Females constitute 56.7% and 50.7% had diabetes duration of >10 years. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at presentation was reported in 46.3%. Average glycemic control over preceding 12months was satisfactory (less than 7.5%), suboptimal (7.5-9%), and poor (more than 9%) in 26.6%, 42.7% & 30.6% of the patients, respectively. Higher proportion of patients using CSII achieved satisfactory or suboptimal glycemic control compared to patients with MDI (P = 0.003). The latest median /IQR HbA1c was significantly lower (P = 0.041) in patients using CSII (8.2 /1.93%) compared to MDI (8.5/2.45%). There was no significant difference between two groups in DKA, severe hypoglycemia or total WHO-5 score.CSII usage was associated with better glycemic control than MDI, although no difference in DKA and severe hypoglycemia.

https://openalex.org/W4296741303,"Introduction Anemia in reproductive age women is defined as the hemoglobin level &lt;11g/dl for lactating or pregnant mothers and hemoglobin level &lt;12 g/dl for none pregnant or non-lactating women. Anemia is a global public health problem affecting both developing and developed countries. Therefore this study aims to determine geographically weighted regression analysis of anemia and its associated factors among reproductive age women in Ethiopia using the 2016 Demographic and Health Survey. Method In this study, a total of 14,570 women of reproductive age were included. Multi-level binary logistic regression models were employed using STATA version 14. Odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval and p-values less than 0.05 was used to identify significant factors. Spatial scan statistics were used to identify the presence of anemia clusters using Kulldorf’s SaTScan version 9.6 software. ArcGIS 10.7 software was used to visualize the spatial distribution and geographically weighted regression of anemia among reproductive age women. Result Overall 23.8% of reproductive-age women were anemic. The SaTScan spatial analysis identified the primary clusters’ spatial window in Southeastern Oromia and the entire Somali region. The GWR analysis shows that having a formal education, using pills/injectables/implant decreases the risks of anemia. However, women who have more than one child within five years have an increased risk of anemia in Ethiopia. In addition to these, in multilevel analysis women who were married and women who have &gt;5 family members were more likely to have anemia. Conclusion In Ethiopia, anemia among reproductive age women was relatively high and had spatial variations across the regions. Policymakers should give attention to mothers who have a low birth interval, married women, and large family size. Women’s education and family planning usage especially pills, implants, or injectable should be strengthened."

Therefore, the relevance of this study is highlighted for the scientific advance of the epidemiological behavior of the virus in Brazil, enabling the development of analyses and discussions on the factors that influenced the high rates of contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in the country. Given the above, this study aims to analyze the epidemiological behavior of the COVID-19 contamination curve by epidemiological weeks (EW), in the years 2020–2021, in Brazil. This is an ecological study of time series, prepared using information collected through secondary means. The country of origin of the study is Brazil, and its main theme is the number of people infected during the COVID-19 pandemic, this being the dependent variable of the study. The data has been analyzed from February 23, 2020, when the first case was confirmed in Brazil, to January 1, 2022. In 2021, the country’s graph shows an exponential growth, reaching a peak of approximately 250 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the 12th EW. This data represents the highest rate of the pandemic in Brazil, and did not vary significantly for the next twelve weeks. Thus, it was identified that Brazil was severely impacted by the new coronavirus, considering the high rates of confirmed cases of the virus in the country, the low adherence of the population to preventive measures, the late start of mass vaccination in the Brazilian population, and the lack of structure in the health system, which was not appropriately prepared for the high demand generated by COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4296741600,"Objective Posttraumatic growth (PTG) and posttraumatic depreciation (PTD) are considered two sides of growth after trauma. Nevertheless, previous studies pointed out that in trauma living with a life-threatening illness, they may be experienced as two independently and share distinct predictors. In our study we aimed to find the different trajectories of PTG and PTD among a sample of people living with HIV (PLWH) and to investigate its predictors out of psychological resilience, and gain and loss of resources from the conservation of resources theory (COR). Methods We designed a longitudinal study that consisted of three measurements at 6-month intervals, and we recruited, respectively, 87, 85 and 71 PLWH. Each time participants filled out the following questionnaires: the expanded version of the PTG and PTD Inventory (PTGDI-X), the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), the Conservation of Resources Evaluation (COR-E), and a survey on sociodemographic and medical data. Results We observed two separate trajectories of PTG and PTD within participants and found that each of the trajectories were related to different predictors from the studied variables. More specifically, we found a positive relationship between resilience and a descending PTD trajectory that stabilized over time. Gain of resources generally predicted a PTG trajectory, while loss of resources predicted the dynamics of PTD. Conclusions Including two parallel constructs, i.e., PTG and PTD, confirmed the independence of their mechanisms in growth processes among PLWH. The initial insight concerning the role of resilience and resources in PTG/PTD processes may inspire more effective planning for psychological help for PLWH, and it may stimulate studies on growth after trauma to further examine the two sides of this phenomenon."

Individual seasonal variations of diabetes, smoking, and elderly patients were analyzed monthly, along with the potential risk factors for cardiovascular complication. We also characterized whether pairwise coexistence of diabetes, smoking, and elderly age augments or blunts the seasonal variations.Seasonal variations in the monthly proportion of cardiac surgeries associated with diabetes, smoking and/or elderly age were observed. The proportion of cardiac surgeries of non-elderly and smoking patients with diabetes peaked in winter (amplitude of change as [peak-nadir]/nadir: 19.2%, p<0.02), which was associated with increases in systolic (6.1%, p<0.001) and diastolic blood pressures (4.4%, p<0.05) and serum triglyceride levels (27.1%, p<0.005). However, heart surgery in elderly patients without diabetes and smoking was most frequently required in summer (52.1%, p<0.001). Concomitant occurrence of diabetes and smoking had an additive effect on the requirement for cardiac surgery (107%, p<0.001), while the simultaneous presence of older age and diabetes or smoking eliminated seasonal variations.Scheduling regular cardiovascular control in accordance with periodicities in diabetes, elderly, and smoking patients more than once a year may improve patient health and social consequences.NCT03967639."
https://openalex.org/W4296742922,"The evolution of RNA-seq technologies has yielded datasets of scientific value that are often generated as condition associated biological replicates within expression studies. With expanding data archives opportunity arises to augment replicate numbers when conditions of interest overlap. Despite correction procedures for estimating transcript abundance, a source of ambiguity is transcript level intra-condition count variation; as indicated by disjointed results between analysis tools. We present TVscript, a tool that removes reference-based transcripts associated with intra-condition count variation above specified thresholds and we explore the effects of such variation on differential expression analysis. Initially iterative differential expression analysis involving simulated counts, where levels of intra-condition variation and sets of over represented transcripts are explicitly specified, was performed. Then counts derived from inter- and intra-study data representing brain samples of dogs, wolves and foxes (wolves vs. dogs and aggressive vs. tame foxes) were used. For simulations, the sensitivity in detecting differentially expressed transcripts increased after removing hyper-variable transcripts, although at levels of intra-condition variation above 5% detection became unreliable. For real data, prior to applying TVscript, ≈20% of the transcripts identified as being differentially expressed were associated with high levels of intra-condition variation, an over representation relative to the reference set. As transcripts harbouring such variation were removed pre-analysis, a discordance from 26 to 40% in the lists of differentially expressed transcripts is observed when compared to those obtained using the non-filtered reference. The removal of transcripts possessing intra-condition variation values within (and above) the 97th and 95th percentiles, for wolves vs. dogs and aggressive vs. tame foxes, maximized the sensitivity in detecting differentially expressed transcripts as a result of alterations within gene-wise dispersion estimates. Through analysis of our real data the support for seven genes with potential for being involved with selection for tameness is provided.

Our results showed that miR-206 mimics suppressed CALR expression, inhibited the proliferation and metastasis ability of breast cancer stem cells and finally induced cellular apoptosis. Over-expression of CALR could effectively attenuate the cytotoxic effect of miR-206. Further studies demonstrated that EVI-1 could be served as a key regulator of miR206-mediated CALR expression. Elevation of EVI-1 can reverse the function of miR-206 on induction of CALR."
https://openalex.org/W4296807396,"Prior research shows that in a particular science domain, students' identity depends on their self-efficacy, perceived recognition by others, and their interest in that domain. In this study, we investigated how the end of the semester physics self-efficacy and perceived recognition by others for bioscience majors enrolled in the second semester of a traditionally taught mandatory physics course sequence predict their overall science identity aligned with their disciplinary major. We find that bioscience majors' physics self-efficacy and perceived recognition not only predict their physics identity but also their overall science identity. These relations between physics self-efficacy and perceived recognition and the overall science identity of bioscience majors suggest interdisciplinary connections that may provide additional pathways for boosting students' science identity, e.g., by enhancing their self-efficacy and perceived recognition in their other mandatory courses such as physics. We also find that on average, women majoring in bioscience had lower physics self-efficacy, perceived recognition, physics identity, and overall science identity than men even though women were not underrepresented in the physics course. One possible reason is that the societal stereotypes and biases pertaining to who can excel in physics can impact women who are constantly exposed to them throughout their life."

The risk factors for the development of mCNV-MA, which is the fovea-involving patchy atrophy lesion adjacent to mCNV, were investigated using the Cox proportional hazard model.A total of 82 eyes (74 patients) were included in the study. The mean age at anti-VEGF treatment was 56.3 ± 12.5 years (range, 26-77), and the mean follow-up period was 76.3 ± 33.5 months (range, 36-154). During follow-up, mCNV-MA developed in 27 eyes (32.9%), and its occurrence was estimated to be 24.5% at 3 years and 37.3% at 5 years after the first anti-VEGF treatment. Old age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.054, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.018-1.091; P = 0.003) and greater CNV size at baseline (HR = 2.396, CI: 1.043-5.504; P = 0.040) were significant factors for mCNV-MA development. Eyes with a thinner subfoveal choroid were more likely to show faster enlargement of the mCNV-MA during follow-up.In mCNV eyes treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, older age and greater mCNV size at baseline were risk factors for the development of MA during long-term follow-up, which was associated with a poor visual prognosis."

https://openalex.org/W4296741106,"The dried plant material of medically important plant Actinidia eriantha especially when it remains in the form of powder often look morphologically similar to its related species. The lack of efficient methods to distinguish the authentic material from other similar species leads to chances of adulteration. The molecular authentication of herbal plant materials such as the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences is considered as more reliable method compared to morphological traits. In this study, we aim to evaluate the potential of identification for roots of A. eriantha and its related species by ITS sequences. The lengths of ITS regions ranged from 624 to 636 bp with GC content ranging from 50.96% to 59.55%. A total of 194 variation sites and 46 haplotypes were formed in 185 samples. Among them, the roots of A. eriantha possessed specific sites at 85bp (C), 205bp (T), 493bp (C), 542bp (G), 574bp (C), 582bp (T) and 610bp (G), while A. hemsleyana, A. callosa, A. valvata and A. polygama have their own specific sites. The inter-specific genetic distance among 8 Actinidia species in the range 2.28% to 11.00%. The phylogenetic tree constructed with ITS, ITS1 and ITS2 region showed that the ITS sequences have higher potential for identification in 8 Actinidia species. However, as to A. eriantha, A. hemsleyana and A. valvata, these three barcodes have the same identification ability. The ITS regions indicated that different samples from same species can be grouped together, except for A. arguta and A. melanandrah. In conclusion, the ITS sequences can be used as an efficient DNA barcode for the identification of A. eriantha and its related species."
https://openalex.org/W4296741305,"Background Home injuries are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in high-income countries. In Sub-Saharan Africa, including Cameroon, many people live in unplanned settlements with poorly constructed houses, predisposing them to home injuries. However, little is known about the epidemiology and care-seeking behaviors of the domestically injured. In this study, our objective was to determine the epidemiology and care-seeking behaviors of home injuries in the Southwest Region of Cameroon. Methods A sub-analyses of a larger descriptive cross-sectional community-based study on injury epidemiology in the preceding 12 months was conducted. Sampling was done using three-stage cluster sampling technique. Differences between groups were evaluated using Chi-squared and Adjusted Wald tests. Results Of 8065 participants, 157 suffered home injuries giving an incidence of 19.6 (16.8–23.0 95% CI) cases per 1000-person years. Home injuries comprised 31.2% of all 503 injuries and affected more females (60.8%) and younger individuals (mean age (SE) 25.1 years (2.0)) than non-home injuries. The most common activity and mechanism of home injury was leisure/play (51%) and falls (37.9%) respectively. Amongst those with home injuries, 37.6% did not seek care from any care provider (versus 25.0% of non-home injuries, p = 0.004) and were more likely to seek treatment within the family or at home (p = 0.008) or at church (p = 0.010). Those with home injuries experienced a median of 14 disability days and 22.9% of families faced difficulties affording basic expenses (p = 0.001). Conclusion Home injuries comprise about a third of the Southwest Region of Cameroon’s burden of injury and likely have a profound socioeconomic impact. Though these injuries cause severe disabilities, a large proportion of victims do not seek care from providers. Prevention efforts should address the design of homes and victims of home injury should be encouraged to utilize formal care services."

https://openalex.org/W4296795638,"Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the third largest source of antioxidants in the human diet, after maize and tomato. Potato landraces have particularly diverse contents of antioxidant compounds such as anthocyanins. We used this diversity to study the evolutionary and genetic basis of anthocyanin pigmentation. Specifically, we analyzed the transcriptomes and anthocyanin content of tubers from 37 landraces with different colorations. We conducted analyses of differential expression between potatoes with different colorations and used weighted correlation network analysis to identify genes whose expression is correlated to anthocyanin content across landraces. A very significant fraction of the genes identified in these two analyses had annotations related to the flavonoid-anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, including 18 enzymes and 5 transcription factors. Importantly, the causal genes at the D, P and R loci governing anthocyanin accumulation in potato cultivars also showed correlations to anthocyanin production in the landraces studied here. Furthermore, we found that 60% of the genes identified in our study were located within anthocyanin QTLs. Finally, we identified new candidate enzymes and transcription factors that could have driven the diversification of anthocyanins. Our results indicate that many anthocyanins biosynthetic genes were manipulated in ancestral potato breeding and can be used in future breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W4296799341,"Artisanal and small-scale mines ( asm ) are on the rise. They represent a crucial source of wealth for numerous communities but are rarely monitored or regulated. The main reason being the unavailability of reliable information on the precise location of the asm which are mostly operated informally or illegally. We address this issue by developing a strategy to map the asm locations using a convolutional neural network for image segmentation, aiming to detect surface mining with satellite data. Our novel dataset is the first comprehensive measure of asm activity over a vast area: we cover 1.75 million km 2 across 13 countries in Sub-Tropical West Africa. The detected asm activities range from 0.1 ha to around 2, 000 ha and present a great diversity, yet we succeed in hitting acceptable compromises of performance, as achieving 70% precision while maintaining simultaneously 42% recall. Ultimately, the remarkable robustness of our procedure makes us confident that our method can be applied to other parts of Africa or the world, thus facilitating research and policy opportunities in this sector."
