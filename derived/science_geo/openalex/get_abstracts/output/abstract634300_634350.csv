https://openalex.org/W2949004447,"In most cases of sporadic colorectal cancers, tumorigenesis is a multistep process, involving genomic alterations in parallel with morphologic changes. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that the human gut microbiome is linked to the development of colorectal cancer. Here we performed fecal metagenomic and metabolomic studies on samples from a large cohort of 616 participants who underwent colonoscopy to assess taxonomic and functional characteristics of gut microbiota and metabolites. Microbiome and metabolome shifts were apparent in cases of multiple polypoid adenomas and intramucosal carcinomas, in addition to more advanced lesions. We found two distinct patterns of microbiome elevations. First, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum spp. was significantly (P < 0.005) elevated continuously from intramucosal carcinoma to more advanced stages. Second, Atopobium parvulum and Actinomyces odontolyticus, which co-occurred in intramucosal carcinomas, were significantly (P < 0.005) increased only in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. Metabolome analyses showed that branched-chain amino acids and phenylalanine were significantly (P < 0.005) increased in intramucosal carcinomas and bile acids, including deoxycholate, were significantly (P < 0.005) elevated in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. We identified metagenomic and metabolomic markers to discriminate cases of intramucosal carcinoma from the healthy controls. Our large-cohort multi-omics data indicate that shifts in the microbiome and metabolome occur from the very early stages of the development of colorectal cancer, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance."

They recapitulate many structural and functional aspects of their in vivo counterpart organs. This versatile technology has led to the development of many novel human cancer models. It is now possible to create indefinitely expanding organoids starting from tumor tissue of individuals suffering from a range of carcinomas. Alternatively, CRISPR-based gene modification allows the engineering of organoid models of cancer through the introduction of any combination of cancer gene alterations to normal organoids. When combined with immune cells and fibroblasts, tumor organoids become models for the cancer microenvironment enabling immune-oncology applications. Emerging evidence indicates that organoids can be used to accurately predict drug responses in a personalized treatment setting. Here, we review the current state and future prospects of the rapidly evolving tumor organoid field."

Synapses are information-processing units of the brain that provide the foundation for higher-level information integration in dendrites, neurons, and networks. Use-dependent changes in synaptic strength (synaptic plasticity) are firmly established as main underlying principles of cognitive processes, such as memory formation and retrieval, perception, sensory processing, attention, associative learning, and decision making (Abdou et al., 2018Abdou K.

Despite these intense investigations and a variety of research efforts focused on synaptic proteins and their subcellular organization and specific functions, only sparse efforts have been made to establish systematic resources for synapse biology in health and disease. In particular, the ontology of synaptic processes has been poorly defined, which has precluded systematic annotation of synaptic genes. Gene Ontology (GO) is the most widely used resource for gene function annotations. The resource has two components: (1) the ontology, a framework of definitions called “terms” to describe gene functions and locations and their relationships, and (2) GO annotations, statements linking genes to specific terms (Ashburner et al., 2000Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. et al.The Gene Ontology ConsortiumGene ontology: tool for the unification of biology.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (27012) Google Scholar, The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2019The Gene Ontology ConsortiumThe Gene Ontology Resource: 20 years and still GOing strong.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D330-D338Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). The ontology is divided into three aspects: (1) molecular function (MF), defining the molecular activities of gene products; (2) cellular component (CC), defining where they are active; and (3) biological process, defining the processes they carry out. Relationships between CC terms and between biological process (BP) terms generally specify how smaller structures are parts of larger ones. The accuracy of GO annotations critically depends on how well experimental evidence supports the annotations. Using existing annotations to synaptic GO terms and synaptic gene sets, several studies have shown that synaptic genes (i.e., genes encoding synaptic proteins) are significantly enriched in genetic variations associated with several brain traits (Savage et al., 2018Savage J.E. Jansen P.R. Stringer S. Watanabe K. Bryois J. de Leeuw C.A. Nagel M. Awasthi S. Barr P.B.

However, the lack of systematic annotation of synaptic genes also limits progress. Available resources, including GO, have limited representations of synapse biology and lack a comprehensive ontology of synaptic processes and locations. Existing resources are biased by uneven and patchy coverage of different aspects of synapse biology. Moreover, existing resources include data that have not been curated by experts, and a large fraction of the data has been aggregated in an unsupervised manner; e.g., by automated text mining or large-scale experiments that result in high rates of false positives, such as bulk proteomics and yeast two-hybrid studies. Thresholds for inclusion are not systematically defined and are typically low. Together, these shortcomings limit the effect of such resources and may engender incorrect conclusions. To overcome these limitations, we established SynGO, a partnership between the GO Consortium and 15 synapse expert laboratories in Europe, North America, and Asia, for systematic annotation of synaptic proteins. SynGO experts have developed an extensive ontology to represent synaptic locations (87 terms) and processes (179 terms) and generated almost 3,000 annotations of synaptic genes to these terms based on a novel comprehensive evidence-tracking system that classifies evidence using only published datasets. Using SynGO, we observed that synaptic genes are exceptionally well conserved, highly intolerant to mutations, and associated with many brain traits, such as IQ and educational attainment, and brain disorders, such as ASD, ADHD, and bipolar disorder. SynGO provides a unique, publicly accessible knowledge base (https://syngoportal.org) as a universal reference for synapse research and education and for enrichment studies of genomic associations, mRNA profiles, and proteomics data. To systematically annotate synaptic genes, we designed a generic synapse model as a conceptual starting point, defining locations at the synapse and processes related to the synapse, and refined this model iteratively until consensus was reached among expert laboratories worldwide (Figure 1). Subsequently, we created GO terms for CCs and BPs for synapses and defined their relationships. At the top level of the CC hierarchy (Figure 2A), synaptic proteins can be described as localized to the presynapse, postsynapse, synaptic cleft, extra-synaptic space, and synaptic membranes (the latter term is used when no distinction is possible between pre- and postsynaptic membranes). From these high-level terms, up to 4 additional hierarchical levels were defined for pre- or postsynaptic cytosol or membrane or organelles within these compartments. The SynGO CC ontology adds substantial precision to the pre-existing GO ontology that contained 13 terms directly connected to the central “synapse” term (and 19 additional terms). SynGO maintained two of these 13 terms (Figure 2A, green symbols) and excluded 11 (Figure 2A, purple symbols). Some of the GO terms were replaced by similar but more precise terms, and others were replaced with more specific terms further down in the hierarchical SynGO ontology. Altogether, 142 SynGO CC ontology terms were designed for accurate annotation of synaptic localizations (Table S2). To visualize this elaborate ontology hierarchy and provide a standardized visualization of SynGO annotations, all CC terms populated with gene annotations in SynGO 1.0 (92 of 142 terms) were plotted in a circular fashion, with the highest hierarchical term (synapse) in the center and each layer of subclasses in outward concentric rings (Figure 2C; see Table S2 for all term names). SynGO did not define mitochondria as part of a specific synaptic CC because mitochondrial proteins are already well annotated (Calvo et al., 2016Calvo S.E. Clauser K.R. Mootha V.K.

Some existing GO terms identical to SynGO ontologies were re-used (green nodes; 13 for CC and 44 for BP), and some existing GO synapse-related terms that did not overlap with the SynGO ontologies were discarded or replaced (purple nodes; 18 for CC and 22 for BP).

Subclasses in outer circles are shown in progressively darker colors. Table S2 contains the complete list of SynGO ontology terms matching the sunburst plots. BP terms for synaptic processes and their relationships were also defined consistently with existing GO terms, with pre- and postsynaptic processes, synaptic organization, synaptic signaling, axonal and dendritic transport, and metabolism as main terms with up to 5 levels of subclasses (Figure 2B). In total, the BP ontology features 256 terms of which 212 are new. 192 of these BP ontology terms were populated with gene annotations in SynGO 1.0 and visualized as a sunburst plot (Figure 2D, analogous to Figure 2B; see Table S2 for all term names). Hence, these novel CC and BP ontologies provide substantial innovation and increased precision for the ontology of the synapse. Together, these ontologies provide a comprehensive structure for systematic annotation of synaptic genes. Currently available synaptic protein lists contain many unsupervised inclusions, in particular from large-scale, automated experiments expected to have substantial false positive rates. SynGO established a systematic evidence tracking protocol and annotation by synapse experts only, based exclusively on published experimental data (PubMed). The SynGO workflow (Figure S1) was implemented in a web interface and used by the experts to annotate synaptic genes. To systematically track evidence, classifications were designed for the model systems used (Figure S2). For synaptic localization (CC), microscopy and biochemical studies were defined as the main experimental classes, each with several subclasses. For functional studies, experimental classes were defined based on perturbation type and methodology (assay) used to detect the consequences, again with several subclasses (Figure S2). These classifications were made coherent with the evidence and conclusions ontology (ECO) (Giglio et al., 2019Giglio M. Tauber R. Nadendla S. Munro J. Olley D. Ball S. Mitraka E. Schriml L.M. Gaudet P. Hobbs E.T. et al.ECO, the Evidence & Conclusion Ontology: community standard for evidence information.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D1186-D1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and new ECO terms were defined. Together, these three dimensions of evidence—(1) model system and/or preparation, (2) experimental perturbation, and (3) assay—provide a systematic, coherent, and detailed definition of the evidence to annotate synaptic genes. Annotations completed by expert laboratories first passed through a quality control pipeline by the SynGO support team (Figure S1) and were then added either directly to the SynGO database (https://syngoportal.org) or returned to the expert laboratories for further editing. These annotations were also deposited in the GO annotation repository (http://geneontology.org) as Gene Ontology causal activity models (GO-CAM; The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2019The Gene Ontology ConsortiumThe Gene Ontology Resource: 20 years and still GOing strong.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D330-D338Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). Together, this evidence tracking system, including detailed references to the evidence (PubMed ID [PMID], figure, and panel), provides an excellent framework for comprehensive transparent annotation of synaptic genes. Using the three dimensions of evidence tracking (model system and/or preparation, experimental perturbation, and assay), 2,922 expert-curated annotations were generated using cumulative candidate synaptic gene lists from published (Lips et al., 2012Lips E.S.

The annotations were subjected to quality control and, typically after iterative optimization, deposited in the SynGO database and the central GO knowledge base (The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2019The Gene Ontology ConsortiumThe Gene Ontology Resource: 20 years and still GOing strong.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D330-D338Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar; Figure S1). We found compelling evidence for 1,112 unique synaptic genes. These were admitted to the SynGO 1.0 knowledge base. The full list of 1,112 genes can be downloaded from https://syngoportal.org. For most genes, both subcellular localization (CC) and BP evidence was found (60%; Figure S3A); for the remaining 40%, evidence was lacking for either CC or BP, and only one term was included. A core set of synaptic proteins was annotated to 3 or more CC or BP terms (Figure S3B). Most evidence was obtained from studies of rodent species (Figure S3C) of either intact tissue or cultured neurons (Figure S3D). Microscopy and biochemical fractionation were the two main assay types used to make CC annotations, whereas BP annotations were based on a larger array of assay types assessing synaptic function (Figure S3E). Together, these 2,922 expert-curated annotations on 1,112 synaptic genes, with a core set annotated to 3 or more CC or BP terms, provide an excellent annotation collection for descriptive studies, functional analyses of synaptic genes, and gene enrichment studies. As a first descriptive analysis, we compared basic structural features of SynGO-annotated synaptic genes with other genes. Human gene features were extracted from BioMart (GRCh38.p12) and Ensembl. Interestingly, synaptic genes were found to be different from other (non-SynGO) genes in many respects. Synaptic genes were, on average, more than twice as long as other genes (2.6-fold of non-SynGO genes; Figure 3A), with 1.6-fold longer cDNA (Figure 3B). The number of known protein-coding transcripts was 1.7-fold higher (Figure 3C), and the sequence of introns and exons (immature transcript length) for protein-coding transcripts was more than 2-fold longer (Figure 3D). Protein-coding transcripts for synaptic genes also contained 1.4-fold more introns (Figure 3E), and these were 1.7-fold longer (Figure 3F). To compare SynGO genes with other brain-expressed genes, we defined two control gene sets: (1) brain-enriched genes (6,600 genes with maximal expression difference between brain and other tissues; Ganna et al., 2016Ganna A. Genovese G. Howrigan D.P. Byrnes A. Kurki M. Zekavat S.M. Whelan C.W. Kals M. Nivard M.G. Bloemendal A. et al.Ultra-rare disruptive and damaging mutations influence educational attainment in the general population.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1563-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and (2) “top N” genes most highly expressed in the brain, with N equal to the number of unique genes in the SynGO set (1,112). Differences between SynGO genes and control sets A and B were generally smaller in comparisons of gene size, introns, and cDNA length but still highly significant (Figures S4A–S4L). Finally, we tested the possibility that SynGO-annotated genes have a higher structural and topological complexity than other genes, especially more transmembrane regions (TMRs), and that this may explain the observed differences between SynGO genes and others. A TMR prediction algorithm (Krogh et al., 2001Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. Predicting transmembrane protein topology with a hidden Markov model: application to complete genomes.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9084) Google Scholar) indicated that SynGO-annotated genes indeed encode significantly more proteins with at least one TMR (35.2% versus 29.7% for the whole genome; p = 6.1e−5, using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test). However, when comparing SynGO annotated proteins with all membrane proteins, SynGO proteins are still significantly different to a similar extent and in all aspects indicated in Figure 3 and Figures S4A–S4L (see Figures S4M–S4R). We also investigated the complexity of isoform expression of synaptic genes in cerebellar neurons using recently published full-length RNA sequencing data (Gupta et al., 2018Gupta I. Collier P.G. Haase B. Mahfouz A. Joglekar A. Floyd T. Koopmans F. Barres B. Smit A.B. Sloan S.A. et al.Single-cell isoform RNA sequencing characterizes isoforms in thousands of cerebellar cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; (Published online October 15, 2018)https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4259Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Synaptic genes expressed a higher number of distinct isoforms compared with non-SynGO genes, per equal read counts, than non-synaptic genes (Figure S5).

The incidence of all major modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and S-nitrosylation) appears to be significantly higher in synaptic proteins compared with other proteins. However, these observations might emerge (in part) from the fact that synaptic proteins are more extensively studied. We tested when SynGO genes emerged in evolution relative to other genes. We found that their evolution follows a pattern that differs substantially from the overall pattern for all human genes (Figure 4A). Specifically, SynGO genes evolved primarily in three “waves” of innovation during which modern-day synaptic genes were gained at a faster rate than other human genes. The first wave of emergence of SynGO genes was prior to the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA), approximately 1,800 million years ago (mya)"

As organoid technology opens up new frontiers of research in biomedicine, there is an emerging need for innovative engineering approaches for the production, control, and analysis of organoids and their microenvironment. In this Review, we explore organ-on-a-chip technology as a platform to fulfill this need and examine how this technology may be leveraged to address major technical challenges in organoid research.

Applying this method to Cancer Genome Atlas samples and normal samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project generated a tissue-specific study of mutation accumulation. Somatic mutations were detected in nearly all individuals and across many normal human tissues in genomic regions called cancer hotspots and in genes that play a role in cancer.

Immunotherapy with antibodies to programmed death 1 (PD-1) produces lower response rates but with long response duration. Preclinical models suggest that combining BRAF and MEK inhibitors with PD-1 blockade therapy improves antitumor activity4-6, which may provide additional treatment options for patients unlikely to have long-lasting responses to either mode of therapy alone. We enrolled 15 patients with BRAFV600-mutated metastatic melanoma in a first-in-human clinical trial of dabrafenib, trametinib and pembrolizumab ( NCT02130466 ). Eleven patients (73%) experienced grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events, the most common being elevation of liver function tests and pyrexia, most of which resolved with drug interruption or discontinuation of either the anti-PD-1 antibody or the targeted therapy combination. Eleven patients (73%; 95% confidence interval = 45-92%) had an objective response, and six (40%; 95% confidence interval = 16-68%) continued with a response at a median follow-up of 27 months (range = 10.3-38.4+ months) for all patients. This study suggests that this triple-combined therapy may benefit a subset of patients with BRAFV600-mutated metastatic melanoma by increasing the frequency of long-lasting antitumor responses."

Early versions of organoids range from simple epithelial structures to complex, disorganized tissues with large cellular diversity. The current challenge is to engineer cellular complexity into organoids in a controlled manner that results in organized assembly and acquisition of tissue function. These efforts have relied on studies of organ assembly during embryonic development and have resulted in the development of organoids with multilayer tissue complexity and higher-order functions.

https://openalex.org/W2949218890,"A central goal of systems neuroscience is to relate an organism's neural activity to behavior. Neural population analyses often reduce the data dimensionality to focus on relevant activity patterns. A major hurdle to data analysis is spike sorting, and this problem is growing as the number of recorded neurons increases. Here, we investigate whether spike sorting is necessary to estimate neural population dynamics. The theory of random projections suggests that we can accurately estimate the geometry of low-dimensional manifolds from a small number of linear projections of the data. We recorded data using Neuropixels probes in motor cortex of nonhuman primates and reanalyzed data from three previous studies and found that neural dynamics and scientific conclusions are quite similar using multiunit threshold crossings rather than sorted neurons. This finding unlocks existing data for new analyses and informs the design and use of new electrode arrays for laboratory and clinical use."

Control of geometry, modulation of the physical environment, and priming with chemical signals reveal the intrinsic capacity of embryonic stem cells to make patterns. Adding the stem cells for the extraembryonic lineages generates three-dimensional models that are more autonomous from the environment and recapitulate many features of the pre- and postimplantation mouse embryo, including gastrulation.

This force, or Casimir effect, is caused by vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Effectively, more modes outside than between the objects results in the objects being pushed together. Zhao et al. show that the extent of the electromagnetic fluctuations can be controlled by coating one of the objects with a dielectric (Teflon), which changes the Casimir effect to a repulsive force at small distances. This then cancels out the force between plates and produces a point of stable equilibrium. Science , this issue p. 984"

Eighteen-week-old NZBWF1 [systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)] and NZW/LacJ (control) mice were treated with vehicle or LC40 (5 × 108 colony-forming units/d) for 15 wk. LC40 treatment reduced lupus disease activity, blood pressure, cardiac and renal hypertrophy, and splenomegaly in SLE mice. LC40 reduced the elevated T, B, regulatory T cells (Treg), and T helper (Th)-1 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes of lupus mice. LC40 lowered the higher plasma concentration of proinflammatory cytokines observed in lupus mice. Aortas from SLE mice showed reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine. Endothelial dysfunction found in SLE is related to an increase of both NADPH oxidase-driven superoxide production and eNOS phosphorylation at the inhibitory Thr495. These activities returned to normal values after a treatment with LC40. Probiotic administration to SLE mice reduced plasma LPS levels, which might be related to an improvement of the gut barrier integrity. LC40 treatment increases the Bifidobacterium count in gut microbiota of SLE mice. In conclusion, our findings identify the gut microbiota manipulation with LC40 as an alternative approach to the prevention of SLE and its associated vascular damage.—Toral, M., Robles-Vera, I., Romero, M., de la Visitación, N., Sánchez, M., O'Valle, F., Rodriguez-Nogales, A., Gálvez, J., Duarte, J., Jiménez, R.

https://openalex.org/W2948448074,"Background Healthcare coverage in Ethiopia has improved dramatically in recent decades. However, facility-based delivery remains persistently low, while maternal mortality remains high. This paper presents the prevalence and associated factors of disrespect and abuse (D&A) during childbirth in public health facilities of western Oromia, Ethiopia. Method A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 612 women from February 2017 to May 2017. Exit interview with the mothers were conducted upon discharge from the maternity ward. We measured D&A during childbirth using seven dimensions. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the association between experience of D&A and client characteristics and institutional factors. Result Three quarters (74.8%) of women reported experiencing at least one form of D&A during their facility childbirth. The types of D&A experienced by the women were; physical abuse (37.1%), non-dignified care (34.6%), non-consented care (54.1%), non-confidential care (40.4%), neglect (25.2%), detention (2.9%), and discrimination (13.2%). Experiences of D&A were 1.6 times more likely to be reported by women delivering at hospitals than health centers (OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.66). Women without a companion throughout their delivery were almost 10 times more likely than women who had a companion to encounter D&A (OR: 9.94, 95% CI: 5.72, 17.28). On the other hand, women with more than 1,368-birr (USD 57) monthly income were less likely to experience any type of D&A (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: .21, .65). Conclusion Three in four women reported experiencing at least one form of D&A during labor and delivery. This demonstrates a real disconnect between what the health system intends to achieve and what is practiced and calls for fundamental solutions in terms of both improving quality of facility-based delivery and ensuring women’s right to receive health care with dignity."
https://openalex.org/W2965568409,"Popularity-based approaches are widely adopted in music recommendation systems, both in industry and research. These approaches recommend to the target user what is currently popular among all users of the system. However, as the popularity distribution of music items typically is a long-tail distribution, popularity-based approaches to music recommendation fall short in satisfying listeners that have specialized music preferences far away from the global music mainstream. Addressing this gap, the contribution of this article is three-fold.First, we provide several quantitative measures describing the proximity of a user's music preference to the music mainstream. Assuming that there is a difference between the global music mainstream and a country-specific one, we define the measures at two levels: relating a listener's music preferences to the global music preferences of all users, or relating them to music preferences of the user's country. To quantify such music preferences, we define a music item's popularity in terms of artist playcounts (APC) and artist listener counts (ALC). Moreover, we adopt a distribution-based and a rank-based approach as means to decrease bias towards the head of the long-tail distribution. This eventually results in a framework of 6 measures to quantify music mainstream.Second, we perform in-depth quantitative and qualitative studies of music mainstream in that we (i) analyze differences between countries in terms of their level of mainstreaminess, (ii) uncover both positive and negative outliers (substantially higher and lower country-specific popularity, respectively, compared to the global mainstream), analyzing these with a mixed-methods approach, and (iii) investigate differences between countries in terms of listening preferences related to popular music artists. We conduct our studies and experiments using the standardized LFM-1b dataset, from which we analyze about 800,000,000 listening events shared by about 53,000 users (from 47 countries) of the music streaming platform Last.fm. We show that there are substantial country-specific differences in listeners' music consumption behavior with respect to the most popular artists listened to.Third, we demonstrate the applicability of our study results to improve music recommendation systems. To this end, we conduct rating prediction experiments in which we tailor recommendations to a user's level of preference for the music mainstream using the proposed 6 mainstreaminess measures: defined by a distribution-based or rank-based approach, defined on a global level or on a country level (for the user's country), and for APC or ALC. Our approach roughly equals a hybrid recommendation approach in which a demographic filtering strategy is implemented before collaborative filtering is performed. Results suggest that, in terms of rating prediction accuracy, each of the presented mainstreaminess definitions has its merits."

The contrasting roles of the AhR in the intestine and brain for cancer endpoints clearly differed from the parallel anti-inflammatory effects observed for noncancer endpoints. Thus, we reinvestigated the role of the AhR and kynurenine in established and patient-derived glioma (PDG) cells. In contrast with previous studies, our data show that kynurenine exhibits minimal effects on GBM cell invasion, and results of functional, genomic, and molecular studies confirm that the AhR protects against GBM cell invasion and growth. Based on the reported differences in the role of the AhR and tryptophan metabolites, including kynurenine in colorectal and brain cancers, we initially compared the Ah responsiveness of kynurenine and its metabolites in Caco2 colon and U87 GBM cells using induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 as endpoints (Figs. S1 and S2). The overall pattern of Ah responsiveness was similar in both cell lines with kynurenic acid and xanthurenic acid, which exhibits AhR activity in at least one of the cell lines, whereas kynurenine was inactive. The lack of AhR activity of kynurenine was somewhat surprising because of positive results in many cell lines (27Zang X. Zheng X. Hou Y. Hu M. Wang H. Bao X. Zhou F. Wang G. Hao H.

In some studies, AhR activity was determined using the AhR-responsive pGudLuc 6.1 plasmid reporter gene assay, and the results (Fig. S1D) show that kynurenine induced luciferase activity in U87 and Caco2 cells transfected with a DRE-luc construct. These results suggest that the AhR responsiveness of this compound is response- and cell context–dependent. The pro-invasion effects of kynurenine were observed previously in U87 GBM cells (26Opitz C.A. Litzenburger U.M. Sahm F. Ott M. Tritschler I. Trump S. Schumacher T. Jestaedt L. Schrenk D. Weller M. Jugold M. Guillemin G.J. Miller C.L. Lutz C.

Fig. 1A confirms expression of AhR mRNA and protein in U87, PDG 14-104s, and PDG 15-037 cells, whereas minimal levels were observed in PDG-015s cells. The results illustrated in Fig. 1B show that knockdown of the AhR with two oligonucleotides targeting the receptor (siAhR-1 and siAhR-2) efficiently decreased expression of AhR protein and increased invasion of the Ah-responsive U87, PDG 14-104s, and PDG 15-037 cells but did not affect invasion of Ah-nonresponsive PDG 14-015s cells in a Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 1C). The effect of kynurenine or kynurenic acid (in the presence or absence of the AhR) on GBM cell invasion was also investigated (Fig. 1, D and E), and the results were quantitated (Fig. 1F). Kynurenine and kynurenic acid at concentrations as high as 100 μm did not affect invasion of PDG 14-104s, PDG 15-037, or PDG 14-015s cells in the presence or absence of the AhR, whereas a small but significant increase was observed in U87 cells treated with kynurenine. Knockdown of the AhR increased invasion of U87, PDG 14-104s, and PDG 15-037 cells, with no change to PDG 14-015s cells, confirming that the endogenous AhR inhibits GBM cell invasion, in contrast to a previous report (26Opitz C.A. Litzenburger U.M. Sahm F. Ott M. Tritschler I. Trump S. Schumacher T. Jestaedt L. Schrenk D. Weller M. Jugold M. Guillemin G.J. Miller C.L. Lutz C.

Therefore, this study focused on further investigation of the role of the AhR in invasion of GBM cells. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to stably knock out AhR expression in the highly invasive PDG 15-037 cells (Fig. S3A), and loss of the AhR was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2A). PCR analysis of basal and TCDD-induced CYP1A1 mRNA levels, respectively, in WT, mock-transfected, and 15-037-AhRKO cells showed that induction was not observed in the absence of AhR expression (Fig. 2B). Incubation of equal numbers of WT, mock-transfected PDG 15-037, and PDG 15-037-AhRKO cells for 1 or 2 days showed that loss of the AhR in 15-037-AhRKO cells resulted in a small but significant increase in cell proliferation after 24 h (Fig. 2C), and this was lower after 48 h. Loss of the AhR resulted in a >4-fold increase in cell invasion in a Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 2D), and there was a more than 3.5-fold increase in invasion using a 3D tumor spheroid invasion assay compared with WT parent and mock transfected cells (Fig. 2E) (37Vinci M. Box C. Eccles S.A. Three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid invasion assay.J. Vis. Exp. 2015; 99 (25993495): e5268610.3791/52686Google Scholar). Moreover, knockdown of the AhR in 15-037 cells by RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9 also enhanced migration in a scratch assay (Fig. 2F), and loss of the AhR in 15-037 cells enhanced α5-integrin and vimentin expression, consistent with an increase in epithelial–mesenchymal transition of these cells (Fig. S3B). We also observed similar results for a second AhR-nonresponsive 15-037-AhRKO cell line generated by CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig. 3, C–E). Collectively, our results indicate that the AhR exhibits tumor suppressor–like activity in GBM cells and functions as an inhibitor of GBM cell invasion. Previous reports used the AhR antagonist CH223191 to investigate the functions of the AhR in GBM (38Gramatzki D. Pantazis G. Schittenhelm J. Tabatabai G. Köhle C. Wick W. Schwarz M. Weller M.

The results illustrated in Fig. 3A show that the AhR antagonist CH223191 slightly inhibited growth of WT PDG 15-037 cells; however, similar results were observed in AhR-deficient PDG 15-037 cells, suggesting an AhR-independent response. Moreover, a comparison of the effects of CH223191 on WT/AhRKO cell migration (Fig. 3B) (scratch assay) and invasion (Fig. 3C) showed that the inhibitory effects of CH223191 were observed in both AhR-expressing and AhR-silent cell lines, indicating that the effects of the AhR antagonist were AhR-independent. The AhR-independent action of CH223191 was also investigated in PDG 15-037 cells after knockdown by RNAi, and similar results were observed (Fig. 3C). Thus, the results of previous studies showing that CH22319 inhibits growth and invasion of glioblastoma cells (38Gramatzki D. Pantazis G. Schittenhelm J. Tabatabai G. Köhle C. Wick W. Schwarz M.

Significant differences between siCT and siAhR groups are indicated (**, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus, functional studies suggest that the AhR exhibits tumor suppressor-like activity in GBM cells, and this was further investigated at the genomic level. We examined the differences in gene expression in mock-transfected (control) PDG-15-037 versus AhR-deficient PDG 15-037 cells (transfected with siAhR) by RNA-Seq and observed that loss of the AhR altered the expression of 749 genes, with 268 decreased and 481 increased (Fig. 4A). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) demonstrated changes in the expression of genes associated with multiple pathways (Fig. 4B), including cell movement (e.g. invasion and migration), cell growth, and proliferation. Causal IPA analysis of the RNA-Seq results demonstrated that the p values and activation z-scores for the differentially expressed genes associated with movement of cancer cells were 3.09E−08 and −2.159, respectively, and for cancer cell invasion, the p value and activation z-scores were 6.55E−06 and −2.043, respectively. These data are consistent with the role of the AhR as in inhibitor of cell movement/invasion in GBM cells, and this complements the functional studies on the AhR. Fig. 4C illustrates the pathway analysis and possible interconnections of cell movement/invasion genes increased by AhR knockdown, and Fig. 4D summarizes changes in expression growth, invasion, and AhR axis gene expression after loss of the AhR in 15-037 GBM cells. Thus, the differences in the transcriptome and associated pathway in PDG 15-037 cells after AhR knockdown are consistent with the functional tumor suppressor–like activity of the AhR in GBM. The effects of AhR knockdown by RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 on expression of CYP1A1 and three pro-invasion genes that were detected in the RNA-Seq experiment are illustrated in Fig. 5, A–D, and show parallel effects on expression of CYP1A1 mRNA (decreased) and MMP-9, CXCL12, and CXCR4 mRNA (induced) after loss of the AhR. Moreover, AhR knockdown also increased MMP-9 but not MMP-2, as determined by zymography assay (Fig. 5E). Previous studies have demonstrated that CXCL12 (ligand)–CXCR4 (cognate receptor) interactions induce the pro-invasion gene MMP-9 (40Qiao N. Wang L. Wang T. Li H. Inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4/CXCR7 axis mediates G-protein signaling pathway to influence the invasion and migration of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.Tumour Biol. 2016; 37 (26715277): 8169-817910.1007/s13277-015-4686-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 41Yu Y.

The role of induced MMP-9 in enhanced invasion of AhR-deficient 15-037 cells (RNAi knockdown) was further investigated, and we observed that inhibition of CXCR4 signaling by AMD3100 or by direct MMP-9 inhibition significantly decreased invasion of 15-037 cells using the tumor spheroid invasion assay (Fig. 5G). These results indicate that activation of the CXCL12–CXCR4–MMP-9 pathway after loss of the AhR contributes to the enhanced invasion of 15-037 GBM cells in which the AhR is silenced. We also investigated contributions of the CXCL12–CXCR4–MMP-9 axis to the enhanced invasion of 15-037 AhRKO cells and found that the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 abrogated the increase of MMP-9 mRNA levels in the AhR-deficient cell lines (Fig. 6A). Moreover, both AMD3100 and the MMP-9 inhibitor significantly decreased invasion in 15-037 AhRKO cells (Fig. 6B), complementing results observed in 15-037 cells after AhR knockdown by RNAi (Fig. 5G). ChIP analysis of the proximal regions of the CYP1A1, CXCL12, MMP-9, CXCR4, and ITGA5 promoters in 15-037 WT and AhRKO cells revealed that loss of the AhR decreased AhR–promoter binding, decreased CYP1A1 gene promoter–associated pol II, and increased promoter-associated pol II on the CXCL12, MMP-9, CXCR4, and ITGA5 gene promoters (Fig. 6C). These results, showing that loss of AhR affects pol II binding, are consistent with gene/protein expression data (Fig. 5). We also investigated tumor development in a mouse (Foxn1nu) xenograft model, and after 6 weeks, we observed palpable tumors in four and five mice injected with WT and AhRKO 15-037 cells, respectively (n = 7/cell line), and tumors derived from AhRKO cells were larger than those derived from WT cells (Fig. 6D). Histopathology also showed that loss of the AhR increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen and ITGA5 staining, which is consistent with enhanced growth and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

The piriform cortex (PiC) codes olfactory information, and the inactivation of neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) can acutely trigger consumption. However, the neural circuit and cellular substrate of transition of olfactory perception into value-based actions remain elusive. We detected enhanced activity after social transmission between two mice in neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that target the NAc and receive projections from the PiC. Exposure to a conspecific potentiated the excitatory postsynaptic currents in NAc projectors, whereas blocking transmission from PiC to mPFC prevented social transmission. Thus, synaptic plasticity in the mPFC is a cellular substrate of social transmission of food safety."

https://openalex.org/W2948483706,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein expressed in neuronal axons. Hyperphosphorylated tau is a major component of neurofibrillary tangles, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates are also found in many neurodegenerative diseases, collectively referred to as tauopathies, and tau mutations are associated with familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Previous studies have generated transgenic mice with mutant tau as tauopathy models, but nonhuman primates, which are more similar to humans, may be a better model to study tauopathies. For example, the common marmoset is poised as a nonhuman primate model for investigating the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, no biochemical studies of tau have been conducted in marmoset brains. Here, we investigated several important aspects of tau, including expression of different tau isoforms and its phosphorylation status, in the marmoset brain. We found that marmoset tau does not possess the primate-unique motif in its N-terminal domain. We also discovered that the tau isoform expression pattern in marmosets is more similar to that of mice than that of humans, with adult marmoset brains expressing only four-repeat tau isoforms as in adult mice but unlike in adult human brains. Of note, tau in brains of marmoset newborns was phosphorylated at several sites associated with AD pathology. However, in adult marmoset brains, much of this phosphorylation was lost, except for Ser-202 and Ser-404 phosphorylation. These results reveal key features of tau expression and phosphorylation in the marmoset brain, a potentially useful nonhuman primate model of neurodegenerative diseases."

Understanding the molecular networks controlling hepatocellular lipid deposition is therefore essential for developing new strategies to effectively prevent and treat this complex disease. Here, we describe a new regulator of lipid partitioning in human hepatocytes: mammalian sterile 20-like (MST) 3. We found that MST3 protein coats lipid droplets in mouse and human liver cells. Knockdown of MST3 attenuated lipid accumulation in human hepatocytes by stimulating β-oxidation and triacylglycerol secretion while inhibiting fatty acid influx and lipid synthesis. We also observed that lipogenic gene expression and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase protein abundance were reduced in MST3-deficient hepatocytes, providing insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the decreased lipid storage. Furthermore, MST3 expression was positively correlated with key features of NASH (i.e., hepatic lipid content, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning) in human liver biopsies. In summary, our results reveal a role of MST3 in controlling the dynamic metabolic balance of liver lipid catabolism vs. lipid anabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2962920423,"Most members of the family of proteins containing a transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif (TMBIM) have anti-apoptotic activity, but their in vivo functions and intracellular mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we report that zebrafish Tmbim3a/Grinaa functions in the prevention of cold-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis. Using a gene-trapping approach, we obtained a mutant zebrafish line in which the expression of the tmbim3a/grinaa gene is disrupted by a Tol2 transposon insertion. Homozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutant larvae exhibited time-dependently increased mortality and apoptosis under cold exposure (at 16 °C). Mechanistically, using immunofluorescence, fluorescence-based assessments of intracellular/mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, mitochondrial membrane potential measurements, and Ca2+-ATPase assays, we found that cold exposure suppresses sarcoplasmic/ER Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity and induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER stress. We also found that the cold-induced ER stress is increased in homozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutant embryos. The cold-stress hypersensitivity of the tmbim3a/grinaa mutants was tightly associated with disrupted intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, followed by mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and cytochrome c release, leading to the activation of caspase 9– and caspase-3–mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Treatment of zebrafish larvae with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetate-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) or with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), an inhibitor of the calcium-releasing protein inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), alleviated cold-induced cell death. Together, these findings unveil a key role of Tmbim3a/Grinaa in relieving cold-induced ER stress and in protecting cells against caspase 9– and caspase 3–mediated apoptosis during zebrafish development.

The cold-stress hypersensitivity of the tmbim3a/grinaa mutants was tightly associated with disrupted intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, followed by mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and cytochrome c release, leading to the activation of caspase 9– and caspase-3–mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Treatment of zebrafish larvae with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetate-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) or with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), an inhibitor of the calcium-releasing protein inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), alleviated cold-induced cell death. Together, these findings unveil a key role of Tmbim3a/Grinaa in relieving cold-induced ER stress and in protecting cells against caspase 9– and caspase 3–mediated apoptosis during zebrafish development. Apoptosis is a conserved biological process essential for embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and responses to pathogens and other stresses in vertebrates (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell death: critical control points.Cell. 2004; 116 (14744432): 205-21910.1016/S0092-8674(04)00046-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Many regulators and effectors have been identified to control the death of cells in animals, and their abnormal expression can lead to a variety of diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, and degenerative disorders (2Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Apoptosis signaling.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69 (10966458): 217-24510.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). During the past two decades, a number of transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif–containing (TMBIM) family proteins, including TMBIM1–TMBIM6, were identified to control cell death (3Rojas-Rivera D.

TMBIM family proteins are highly conserved in mammals, zebrafish, and flies, with homologs present even in species where no BCL-2 family members have been identified, including plants, yeast, and many viruses (4Hu L. Smith T.F. Goldberger G. LFG: a candidate apoptosis regulatory gene family.Apoptosis. 2009; 14 (19784873): 1255-126510.1007/s10495-009-0402-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the control of cell death by TMBIM family proteins may represent a more fundamental and highly conserved pathway in lower organisms (5Rojas-Rivera D. Hetz C.

However, the biological and physiological functions of most TMBIM proteins remain poorly characterized due to the lack of in vivo verification.

However, ectopic expression of mouse TMBIM3/GRINA specifically reduced cell death induced by several ER stress agents, but not by other agents that activate both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis (3Rojas-Rivera D.

Moreover, TMBIM3/GRINA and TMBIM6/BI-1 can form a protein complex, and their double mutants are lethal and extremely susceptible to pharmacological ER stress (3Rojas-Rivera D. Armisén R. Colombo A.

Temperature is one of environmental factors that determine nearly all life activities of fishes, including embryonic development, growth, reproduction, metabolism, behavior, and distribution. Temperature approaching to or beyond the low temperature limit of fishes can severely disturb their physiological, biochemical, and metabolic functions as well as behaviors, which ultimately results in mortality. It is reported that cold-induced apoptosis in cultured hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells was mediated by reactive oxygen species (7Rauen U. Polzar B. Stephan H. Mannherz H.G. de Groot H. Cold-induced apoptosis in cultured hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells: mediation by reactive oxygen species.FASEB J. 1999; 13 (9872940): 155-16810.1096/fasebj.13.1.155Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A large number of differentially expressed genes in previous studies were identified from fish models under cold exposure and uncovered key biological processes and signaling pathways responding to cold stress (8Hu P.

In addition to major cold responses, such as antioxidant response, increased mitochondrial function, and membrane compositional changes, transcriptomic analysis of liver in gilthead sea bream has revealed a key role of unfolded protein response (UPR) to ER stress during short- and long-term exposure to cold (11Mininni A.N.

Liver transcriptome analysis in gilthead sea bream upon exposure to low temperature.BMC Genomics. 2014; 15 (25194679): 76510.1186/1471-2164-15-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, molecular mechanisms controlling the cell death and individual mortality of fish under cold exposure remain largely unclear. Zebrafish is widely used as a research model for multiple disciplines, including developmental biology, genetics, physiology, toxicology, and environmental genomics (9Long Y. Song G. Yan J. He X. Li Q. Cui Z. Transcriptomic characterization of cold acclimation in larval zebrafish.BMC Genomics. 2013; 14 (24024969): 612-71210.1186/1471-2164-14-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Two TMBIM3-like proteins, Tmbim3a/Grinaa and Tmbim3b/Grinab, can be found in the genome of zebrafish. The transcription of the tmbim3a/grinaa gene in cold-acclimated zebrafish was significantly up-regulated by RNA-Seq analysis of our previous study (10Long Y. Li L. Li Q. He X. Cui Z. Transcriptomic characterization of temperature stress responses in larval zebrafish.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (22666345)e3720910.1371/journal.pone.0037209Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Knockdown of Tmbim3b/Grinab in zebrafish using morpholino led to enhanced apoptosis during development of the nervous system (3Rojas-Rivera D. Armisén R. Colombo A. Martínez G. Eguiguren A.L. Díaz A. Kiviluoto S. Rodríguez D. Patron M. Rizzuto R. Bultynck G. Concha M.L. Sierralta J. Stutzin A. Hetz C. TMBIM3/GRINA is a novel unfolded protein response (UPR) target gene that controls apoptosis through the modulation of ER calcium homeostasis.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19 (22240901): 1013-102610.1038/cdd.2011.189Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, functions and mechanisms of Tmbim3/Grina in zebrafish remain largely unknown. In this study, we generated a tmbim3a/grinaa mutant through a gene-trapping approach. Homozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutants are viable and fertile, but their larvae exhibited an increased individual mortality and apoptosis under cold stress. We further dissected Tmbim3a/Grinaa functions in ER-Ca2+ homeostasis and ER stress–mediated intracellular signaling for the control of apoptosis in developing embryos of zebrafish exposed to low temperature. In a screening for insertion mutants through a Tol2 transposon–mediated gene-trapping approach (12Clark K.J. Balciunas D. Pogoda H.M. Ding Y. Westcot S.E. Bedell V.M. Greenwood T.M. Urban M.D. Skuster K.J. Petzold A.M. Ni J. Nielsen A.L. Patowary A. Scaria V. Sivasubbu S. et al.In vivo protein trapping produces a functional expression codex of the vertebrate proteome.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8 (21552255): 506-51510.1038/nmeth.1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we identified a zebrafish line that carries a Tol2 transposon in the second intron of the tmbim3a/grinaa gene through PCR-based genome walking assays (Fig. 1A). Homozygous (Homo) and heterozygous (Hetero) mutants can be detected with two PCR primer sets, f/r1 and f/r2, respectively (Fig. 1B). Tmbim3a/Grinaa of zebrafish (Z-grinaa) shares a higher degree of amino acid sequence similarity with those of human GRINA and mouse Grina than Tmbim3b/Grinab (Z-grinab) (Fig. S1). To generate homozygous mutants, the founder fish (F0) was crossed with WT fish to produce F1 offspring, and 29.2% of F1 fish carried the Tol2 transposon in their genome. The positive F1 fish were then mated with WT fish to obtain F2 offspring. PCR analysis indicated that the positive rate of F2 fish was 46.1% (Table S2). Moreover, 21.2% (42 of 198) of F3 offspring that were produced by the intercross of positive F2 individuals were homozygous mutants. These data fit well with the standard Mendelian inheritance ratio (50 and 25% in F2 and F3 offspring, respectively), suggesting that the Tol2 transposon in this fish line was integrated into a single chromosomal locus. The insertion of the Tol2 transposon into the tmbim3a/grinaa locus would produce a fused transcript containing the second exon of tmbim3a/grinaa and the RFP coding sequence in tmbim3a/grinaa mutants (Fig. 1C). Indeed, fused transcripts were detected only in heterozygous and homozygous mutants using a primer set F/R2 for RT-PCR, and the transcription of endogenous tmbim3a/grinaa gene was markedly blocked by the Tol2 insertion in heterozygous and homozygous mutants when detected with a primer set F/R1 (Fig. 1D) and whole-mount in situ hybridization (Fig. 1E). qPCR indicated that transcriptional levels of endogenous tmbim3a/grinaa gene in heterozygous and homozygous embryos at 60 h post-fertilization (hpf) decreased to 51.8 and 5.3% of that in WT embryos, respectively (Fig. 1F). However, homozygous embryos at 60 hpf were morphologically the same as the WT embryos (Fig. 1G). Thus, homozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutants are viable and fertile under standard rearing conditions and can be used as a loss-of-function model to study physiological and cellular roles of endogenous TMBIM3a/Grinaa. Spatiotemporal expression patterns of RFP in heterozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutant embryos were imaged. As shown in Fig. 2A, RFP was ubiquitously distributed in developing embryos before 12 hpf (Fig. 2A, a1 and a2) and prominently expressed in the spinal cord (sc) at 24 hpf (Fig. 2A, a3). Relatively high levels of RFP were observed in the lateral line primordium (llp), hindbrain (hb), cerebellum (ce), and eyes (ey) of embryos at 48–96 hpf (Fig. 2A, a4–a6). RFP appeared in the intestine (in) of embryos at 120 hpf (Fig. 2A, a7). These RFP expression patterns in heterozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutant embryos were almost identical to the spatiotemporal expression patterns of endogenous tmbim3a/grinaa gene in developing WT embryos examined with whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) assays (Fig. 2B). Moreover, tmbim3a/grinaa mRNA was detectable at variable levels in embryos at 6–120 hpf (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the RFP expression in tmbim3a/grinaa mutants is precisely controlled by the tmbim3a/grinaa promoter. The subcellular distribution of Tmbim3a/Grinaa in ZF4 cells (zebrafish embryonic fibroblast–like cell line) was further detected with immunofluorescence staining. We found that HA-tagged TMBIM3a/Grinaa was co-localized well with an ER tracker (Fig. 2D), suggesting that physiological and cellular functions of zebrafish TMBIM3a/Grinaa are likely associated with the ER. Because homozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutants are viable and fertile, we explored the effects of cold stress on developing zebrafish embryos by examination of the death and hatching rates of developing embryos. We have previously found that WT zebrafish larvae exposed to 16–18 °C developed cold acclimation response and showed no mortality during the acclimation process (13Long Y. Yan J. Song G. Li X. Li X. Li Q. Cui Z. Transcriptional events co-regulated by hypoxia and cold stresses in Zebrafish larvae.BMC Genomics. 2015; 16 (25975375): 38510.1186/s12864-015-1560-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, we dissected the function of Tmbim3a/Grinaa under cold stress at 16 °C. As shown in Fig. 3A, death rates of homozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutant embryos exposed to 16 °C for 36–240 h markedly increased from 6 to 92% compared with those of WT embryos from 2 to 8%, and average hatching rates of homozygous and WT embryos were 28 and 96%, respectively (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that Tmbim3a/Grinaa plays a protective role during zebrafish embryogenesis under cold condition. This notion was supported by the significant induction of endogenous tmbim3a/grinaa expression in WT larvae and rfp expression in homozygous mutants at 16 °C (Fig. 3C) as well as the induced RFP fluorescence intensity in homozygous mutant embryos at 16 °C (Fig. 3D). Because the swimming behavior of zebrafish has been used as an indicator for cold tolerance (14Wang Q. Tan X. Jiao S. You F. Zhang P.-J. Analyzing cold tolerance mechanism in transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio).PLoS One. 2014; 9 (25058652)e10249210.1371/journal.pone.0102492Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), zebrafish larvae at 96 hpf were exposed to 16 °C for 24 h and then transferred to a Zebra-view system observation chamber to record the spontaneous swimming behavior for 2 h. The moving paths at different intervals were recorded and analyzed according to the intensities of three classes of swimming activity: slow (black), mild (green), and active (red). In the control group at 28 °C, homozygous and WT larvae have a similar swimming activity. After exposure to 16 °C for 24 h, the swimming activity of WT larvae was slightly suppressed, but homozygous mutant larvae instantly lost their swimming ability for the first 5 min and then started to move at a mild or slow swimming activity (Fig. 3E). These results imply that homozygous mutant larvae exhibited a lower swimming ability than that of WT under cold stress. To address cellular mechanisms underlying the roles of Tmbim3a/Grinaa in protection of embryos exposed to low temperature, phenotypic and cellular defects of developing embryos were examined. As shown in Fig. 4A, homozygous mutant embryos at 36 hpf were morphologically indistinguishable from the WT except for the appearance of apoptotic dots on the face of the yolk after exposure to 16 °C for 24 h. At 48 hpf, the numbers of dying cells were drastically found in the brain, spinal cord, and tail (data not shown). The ratio of homozygous mutant embryos with morphological defects (abnormal) was mostly rescued by injection of synthetic tmbim3a/grinaa capped mRNA (26.4%, injected) compared with those of uninjected (81.7%, uninj) and WT (0%, WT) controls (Fig. 4B). The expression of injected tmbim3a/grinaa capped mRNA was proved by Western blotting (Fig. S2A). However, the survival rates of WT and homozygous mutants at 16 °C were not significantly affected by injection of tmbim3b/grinab-MO (3Rojas-Rivera D. Armisén R. Colombo A. Martínez G. Eguiguren A.L. Díaz A. Kiviluoto S. Rodríguez D. Patron M. Rizzuto R. Bultynck G. Concha M.L. Sierralta J. Stutzin A. Hetz C. TMBIM3/GRINA is a novel unfolded protein response (UPR) target gene that controls apoptosis through the modulation of ER calcium homeostasis.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19 (22240901): 1013-102610.1038/cdd.2011.189Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or tmbim3b/grinab capped mRNA (Fig. S3). These data suggest that Tmbim3a/Grinaa and Tmbim3b/Grinab have differential roles in zebrafish and that Tmbim3a/Grinaa plays a dominant role in protection of developing embryos from cold-induced cell death. We next employed TUNEL assays to detect apoptotic cells of developing embryos of WT and tmbim3a/grinaa embryos under normal conditions and cold stress. As shown in Fig. 4C and Fig. S2B, apoptotic cells appeared in the tail region of homozygous mutants and WT embryos maintained at 28 °C and exposed to 16 °C for 60 h. There is no significant difference in apoptotic cell numbers between homozygous mutants and WT embryos at 28 °C (Fig. S2B); however, the number of apoptotic cells in homozygous mutants at 16 °C was significantly higher than that in the WT group (Fig. 4, C and D). Using transmission EM, we found that most of the cells in the tail of WT embryos at 16 °C maintained the integrity of the cell membrane and nucleus; however, a large number of cells in the tail of homozygous mutants demonstrated apoptotic features, including cell shrinkage, nuclear chromatin concentration, broken cell membranes, and nuclear lysis (Fig. 4E). Because cold stress was reported to induce ferroptosis elsewhere (15Hattori K. Ishikawa H. Sakauchi C. Takayanagi S. Naguro I. Ichijo H. Cold stress-induced ferroptosis involves the ASK1-p38 pathway.EMBO Rep. 2017; 18 (28887319): 2067-207810.15252/embr.201744228Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we next examined the involvement of ferroptosis under cold exposure by using three ferroptosis inhibitors, including the iron chelator deferoxamine (16Chen B. Yan Y.L. Liu C. Bo L. Li G.F. Wang H. Xu Y.J. Therapeutic effect of deferoxamine on iron overload-induced inhibition of osteogenesis in a zebrafish model.Calcif. Tissue Int. 2014; 94 (24414856): 353-36010.1007/s00223-013-9817-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the MEK inhibitor U0126 (17Hawkins T.A. Cavodeassi F. Erdélyi F. Szabó G. Lele Z. The small molecule Mek1/2 inhibitor U0126 disrupts the chordamesoderm to notochord transition in zebrafish.BMC Dev. Biol. 2008; 8 (18419805): 42-5210.1186/1471-213X-8-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the lipid peroxide scavenger Fer-1 (15Hattori K. Ishikawa H. Sakauchi C. Takayanagi S. Naguro I. Ichijo H. Cold stress-induced ferroptosis involves the ASK1-p38 pathway.EMBO Rep. 2017; 18 (28887319): 2067-207810.15252/embr.201744228Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). If ferroptosis occurred under cold exposure, decreased survival rates of zebrafish larvae at 16 °C could be rescued by these inhibitors. However, the survival rates of embryos at 28 and 16 °C were not significantly affected by these ferroptosis inhibitors (Fig. S4), suggesting that ferroptosis does not account for individual death of developing zebrafish embryos under cold exposure at 16 °C. Taken together, cold stress can trigger apoptotic cell death in developing embryos and homozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutants are more sensitive to cold stress than the WT. Because TMBIM3/Grina is an evolutionarily conserved ER-resident protein, we examined effects of Tmbim3a/Grinaa deficiency on ER response to prolonged cold exposure by detecting the expression of UPR-related marker genes, including atf6, bip, chop, edem, and ire1α. qPCR analysis indicated that the transcriptional levels of these genes were significantly up-regulated in WT embryos when exposed to 16 °C versus 28 °C for 60 h (from 12 to 72 hpf) (Fig. 5A). Cold-induced expression of Chop in homozygous mutant and WT embryos was also confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5B). In addition, time course analysis revealed that the expression of these five genes was significantly induced by cold exposure during different time periods: chop from 12 to 18 hpf; atf6, bip, and edem from 12 to 24 hpf; and irelα from 12 to 36 hpf (Fig. 5C). Strikingly, the expression levels of UPR-related ER stress genes in homozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutants were significantly higher than those in WT embryos after exposure to 16 °C for 60 h (from 12 to 72 hpf) (Fig. 5D). This suggests that cold exposure can induce an ER stress response marked by the activation of UPR pathways, and homozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutants display an increased ER stress response to cold exposure. The Ca2+-ATPase of the SERCA type plays an important role in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by pumping an active Ca2+ efflux from the cytoplasm into the ER (18Higgins E.R. Cannell M.B. Sneyd J. A buffering SERCA pump in models of calcium dynamics.Biophys. J. 2006; 91 (16617079): 151-16310.1529/biophysj.105.075747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To understand whether the activity of SERCA was affected by cold exposure, we analyzed the expression of three highly conserved genes, atp2a1, atp2a2a, and atp2a2b, that encode proteins of the SERCA pump (19Periasamy M. Kalyanasundaram A. SERCA pump isoforms: their role in calcium transport and disease.Muscle Nerve. 2007; 35 (17286271): 430-44210.1002/mus.20745Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) in zebrafish embryos. Consistent with the RNA-Seq data in our previous study (9Long Y. Song G. Yan J. He X. Li Q. Cui Z. Transcriptomic characterization of cold acclimation in larval zebrafish.BMC Genomics. 2013; 14 (24024969): 612-71210.1186/1471-2164-14-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), cold exposure at 16 °C for 60 h (from 12 to 72 hpf) led to a significant increase in the mRNA levels of the three genes in WT (Fig. 6A) and homozygous tmbim3a/grinaa mutants (Fig. S5). Despite a significant increase at mRNA levels, Ca2+-ATPase activity of SERCA in developing embryos was significantly decreased after exposure to cold stress for 12–60 h (from 24 to 72 hpf) (Fig. 6B). We next investigated whether the elevated activity of SERCA prevents cold-induced ER stress and apoptosis using an allosteric SERCA activator, CDN1163 (20Kang S. Dahl R. Hsieh W. Shin A. Zsebo K.M.

Similar to the treatment with thapsigargin (a specific SERCA inhibitor) at 28 °C, cold exposure at 16 °C led to a significant decrease in SERCA activity; however, CDN1163 treatment at 28 and 16 °C significantly enhanced the SERCA activity (Fig. 6C). The involvement of SERCA activity in the control of ER stress was shown by the fact that cold-induced chop expression was markedly suppressed by CDN1163 or classical ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA, but treatment with CDN1163 or 4-PBA could not abolish the cold-induced ER stress (Fig. 6D).

The spatial distribution of these dimensions can help in conservation decisions through the location of complementary areas with high diversity. We analyzed congruence in spatial patterns of species richness and functional diversity of cricetid rodents in the state of Oaxaca, southern Mexico, at different scales, and environmental variables related. Potential distribution models were produced for 49 species of cricetids in Maxent and superimposed to obtain potential communities in cells of 25, 50,100, 200 and 400 km2. We estimated species richness (SR) and functional diversity (SES.FD) eliminating the species richness effect through null models. The patterns and spatial congruence of species richness and functional diversity are described. The relationships between the environmental variables (elevation, temperature, precipitation, net primary productivity and potential evapotranspiration) and the SR and SES.FD were explored using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The highest species richness was found in mountainous ecosystems while the highest functional diversity was in tropical forests, revealing a spatial incongruence among these components of biodiversity (r = -0.14, p = 0.42; Pearson correlation). The locations of the cells of low congruence varied according to spatial resolution. In univariate models, elevation was the variable that best explained species richness (R2 = 0.77). No single variable explained the functional diversity; however, the models that included multiple environmental variables partially explained both the high and low functional diversity. The different patterns suggest that different historic, ecological and environmental processes could be responsible for the community structure of cricetid rodents in Oaxaca. These results indicate that one great challenge to be met to achieve more effective planning for biological conservation is to integrate knowledge regarding the spatial distribution of different dimensions of biodiversity."

Second, to evaluate the agreement between computer-based scoring algorithms and compare them with human rating.Reading performance was measured for 101 individuals with low vision, using the Portuguese version of the MNREAD test. Seven raters estimated the maximum reading speed (MRS) and critical print size (CPS) of each individual MNREAD curve. MRS and CPS were also calculated automatically for each curve using two different algorithms: the original standard deviation method (SDev) and a non-linear mixed effects (NLME) modeling. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to estimate absolute agreement between raters and/or algorithms.Absolute agreement between raters was 'excellent' for MRS (ICC = 0.97; 95%CI [0.96, 0.98]) and 'moderate' to 'good' for CPS (ICC = 0.77; 95%CI [0.69, 0.83]). For CPS, inter-rater reliability was poorer among less experienced raters (ICC = 0.70; 95%CI [0.57, 0.80]) when compared to experienced ones (ICC = 0.82; 95%CI [0.76, 0.88]). Absolute agreement between the two algorithms was 'excellent' for MRS (ICC = 0.96; 95%CI [0.91, 0.98]). For CPS, the best possible agreement was found for CPS defined as the print size sustaining 80% of MRS (ICC = 0.77; 95%CI [0.68, 0.84]). Absolute agreement between raters and automated methods was 'excellent' for MRS (ICC = 0.96; 95% CI [0.88, 0.98] for SDev; ICC = 0.97; 95% CI [0.95, 0.98] for NLME). For CPS, absolute agreement between raters and SDev ranged from 'poor' to 'good' (ICC = 0.66; 95% CI [0.3, 0.80]), while agreement between raters and NLME was 'good' (ICC = 0.83; 95% CI [0.76, 0.88]).For MRS, inter-rater reliability is excellent, even considering the possibility of noisy and/or incomplete data collected in low-vision individuals. For CPS, inter-rater reliability is lower. This may be problematic, for instance in the context of multisite investigations or follow-up examinations. The NLME method showed better agreement with the raters than the SDev method for both reading parameters. Setting up consensual guidelines to deal with ambiguous curves may help improve reliability. While the exact definition of CPS should be chosen on a case-by-case basis depending on the clinician or researcher's motivations, evidence suggests that estimating CPS as the smallest print size sustaining about 80% of MRS would increase inter-rater reliability."
https://openalex.org/W2914047661,"Schwann cells myelinate selected axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and contribute to fast saltatory conduction via the formation of compact myelin, in which water is excluded from between tightly adhered lipid bilayers. Peripheral neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS), are incurable demyelinating conditions that result in pain, decrease in muscle mass, and functional impairment. Many Schwann cell proteins, which are directly involved in the stability of compact myelin or its development, are subject to mutations linked to these neuropathies. The most abundant PNS myelin protein is protein zero (P0); point mutations in this transmembrane protein cause CMT subtype 1B and DSS. P0 tethers apposing lipid bilayers together through its extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain. Additionally, P0 contains a cytoplasmic tail (P0ct), which is membrane-associated and contributes to the physical properties of the lipid membrane. Six CMT- and DSS-associated missense mutations have been reported in P0ct. We generated recombinant disease mutant variants of P0ct and characterized them using biophysical methods. Compared to wild-type P0ct, some mutants have negligible differences in function and folding, while others highlight functionally important amino acids within P0ct. For example, the D224Y variant of P0ct induced tight membrane multilayer stacking. Our results show a putative molecular basis for the hypermyelinating phenotype observed in patients with this particular mutation and provide overall information on the effects of disease-linked mutations in a flexible, membrane-binding protein segment. Using neutron reflectometry, we additionally show that P0ct embeds deep into a lipid bilayer, explaining the observed effects of P0ct on the physical properties of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2964484378,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The NF2 gene encodes the tumor suppressor merlin, and loss of merlin activity promotes tumorigenesis and causes NF2. Cellular redox signaling has been implicated in different stages of tumor development. Among reactive nitrogen species, peroxynitrite is the most powerful oxidant produced by cells. We recently showed that peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration down-regulates mitochondrial metabolism in tumor cells. However, whether peroxynitrite supports a metabolic shift that could be exploited for therapeutic development is unknown. Here, we show that vestibular schwannomas from NF2 patients and human, merlin-deficient (MD) Schwann cells have high levels of endogenous tyrosine nitration, indicating production of peroxynitrite. Furthermore, scavenging or inhibiting peroxynitrite formation significantly and selectively decreased survival of human and mouse MD-Schwann cells. Using multiple complementary methods, we also found that merlin deficiency leads to a reprogramming of energy metabolism characterized by a peroxynitrite-dependent decrease of oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolysis and glutaminolysis. In MD-Schwann cells, scavenging of peroxynitrite increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and membrane potential, mediated by the up-regulation of the levels and activity of mitochondrial complex IV. This increase in mitochondrial activity correlated with a decrease in the glycolytic rate and glutamine dependence. This is the first demonstration of a peroxynitrite-dependent reprogramming of energy metabolism in tumor cells. Oxidized proteins constitute a novel target for therapeutic development not only for the treatment of NF2 schwannomas but also other tumors in which peroxynitrite plays a regulatory role."

We adopted a cross-sectional quantitative study design for this study, which was performed in three unions (sub-districts) located in Raiganj Upazila of the Sirajganj district in Bangladesh. Using a validated tool, a screening program was conducted at the household level. After initial screening, a team of ophthalmologists confirmed the diagnoses by clinical examinations. The prevalence of childhood blindness was observed to be 6.3 per 10,000 children, whereas the rate of uniocular blindness was 4.8 per 10,000 children. Congenital problems were the major causes of both uniocular and binocular blindness (uniocular blindness: 84% and binocular blindness: 92%). The whole globe was the site responsible for binocular blindness (28.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.1, 47.7), whereas the cornea was responsible for uniocular blindness (57.8%, 95% CI: 35.3, 78.1). Childhood blindness is a public health problem in Bangladesh and is highly prevalent, regardless of sex. The major causes of childhood blindness are congenital."

Here, we applied solution NMR and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to structurally characterize full-length NHERF1 and disease-associated variants that are implicated in impaired phosphate homeostasis. Using NMR, we mapped the modular architecture of NHERF1, which is composed of two structurally-independent PDZ domains that are connected by a flexible, disordered linker. We observed that the ultra-long and disordered C-terminal tail of NHERF1 has a type 1 PDZ-binding motif that interacts weakly with the proximal, second PDZ domain to form a dynamically autoinhibited structure. Using ensemble-optimized analysis of SANS data, we extracted the molecular size distribution of structures from the extensive conformational space sampled by the flexible chain. Our results revealed that NHERF1 is a diffuse ensemble of variable PDZ domain configurations and a disordered C-terminal tail. The joint NMR/SANS data analyses of three disease variants (L110V, R153Q, and E225K) revealed significant differences in the local PDZ domain structures and in the global conformations compared with the WT protein. Furthermore, we show that the substitutions affect the affinity and kinetics of NHERF1 binding to ezrin and to a C-terminal peptide from G protein–coupled receptor kinase 6A (GRK6A).

In humans, NHERF1 is reversibly phosphorylated at Ser-290 by a multiprotein kinase cascade involving GRK6A, which in turn regulates PTH-sensitive, NPT2A (sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2A)-mediated phosphate uptake (23Hall R.A.

Although GRK6A has much higher affinity for the N-terminal PDZ1 domain, it is through interactions with the partially masked PDZ2 domain that NHERF1 is phosphorylated in the C-terminal hinge region (20Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Oligomerization of NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 PDZ domains: differential regulation by association with receptor carboxyl termini and by phosphorylation.Biochemistry. 2001; 40 (11456497): 8572-858010.1021/bi0103516Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have further evaluated the extent to which the structural differences affect disease mutant interactions with ezrin and G protein–coupled receptor kinase A (GRK6A). We used SPR to measure the binding affinity and the kinetics of the association of each of the three mutants with ezFERM and a C-terminal peptide from GRK6A. Collectively, the results provide a structural and dynamic framework for understanding the internal mechanics of WT and NHERF1 variants in key functional states. Using structural information provided by NMR chemical shift analysis, we confirmed the boundaries of the structured domains, the nature of interdomain contacts, and the structural propensities of the linker regions in full-length NHERF1. The initial characterization focused on the autoinhibited and open state triggered by association of NHERF1(wt) with the FERM domain of ezrin (ezFERM). Despite the relatively high-molecular mass of NHERF1 (∼39 kDa) and its complex with ezFERM (∼79 kDa), the high quality of the 2D 15N-TROSY spectra (Fig. 2A) enabled us to successfully assign ∼76% of the backbone resonances of the 358-residue construct, using 2H/13C/15N-labeled samples and TROSY-based triple resonance experiments. In NHERF1(wt), the “on-off” association of PDZ2 with the C-terminal residues results in extensive broadening of backbone amide resonances in both PDZ2 (α2 and β2–β3) and EB (residues 337–358) domains due to coalescence of resonances on intermediate time scales. In the ezFERM-bound state, the conformational exchange in the PDZ2 domain is quenched, and some of the largest chemical shift changes mapped to residues in the ligand-binding site (Fig. 2B). Unexpectedly, we also observed line-broadening in the β2 strand (residues 25–31) in the PDZ1 ligand-binding site. Like the PDZ2 domain, we recovered the intensity of the lost signals in PDZ1 upon ezFERM binding. Collectively, these changes are consistent with transient autoinhibitory interactions involving the PDZ2 domain and to a lesser extent the PDZ1 domain. The secondary structure predictions obtained from the analysis of the backbone chemical shifts (Cα, Cβ, C′, N, and HN) of NHERF1 in the autoinhibited state using TALOS+ (25Shen Y. Bax A. Protein structural information derived from NMR chemical shift with the neural network program TALOS-N.Methods Mol.

The secondary structure profile is identical to the αβ fold of the isolated PDZ domains (16Bhattacharya S. Dai Z. Li J. Baxter S. Callaway D.J. Cowburn D. Bu Z. A conformational switch in the scaffolding protein NHERF1 controls autoinhibition and complex formation.J. Biol.

The random coil index (RCI) from TALOS+ analysis indicates that the linker regions, connecting PDZ1–PDZ2 domains (residues 112–146) and between PDZ2–EB domains (residues 252–324), have disordered backbones (Fig. S1). To confirm the RCI predictions, we compared the experimental chemical shifts against the random coil values incorporated in the POTENCI database used for identifying intrinsically-disordered proteins (26Nielsen J.T. Mulder F.A.A. POTENCI: prediction of temperature, neighbor and pH-corrected chemical shifts for intrinsically disordered proteins.J. Biomol. NMR. 2018; 70 (29399725): 141-16510.1007/s10858-018-0166-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The excellent agreement between the predicted random coil shifts of the linker residues and the corresponding experimental values confirmed that these regions are intrinsically disordered and completely flexible (Fig. 3). The unusually long (residues 262–324) and disordered C-terminal tail lends credence to the possibility that the EBD could interact with both PDZ domains, albeit with different affinities. In the isolated PDZ1 domain, the residues in the ligand-binding site can be observed in the 2D 15N HSQC spectrum (17Bhattacharya S. Ju J.H. Orlova N. Khajeh J.A. Cowburn D. Bu Z. Ligand-induced dynamic changes in extended PDZ domains from NHERF1.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425 (23583913): 2509-252810.1016/j.jmb.2013.04.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hence, the logical origin of the observed loss–of–signal in PDZ1 from full-length NHERF1 is either a weak intra- or intermolecular interaction with an internal binding motif or the C-terminal sequence (−FSNL). Because we recovered the lost signal intensity upon the EB domain binding to ezFERM, we can disqualify purported interactions involving an internal segment in the linker regions. Instead, the most probable cause is a weak intramolecular interaction with the C-terminal type 1 motif (–SXL), which is effectively independent of the protein concentration (>40 μm). The C-terminal motif without a positively-charged side chain at the penultimate position (X = Arg+) is not optimized for high-affinity binding to the PDZ1 domain (17Bhattacharya S. Ju J.H. Orlova N.

Nevertheless, we expect the weak millimolar affinity could increase by the local concentration effect. Thus, in solution, monomeric NHERF1 can adopt at least two inactive closed conformations and a fully open state when bound to ezFERM. NHERF1 has been shown to dimerize at concentrations greater than 140 μm that are physiologically (<10 μm) irrelevant (13Li J. Dai Z. Jana D. Callaway D.J. Bu Z.

To estimate the contribution of the different structural states of NHERF1 to any experimental measurement, we applied a quantitative relationship between intra- and intermolecular binding constants developed originally for polymer chains of variable length in systems of similar complexity (29Laederach A.

Based on the bimolecular affinity (Kd ∼93 μm) between the isolated PDZ2 domain and a C-terminal peptide (32Cheng H. Li J. Fazlieva R. Dai Z. Bu Z. Roder H. Autoinhibitory interactions between the PDZ2 and C-terminal domains in the scaffolding protein NHERF1.Structure. 2009; 17 (19446522): 660-66910.1016/j.str.2009.03.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we expect at least ∼77% monomer at the protein concentrations (∼140 μm) required for the NMR studies. Using the worm-chain model, the probability of the end–to–end distance of the 91-residue linker between PDZ2 and EB domain maximizes at ∼37 Å. In this distance range, free NHERF1 is a mixed population of closed (76%) and open (24%) conformations as predicted by the intramolecular association constant K′ and effective local concentration, Ceff (Equation 1 and Fig. S2). Assuming a slightly longer end–to–end distance of the linker (∼60 Å) between the PDZ1-EB domains based on model structures, the effective local concentration is lower, resulting in a much smaller fraction of the closed PDZ1 conformer (<5%). The significant population of the open conformer of NHERF1 (∼24%) has important biological ramifications for access to the target binding site at both PDZ domains when ezrin is dormant. Ezrin in the inactive state is autoinhibited, masking the NHERF1-binding site that is only exposed by a conformational change triggered by phosphorylation and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding (33Jayasundar J.J.

To illustrate the effect of the interconverting NHERF1 populations on binding site access, we used a 20-residue C-terminal peptide derived from GRK6A (Fig. 4) to simultaneously monitor the chemical shift perturbation in each PDZ domain at increasing peptide concentrations in the absence of ezFERM. The GRK6A peptide has much higher binding affinity for the isolated PDZ1 compared with the PDZ2 domain from NHERF1 (23Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A.

Accordingly, the N-terminal PDZ1 domain was readily saturated at a 1:1 protein–to–peptide ratio. In the PDZ2 domain, binding was inhibited but not abrogated, supporting limited access permitted by the dynamic C-terminal interactions (Fig. 4B). Therefore, an important outcome of partially open states is different ligands have some access to both PDZ domains instead of rel"

In this study, using exocytic secretion, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) assay, immunoprecipitation, and microscopy, we demonstrate that the exocyst subunit Exo84, which is known to be phosphorylated in mitosis, can also be phosphorylated directly by Cdk1 in the late G1 phase. Of note, we found that the Cdk1-mediated Exo84 phosphorylation impairs exocytic secretion in the late G1 phase. Using conditional cdc mutants and phosphodeficient and phosphomimetic exo84 mutants, we further observed that Cdk1-phosphoryated Exo84 inhibits the exocyst complex assembly, exocytic secretion, and cell growth, which may be important for proper execution of the G1/S-phase transition before commitment to a complete cell cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2948731380,"Avian cavity nesters (ACN) are viable indicators of forest structure, composition, and diversity. Utilizing these species responses in multi-disciplinary climate-avian-forest modeling can improve climate adaptive management. We propose a framework for integrating and evaluating climate-avian-forest models by linking two ACN niche models with a forest landscape model (FLM), LANDIS-II. The framework facilitates the selection of available ACN models for integration, evaluation of model transferability, and evaluation of successful integration of ACN models with a FLM. We found selecting a model for integration depended on its transferability to the study area (Northern Rockies Ecoregion of Idaho in the United States), which limited the species and model types available for transfer. However, transfer evaluation of the tested ACN models indicated a good fit for the study area. Several niche model variables (canopy cover, snag density, and forest cover type) were not directly informed by the LANDIS-II model, which required secondary modeling (Random Forest) to derive values from the FLM outputs. In instances where the Random Forest models performed with a moderate classification accuracy, the overall effect on niche predictions was negligible. Predictions based on LANDIS-II simulations performed similarly to predictions based on the niche model's original training input types. This supported the conclusion that the proposed framework is viable for informing avian niche models with FLM simulations. Even models that poorly approximate habitat suitability, due to the inherent constraints of predicting spatial niche use of irruptive species produced informative results by identifying areas of management focus. This is primarily because LANDIS-II estimates spatially explicit variables that were unavailable over large spatial extents from alternative datasets. Thus, without integration, one of the ACN niche models was not applicable to the study area. The framework will be useful for integrating avifauna niche and forest ecosystem models, which can inform management of contemporary and future landscapes under differing management and climate scenarios."

The findings, from the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment (LHCb), a particle detector fed by the LHC at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, suggest pentaquarks are not bags of five quarks binding in a new way, but are more like conventional atomic nuclei, with a particle called a baryon that contains three quarks bound to another called a meson, which has two.
