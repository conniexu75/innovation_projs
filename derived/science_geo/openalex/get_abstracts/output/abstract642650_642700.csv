The responsive stem cell that mediates this process is unclear, in part because of a lack of in vitro models that recapitulate key epithelial changes that occur in vivo during damage and repair. Here, we identify a Hopx+ colitis-associated regenerative stem cell (CARSC) population that functionally contributes to mucosal repair in mouse models of colitis. Hopx+ CARSCs, enriched for fetal-like markers, transiently arose from hypertrophic crypts known to facilitate regeneration. Importantly, we established a long-term, self-organizing two-dimensional (2D) epithelial monolayer system to model the regenerative properties and responses of Hopx+ CARSCs. This system can reenact the “homeostasis-injury-regeneration” cycles of epithelial alterations that occur in vivo. Using this system, we found that hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum stress, insults commonly present in inflammatory bowel diseases, mediated the cyclic switch of cellular status in this process.

The intestinal epithelium is the physical barrier separating luminal contents from the underlying stroma. Disruptions of this barrier, whether caused by infection, excessive dysregulated inflammation, vascular insults, or iatrogenic causes must be swiftly repaired to minimize the exposure of the host to insults arising from otherwise contained luminal contents. The intestinal epithelium exploits distinct repair strategies in response to acute injuries with different degrees of severity. Insults that superficially damage the mucosa and focally remove differentiated epithelial cells are quickly repaired by the migration of adjacent epithelial cells (Feil et al., 1989Feil W. Lacy E.R.

In scenarios where more severe lesions occur that include crypt loss, stem cells in the crypts positioned adjacent to the area of injury are mobilized to repair the damage by forming wound channels (Miyoshi et al., 2012Miyoshi H. Ajima R. Luo C.T. Yamaguchi T.P. Stappenbeck T.S.

Such aberrant mucosal healing frequently occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and poses a challenge for achieving long-term remission (Baert et al., 2010Baert F. Moortgat L.

A key to understanding epithelial repair in response to chronic injury, such as occurs in the setting of inflammation, is to identify the stem cell populations that execute the regenerative process. Two major types of intestinal stem cells have been shown to maintain epithelial turnover in homeostasis: the fast-cycling crypt base columnar cells marked by Lgr5 (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H.

Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In the mouse small intestine, Lgr5+ stem cells are required for regeneration in a radiation injury model (Metcalfe et al., 2014Metcalfe C. Kljavin N.M. Ybarra R. de Sauvage F.J. Lgr5+ stem cells are indispensable for radiation-induced intestinal regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In contrast, during colonic inflammation, they are dispensable for repair (Metcalfe et al., 2014Metcalfe C. Kljavin N.M. Ybarra R. de Sauvage F.J. Lgr5+ stem cells are indispensable for radiation-induced intestinal regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), raising a question as to the identity of colonic stem cells mediating colitis-associated regeneration. Recent studies report a fetal-like reversion of the regenerative epithelium in both dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and helminth infection (Nusse et al., 2018Nusse Y.M. Savage A.K.

Nevertheless, due to the lack of lineage tracing and cell ablation experiments, it is unclear whether cells in such a primitive state are functionally required for epithelial regeneration in colitis and can truly represent a regenerative stem cell population. The complex cellular composition/architecture of the intestine poses a formidable challenge when striving to obtain a detailed, comprehensive mechanistic dissection of chronic injury and repair of its epithelium. Current 3D epithelial culture systems have limitations in their capability to model multiple cycles of injury and repair. Organoids and spheroid cultures mimic components of homeostasis (Miyoshi and Stappenbeck, 2013Miyoshi H. Stappenbeck T.S.

Manipulations of organoids or spheroids to induce relatively pure select lineages representing tissue homeostasis or injury are usually confounded by the short-lived nature of these cells and cellular states in culture (Basak et al., 2017Basak O.

However, in pathological conditions like IBD, epithelial cells are often the subject of recurrent insults including hypoxic injury and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Giatromanolaki et al., 2003Giatromanolaki A.

Colgan S.P. Hypoxia and gastrointestinal disease.J. Mol. Med. (Berl.). 2007; 85: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As a result, intestinal epithelial cells can undergo repeated cycles of injury-repair (Sturm and Dignass, 2008Sturm A. Dignass A.U. Epithelial restitution and wound healing in inflammatory bowel disease.World J. Gastroenterol. 2008; 14: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), switching constantly from one cellular state to another. No in vitro epithelial model system has been able to recapitulate this complex process. The development of such a system would allow a better understanding of stem cell behavior during injury and subsequent regeneration and provide opportunities for creating new therapeutics. In this report, we present the identification of a colitis-associated regenerative stem cell (CARSC) population marked by Hopx expression in mouse models of colitis. We demonstrate that Hopx+ CARSCs arise during the reparative stage of colitis, preceded by an injury phase when Lgr5/Hopx double negative atrophic crypts are prevalent near areas of ulcerations. Hopx+ CARSCs largely co-express fetal-like markers and can functionally contribute to regeneration as demonstrated by lineage tracing and cell ablation experiments. Importantly, we establish a long-term 2D colonic in vitro system capable of modeling Hopx+ CARSCs and the repeated cycles of colonic epithelial injury-regeneration. By exposing the apical side of the monolayer layer to air, in vitro Hopx+ CARSCs undergo a proliferative burst before regenerating into a self-organizing monolayer that mimics cells in homeostasis. This mature monolayer can then be re-submerged to elicit a profound and rapid damage response mimicking in vivo epithelial injury. Hypoxia and ER stress, insults commonly present in IBD patients and mouse models of colitis, mediate this process. Importantly the cycle of injury and repair can be completed in this model system, due to the fact the same monolayer can be re-exposed to air-liquid interface thus returning cells to a homeostatic state. DSS administration to mice typically induces damage and ulceration of the colonic mucosa. We examined crypt morphology in DSS-induced injuries with or without a recovery phase. After a 14-day recovery from DSS injury, we confirmed previous studies that showed the presence of hypertrophic crypts in the distal colon (Erben et al., 2014Erben U. Loddenkemper C. Doerfel K. Spieckermann S. Haller D. Heimesaat M.M. Zeitz M. Siegmund B. Kühl A.A. A guide to histomorphological evaluation of intestinal inflammation in mouse models.Int. J. Clin. Exp.

These elongated crypts contained an increased number of proliferative cells at the expense of cellular differentiation as demonstrated by a substantial reduction in mature goblet cells (Figures 1A–1C and S1A) The close proximity of hypertrophic crypts to the areas of ulceration reflected an ongoing process of crypt regeneration, as described previously (Yui et al., 2018Yui S. Azzolin L. Maimets M. Pedersen M.T. Fordham R.P. Hansen S.L. Larsen H.L. Guiu J. Alves M.R.P.

In contrast, during the injury phase (with continuous DSS administration for up to 7 days), many crypts, frequently located near or within ulcerated areas in the distal colon, exhibited an atrophic appearance. These atrophic crypts contained epithelial cells with a squamous morphology instead of the columnar shape observed in untreated mice (Figure 1A); they also manifested greatly reduced proliferative activity and mature goblet cell differentiation (Figures 1A, 1C, and S1A). Atrophic crypts with these characteristics were prominent at the injury stage but were rare during regeneration (Figure 1B). Thus, atrophic crypts appeared to precede emergence of hypertrophic crypts and potentially represent an injured cellular state occurring in response to DSS injury.Figure S1Hopx+ CARSCs Promote Colitis-Associated Regeneration In Vivo, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Alcian blue staining of goblet cells present in colonic mucosa sections obtained from mice treated with no DSS, 7 days of DSS, and 7 days of DSS plus a 14-day recovery phase.

Histological, in situ hybridization and immuno-fluorescent images are representative of at least 3 animals examined. We next examined the mRNA expression of markers for fast-(Lgr5) and slow-cycling (Hopx) stem cells by in situ hybridization at distinct stages of DSS-induced colitis. Mice administered with 7 days of DSS showed greatly decreased expression of both Lgr5 and Hopx mRNAs in both uninjured (Figure S1B) and injured areas, the latter including atrophic crypts (Figure 1D). In mice with DSS injury followed by 14 days of recovery, Lgr5 expression was still largely suppressed in most colonic crypts, including uninjured areas and regenerating hypertrophic crypts (Figures 1D and S1B). This latter finding is consistent with previously reported transcriptomic data (Yui et al., 2018Yui S. Azzolin L. Maimets M. Pedersen M.T. Fordham R.P. Hansen S.L. Larsen H.L. Guiu J. Alves M.R.P. Rundsten C.F. et al.YAP/TAZ-Dependent Reprogramming of Colonic Epithelium Links ECM Remodeling to Tissue Regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 22: 35-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In contrast, Hopx expression re-emerged during the regeneration phase with robust expression specifically in epithelial cells located in hypertrophic crypts (Figures 1D and S1B). These data suggest that Hopx can potentially mark an arising regenerative stem cell population. A similar temporal pattern of crypt morphological changes during injury/repair was observed in response to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis (Figure S1C). As in the DSS model, neither Hopx nor Lgr5 mRNA was detected in atrophic crypts (present on day 3 post injury); in contrast, Hopx but not Lgr5 mRNA was enriched in hypertrophic crypts (present on day 7 post injury). We also observed similar findings using a genetic model of spontaneous colitis (dnKO) where hypertrophic crypts are a prominent feature (Figure S1D; Kang et al., 2008Kang S.S. Bloom S.M. Norian L.A. Geske M.J. Flavell R.A. Stappenbeck T.S. Allen P.M. An antibiotic-responsive mouse model of fulminant ulcerative colitis.PLoS Med. 2008; 5: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, Hopx mRNA is enriched in hypertrophic crypts in multiple models of colonic damage secondary to inflammation. The re-emergence of Hopx expression was similar in timing and location to the induction of fetal-like markers, such as Tacstd2 (Trop2), during epithelial regeneration (Yui et al., 2018Yui S.

We utilized the Hopx-CreERT2/Rosa-LSL-tdTomato (HopxCreER/RosaTd) as well as Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2/Rosa-LSL-tdTomato (Lgr5CreER/RosaTd) mice to transiently label Hopx+ and Lgr5+ cells, respectively, by tamoxifen induction during the hypertrophic crypt stage (Figure 1E). Over 70% of Tacstd2 (Trop2)+ crypts were labeled by the Hopx reporter, whereas <2% were labeled by the Lgr5 reporter (Figures 1E and 1F). With the caveat that possible unequal mosaicism is associated with the two reporter mouse lines, these data further support the conclusion that Hopx, but not Lgr5, mark a regenerative stem cell population within hypertrophic crypts. Interestingly, we also noted Hopx-labeling of hypertrophic crypts that were Tacstd2-negative (Figure S1E), implying heterogeneity in the composition and stages of regenerative crypts. We next performed lineage-tracing experiments to test if Hopx marks regenerative stem cells that can contribute to the restoration of epithelial homeostasis. We labeled the H"

Nutrient-rich conditions activate mTORC1 to trigger downstream anabolic reactions and inhibit catabolic ones, such as autophagy, while in the absence of nutrients, mTORC1 is turned off. Amino acids signal through upstream sensors and regulators to modulate the nucleotide loading states of the Rag GTPases, which form heterodimers consisting of RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD (Nakashima et al., 1996Nakashima N.

When RagA/B binds to GDP and RagC/D to GTP, the GTPase heterodimer binds weakly to mTORC1, leading to loss of its lysosomal localization and inactivation (Kim et al., 2008Kim E. Goraksha-Hicks P.

Previous computational studies identified two Longin and two DENN domains within the FLCN-FNIP2 complex (Pacitto et al., 2015Pacitto A. Ascher D.B. Wong L.H. Blaszczyk B.K. Nookala R.K. Zhang N.

Lst4, the yeast Fnip1/2 orthologue, is a DENN-family protein.Open Biol. 2015; 5: 150174Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the DENN domain of FLCN was crystallized, revealing structural homology to the DENN1B protein (Nookala et al., 2012Nookala R.K.

However, there is currently neither structural information about the intact FLCN-FNIP2 complex nor any molecular insight into the GAP mechanism.

We assembled the FLCN-FNIP2 complex with the Rag GTPases and Ragulator into a nonameric supercomplex and used cryo-EM to determine its structure. Our work reveals the architecture of FLCN-FNIP2 as well as how it binds the Rag GTPases. Furthermore, we identified the catalytic residue necessary for the GAP activity, which leads us to interpret our structure as an on-pathway intermediate. These results provide a first depiction of the intact FLCN-FNIP2 complex and a roadmap for further mechanistic studies on its role in BHD syndrome. To determine the structure of the FLCN-FNIP2 complex, we first co-expressed FLCN and FNIP2 in HEK293 FreeStyle cells and purified the heterodimer using affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration (Figure 1A, blue line). The two subunits co-eluted as a heterodimer (Figure 1B, blue lane). We then assembled the FLCN-FNIP2 complex with its substrate, the Rag GTPase heterodimer, and the Ragulator complex, the scaffolding complex and GEF for the Rag GTPases on the lysosomal membrane. To secure a stable interaction between FLCN-FNIP2 and the Rag GTPases, we used a point mutant of RagA, T21N, that locks it in the GDP-bound state (Shen et al., 2017Shen K. Choe A. Sabatini D.M.

Cell. 2017; 68: 552-565.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When we loaded FLCN-FNIP2 with the RagA(T21N)-RagC mutant in the presence of GDP and GppNHp (a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog), a heterotetramer formed that survived gel filtration, suggesting that a stable FLCN-FNIP2-GDPRagA(T21N)-RagCGppNHp complex was generated (Figures 1A and 1B, orange line). This complex was further assembled with the Ragulator pentamer, which is known to bind to the Rag GTPase heterodimer through its C-terminal roadblock domains (CRDs, Figures 1A and 1B, red line) (de Araujo et al., 2017de Araujo M.E.G.

Coomassie blue stained gel analyses confirmed that all nine subunits are present in the final complex (∼320 kD) and suitable for cryo-EM structural determination (Figure 1B). We carried out single-particle cryo-EM structural determination for the FLCN-FNIP2-Rag-Ragulator complex (Figures S1A and S1B; Table 1) and resolved the cryo-EM density map at the resolution of 3.31 Å (gold-standard criteria) (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1C). Local resolution ranges from 3.0 to 5.0 Å (Figures S1C–S1E) with the side chains at the core region clearly resolved (Figures S2A–S2C). We manually built ∼35% of the complex de novo after docking of the existing structures for the Rag GTPases (Gong et al., 2011Gong R. Li L. Liu Y. Wang P. Yang H. Wang L. Cheng J. Guan K.L. Xu Y.

The FLCN-FNIP2-Rag-Ragulator complex adopts an elongated conformation, with a size of 220 × 100 × 60 Å (Video S1). The Rag GTPase heterodimer localizes at the center (Figure 2A). Their CRDs interact with Ragulator, similar to what was observed in previously resolved structures (Figures 2A and 2B) (de Araujo et al., 2017de Araujo M.E.G. Naschberger A. Fürnrohr B.G. Stasyk T.

Interestingly, although FLCN-FNIP2 is a specific GAP for RagC, it enters the space in between the Rag subunits and directly contacts the NBDs of both RagA and RagC, suggesting it functions through a unique molecular mechanism. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5YTA2MjMwOWI0ZmQ3MTQ1MzZlZGMwODNiYTM3NGVjNSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3OTQ4NjUzfQ.LakHZ5jtOInV1loeByOfSzEbHL_emtrrtYvFiUCtJHgBG_dAAtcOGwoY7LYdUTbccP6V1s9vVLtQhDI1s7muUOGg8kWGIWHXLexCWY9j0ATApUVdZNxSrNHUpeCGGui6aAsWHVA0QR-a6Pd0DleEE_3P0RhSAtF4HR7Oedqr6qA05pjeJABN5hA3ejYguYxDcC7ZFXKc96o5pV5-Qj7MuQeUNl7_r0RXx_c3f0wdBLnacZb_jnnbLWmzL0VghSbE2fkpS0TFg2R5-Tf1FW27hzY2f7gpXMpPoiov_hAEK5qAPXPU-4VSw6AzAlqbeB8hLOYOqyqCln6zA9c-iKPhqg Download .mp4 (43.49 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1.

They each contain a Longin domain at the N terminus and a DENN domain at the C terminus. In particular, both the Longin and the DENN domains on FNIP2 are assembled by discontinued stretches of its primary sequence, and they both contain long loops that lack EM density, which could partially explain the difficulty in direct crystallization. We observed tight intramolecular interactions within FNIP2 between its Longin domain and the DENN domain (Figure S2E), while the two domains of FLCN are physically separated and only connected through a linker (Figures 2A, S2C, and S2D). The structural model offers insight into the heterodimerization mechanism between FLCN and FNIP2. We identified two contact surfaces between FLCN and FNIP2, each formed by heterodimerization of their corresponding domains (Figures 2C and 2D). First, FLCN and FNIP2 each contribute a Longin domain to form a heterodimer (Figures 2B and 2C), which directly enters the space in between the NBDs of RagA and RagC (Figure 2A). This heterodimerization is mediated by a continuous ten-stranded β sheet as a middle platform, sandwiched by six α helices (Figure 2C). Interestingly, we observed a very similar architecture of the two Longin domains of the Nprl2 and Nprl3 subunits in the GATOR1 complex that serves as a GAP for RagA (Shen et al., 2018Shen K.

Since the breakthrough discovery of transcription factor (TF)-driven reprogramming by Shinya Yamanaka (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

Transcription factor binding dynamics during human ES cell differentiation.Nature. 2015; 518: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Subsequent work from Yamanaka’s laboratory showed that, of the four TFs in the reprogramming cocktail—Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc (OSKM)—only cMyc could be omitted while still permitting generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Nakagawa et al., 2008Nakagawa M. Koyanagi M. Tanabe K. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Okita K. Mochiduki Y. Takizawa N. Yamanaka S. Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells without Myc from mouse and human fibroblasts.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). Moreover, although Sox2, Kfl4, and cMyc could be replaced by other members of their TF families, Oct4 could not be substituted by either Oct1 or Oct6. Numerous attempts have been made to replace the components of the reprogramming cocktail to understand the molecular role of each factor, as well as potentially improve efficiency and safety of the reprogramming technology (Radzisheuskaya and Silva, 2014Radzisheuskaya A. Silva J.C. Do all roads lead to Oct4? The emerging concepts of induced pluripotency.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 275-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although many studies have shown the possibility of substitutions for Oct4 in the reprogramming cocktail (Table S1), Oct4 remains a commonly used molecule for generating iPSCs. In fact, we and others have demonstrated that exogenous expression of Oct4 alone is sufficient for reprogramming cell types that inherently express the other reprogramming factors (Kim et al., 2009aKim J.B.

In vivo, Oct4 serves as a master regulator, playing an integral role in maintaining pluripotency (Niwa et al., 2000Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G.

Intriguing recent studies described Oct4-independent reprogramming cocktails, where Oct4 was replaced with GATA factors (Montserrat et al., 2013Montserrat N. Nivet E. Sancho-Martinez I. Hishida T.

Yang W. et al.GATA family members as inducers for cellular reprogramming to pluripotency.Cell Res. 2015; 25: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Shu et al. hypothesized that Oct4 and Sox2 could orchestrate cellular dedifferentiation during reprogramming by counteracting each other’s effects in the specification of meso-endoderm and neuroectoderm, respectively. The report demonstrated that endoderm lineage specifiers, such as Gata3, Gata4, and Gata6, promoted even higher-efficiency reprogramming compared to Oct4. This study introduced the “seesaw model” of pluripotency, which describes it as a fine balance between the induction of opposing developmental lineages (Shu and Deng, 2013Shu J. Deng H. Lineage specifiers: new players in the induction of pluripotency.Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2013; 11: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our group previously determined that Oct4 is not critical for establishing totipotency during mouse development; moreover, following nuclear transfer, Oct4-null oocytes can still efficiently reprogram somatic nuclei to pluripotency (Wu et al., 2013Wu G. Han D. Gong Y. Sebastiano V. Gentile L. Singhal N. Adachi K. Fischedick G. Ortmeier C. Sinn M. et al.Establishment of totipotency does not depend on Oct4A.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The present work was sparked by the surprising observation that a reprogramming cassette that did not contain Oct4 was able to efficiently generate iPSCs, contrary to the long-standing dogma. Initially, we removed Oct4 from the widely used tetO-OKSM polycistronic reprogramming cassette (Sommer et al., 2009Sommer C.A. Stadtfeld M. Murphy G.J. Hochedlinger K. Kotton D.N. Mostoslavsky G. Induced pluripotent stem cell generation using a single lentiviral stem cell cassette.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) to generate a negative control to compare the reprogramming ability of different POU factors (Figure 1A). To our surprise, induction of KSM in Oct4-GFP reporter mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (OG2) could still generate GFP+ colonies (Figure 1B). We then deleted Oct4 also from the tetO-OSKM vector (Carey et al., 2009Carey B.W. Markoulaki S. Hanna J. Saha K. Gao Q. Mitalipova M. Jaenisch R. Reprogramming of murine and human somatic cells using a single polycistronic vector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The SKM cassette also gave rise to GFP+ and alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies, as early as 5 days post-induction (dpi) (Figures 1D and S1B). PCR genotyping confirmed lentiviral integration of SKM/KSM cassettes in all iPSC lines, whereas neither Oct4 transgene nor another POU factor, Brn4, were detected (Figure 1E). The KSM/SKM (hereafter referred to as SKM) iPSCs displayed morphology characteristic of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and could be expanded for at least 15 passages (Figures 1B and 1D). They stained positive for the pluripotency-specific markers SSEA1 and Nanog (Figure S1A). Methylation analysis of bisulfite-treated DNA revealed that the Oct4 and Nanog promoters were hypomethylated (Figure 1F), indicating epigenetic activation of the pluripotency genes. In contrast, the Col1a1 promoter was hypermethylated in the reprogrammed cell lines, indicating silencing of the somatic gene. The SKM iPSCs gave rise to all three germ layers in teratoma formation assays (Figure 1G) and contributed to the development of viable chimeric mice (Figure 1H), including the germline (Figure 1I). To assess the efficiency and kinetics of SKM versus OSKM reprogramming, we performed a time course reprogramming experiment. OG2 MEFs were transduced with the OSKM, SKM, OSK, OKM, or OSM polycistronic vectors and induced with doxycycline (dox) for 1–8 days (Figure 1J). SKM generated GFP+ colonies after at least 5 days of induction, which is delayed by 2 days compared to OSKM (Figure 1K). The SKM reprogramming efficiency after 6–8 days of induction was approximately 30% of that for OSKM. Surprisingly, the removal of Oct4 from the OSKM cassette was the least detrimental, while removal of Klf4 led to the biggest drop in reprogramming efficiency. Western blot analysis confirmed comparable factor expression and the absence of the factor eliminated from each cassette (Figure 1L). The use of MEFs with Gof18;Rosa26-rtTA background gave a very similar result (Figure S1B). We ruled out the possibility that the tet-inducible promoter or the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) is responsible for reprogramming in the absence of Oct4 by demonstrating that EF1α-SKM/KSM could generate GFP+ colonies in the absence of rtTA (Figure S1C). We also cloned the KSM cassette into the non-integrating, episomal vector to attempt virus-free reprogramming (Okita et al., 2011Okita K. Matsumura Y. Sato Y. Okada A. Morizane A. Okamoto S. Hong H. Nakagawa M. Tanabe K. Tezuka K. et al.A more efficient method to generate integration-free human iPS cells.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Lipofection of episomal KSM into MEFs generated GFP+ colonies that were expanded into stable iPSC lines (Figure S1D) that lost the vector by passage 5 (Figure S1E). We confirmed the pluripotency of integration-free KSM-iPSCs by immunostaining and teratoma assays (Figures S1F and S1G). To address the question whether SKM reprogramming depends on a specific starting cell population, we transduced presorted Thy− and Thy+ subpopulations of MEFs and found that both could be reprogrammed, although SKM induction in Thy+ cells gave rise to more GFP+ colonies (Figures S1H–S1J). We also demonstrated that adult lung fibroblasts (Figure S1K), immortalized adult tail tip fibroblasts (Figure S1L), and cortical astrocytes (Figures S1M–S1P) could be reprogrammed in the absence of exogenous Oct4. Overall, the efficiency of SKM reprogramming appeared to correlate with the rate of cell division, but not the origin of the cells. To further understand the components driving SKM reprogramming, we dissected the reprogramming cassettes. We found that neither KS nor SK can reprogram alone, but each could generate GFP+ colonies when combined with Oct4 or cMyc (Figure 2A). We used three different concentrations of dox to induce different levels of reprogramming factor expression. Although even the lowest expression level (10 ng/mL of dox) was sufficient for OSKM reprogramming, reprogramming in the absence of Oct4 required higher levels of expression (50 or 1,000 ng/mL dox). Polycistronic expression of the factors appeared to be beneficial, but not crucial, for SKM reprogramming, as SK+M, KS+M, K+SM, and even S+K+M could generate GFP+ colonies, albeit with very low efficiency in the case of monocistronic induction. Klf4-IRES-Sox2 (KS)+M could generate iPSCs with efficiency comparable to KSM, excluding the possibility of a gain-of-function effect from polyproteins that may arise from uncleaved 2A peptides (Velychko et al., 2019Velychko S.

It was reported that the endoderm-specific GATA factors could substitute for Oct4 in reprogramming to pluripotency, while ectoderm-specific Sox1 or Sox3 could replace Sox2 (Shu et al., 2013Shu J.

Yang W. et al.GATA family members as inducers for cellular reprogramming to pluripotency.Cell Res. 2015; 25: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We replaced Sox2 with Sox1 and observed only a 50% decrease in reprogramming efficiency for both the SKM and OSKM cocktails (Figures 2B and 2C). Adding Gata4 or Gata6 did not significantly increase the reprogramming efficiency for either Sox2-KM or Sox1-KM at a high level of transgene expression but increased the number of GFP+ colonies at lower level of induction (Figure 2C). We next tested whether Gata4 or Gata6 could reprogram in combination with SK only. Indeed, as reported by Shu et al., 2013Shu J. Wu C. Wu Y. Li Z. Shao S. Zhao W. Tang X. Yang H. Shen L. Zuo X. et al.Induction of pluripotency in mouse somatic cells with lineage specifiers.Cell. 2013; 153: 963-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, SK+Gata4/6 could generate iPSCs; however, the efficiency of reprogramming was 10 times lower than for SK+O or SK+M (Figures S2A and S2B). Moreover, SK+GATA did not generate any GFP+ colonies when induced with a lower dox concentration (Figure S2A). Given that GATA factors, Oct4, and cMyc share the ability to activate proliferation genes, we next questioned whether SK alone could reprogram highly proliferative cells. We introduced a tet-inducible SV40 Large T antigen (SV40LT) lentiviral vector into MEFs, allowing us to reversibly immortalize fibroblasts during the reprogramming process (Anastassiadis et al., 2010Anastassiadis K. Rostovskaya M. Lubitz S. Weidlich S. Stewart A.F. Precise conditional immortalization of mouse cells using tetracycline-regulated SV40 large T-antigen.Genesis. 2010; 48: 220-232PubMed Google Scholar). The immortalization of the starting MEFs allowed for reprogramming with SK only and rendered the addition of cMyc, Gata4, or Gata6 ineffective (Figures 2D, S2C, and S2D). SK iPSCs (Figure S2E) could be passaged at least 12 times while preserving the normal karyotype (Figure S2F). We verified their genomic integrations by PCR genotyping and their pluripotency by immunostaining, teratoma formation, and chimera contribution, including the germline (Figures S2G–S2K). Cell proliferation assay through the course of reprogramming showed that the addition of Gata4 or Gata6 significantly increased the proliferation of fibroblasts, resulting in 2-fold increase in cell number after 6 dpi compared to SK alone (Figure 2E). Thus, we conclude that GATA factors when combined with SK could reprogram fibroblasts by increasing the proliferation rate in a manner similar to cMyc and SV40LT. We next evaluated the developmental potential of SKM iPSCs by performing the most stringent test for pluripotency, tetraploid (4N) complementation assay (Figure 3A; Nagy et al., 1990Nagy A. Gócza E. Diaz E.M. Prideaux V.R. Iványi E. Markkula M. Rossant J. Embryonic stem cells alone are able to support fetal development in the mouse.Development. 1990; 110: 815-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, the tested iPSCs are aggregated with 4N embryos that can form extra-embryonic tissues but fail to develop viable inner cell mass. Development of such aggregates results in a fetus consisting almost exclusively of iPSCs (all-iPSC mice). We tested 13 clonal tet-inducible iPSC lines derived from Gof18-Rosa26-rtTA MEFs (5 SKM, 3 KSM, and 5 OSKM lines) of the same passage that were generated and cultured in parallel. All the tested lines were preselected for minimal transgene leakage to avoid possible harmful developmental effects (Figure S3A). Additionally, we generated control ESC lines from F1 embryos derived by mating SKM#1 all-iPSC mice to achieve the closest matching genotype. All SKM iPSC lines were capable of generating full-term all-iPSC pups (4N-on; Figures 3B and 3C; Table S2). In contrast, only 3 of 5 OSKM lines were 4N-on (Figure 3C), corroborating published reports (Amlani et al., 2018Amlani B. Liu Y. Chen T. Ee L.-S. Lopez P. Heguy A. Apostolou E. Kim S.Y. Stadtfeld M.

Astonishingly, 44.1% ± 9.1% of SKM iPSC- and 27.1% ± 17.5% of ESC-aggregated embryos gave rise to fully developed pups, compared to only 2.3% ± 1.4% for OSKM iPSCs (Figure 3D). The 4N complementation efficiency for OSKM lines was comparable to those of other reports (Figure S3B), whereas the efficiency of SKM iPSCs was much higher than that of OSKM iPSCs or iPSCs generated by alternative cocktails—Oct4+Tet1 (OT) or Sall4+Nanog+Esrrb+Lin28 (SNEL)—which were reported to improve iPSC quality (Buganim et al., 2014Buganim Y.

Notably, none of the OSKM all-iPSC pups survived foster nursing (Figure S3B), while 49.5% of SKM all-iPSC pups survived for at least 2 days of foster nursing and 34% survived until adulthood (Figure 3D). All adult SKM all-iPSC mice were healthy and fertile (Figures 3E and 3F). Additionally, we tested 6 integration-free iPSC lines generated by episomal vectors (Figures S1D–S1F). The results were largely consistent: all tested episomal KSM (epiKSM) iPSC lines were 4N-on, while only 1 of 3 epiKSM+O lines was 4N-on, albeit of high quality (Figure 3C; Table S2). The higher variability of episomal comparing to tet-inducible lines is expected, due to the stochastic nature of episomal disappearance and, therefore, lack of factor expression control (Okita et al., 2013Okita K. Yamakawa T. Matsumura Y. Sato Y. Amano N. Watanabe A. Goshima N. Yamanaka S. An efficient nonviral method to generate integration-free human-induced pluripotent stem cells from cord blood and peripheral blood cells.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the rare appearance of a high-quality epiKSM+O line suggests that certain conditions, such as lower expression, fast vector disappearance, or a certain O:KSM ratio, could allow for high-quality iPSCs, even in the presence of Oct4. Taken together, the SKM cocktail generates iPSCs with exceptionally high developmental potential, nearly 20-fold higher than that of OSKM, suggesting that exogenous Oct4 detrimentally affects the quality of iPSCs. We hypothesized that early silencing of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-based vectors could account for the contradictory data presented in numerous publications reporting the indispensability of Oct4 in the Yamanaka cocktail (Table S1). It is commonly accepted that silencing of retroviral transgenes is a distinct characteristic of pluripotent, but not somatic, cells (Hochedlinger and Plath, 2009Hochedlinger K. Plath K. Epigenetic reprogramming and induced pluripotency.Development. 2009; 136: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). We transduced OG2 MEFs with a retroviral pMX vector expressing mCherry to track the retroviral silencing during reprogramming. Surprisingly, the morphological changes of SKM- and OSKM-induced fibroblasts coincided with the loss of mCherry signal starting as early as 2 dpi (Figures 4A, S4A, and S4B). Later, mCherry− cells formed dome-shaped colonies, within which Oct4-GFP+ cells emerged (Figures 4A and S4B). We quantified the results of time course fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis during OSKM and SKM reprogramming (Figure S4C). Although half of the fibroblasts had already lost mCherry expression after 2 dpi, a third of the mCherry+ cells still expressed fibroblast-specific Thy1, but the majority became double-negative by 4 dpi. These data suggest that retroviral silencing occurs very early during lentivirus-driven reprogramming—even before the loss of somatic cell identity. If such immediate silencing occurred during retrovirus-mediated reprogramming, it would preclude conversion of fibroblasts into iPSCs. Indeed, when pMX-mCherry+ cells were infected with retroviral Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc, some groups of cells lost mCherry expression and reprogramming was halted (Figure S4D). GFP+ cells could only arise from within mCherry+ clusters that kept expressing the transgenes. Thus, reprogramming with MMLV-based vectors selects for the cells that do not undergo early retroviral silencing. We dissected the tetO-OSKM cassette to identify the exact factors driving early retrovirus silencing. We cloned the reprogramming factors into a tet-inducible vector carrying IRES-Puro, allowing for the selection of infected cells. Although none of the factors could trigger silencing when induced alone, simultaneous expression of Sox2 and cMyc (SM) was sufficient to silence the retroviral transgene in most of the cells by 3 dpi (Figure 4B). We tracked the reprogramming fate of the cells that did or did not undergo early retroviral silencing. We sorted the cells on d3 after SKM or OSKM induction and selection and plated the cells on a feeder layer to assess their reprogramming fate (Figure 4C). Overall, the mCherry− populations gave rise to a significantly higher number of GFP+ colonies than the mCherry+ populations for both reprogramming conditions. Although in the case of OSKM reprogramming, the same number of mCherry− cells gave 4 times more GFP+ colonies than the mCherry+ cells, in the case of SKM, the mCherry− fraction gave nearly 50 times more colonies than the mCherry+ fraction (Figure 4D). We therefore confirmed that retroviral silencing occurs early during the reprogramming, which is particularly relevant for SKM induction. Altogether, these results suggest the infeasibility of retrovirus-driven SKM reprogramming (Figure S1C). To gain deeper insight into the mechanism of SKM reprogramming, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) over the course of reprogramming (Figure 4E). The pMX-mCherry+ OG2 MEFs were transduced with polycistronic SKM or OSKM; samples were collected after 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 dpi. Only mCherry− cells were used for RNA isolation to reduce heterogeneity and to eliminate contamination by untransduced cells. Additionally, we sequenced subpopulations of reprogramming intermediates that underwent mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) on d6 (mCherry−/GFP−/Epcam+) or activated endogenous Oct4 (mCherry−/GFP+) on d9 and d12 (2 days after dox withdrawal; Figure S4E).

Visualizing and understanding the axonal connections of the human brain has immense value in applications that range from training medical students to planning neurosurgical procedures. As such, neuroanatomists have used traditional histologic techniques for nearly a century to describe the white matter connections of the human brain (Agrawal et al., 2011Agrawal A. Kapfhammer J.P. Kress A. Wichers H. Deep A. Feindel W. Sonntag V.K. Spetzler R.F. Preul M.C. Josef Klingler’s models of white matter tracts: influences on neuroanatomy, neurosurgery, and neuroimaging.Neurosurgery. 2011; 69: 238-252, discussion 252–254Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Human anatomical results are ideally coupled with more detailed experiments performed in the non-human primate brain to delineate details of the specific connections and somatotopic organization of individual axonal pathways (Van Essen and Glasser, 2018Van Essen D.C. Glasser M.F. Parcellating cerebral cortex: how invasive animal studies inform noninvasive mapmaking in humans.Neuron. 2018; 99: 640-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, direct translation of the complex axonal trajectories and detailed connectomic information available from monkey studies are often difficult to scale and render within the context of the human brain. In addition, assumptions must be made on the cross-species homolog of each pathway and its exact anatomical location in the human brain. The advent of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (Basser et al., 1994Basser P.J. Mattiello J. LeBihan D. MR diffusion tensor spectroscopy and imaging.Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 259-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4411) Google Scholar), and the application of tractography algorithms to that data (Mori et al., 1999Mori S. Crain B.J. Chacko V.P. van Zijl P.C. Three-dimensional tracking of axonal projections in the brain by magnetic resonance imaging.Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar), has provided unique opportunities to create in vivo simulations of structural connectivity in the human brain. Tractography-based structural connectomes have subsequently become a driving force in human brain imaging research (Setsompop et al., 2013Setsompop K. Kimmlingen R. Eberlein E. Witzel T.

However, tractography suffers from inherent limitations in reconstructing white matter pathways (Jones et al., 2013Jones D.K. Knösche T.R. Turner R.

USA. 2014; 111: 16574-16579Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and decades of tractography validation studies have repeatedly called for alternative strategies to more accurately map the axonal pathways of the human brain (Maier-Hein et al., 2017Maier-Hein K.H. Neher P.F. Houde J.C. Côté M.A. Garyfallidis E. Zhong J. Chamberland M. Yeh F.C. Lin Y.C. Ji Q. et al.The challenge of mapping the human connectome based on diffusion tractography.Nat.

Ocampo-Pineda M. et al.Limits to anatomical accuracy of diffusion tractography using modern approaches.Neuroimage. 2019; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to employ new holographic visualization technologies to facilitate data integration and collaborative interaction for the generation of human axonal pathway models. Our specific focus was the creation of detailed representations of the axonal pathways in the subthalamic region, a brain area considered highly problematic for tractographic reconstructions but a common surgical target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies. Although it is generally accepted that tractography can generate reasonable estimates of large pathways, such as the corpus callosum or corticospinal tract, it has known difficulties with smaller pathways. This is especially true if those smaller pathways also intersect large pathways, such as the connections between the basal ganglia and diencephalon. In addition, anatomical reconstructions of large pathways typically show a somatotopic organization of the fibers within the tract, but tractography alone is not always capable of simulating that somatotopy. Therefore, we set out to collate decades of anatomical knowledge about the cortical and subcortical axonal pathways coursing through the subthalamic region and integrate that information into a model of the human brain. Generating an anatomically accurate representation of the axonal pathways in the human subthalamic region is a challenging 3D task. Many different pathways are crossing each other and following tortuous paths. In addition, the detailed anatomical knowledge on the specific features of each pathway is spread across multiple experts, each with their own unique understanding of the system. To address this challenge, we employed group-based holographic visualization to help us perform complex 3D tasks as collaborative interactions. Our holographic visualization system integrated human histological and structural MRI data with estimated trajectories for each pathway. Each of these trajectories could be interactively manipulated with a series of control points. The control points could be placed and scaled within the holographic brain model based on structural and/or histological landmarks available in the data. We then assembled world expert neuroanatomists to discuss, define, and finalize the axonal trajectories to the best of their collective knowledge, all within the holographic visualization environment. The outcomes of this project were a first of its kind holographic visualization program for developing anatomical priors for use in tractography research, as well as the first anatomically realistic model of the major axonal pathways in the human subthalamic region. We propose that both of these advances have applications in medical education and neurosurgical research. This project generated three types of results. First, we assembled a human brain model that served as the foundation for creating our axonal pathway representations. Second, we designed a holographic visualization platform for analyzing and interacting with brain imaging data. Third, we used the human brain model and holographic visualization to create axonal pathway reconstructions that connect the cortical, basal ganglia, and cerebellar systems. The CIT168 brain atlas (Pauli et al., 2018Pauli W.M. Nili A.N. Tyszka J.M. A high-resolution probabilistic in vivo atlas of human subcortical brain nuclei.Sci. Data. 2018; 5: 180063Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) provided the foundation for our human brain model (Figure 1). This brain atlas was originally constructed using diffeomorphic registration of T1- and T2-weighted structural MRIs from 168 typical adults drawn from the Human Connectome Project (Van Essen et al., 2013Van Essen D.C. Smith S.M. Barch D.M. Behrens T.E. Yacoub E. Ugurbil K. WU-Minn HCP ConsortiumThe WU-Minn Human Connectome Project: an overview.Neuroimage. 2013; 80: 62-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2649) Google Scholar). 3D volumes representing cortical parcellations and subcortical nuclei were rendered and integrated with 2D image slices associated with the axial, coronal, and sagittal views of the CIT168 MRI data. These triangulated surface models and image slices were then ported to the Unity programming environment, so the results could be simulated as holograms by the Microsoft HoloLens platform (see STAR Methods; Figure 1). Histological results from the Morel stereotactic atlas of the human thalamus and basal ganglia (Morel, 2007Morel A. Stereotactic Atlas of the Human Thalamus and Basal Ganglia. Informa Healthcare USA, 2007Crossref Google Scholar, Gallay et al., 2008Gallay M.N. Jeanmonod D. Liu J. Morel A. Human pallidothalamic and cerebellothalamic tracts: anatomical basis for functional stereotactic neurosurgery.Brain Struct. Funct. 2008; 212: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) were co-registered with the CIT168 MRI slices (see STAR Methods; Figure 2). These results provided myelin-stain-based descriptions of the cerebellothalamic, pallidothalamic, and medial lemniscus axonal pathways in axial and sagittal 2D slices (Figures 2A and 2B). We then assembled 3D trajectories for these pathways and generated streamline approximations to simulate the distribution of fibers within the anatomy (Figures 2C–2E). The general process of importing histological results and developing streamline approximations for each pathway was repeated for the posterior limb of internal capsule (Morecraft et al., 2017Morecraft R.J. Binneboese A. Stilwell-Morecraft K.S. Ge J. Localization of orofacial representation in the corona radiata, internal capsule and cerebral peduncle in Macaca mulatta.J. Comp.

Single-axon tracing of the corticosubthalamic hyperdirect pathway in primates.Brain Struct. Funct. 2018; 223: 3959-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar; Figure 4). However, the available anatomical results for these pathways were derived from the non-human primate experiments, so direct co-registration with the CIT168 MRI slices was not explicit but inferred from expert knowledge. Similarly, detailed anatomical reconstructions are available for the axonal trajectories connecting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GP) in the monkey brain (Sato et al., 2000aSato F.

Attempting to visualize, and render in one’s mind, the complex 3D neuroanatomy of the subthalamic region can be difficult using traditional 2D computer screens. This task becomes even more complicated when attempting to verify the anatomical accuracy and continuity of various axonal pathways with respect to all of the other surrounding structures. Therefore, we turned to holographic visualization to help us refine the pathway descriptions (Figure 2F; see STAR Methods). The most valuable component of the holographic visualization experience was the ability to perform group-based interactions with the data. We assembled collections of world expert neuroanatomists on multiple occasions for interactive pathway-editing sessions (see STAR Methods). During these sessions, we could all see the same hologram that was fixed to a common space in the room, toggle different components of the brain model on/off, and interactively manipulate the control points describing each pathway trajectory (see STAR Methods; Figure 2F). Most importantly, all of these technical aspects of the model were available while maintaining eye contact with each other in the real world, which facilitated the communication of ideas. The supplemental material provides some short video clips demonstrating the interactions (Video S1). In between holographic group sessions, the engineering team used the anatomist input to update the pathway descriptions and refine components of the human brain model (see STAR Methods). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJmYWYzZjI1MTI1MzExODhlZTViYmRmNjU0Mzg5YzZhMSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3ODY5OTE0fQ.Y2IlheoHrau8rj8IWu-frdDdEWFX8WsVkGKa2-2LZ84PNW0CR99tezqVVDhPBP1NzslxBaU1vudsk1MDtvpDIeeALers6UwbcK5UGIkFVmExGw5oleCpjWP42sUg4jcd9tFxa4P06r-XRp4mnpk9iy04aVIuOpGMzfOcOrIM4hVC9eZyMlUrXy4XwUpImr6xJgmyRLl-fWGWo1WyUEtFh3fzKcG7ljtTbpno-Nv_XTTqKkF4KY1EkN2WT6S1MklUbJ1kOeHiuDlNbngMGzXZlDOrNzGwcsXuiJ6R9UXh1drY5my7GJnL75ZooxRAxB7oNqtGKWtsja1Eb-CHls3WkA Download .mp4 (58.46 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. Anatomist Interactions with Holographic Models During our pathway-editing process, histological data were considered paramount when defining the axonal trajectories, but many gaps needed to be filled with collective knowledge that was uniquely accessed via the holographic group sessions. In such situations, the anatomist input was coupled with structural landmarks available in the CIT168 MRI data to provide the constraints necessary to define anatomically realistic trajectories for the pathways. The result of this iterative process was our collective definition of anatomical priors that are representative of 12 cortical projections (Figure 3), as well as their corresponding hyperdirect innervations of the STN (Figure 4), and 6 pathways associated with the basal ganglia or thalamus (Figure 5). The streamlines associated with these pathways, and their quantitative coordinates in CIT168 space, are available for download as VTK files in the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/mhd4z). In addition, a web-based Unity program is provided for interactive visualization of the entire human brain model (https://mikkelvpetersen.com/pathway-atlas-simple/). The educational desire, and clinical need, for an anatomically accurate pathway atlas for the human subthalamic region has existed for decades, especially following the therapeutic success of subthalamic DBS for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. In theory, most of the anatomical data necessary to assemble a subthalamic pathway atlas have been available via the combination of results from many different studies but never formally collated into a single coordinate system or translated into the human space. This missing step can be attributed to the substantial technical challenges associated with integrating the various datasets and then visualizing that complex 3D information in a way that would be amenable to atlas generation. However, the recent advent of holographic visualization systems that facilitate group-based interaction has changed the equation. We recognized that any attempt to assemble an axonal pathway atlas from histological results and structural MRI data would require extensive neuroanatomist expertise to fill the inherent gaps in the available information. However, no single person has all of the anatomical knowledge and experience necessary to achieve that goal for every pathway of interest. Therefore, the unique opportunity we leveraged was the combination of advanced holographic visualization of integrated datasets with simultaneous interactive inputs from collections of world expert neuroanatomists. We propose that this general framework can be repeated throughout the brain to develop the anatomical priors necessary for the evolution of human connectomic analyses. Countless human tractography studies have been performed to simulate the connections between cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum (e.g., Meola et al., 2016Meola A. Yeh F.C. Fellows-Mayle W. Weed J. Fernandez-Miranda J.C. Human connectome-based tractographic atlas of the brainstem connections and surgical approaches.Neurosurgery. 2016; 79: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, Plantinga et al., 2018Plantinga B.R. Temel Y. Duchin Y. Uludağ K. Patriat R. Roebroeck A. Kuijf M. Jahanshahi A. Ter Haar Romenij B. Vitek J. Harel N. Individualized parcellation of the subthalamic nucleus in patients with Parkinson’s disease with 7T MRI.Neuroimage. 2018; 168: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, tractography alone is an inherently limited approach that currently requires alternative or combinatorial strategies to accurately map the axonal pathways of the human brain (Schilling et al., 2019Schilling K.G. Nath V. Hansen C. Parvathaneni P. Blaber J. Gao Y. Neher P. Aydogan D.B. Shi Y. Ocampo-Pineda M. et al.Limits to anatomical accuracy of diffusion tractography using modern approaches.Neuroimage. 2019; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This issue is compounded by the lack of anatomical axonal pathway “gold standards” in the human brain to help verify or refute the accuracy of tractographic simulations. Our results provide an independently generated pathway atlas that explicitly integrates anatomical detail in the subthalamic region that far exceeds the capabilities of any current tractography algorithm or dataset. As such, our data represent a test case for the evaluation of novel tractography strategies moving forward. Human Connectome Project (HCP) datasets represent a standard for high-quality DWI data, and to further improve the robustness and applicability of those results, group connectomes have recently been constructed (Yeh et al., 2018Yeh F.C. Panesar S. Fernandes D. Meola A. Yoshino M. Fernandez-Miranda J.C. Vettel J.M. Verstynen T. Population-averaged atlas of the macroscale human structural connectome and its network topology.Neuroimage. 2018; 178: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed a simple comparison of our anatomically defined pathways with the streamlines available in a group connectome specifically created to study DBS of the subthalamic region (Horn et al., 2019Horn A. Li N. Dembek T.A. Kappel A. Boulay C. Ewert S. Tietze A. Husch A. Perera T. Neumann W.J. et al.Lead-DBS v2: towards a comprehensive pipeline for deep brain stimulation imaging.Neuroimage. 2019; 184: 293-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar; Figure 6). The substantial discrepancies between the anatomist-defined atlas pathways and the group connectome streamlines are easily apparent. Further, nearly all of the connecting streamlines predicted by the group connectome appear to be false-positive trajectories. Therein lies the danger of using anatomically unconstrained methods to infer axonal pathway information from a water diffusion displacement profile in an underdetermined inverse problem (Thomas et al., 2014Thomas C. Ye F.Q. Irfanoglu M.O. Modi P. Saleem K.S. Leopold D.A. Pierpaoli C. Anatomical accuracy of brain connections derived from diffusion MRI tractography is inherently limited.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 16574-16579Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The simulations in Figure 6 highlight the need to use detailed anatomical foundations, or anatomical priors, when attempting to create connectomic datasets, even when using high-quality DWI data. Although the pathway models generated in this study represent the most anatomically detailed 3D representations of human subthalamic axonal trajectories ever created, they still suffer from numerous limitations. First, no anatomical standards currently exist for defining these pathways in the human brain (Figure 7). As such, an important validation experiment for our holographic reconstruction methods would be to recreate established pathways in the macaque brain to more explicitly demonstrate the legitimacy of this new methodology. Nonetheless, our goal was to address the pressing need for something that could serve as an initial standard for human analyses, based on the collective knowledge of our anatomy experts, as well as the latest histologic and MRI data. Clearly, our pathway models will need to evolve with time as additional anatomical information becomes available and new anatomical mapping techniques are developed. For example, HCP data (Yeh et al., 2018Yeh F.C. Panesar S. Fernandes D. Meola A. Yoshino M. Fernandez-Miranda J.C. Vettel J.M. Verstynen T. Population-averaged atlas of the macroscale human structural connectome and its network topology.Neuroimage. 2018; 178: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), 7T MRI data (Duchin et al., 2018Duchin Y. Shamir R.R. Patriat R. Kim J. Vitek J.L. Sapiro G. Harel N. Patient-specific anatomical model for deep brain stimulation based on 7 Tesla MRI.PLoS ONE. 2018; 13: e0201469Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and 3D polarized light imaging (3D-PLI) (Schmitz et al., 2018Schmitz D. Muenzing S.E.A. Schober M. Schubert N. Minnerop M. Lippert T. Amunts K. Axer M. Derivation of fiber orientations from oblique views through human brain sections in 3D-polarized light imaging.Front. Neuroanat. 2018; 12: 75Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) all provide augmentative information that could be used to evolve the human pathway models in the future. The second major limitation of this study was that many of the details included in the human pathway atlas were derived from scientific results generated in the macaque brain. This required inter-species assumptions on the maintenance of somatotopic organizations of axonal trajectories within pathways, as well as their respective termination points in the basal ganglia targets. For example, previous tractographic analyses suggest that the human internal capsule is somatotopically organized in the same fashion as the macaque (e.g., Archer et al., 2018Archer D.B. Vaillancourt D.E. Coombes S.A. A template and probabilistic atlas of the human sensorimotor tracts using diffusion MRI.Cereb. Cortex. 2018; 28: 1685-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Safadi et al., 2018Safadi Z. Grisot G. Jbabdi S. Behrens T.E. Heilbronner S.R. McLaughlin N.C.R. Mandeville J. Versace A.

Neurosci. 2018; 38: 2106-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but real anatomical documentation of these kinds of details is lacking in the human. The third major limitation of our atlas is that it is an atlas, an amalgamation of many different anatomical features that may not be specifically representative of any single individual. Nonetheless, advances in non-linear warping algorithms do provide opportunities to translate the idealized anatomical information provided in our atlas into the context of MRI datasets from a real person (Avants et al., 2014Avants B.B. Tustison N.J. Stauffer M. Song G. Wu B. Gee J.C. The Insight ToolKit image registration framework.Front. Neuroinform. 2014; 8: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar; Figure 6). Figures S1 and S2 demonstrate that process with a small-, medium-, and large-sized brain selected from the HCP database. The primary applications of the pathway atlas are in medical education and connectomic research. Detailed anatomical information about the human brain and its axonal connections provides greater opportunities to facilitate medical training experiences that highlight the role of brain connectivity on behavioral function, as well as the subsequent loss of function with disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis or stroke). Such training can also leverage the group-based holographic visualization capabilities, as is being done with gross anatomy education (Wish-Baratz et al., 2019Wish-Baratz S. Gubatina A.P. Enterline R. Griswold M.A. A new supplement to gross anatomy dissection: HoloAnatomy.Med. Educ. 2019; 53: 522-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).

Synapses constitute the elementary functional units of the brain. They convey excitatory or inhibitory signals that need to be coordinated in space and time for optimal brain function (Mullins et al., 2016Mullins C. Fishell G. Tsien R.W.

Excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the mammalian brain mainly use glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter, respectively. They are multi-molecular nanomachines composed of almost exclusive sets of proteins (Krueger-Burg et al., 2017Krueger-Burg D. Papadopoulos T. Brose N.

Yet they share the same basic organization, which ensures the efficacy and fine-tuning of synaptic transmission. The organization of synapses relies on transient, highly regulated interactions between various categories of proteins (neurotransmitter receptors, scaffolding proteins, adhesion proteins, signaling molecules, and cytoskeleton elements) and accommodates a great level of molecular diversity (Choquet and Triller, 2013Choquet D.

The molecular diversity of synapses enables the establishment of complex neuronal networks: it specifies their functional properties and shapes the transfer of information between neurons throughout the brain. Hence, synaptic dysfunctions cause a wide range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy, autisms, or schizophrenia (Bourgeron, 2015Bourgeron T.

Nonetheless, frequent discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo studies have made the role of some trans-synaptic molecular interactions difficult to precisely delineate. Furthermore, the scarcity of information on how trans-synaptic signals are transduced in the post-synaptic neuron stymies our understanding of the molecular logic governing the assembly of synaptic connections. Individual synaptic proteins may operate through a diversity of modalities. Recently, it has emerged that ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), which are the main excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the CNS, do not solely operate through ionotropic mechanisms (Dore et al., 2015Dore K.

Alternative functions of iGluRs are best characterized for the glutamate receptor delta-2 (GluD2), an iGluR of the delta subfamily (comprising GluD1 and GluD2 receptor subunits, encoded by the genes grid1 and grid2) predominantly expressed in the cerebellum (Araki et al., 1993Araki K.

It contributes to synaptic adhesion by interacting with presynaptic neurexins containing an insert in the splice site 4 through the extracellular scaffolding proteins cerebellins (Cblns), presynaptically secreted molecules that belong to the C1q family of the classical complement pathway (Südhof, 2017Südhof T.C.

Neurochem. 2012; 121: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, GluD1 function remains poorly understood. In the present study, we have investigated the role of GluD1 in the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the somato-sensory cortex. By depleting GluD1 in vivo in a few layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs) using sparse in utero electroporation (IUE), we demonstrate that GluD1 regulates the formation of inhibitory synapses in dendrites as well as inhibitory synaptic transmission. In contrast, GluD1 is dispensable for the formation and maintenance of excitatory synapses in CNPs. Using an in vivo structure/function analysis, we demonstrate that the regulation of inhibitory synapses by GluD1 requires trans-synaptic interaction via Cbln4, an extracellular scaffolding protein secreted by somatostatin-expressing (SST+) interneurons (INs) (Favuzzi et al., 2019Favuzzi E. Deogracias R. Marques-Smith A. Maeso P. Jezequel J. Exposito-Alonso D. Balia M. Kroon T. Hinojosa A.J. Maraver E.F. Rico B. Distinct molecular programs regulate synapse specificity in cortical inhibitory circuits.Science. 2019; 363: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), activation of the receptor by its endogenous agonists glycine and D-Serine, and post-synaptic signaling via the intracellular C-terminal tail of the receptor. Using mass spectrometry, we characterize GluD1 interactome in developing synapses. We show that GluD1 serves as a hub for molecules implicated in inhibitory synaptogenesis, and we identify two major partners of GluD1, the signaling molecules rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 12 (ARHGEF12) and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A (PPP1R12A), as critical regulators of inhibitory synapse formation in CPNs. Together, our results define a trans-synaptic signaling pathway centered on an atypical iGluR for the formation and specification of cortical inhibitory circuits. In order to assess the role of GluD1 in synaptic development, we used cortex-directed IUE at embryonic day (E)15.5. IUE at E15.5 allows the sparse and specific modification of layer 2/3 CPNs in their intact environment and the dissection of cell autonomous mechanisms operating at synapses in vivo (Figure 1A). We analyzed the consequences of GluD1 depletion or overexpression on excitatory and inhibitory synapses formed on oblique apical dendrites of layer 2/3 CPNs of the somato-sensory cortex using a morphometric approach (Figure 1A). We first used dendritic spines, the postsynaptic site of the majority of excitatory synaptic inputs in the brain (Bourne and Harris, 2008Bourne J.N. Harris K.M. Balancing structure and function at hippocampal dendritic spines.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 47-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, Yuste, 2013Yuste R. Electrical compartmentalization in dendritic spines.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 36: 429-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and clusters of PSD-95, a major scaffolding protein of excitatory synapses (Sheng and Hoogenraad, 2007Sheng M. Hoogenraad C.C. The postsynaptic architecture of excitatory synapses: a more quantitative view.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 823-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), as a proxy for excitatory synapses (Figure 1B). We found that GluD1 depletion using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (shGluD1; Figure S1A) did not affect the density of dendritric spines in juvenile (postnatal day [P]20–22) or adult (P > 69) mice (102% ± 3% and 105% ± 5% of control in juvenile and adult neurons respectively; Figures 1B–1D) or the density of endogenous PSD-95 clusters visualized using EGFP-tagged fibronectin intrabodies generated with mRNA display (FingR) (Gross et al., 2013Gross G.G. Junge J.A. Mora R.J. Kwon H.-B. Olson C.A. Takahashi T.T. Liman E.R. Ellis-Davies G.C.R. McGee A.W. Sabatini B.L. et al.Recombinant probes for visualizing endogenous synaptic proteins in living neurons.Neuron. 2013; 78: 971-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (94% ± 5% of control; Figures 1E and 1F). GluD1 overexpression, however, decreased spine density to 75% ± 4% of the control value (Figures 1B and 1C). These results suggest that GluD1 is not necessary for the formation or maintenance of excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 CPNs, though GluD1 may constrain their number if upregulated. We then assessed the role of GluD1 at inhibitory synapses. To that aim, we expressed small amounts of fluorescent (EGFP-tagged) gephyrin (Figure 1A), the core component of inhibitory postsynaptic scaffolds (Krueger-Burg et al., 2017Krueger-Burg D.

Elimination of inhibitory synapses is a major component of adult ocular dominance plasticity.Neuron. 2012; 74: 374-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In juvenile mice, GluD1 knockdown (KD) using shRNAs decreased the density of gephyrin clusters compared to control neurons (77% ± 4% of control; Figures 1G and 1H; Figure S2). Normal gephyrin cluster density was rescued by co-electroporating shGluD1 with a KD-resistant GluD1 construct (GluD1∗; Figures 1G and 1H; Figure S1A). Remarkably, the decrease in gephyrin cluster density induced by GluD1 KD was maintained in adults (79% ± 4% of control; Figure 1I), indicating that the loss of inhibitory synapses was not compensated over time. To further substantiate the role of GluD1 at inhibitory synapses, we knocked out grid1 in single cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We expressed the enhanced specificity espCas9(1.1) (Slaymaker et al., 2016Slaymaker I.M. Gao L. Zetsche B. Scott D.A. Yan W.X. Zhang F. Rationally engineered Cas9 nucleases with improved specificity.Science. 2016; 351: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) and a combination of two guide RNAs (gRNAs) using IUE. In grid1 knockout (KO) neurons, the density of gephyrin clusters was decreased by 22% ± 5% compared to control neurons expressing espCas9(1.1) with mismatched gRNAs (Figures 1J and 1K), which is consistent with GluD1 KD experiments with shRNAs. In line with these results, GluD1 overexpression increased the density of gephyrin clusters along dendrites by 33% ± 4% (Figures 1J and 1K). To test the physiological consequences of GluD1 inactivation on synaptic transmission, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording in electroporated GluD1-depleted neurons and in neighboring non-electroporated control neurons (Figure 2A). We compared miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) in brain slices from juvenile mice (Figure 2B). In line with the morphological data, GluD1 KD did not affect the amplitude or the frequency of mEPSCs (98% ± 8% and 100% ± 4% of control, respectively) (Figures 2B–2D). In contrast, GluD1 KD slightly increased the amplitude of mIPSCs and decreased their frequency by ≈35% (Figures 2B, 2E, and 2F), which is consistent with the reduced gephyrin cluster density observed in the oblique dendrites of GluD1 KD and KO neurons. We conclude that GluD1 in CPNs is selectively required for the formation of inhibitory synapses. It regulates both the assembly of the gephyrin-based postsynaptic scaffold and inhibitory synaptic transmission. It"

However, the mechanism underlining this propensity and therapeutic approaches to counter this process has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that MCP-1 produced by omental adipocytes binding to its cognate receptor CCR-2 on ovarian cancer cells facilitates migration and omental metastasis by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and its downstream effectors HIF-1α and VEGF-A in cell lines, xenografts, and transgenic murine models. MCP-1 antibody significantly decreased tumor burden and increased survival of mice in vivo. Interestingly, metformin decreased omental metastasis at least partially by inhibiting MCP-1 secretion from adipocytes independent of direct effects on cancer cells. Together this suggests a novel target of MCP-1/CCR-2 axis that could benefit ovarian cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2988375020,"The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) performs many functions, including decision making and movement control. It remains unknown which input and output pathways of PPC support different functions. We addressed this issue in mice, focusing on PPC neurons projecting to the dorsal striatum (PPC-STR) and the posterior secondary motor cortex (PPC-pM2). Projection-specific, retrograde labeling showed that PPC-STR and PPC-pM2 represent largely distinct subpopulations, with PPC-STR receiving stronger inputs from association areas and PPC-pM2 receiving stronger sensorimotor inputs. Two-photon calcium imaging during decision making revealed that the PPC-STR population encodes history-dependent choice bias more strongly than PPC-pM2 or general PPC populations. Furthermore, optogenetic inactivation of PPC-STR neurons or their terminals in STR decreased history-dependent bias, while inactivation of PPC-pM2 neurons altered movement kinematics. Therefore, PPC biases action selection through its STR projection while controlling movements through PPC-pM2 neurons. PPC may support multiple functions through parallel subpopulations, each with distinct input-output connectivity."

This study aimed to explore the association between self-efficacy and self-management behaviors among Chinese T2DM patients, which might provide evidence to inform effective self-management interventions for these patients.A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a multi-stage stratified randomized sampling in Shandong Province, China. The Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Short Form (DES-SF) was used to measure patients' self-efficacy to manage diabetes. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to explore the observed classes of self-management behaviors (dietary control, physical exercise, regular medication and self-monitoring of blood glucose). A two-class solution for self-management behaviors was tested to be the fittest based on LCA; we labelled active and inactive self-management groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to examine the associations between self-efficacy and self-management behaviors.A total of 2166 T2DM patients were included in the analysis. The mean DES-SF score was 31.9 (standard deviation: 5.2). The estimated proportions of T2DM in the active and inactive groups were 54.8% and 45.2%, respectively. The multivariate logistic regression showed that higher DES-SF score was significantly associated with higher possibility of active self-management behaviors (odds ratio = 1.06; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.08).Self-efficacy in managing diabetes is associated with self-management behaviors among Chinese T2DM patients. To improve self-management behaviors, multiple strategies should be conducted to improve patients' self-efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2984922519,"The 'European Alliance Against Depression' community-based intervention approach simultaneously targets depression and suicidal behaviour by a multifaceted community based intervention and has been implemented in more than 115 regions worldwide. The two main aims of the European Union funded project ""Optimizing Suicide Prevention Programmes and Their Implementation in Europe"" were to optimise this approach and to evaluate its implementation and impact. This paper reports on the primary outcome of the intervention (the number of completed and attempted suicides combined as 'suicidal acts') and on results concerning process evaluation analysis. Interventions were implemented in four European cities in Germany, Hungary, Portugal and Ireland, with matched control sites. The intervention comprised activities with predefined minimal intensity at four levels: training of primary care providers, a public awareness campaign, training of community facilitators, support for patients and their relatives. Changes in frequency of suicidal acts with respect to a one-year baseline in the four intervention regions were compared to those in the four control regions (chi-square tests). The decrease in suicidal acts compared to baseline in the intervention regions (-58 cases, -3.26%) did not differ significantly (χ2 = 0.13; p = 0.72) from the decrease in the control regions (-18 cases, -1.40%). However, intervention effects differed between countries (χ2 = 8.59; p = 0.04), with significant effects on suicidal acts in Portugal (χ2 = 4.82; p = 0.03). The interviews and observations explored local circumstances in each site throughout the study. Hypothesised mechanisms of action for successful implementation were observed and drivers for 'added-value' were identified: local partnership working and 'in-kind' contributions; an approach which valued existing partnership strengths; and synergies operating across intervention levels. It can be assumed that significant events during the implementation phase had a certain impact on the observed outcomes. However, this impact was, of course, not proven."

https://openalex.org/W2986601626,"Background Preterm birth (PTB) is a public health issue worldwide. In developing nations, like Ethiopia, PTB is under reported and underestimated. However, it is the leading cause of neonatal and under-five mortality in Ethiopia. Besides, limited and non-comparative research studies to date has been conducted in the country to address the prevalence of PTB. Therefore, this study aims to determine predictors of PTB. Methods Hospital-based unmatched case control study was employed on a sample of 139 cases and 278 controls from October 2017 to December 2017 in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. The cases and controls were proportionally allocated in each hospital based on the last one-year case flows. As soon as a case was identified, the respective two controls were enrolled until the required sample size was satisfied. The outcome variable was measured by using either last menstrual period (LMP), early ultrasound result, or Ballard maturity examination. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a standardized, structured, and pre-tested questionnaire to collect data. The collected data was entered into Epi-data and exported into SPSS for analysis. Independent variables with p-values < 0.25 in the bivariate analysis were entered into multivariable logistic regression models with forward logistic regressions method to control the influence of covariates. Ethical clearance was ensured. Results A total of 134 cases and 268 controls participated with a response rate of 96.4%. After adjusting for covariates, the following variables were associated with PTB: residing in rural areas [AOR = 2.99: 95% CI 1.19, 7.48], low maternal age [AOR = 3.47: 95% CI 1.11, 10.83], being illiterate [AOR = 4.56: 95% CI 1.11,8.62], short birth spacing [AOR = 2.48: 95% CI 1.07, 5.75], no antenatal care visits for this index pregnancy [AOR = 10.78: 95% CI 4.43, 26.25], having a history of previous adverse birth outcomes [AOR = 3.47: 95% CI 1.51, 8.02], and exposure to medical problems during pregnancy [AOR = 13.94: 95% CI 4.39, 24.27]. Conclusion The study revealed maternal sociodemographic factors, short birth space, lack of antenatal care, exposure to previous adverse birth outcomes and facing medical illnesses during pregnancy were the predictors of PTB. Therefore, inclusive preventive and control interventions should be developed at regional, zonal and district levels to reduce the burden of PTB among women resided in rural areas such as integrating antenatal care services into the existing health extension packages. Study results suggest increasing the awareness of PTB, contraceptive utilization and counseling to enhance birth spacing, antenatal care visits, and accessibility to services among women in Ethiopia should be given due attention. Health care providers should focus on mothers with previous adverse birth outcomes and those exposed to medical problems during pregnancy. Additional community based longitudinal studies supplemented with qualitative methods are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2989447917,"A subset of environmental chemicals acts as ""obesogens"" as they increase adipose mass and lipid content in livers of treated rodents. One of the most studied class of obesogens are the tin-containing chemicals that have as a central moiety tributyltin (TBT), which bind and activate two nuclear hormone receptors, Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG) and Retinoid X Receptor Alpha (RXRA), at nanomolar concentrations. Here, we have tested whether TBT chloride at such concentrations may affect the neutral lipid level in two cell line models of human liver. Indeed, using high content image analysis (HCA), TBT significantly increased neutral lipid content in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Consistent with the observed increased lipid accumulation, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH) and RT-qPCR experiments revealed that TBT enhanced the steady-state mRNA levels of two key genes for de novo lipogenesis, the transcription factor SREBF1 and its downstream enzymatic target, FASN. Importantly, pre-treatment of cells with 2-deoxy-D-glucose reduced TBT-mediated lipid accumulation, thereby suggesting a role for active glycolysis during the process of lipid accumulation. As other RXRA binding ligands can promote RXRA protein turnover via the 26S proteasome, TBT was tested for such an effect in the two liver cell lines. We found that TBT, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, significantly reduced steady-state RXRA levels in a proteasome-dependent manner. While TBT promotes both RXRA protein turnover and lipid accumulation, we found no correlation between these two events at the single cell level, thereby suggesting an additional mechanism may be involved in TBT promotion of lipid accumulation, such as glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2985582581,"Which comes first: tissue structure or cell differentiation? Although different cell types establish distinct structures delineating the inside and outside of an embryo, they progressively become specified by the blastocyst stage, when two types of cell lineages are formed: the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophectoderm (TE). This inside–outside aspect can be experimentally converted by the isolation of the ICM from a blastocyst, leading to a posteriori externalization of the blastomeres composing the outermost layer of the ICM. Here, we investigated the totipotency of isolated mouse and bovine ICMs to determine whether they are competent for TE regeneration. Surprisingly, a calf was generated from the bovine isolated ICM with re-formed blastocoel (re-iICM), but no mouse re-iICMs developed to term. To further explore the cause of difference in developmental competency between the mouse and bovine re-iICMs, we investigated the SOX17 protein expression that is a representative molecular marker of primitive endoderm. The localization pattern of SOX17 was totally different between mouse and bovine embryos. Particularly, the ectopic SOX17 localization in the TE might be associated with lethality of mouse re-iICMs. Meanwhile, transcriptome sequencing revealed that some of the bovine re-iICMs showed transcriptional patterns of TE-specific genes similar to those of whole blastocysts. Our findings suggest that TE regeneration competency is maintained longer in bovine ICMs than in mouse ICMs and provide evidence that the ICM/TE cell fate decision is influenced by structural determinants, including positional information of each blastomere in mammalian embryos.

In mice, differences in blastomere position become apparent at the 16-cell stage; subsequently, lineage-specific transcriptional profiles are simultaneously composed and completed by the 32-cell stage, embryonic day (E) 3.0 (11Guo G.

By E4.5 (128-cell stage), the primitive endoderm (PrE) is specified within the ICM to give rise to the yolk sac, which is the second cell fate decision after the first ICM/TE decision. The blastomeres other than PrE within the ICM are epiblast, which gives rise to the embryo proper. The PrE layer is arranged in the laminae adjacent to the blastocoel. After these blastomere specifications, three components are generated to construct a whole conceptus: epiblast, PrE, and TE. Thus, the different microenvironments provided by the inside and outside blastomeres lead to and ensure each blastomere specification through the accommodation of key differentiation markers to determine lineage-specific transcriptional profiles. These microenvironments can be experimentally redesigned by isolating the ICM derived from a mouse blastocyst to explore the plasticity of cell fate decisions (12Wigger M. Kisielewska K. Filimonow K. Plusa B. Maleszewski M. Suwińska A. Plasticity of the inner cell mass in mouse blastocyst is restricted by the activity of FGF/MAPK pathway.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (29123210): 1513610.1038/s41598-017-15427-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The isolation of the ICM by TE removal leads to a posteriori externalization of the blastomeres composing the outermost layer of the ICM that was originally allocated to the inside beneath an epithelial TE layer. The isolated ICM (iICM) from mouse blastocyst has the ability to regenerate the TE because of the inactivation of Hippo signaling, which is essential for the conversion of information regarding blastomere position, polarity, and contact into cell lineage–specific transcriptional commands (12Wigger M. Kisielewska K. Filimonow K. Plusa B. Maleszewski M. Suwińska A. Plasticity of the inner cell mass in mouse blastocyst is restricted by the activity of FGF/MAPK pathway.Sci.

The Hippo signaling effector YAP1 is a key regulator of cell lineage specificity in developing embryos. A nucleocytoplasmic shift in YAP1 localization characterizes the boundary between the ICM and TE within a blastocyst. Hippo signaling inactivation induces the nuclear localization of YAP1, resulting in CDX2 expression through interaction with TEAD4 in the TE (13Nishioka N. Inoue K. Adachi K. Kiyonari H. Ota M.

Interestingly, in mouse iICMs, CDX2, which commits cells to the TE lineage, as well as GATA4, an early marker for the PrE lineage, are expressed in the outer blastomeres, i.e. the “regenerated TE” (12Wigger M.

In contrast, the TE of a normal mouse blastocyst never expresses PrE markers, including SOX17 (14Lorthongpanich C. Messerschmidt D.M. Chan S.W. Hong W. Knowles B.B. Solter D. Temporal reduction of LATS kinases in the early preimplantation embryo prevents ICM lineage differentiation.Genes Dev. 2013; 27 (23824537): 1441-144610.1101/gad.219618.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Krawchuk D.

However, whether this “regenerated TE” observed in the iICM is equivalent to the “intrinsic TE” has not yet been determined. Another important question is whether the iICM expressing lineage-specific transcription factors for three primary cell lineages is totipotent (defined as the developmental ability to form an entire individual). Expression of the complete set of lineage-specific markers does not ascertain totipotency. For example, although somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos express all the lineage-specific marker genes (16Mallol A. Santaló J. Ibáñez E.

Hence, cell totipotency and the potential for full-term development can only be determined by transferring embryos to recipient females, which would provide conclusive evidence that positional information of blastomeres is essential for cell fate decision in mammalian embryos. The microenvironmental events associated with cell fate specification at the blastocyst stage described above have rarely been investigated in nonrodent species other than mice. However, crucial differences exist in the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell fate specification at the blastocyst stage among species (22Simmet K. Zakhartchenko V. Wolf E.

For example, OCT4, a representative basis of cell pluripotency, is not restricted to the ICM in human and bovine blastocysts, unlike that in mouse (25Berg D.K. Smith C.S. Pearton D.J. Wells D.N.

Comparing cell specifications through the microenvironment between rodent and nonrodent species may contribute to our understanding of diverse regulation patterns during preimplantation development across species. We determined the TE regeneration competency of the outmost blastomeres within the iICM by investigating the totipotency of both mouse and bovine iICMs. Mouse iICMs could not develop to term, but a calf was born from bovine iICM with regenerated TE. This difference in maintenance of TE regeneration competency between the species might be attributed to species specificity, in part, in the spatiotemporal regulation of SOX17. The regeneration of TE in bovine as well as mouse iICM was mediated by Hippo signaling. Some bovine iICMs exhibited normal expression levels of bovine TE-specific genes, which was supported by the well-developed placenta of the newborn cattle derived from the iICM. Our findings suggest that the TE regeneration competency is maintained in bovine ICMs for relatively longer than in mouse ICMs, revealing the remarkable flexibility in cell differentiation during preimplantation development in mammals. We assessed the competency of the iICMs to re-form a blastocoel (re-cavitation; Fig. 1A). The purity of the iICMs was confirmed on the basis of CDX2 fluorescent signals that characterize TE, and no TE carryover was noted in both mouse and bovine iICMs (Fig. 1, B and C). When the iICMs were cultured in the embryo-cultivation medium for 24 h, the formation of morphologically clear blastocoels was induced in both mouse and bovine iICMs (Fig. 1A). However, the size of the blastocoel in mouse iICMs with re-cavitation (re-iICMs) was markedly smaller than that in intact whole blastocysts. In contrast, the blastocoel of bovine re-iICMs was relatively well-developed, and the blastocoel size of some bovine re-iICMs was similar to that of intact whole blastocysts. The rate of re-iICMs to all the cultured iICMs in mice (57.1% ± 8.5) was remarkably lower than that in cattle (97.2% ± 2.0; Fig. 1D). For further comparison of re-iICMs between mice and cattle, we assessed the total cell number. Immediately after the isolation of ICMs, the cell numbers of both mouse and bovine iICMs decreased because of TE removal. The total cell number in mouse re-iICMs tended to decrease after 24 h of cultivation compared with that in iICMs immediately after isolation, both of which were considerably lower than that of intact whole blastocysts (Whole; Fig. 1E). In contrast, the total cell number in bovine re-iICM increased by ∼1.5-fold relative to that in the iICM immediately after isolation (Fig. 1F), which was equivalent to half of that in Whole. These results suggest that the competences of re-cavitation and cell proliferation in bovine re-iICM are relatively higher than those in mouse re-iICM. Subsequently, to determine the totipotency of the re-iICMs in mice and cattle, we evaluated the full-term development potential after transfer to the uteri of recipient females. First, we transferred 59 mouse re-iICMs derived from ICR (Institute of Cancer Research). None of the mouse re-iICMs developed to term (Fig. 1G). In general, the developmental competence of mouse embryos from closed colonies, including ICR, is considerably lower than that of embryos from hybrids, such as B6D2F1 (C57BL/6 × DBA/2). Therefore, we transferred 61 B6D2F1 re-iICMs; nevertheless, none of them showed implantation sites and full-term development. Like in mice, we transferred four bovine re-iICMs to three recipient cows. We used oocytes derived from Japanese black beef cattle for producing iICMs because Japanese black beef cattle have a distinct black coat-color phenotype, and neonates derived from them are distinguishable from recipient Holstein cows. Among the recipient cows, one was pregnant. Surprisingly, on day 282 (June 24, 2018) of gestation, a female calf with black coat was born vaginally (Fig. 1H). The placenta discharged from the uterus after birth (afterbirth) was morphologically normal with 92 fetal cotyledons. The birth weight was also normal (46 kg). The birth of the calf provides definitive evidence that some bovine iICMs can regenerate functional TE to support full-term development. In contrast, no mouse iICMs developed to term, indicating that species-specific differences exist in the maintenance of totipotency during preimplantation development. However, mouse iICMs could also regenerate TE with primary differentiation markers such as CDX2, which has been supported by the findings of one previous study, although whether the regenerated TE was functional was not determined (12Wigger M. Kisielewska K. Filimonow K. Plusa B. Maleszewski M. Suwińska A. Plasticity of the inner cell mass in mouse blastocyst is restricted by the activity of FGF/MAPK pathway.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (29123210): 1513610.1038/s41598-017-15427-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To explore how TE regeneration was achieved in mouse and bovine re-iICMs, we investigated CDX2 activation within the iICM by precisely observing the dynamics of three proteins: YAP1, TEAD4, and CDX2. In mouse normal embryos, the interaction between YAP1 and TEAD4 is believed to be an upstream mediator of CDX2 expression (13Nishioka N. Inoue K. Adachi K. Kiyonari H. Ota M. Ralston A. Yabuta N. Hirahara S. Stephenson R.O. Ogonuki N. Makita R. Kurihara H. Morin-Kensicki E.M. Nojima H.

YAP1 is shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a phosphorylation-dependent manner through the Hippo pathway, where the inside–outside spatial information translates into the transcriptional regulation of CDX2. We confirmed that YAP1 nuclear translocation in the outer blastomeres was coordinated with CDX2 expression during re-iICM formation in mice (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with the findings of a previous study (12Wigger M. Kisielewska K. Filimonow K. Plusa B. Maleszewski M. Suwińska A. Plasticity of the inner cell mass in mouse blastocyst is restricted by the activity of FGF/MAPK pathway.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (29123210): 1513610.1038/s41598-017-15427-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, little is known about this elegant regulatory mechanism of ICM/TE cell differentiation through the Hippo pathway during early bovine embryogenesis. To ensure the conserved molecular interaction in the Hippo pathway, we determined the localization patterns of both YAP1 and TEAD4 in intact bovine embryos from D5.0 to D6.5 (Fig. S1, A and B). Nuclear translocation of YAP1 in the outer cells began from D5.0 to D5.5 and was completed in the outermost blastomeres by the early blastocyst stage at D6.0 (Fig. S1A). In addition, TEAD4 was localized within the nuclei after D5.5 in almost all blastomeres composing an embryo (Fig. S1B). CDX2 started to localize within the nuclei in the outer blastomeres at D6.0 (Fig. S1B). To compare the localization patterns of YAP1 and CDX2 between bovine and mouse re-iICMs, we performed dual immunostaining (Fig. 2, A and B). In both mouse and bovine re-iICMs, YAP1 and CDX2 were colocalized within the nuclei in the outer blastomeres. Next, we double-checked the restricted localization of YAP1 and CDX2 to the outer blastomeres in bovine Whole and re-iICMs by using confocal microscopic images (Fig. S2). Moreover, because direct interaction between YAP1 and TEAD4 in species other than humans has not yet been confirmed (27Jang J.W. Kim M.K. Lee Y.S. Lee J.W. Kim D.M. Song S.H. Lee J.Y. Choi B.Y. Min B. Chi X.Z. Bae S.C. RAC-LATS1/2 signaling regulates YAP activity by switching between the YAP-binding partners TEAD4 and RUNX3.Oncogene. 2017; 36 (27425596): 999-101110.1038/onc.2016.266Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we performed immunoprecipitation for these proteins by using bovine fetal fibroblasts (Fig. 2C). We detected YAP1/TEAD4 proteins by using Western blotting and samples immunoprecipitated with YAP1/TEAD4 antibodies. Moreover, we confirmed the localization patterns of YAP1 and TEAD4 in bovine re-iICMs. YAP1 nuclear localization in the outermost blastomeres and TEAD4 nuclear localization in most blastomeres of bovine re-iICMs were similar to those observed in intact whole blastocysts after D6.0 (Fig. S1, A and B, and Fig. 2D). The spatiotemporal localization patterns of YAP1, TEAD4, and CDX2 in bovine embryos largely corresponded to those in mouse embryos; the interaction between YAP1 and TEAD4 has also been confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments in human HEK293 cells (27Jang J.W. Kim M.K. Lee Y.S. Lee J.W. Kim D.M. Song S.H. Lee J.Y. Choi B.Y. Min B. Chi X.Z. Bae S.C. RAC-LATS1/2 signaling regulates YAP activity by switching between the YAP-binding partners TEAD4 and RUNX3.Oncogene. 2017; 36 (27425596): 999-101110.1038/onc.2016.266Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, these results confirm that the underlining regulatory mechanism through the interaction between YAP1 and TEAD4 is conserved in bovine embryos. To further explore the differences in the localization patterns of YAP1 and CDX2 between mouse and bovine re-iICMs, we assessed the proportion of blastomeres with or without YAP1 and CDX2 fluorescent signals in mouse and bovine re-iICMs (Fig. 2E). In mice, the proportion of YAP1+/CDX2+ and YAP1−/CDX2− blastomeres was 25.0 ± 25.0 and 75.0 ± 25.0%, respectively. Neither YAP1- nor CDX2-positive blastomeres (YAP1+/CDX2− and YAP1−/CDX2+) was detected in the analyzed mouse re-iICMs. Conversely, the proportion of YAP1+/CDX2+, YAP1+/CDX2−, YAP1−/CDX2+, and YAP1−/CDX2− blastomeres was 44.0 ± 11.1, 6.0 ± 2.4, 6.0 ± 2.8, and 44.0 ± 10.5% in bovine re-iICMs, respectively. Unlike in mouse re-iICMs, ∼50% of blastomeres exhibited CDX2 expression to characterize the TE. These results indicate that the competence of TE regeneration through YAP1 expression in bovine iICM is relatively higher than that in mouse iICM. To obtain further insight into the transcriptional factor responsible for cell-fate decisions leading to the difference in the competence of TE regeneration among species, we focused on SOX17 expression during cell differentiation from ICM to PrE in mouse and bovine re-iICMs. In mouse embryos, SOX17 is a well-known PrE marker. However, because of insufficient knowledge on SOX17 expression pattern during bovine preimplantation development, we first determined the SOX17 dynamics in bovine embryos compared with those in mouse embryos (Fig. S3, A and B). SOX17 was absent in the mouse embryos at E3.0 (the late morula stage), and then was expressed in the ICM nuclei at E3.75 (the blastocyst stage). At E4.75 (the expanded blastocyst stage), SOX17 was clearly localized in the PrE nuclei of the ICM blastomeres facing the blastocoel (Fig. S3A), which is consistent with the findings of previous studies (14Lorthongpanich C.

Here we show that people readily engage in social categorization distinguishing humans (""us"") from machines (""them""), which leads to reduced cooperation with machines. However, we show that a simple cultural cue-the ethnicity of the machine's virtual face-mitigated this bias for participants from two distinct cultures (Japan and United States). We further show that situational cues of affiliative intent-namely, expressions of emotion-overrode expectations of coalition alliances from social categories: When machines were from a different culture, participants showed the usual bias when competitive emotion was shown (e.g., joy following exploitation); in contrast, participants cooperated just as much with humans as machines that expressed cooperative emotion (e.g., joy following cooperation).

https://openalex.org/W2983304535,"Large trees, here defined as ≥60 cm trunk diameter, are the most massive organisms in tropical rain forest, and are important in forest structure, dynamics and carbon cycling. The status of large trees in tropical forest is unclear, with both increasing and decreasing trends reported. We sampled across an old-growth tropical rain forest landscape at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica to study the distribution and performance of large trees and their contribution to forest structure and dynamics. We censused all large trees in 238 0.50 ha plots, and also identified and measured all stems ≥10 cm diameter in 18 0.50 ha plots annually for 20 years (1997-2017). We assessed abundance, species diversity, and crown conditions of large trees in relation to soil type and topography, measured the contribution of large trees to stand structure, productivity, and dynamics, and analyzed the decadal population trends of large trees. Large trees accounted for 2.5% of stems and ~25% of mean basal area and Estimated Above-Ground Biomass, and produced ~10% of the estimated wood production. Crown exposure increased with stem diameter but predictability was low. Large tree density was about twice as high on more-fertile flat sites compared to less fertile sites on slopes and plateaus. Density of large trees increased 27% over the study interval, but the increase was restricted to the flat more-fertile sites. Mortality and recruitment differed between large trees and smaller stems, and strongly suggested that large tree density was affected by past climatic disturbances such as large El Niño events. Our results generally do not support the hypothesis of increasing biomass and turnover rates in tropical forest. We suggest that additional landscape-scale studies of large trees are needed to determine the generality of disturbance legacies in tropical forest study sites."

The α-helical structure of the four AMPs was confirmed by circular dichroism (CD). These results suggest that the four peptides can be valuable tools for the design and development of AMPs for use in the inhibition of MDR pathogenic bacteria. A clear index of synergism and additivity was found for the combination of QnCs-BUAP + Uy234, which makes these peptides the most promising candidates against pathogenic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2983883525,"The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana plays important roles in maintaining appropriate ion homeostasis in the cytoplasm and regulating plant tolerance to salinity. However, little is known about the details regarding SOS family genes in the tuber mustard crop (Brassica juncea var. tumida). Here, 12 BjSOS family genes were identified in the B. juncea var. tumida genome including two homologous genes of SOS1, one and three homologs of SOS2 and SOS3, two homologs of SOS4, two homologs of SOS5 and two homologs of SOS6, respectively. The results of conserved motif analysis showed that these SOS homologs contained similar protein structures. By analyzing the cis-elements in the promoters of those BjSOS genes, several hormone- and stress-related cis-elements were found. The results of gene expression analysis showed that the homologous genes were induced by abiotic stress and pathogen. These findings indicate that BjSOS genes play crucial roles in the plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses. This study provides valuable information for further investigations of BjSOS genes in tuber mustard."
https://openalex.org/W2987727187,"Tarantula urticating setae are modified setae located on the abdomen or pedipalps, which represent an effective defensive mechanism against vertebrate or invertebrate predators and intruders. They are also useful taxonomic tools as morphological characters facilitating the classification of New World theraphosid spiders. In the present study, the morphology of urticating setae was studied on 144 taxa of New World theraphosids, including ontogenetic stages in chosen species, except for species with urticating setae of type VII. The typology of urticating setae was revised, and types I, III and IV were redescribed. The urticating setae in spiders with type I setae, which were originally among type III or were considered setae of intermediate morphology between types I and III, are newly considered to be ontogenetic derivatives of type I and are described as subtypes. Setae of intermediate morphology between that of body setae and type II urticating setae that were found in Iridopelma hirsutum and Antillena rickwesti may provide another evidence that type II urticating setae evolved from body setae. It is supposed that the fusion of barbs with the shaft may lead to the morphology of type II setae. As the type II setae of Aviculariinae evolved independently to the UrS of Theraphosinae and both subfamilies represent two non-sister groups, this should explain the differences in the morphology of body setae in Aviculariinae and Theraphosinae. The terminology of “barbs” and “reversed barbs” was revised and redefined, newly emphasizing the real direction of barbs."
https://openalex.org/W2987756386,"Powdery mildew is one of the most widespread diseases of wheat. The development and deployment of resistant varieties are one of the most economical and effective methods to manage this disease. Our previous study showed that the gene(s) at 2Mb in Chinese Spring (CS)-Aegilops biuncialis 2Mb disomic addition line TA7733 conferred a high level of resistance to powdery mildew of wheat. In this study, resistance spectrum of TA7733 was assayed by using 15 Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) isolates prevalent in different regions of China. The result indicated that TA7733 was highly resistant to all tested Bgt isolates and the gene(s) on chromosome 2Mb conferred broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew. In order to characterize mechanism of powdery mildew resistance by identifying candidates R-genes derived from Ae. biuncialis chromosome 2Mb and develop 2Mb-specific molecular markers, we performed RNA-seq analysis on TA7733 and CS. In total we identified 7,278 unigenes that showed specific expression in TA7733 pre and post Bgt-infection when compared to CS. Of these 7,278 unigenes, 295 were annotated as putative resistance (R) genes. Comparatively analysis of R-gene sequences from TA7733 and CS and integration CS Ref Seq v1.0 were used to develop R-gene specific primers. Of 295 R-genes we identified 53 R-genes were specific to 2Mb and could be involved in powdery mildew resistance. Functional annotation of majority of the 53 R-genes encoded nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat (NLR) protein. The broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew in TA7733 and availability of 2Mb-derived putative candidate R-gene specific molecular markers identified in this study will lay foundations for transferring powdery mildew resistance from 2Mb to common wheat by inducing CS-Ae. biuncialis homoeologous recombination. Our study also provides useful candidates for further isolation and cloning of powdery mildew resistance gene(s) from Ae. biuncialis chromosome 2Mb."
https://openalex.org/W2983821079,"In Denmark, American mink (Neovison vison) have been bred for their fur since the mid-1920s. Mink escaping from farms may supply the feral population. Often, it is of biological and management interest to separate the population of feral mink (i.e. mink caught in the wild) in two groups: 1) mink born on farms i.e., escapees, and 2) mink born in the wild. In this study, two methods were used for separating feral mink into the two groups: a) Comparison of body length of farmed mink and feral mink, and b) Presence of a biomarker (tetracycline: an oral antibiotic used on mink farms). A total of 367 wild caught mink (from the mainland of Denmark and the island of Bornholm), and 147 mink from farms, collected during the period 2014–2018, were used for the analysis of body length. For the testing of tetracycline (TC) as a biomarker, 78 mink from farms where there was knowledge about TC treatment (with or without) were examined for fluorescent markings in the canine teeth. Results from both univariate analyses and Gaussian mixture model analysis demonstrated clear divisions between the mean body length (mean ± S.E., range) of farmed males (52.1 cm ± 0.4, 48–68) and farmed females (mean 44.0 ± 0.2, 40–50), and between farmed mink and wild caught mink. Mixture analysis identified two groups within each sex of the wild caught mink, one assigned to farmed mink (born in captivity) and another group of smaller mink suspected of being born in the wild. On Bornholm, the mean (±SD, range) length of males born in the wild was 43.7cm (± 0.3, 36–57) and for females 37.5cm (± 0.3, 32–45). The mean length (±SD, range) of males born in the wild in the mainland of Denmark was 42.5cm (± 2.3, 36–46) and for females 36.1cm (± 1.0, 34–37). Among the feral mink from mainland Denmark, 28.4% of males and 21.6% of females were identified as escapees, while 0% of the males and 1% of the females were identified as escapees among the wild caught mink on Bornholm. Eight percent of mink from farms using tetracycline were false negatives, while no false positives were found among mink from farms not using TC. TC fluorescence was found in five of 217 mink caught in the wild equivalent to 22% escapees in mainland Denmark. No TC markings were found in mink caught in the wild on Bornholm. In conclusion, both methods a) the body length of mink, and b) fluorescent biomarkers in canine teeth are considered as useful tools to identifing mink that have escaped from farms."
https://openalex.org/W2985946832,"Research efforts directed to elucidation of mechanisms behind trading of resources between the partners in the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis have seen a considerable progress in the recent years. Yet, despite of the recent developments, some key questions still remain unanswered. For example, it is well established that the strictly biotrophic AM fungus releases phosphorus to- and receives carbon molecules from the plant symbiont, but the particular genes, and their products, responsible for facilitating this exchange, are still not fully described, nor are the principles and pathways of their regulation. Here, we made a de novo quest for genes involved in carbon transfer from the plant to the fungus using genome-wide gene expression array targeting whole root and whole shoot gene expression profiles of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal Medicago truncatula plants grown in a glasshouse. Using physiological intervention of heavy shading (90% incoming light removed) and the correlation of expression levels of MtPT4, the mycorrhiza-inducible phosphate transporter operating at the symbiotic interface between the root cortical cells and the AM fungus, and our candidate genes, we demonstrate that several novel genes may be involved in resource tradings in the AM symbiosis established by M. truncatula. These include glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator, polyol/monosaccharide transporter, DUR3-like, nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferase or a putative membrane transporter. Besides, we also examined the expression of other M. truncatula phosphate transporters (MtPT1-3, MtPT5-6) to gain further insights in the balance between the ""direct"" and the ""mycorrhizal"" phosphate uptake pathways upon colonization of roots by the AM fungus, as affected by short-term carbon/energy deprivation. In addition, the role of the novel candidate genes in plant cell metabolism is discussed based on available literature."

Here, we investigated the activity of AP on a panel of structurally defined LPS chemotypes isolated from Escherichia coli and demonstrate that calf intestinal AP (cIAP) has only minimal activity against unmodified enteric LPS chemotypes. Pi was only released from a subset of LPS chemotypes harboring spontaneously labile phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) modifications connected through phosphoanhydride bonds. We demonstrate that the spontaneously hydrolyzed O-phosphorylethanolamine is the actual substrate for AP. We found that the 1- and 4′-lipid A phosphate groups critical in TLR4/MD2 signaling become susceptible to hydrolysis only after de-O-acylation of ester linked primary acyl chains on lipid A. Furthermore, PEtN modifications on lipid A specifically enhanced hTLR4 agonist activity of underacylated LPS preparations.

https://openalex.org/W2988153676,"Background & aims Originally believed to be primarily a disorder of T-cell signaling, evidence shows that macrophage-lineage cells also contribute to the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease (CD). Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is a key regulator of the macrophage lineage, but its role in CD has not been well established. We examined transcriptional data from CD mucosa for evidence of CSF-1 pathway activation and tested JNJ-40346527 (PRV-6527), a small molecule inhibitor of CSF-1 receptor kinase (CSF-1R), for its ability to inhibit disease indices in murine colitis. Methods A CSF-1 pathway gene set was created from microarray data of human whole blood cultured ex vivo with CSF-1 and compared to a TNFα-induced gene set generated from epithelial-lineage cells. Gene set variation analysis was performed using existing Crohn’s mucosa microarray data comparing patients who either responded or failed to respond to anti-TNFα therapy. Commencing day 14 or day 21, mice with T-cell transfer colitis were treated with vehicle or JNJ-40346527 until study termination (day 42). Endpoints included colon weight/length ratios and histopathology scores, and macrophage and T cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Mucosal gene expression was investigated using RNAseq. Results Both the CSF-1 and the TNFα gene sets were enriched in the colonic mucosal transcriptomes of Crohn’s disease and in mouse colitis, and expression of both gene sets was highest in patients who did not respond to anti-TNFα therapy. In these patients neither set was reduced by therapy. In the mouse model, JNJ-40346527 inhibited the increase in colon weight/length ratio by ∼50%, reduced histological disease scores by ∼60%, and reduced F4/80+ mononuclear cell and CD3+ lymphocyte numbers. RNAseq analysis confirmed the CSF-1 gene set was sharply reduced in treated mice, as were gene sets enriched in “M1” inflammatory and “M0” resident macrophages and in activated T cells. Conclusions CSF-1 biology is activated in Crohn’s disease and in murine T cell transfer colitis. Inhibition of CSF-1R by JNJ-40346527 was associated with attenuated clinical disease scores and reduced inflammatory gene expression in mice. These data provide rationale for testing JNJ-40346527 (PRV-6527) in human inflammatory bowel disease."

The present study aims to examine the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymia in different European and Associated countries using standardized interview techniques. Furthermore, service utilization for the elderly with depression is assessed. Methods The MentDis_ICF65+ study is a cross-sectional survey (N = 3,142) that was conducted in six different European and Associated countries (Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, England and Israel) with a subsample of n = 463 elderly with any depressive disorder. Results Sociodemographic and clinical correlates, such as gender, age and symptom severity, were significantly associated with MDD and dysthymia in the elderly. Only 50% of elderly with any depressive disorder were treated with psycho- or pharmacotherapy. Conclusion Our findings identified sociodemographic and clinical characteristics for depression risk in the elderly and highlight the need to improve service delivery to older adults who suffer from depression."
https://openalex.org/W2985734592,"For doubled haploid (DH) production in maize, F1 generation has been the most frequently used for haploid induction due to facility in the process. However, using F2 generation would be a good alternative to increase genetic variability owing to the additional recombination in meiosis. Our goals were to compare the effect of F1 and F2 generations on DH production in tropical germplasm, evaluating the R1-navajo expression in seeds, the working steps of the methodology, and the genetic variability of the DH lines obtained. Sources germplasm in F1 and F2 generations were crossed with the tropicalized haploid inducer LI-ESALQ. After harvest, for both induction crosses were calculated the haploid induction rate (HIR), diploid seed rate (DSR), and inhibition seed rate (ISR) using the total number of seeds obtained. In order to study the effectiveness of the DH working steps in each generation, the percentage per se and the relative percentage were verified. In addition, SNP markers were obtained for genetic variability studies. Results showed that the values for HIR, ISR, and DSR were 1.23%, 23.48%, and 75.21% for F1 and 1.78%, 15.82%, and 82.38% for F2, respectively. The effectiveness of the DH working step showed the same percentage per se value (0.4%) for F1 and F2, while the relative percentage was 27.2% for F1 and 22.4% for F2. Estimates of population parameters in DH lines from F1 were higher than F2. Furthermore, population structure and kinship analyses showed that one additional generation was not sufficient to create new genotype subgroups. Additionally, the relative efficiency of the response to selection in the F1 was 31.88% higher than F2 due to the number of cycles that are used to obtain the DH. Our results showed that in tropical maize, the use of F1 generation is recommended due to a superior balance between time and genetic variability."

The aim was to explore the feasibility of using haptic icons to create assistive technologies for people with visual impairments. We compared the performance and satisfaction of users with different visual capacities (visually impaired vs. sighted) and using different learning processes (with or without a reinforcement learning stage). The reinforcement learning stage improves the recognition rate in both types of users, although the improvement obtained by the visually impaired users is even better as their recognition rates become very similar to those obtained by the sighted users. Finally, it was observed that the better recognized haptic icons are those assigned to the most employed applications by the user."

This work describes the cDNA cloning and bioinformatics analysis of Eg2DBDα, a 2DBD nuclear receptor isoform from the parasite Echinococcus granulosus (Platyhelminth, Cestoda). The Eg2DBDα gene coding domain structure was analysed. Although two additional 2DBD nuclear receptors are reported in the parasite database GeneDB, they are unlikely to be expressed in the larval stage. Phylogenetic relationships between these atypical proteins from different cestodes are also analysed including S. mansoni 2DBD nuclear receptors. The presence of two DNA binding domains confers particular interest to these nuclear receptors, not only concerning their function but to the development of new antihelminthic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2988623934,"Some patients have residual non-specific symptoms after therapy for Lyme disease, referred to as post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms or syndrome, depending on whether there is functional impairment. A standardized test battery was used to characterize a diverse group of Lyme disease patients with and without residual symptoms. There was a strong correlation between sleep disturbance and certain other symptoms such as fatigue, pain, anxiety, and cognitive complaints. Results were subjected to a Logistic Regression model using the Neuro-QoL Fatigue t-score together with Short Form-36 Physical Functioning scale and Mental Health component scores; and to a Decision Tree model using only the QoL Fatigue t-score. The Logistic Regression model had an accuracy of 97% and Decision Tree model had an accuracy of 93%, when compared with clinical categorization. The Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models were then applied to a separate cohort. Both models performed with high sensitivity (90%), but moderate specificity (62%). The overall accuracy was 74%. Agreement between 2 time points, separated by a mean of 4 months, was 89% using the Decision Tree model and 87% with the Logistic Regression model. These models are simple and can help to quantitate the level of symptom severity in post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms. More research is needed to increase the specificity of the models, exploring additional approaches that could potentially strengthen an operational definition for post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms. Evaluation of how sleep disturbance, fatigue, pain and cognitive complains interrelate can potentially lead to new interventions that will improve the overall health of these patients."

The outcomes were measured by shoulder range of motion (ROM), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder score, the period of pain relief, overall duration of disease, and satisfaction.All the patients got great improvement in shoulder ROM (P < .0001) after arthroscopic surgery, but there was no statistical difference in the pre-operative and post-operative shoulder ROM between the four groups and between diabetic and nondiabetic groups. The overall duration of disease was mean 55.4~68.7 weeks, which demonstrated much shorter disease course compared with nature course. Improvement were also seen in shoulder ROM at one week to one month, and the period of total pain relief was at a mean time of 3.7 to 3.8 weeks. There were higher ASES Shoulder score in group B than in group C (P = 0.02) and higher DASH score in diabetic group in short term follow-up.Arthroscopic release provides effective and rapid improvements to shoulder motion and function, unrelated to the timing of surgery, in patients with frozen shoulder.

https://openalex.org/W2983680471,"The objective of the present study was to verify the energy expenditure (EE), energy system contributions and autonomic control during and after an acute low-load or high-load resistance training (RT) protocol to momentary failure (MF) in young adults. Eleven young men (22 ± 3 yrs, 71.8 ± 7.7 kg; 1.75 ± 0.06 m) underwent a randomized crossover design of three knee extension acute protocols: a low-load RT [30% of their maximal strength (1RM); RT30] or a high-load RT (80% of 1RM; RT80) protocol, with all sets being performed to MF; or a control session (Control) without exercise. Participants were measured for EE, energy system contributions, and cardiac autonomic control before, during, and after each exercise session. Exercise EE was significantly higher for RT30 as compared to RT80. Furthermore, post measurements of blood lactate levels and the anaerobic lactic system contribution were significantly greater for RT30 as compared to RT80. In addition, parasympathetic restoration was lower for RT30 as compared to RT80. In conclusion, a low-load (30% 1RM) RT session produced higher EE during exercise than a high-load (80% 1RM) RT session to MF, and may be a good option for fitness professionals, exercise physiologists, and practitioners when choosing the optimal RT protocol that provides more EE, especially for those who want or need to lose weight."
https://openalex.org/W2986651131,"The input contains perceptually available cues, which might allow young infants to discover abstract properties of the target language. Thus, word frequency and prosodic prominence correlate systematically with basic word order in natural languages. Prelexical infants are sensitive to these frequency-based and prosodic cues, and use them to parse new input into phrases that follow the order characteristic of their native languages. Importantly, young infants readily integrate auditory and visual facial information while processing language. Here, we ask whether co-verbal visual information provided by talking faces also helps prelexical infants learn the word order of their native language in addition to word frequency and prosodic prominence. We created two structurally ambiguous artificial languages containing head nods produced by an animated avatar, aligned or misaligned with the frequency-based and prosodic information. During 4 minutes, two groups of 4- and 8-month-old infants were familiarized with the artificial language containing aligned auditory and visual cues, while two further groups were exposed to the misaligned language. Using a modified Headturn Preference Procedure, we tested infants' preference for test items exhibiting the word order of the native language, French, vs. the opposite word order. At 4 months, infants had no preference, suggesting that 4-month-olds were not able to integrate the three available cues, or had not yet built a representation of word order. By contrast, 8-month-olds showed no preference when auditory and visual cues were aligned and a preference for the native word order when visual cues were misaligned. These results imply that infants at this age start to integrate the co-verbal visual and auditory cues."

The object of the study is to determine the association of initial clinical-radiological features and staging with outcomes in patients with PHA.The medical records of adult patients with PHA were retrieved from an electronic medical record database and a pathology database and retrospectively reviewed. During 10 years, 22 eligible patients were included. Data extracted focused on the information before the first formal treatment with a pathological proof, including demographic characteristics, medical history, laboratory data, preliminary images, histopathological records, treatment, and follow-up survival period. Two radiologists blindly re-analyzed preliminary images of all 22 patients together and recorded tumor features and imaging stage based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) Staging System for hepatocellular carcinoma. A radiologist compiled the initial clinical data and preliminary image stage to analyze the association with patients' survival outcome.Higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST), higher total bilirubin (TB), lower albumin (ALB), longer prothrombin time (PT) and lower platelet count of serum relative to the normal reference range were more common in patients who survived ≤ 90 days (all P < 0.05). Overall survival was much better in patients with single PHA than in those with other tumor patterns of multiple PHA (all P < 0.05). Overall survival determined by preliminary imaging showed significant differences between stage I and stage III (P = 0.044), stage I and stage IV (P = 0.011), and stage III and IV (P = 0.047). No patients were at stage II.Initial serum levels of ALT, TB, ALB, and PT, platelet count, single mass in liver, and preliminary imaging staging could help predict survival outcomes of patients with PHA."
https://openalex.org/W2984943918,"The size at which sexual maturity is reached is a key population parameter used to guide the setting of minimum legal size limits in fisheries. Understanding spatial and temporal variations in size at maturity is fundamental to management because the relationship between size at maturity and minimum legal size limits affects the fraction of the mature population biomass that is harvested, and resulting egg production, larval settlement and recruitment. This study measured the size at maturity of female Southern Rock Lobster (Jasus edwardsii) across South Australia between 1991 and 2015 in relation to known oceanographic characteristics, surface and subsurface temperature data, and relative changes in lobster abundance. There was pronounced north to south spatial variation in estimates of size at maturity. Larger average size at maturity was recorded in warmer north-western areas of the fishery relative to the cooler waters of the south-east. Estimates of size at maturity also differed over 25 years across the fishery. However, the nature of temporal responses varied spatially, and were more consistent with variations in surface and subsurface water temperature at local-scales than changes in lobster density. In the well-mixed waters of the north-western, western and south-eastern parts of the fishery, relatively high rates of increase in sea-surface temperature and size at maturity were recorded since 1991, indicating that size at maturity may be responding to ocean warming associated with global climate change. In more central parts of the fishery, contrasting temporal signals in sea-surface temperature (positive) and bottom temperature (negative) indicated increases in upwelling strength over the study period, and formation of a bottom cold pool below a warm surface layer, with corresponding decreases in size at maturity recorded. The spatio-temporal changes in size at maturity measured in this study highlight the need for oceanographic information to be integrated into future stock assessment models to enhance harvest strategy development, allow timely adaptive management decisions and increase the resilience of fisheries to the impacts of climate change."

Descriptive statistics were used to estimate overall MTCT rate and MTCT rate by year, and period of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) protocol implementation. We conducted simple and multiple logistic-regression analyses, to identify predictors of MTCT.Data from 1,651 mother-to-infant pairs, with HIV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) test results from 2008 (n = 49), 2009 (n = 246), 2010 (n = 280), 2011 (n = 335), 2012 (n = 290), 2013 (n = 225) and 2014 (n = 226) were analysed. The overall MTCT rate among HIV exposed infants (HEIs) was 9.7% (95% CI 8.3% - 11.1%) at a median age of 8 weeks (IQR = 6-20). The MTCT rate decreased from 14.3% (4.4%-24.2%) in 2008 to 4.9% (2.1%-7.7%) in 2014 (p = 0.016). The MTCT rate was the lowest (5.4% [3.7% - 7.0%]) when all pregnant women living with HIV received triple antiretroviral therapy, as treatment or prophylaxis (ARVT/P). Using the pooled data, we found that infant age, breastfeeding option, antiretroviral regimen and year were predictors of MTCT. The adjusted odds of MTCT were significantly higher, when neither mother nor HEI received ARVT/P (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 26.4 [14.0-49.8], and lower amongst infants born in 2012, compared with those born in 2008 (AOR 0.2 [0.0-1.0]).The MTCT rate declined significantly between 2008 and 2014 in these two routine health-facility settings in Nigeria. Our study suggests that ARVT/P yields the lowest MTCT. Thus, efforts to scale up lifelong ARVT/P (Option B+) in Nigeria should be accelerated."
https://openalex.org/W2986661580,"Optogenetically engineered human neural progenitors (hNPs) are viewed as promising tools in regenerative neuroscience because they allow the testing of the ability of hNPs to integrate within nervous system of an appropriate host not only structurally, but also functionally based on the responses of their differentiated progenies to light. Here, we transduced H9 embryonic stem cell-derived hNPs with a lentivirus harboring human channelrhodopsin (hChR2) and differentiated them into a forebrain lineage. We extensively characterized the fate and optogenetic functionality of hChR2-hNPs in vitro with electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry. We also explored whether the in vivo phenotype of ChR2-hNPs conforms to in vitro observations by grafting them into the frontal neocortex of rodents and analyzing their survival and neuronal differentiation. Human ChR2-hNPs acquired neuronal phenotypes (TUJ1, MAP2, SMI-312, and synapsin 1 immunoreactivity) in vitro after an average of 70 days of coculturing with CD1 astrocytes and progressively displayed both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter signatures by immunocytochemistry and whole-cell patch clamp recording. Three months after transplantation into motor cortex of naïve or injured mice, 60–70% of hChR2-hNPs at the transplantation site expressed TUJ1 and had neuronal cytologies, whereas 60% of cells also expressed ChR2. Transplant-derived neurons extended axons through major commissural and descending tracts and issued synaptophysin+ terminals in the claustrum, endopiriform area, and corresponding insular and piriform cortices. There was no apparent difference in engraftment, differentiation, or connectivity patterns between injured and sham subjects. Same trends were observed in a second rodent host, i.e. rat, where we employed longer survival times and found that the majority of grafted hChR2-hNPs differentiated into GABAergic neurons that established dense terminal fields and innervated mostly dendritic profiles in host cortical neurons. In physiological experiments, human ChR2+ neurons in culture generated spontaneous action potentials (APs) 100–170 days into differentiation and their firing activity was consistently driven by optical stimulation. Stimulation generated glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic activity in neighboring ChR2- cells, evidence that hChR2-hNP-derived neurons had established functional synaptic connections with other neurons in culture. Light stimulation of hChR2-hNP transplants in vivo generated complicated results, in part because of the variable response of the transplants themselves. Our findings show that we can successfully derive hNPs with optogenetic properties that are fully transferrable to their differentiated neuronal progenies. We also show that these progenies have substantial neurotransmitter plasticity in vitro, whereas in vivo they mostly differentiate into inhibitory GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, neurons derived from hNPs have the capacity of establishing functional synapses with postsynaptic neurons in vitro, but this outcome is technically challenging to explore in vivo. We propose that optogenetically endowed hNPs hold great promise as tools to explore de novo circuit formation in the brain and, in the future, perhaps launch a new generation of neuromodulatory therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2987460917,"Cancer Stem Cells (CSC), a subset of cancer cells resembling normal stem cells with self-renewal and asymmetric division capabilities, are present at various but low proportions in many tumors and are thought to be responsible for tumor relapses following conventional cancer therapies. In vitro, most intriguingly, isolated CSCs rapidly regenerate the original population of stem and non-stem cells (non-CSCs) as shown by various investigators. This phenomenon still remains to be explained. We propose a mathematical model of cancer cell population dynamics, based on the main parameters of cell population growth, including the proliferation rates, the rates of cell death and the frequency of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions both in CSCs and non-CSCs sub-populations, and taking into account the stabilization phenomenon. The analysis of the model allows determination of time-varying corridors of probabilities for different cell fates, given the particular dynamics of cancer cells populations; and determination of a cell-cell communication factors influencing these time-varying probabilities of cell behavior (division, transition) scenarios. Though the results of the model have to be experimentally confirmed, we can anticipate the development of several fundamental and practical applications based on the theoretical results of the model."

However, transgenerational effects of this neurological disorder particularly prolonged febrile seizure (PFS) on neurobehavioral study and methylation profile is unknown. We therefore hypothesized that transgenerational impact of prolonged febrile seizure is dependent on methylation of hippocampal mGluR1 gene. Prolonged febrile seizure was induced on post-natal day (PND) 14, by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 217μg/kg ip) and kainic acid (KA; 1.83 mg/kg ip). Sucrose preference test (SPT) and Forced swim test (FST) were carried out in the first generation (F0) of animals at PND37 and PND60. The F0 rats were decapitated at PND 14, 37 and 60 which corresponded to childhood, adolescent and adulthood respectively and their hippocampal tissue collected. The second generation (F1) rats were obtained by mating F0 generation at PND 60 across different groups, F1 rats were subjected to SPT and FST test on PND 37 only. Decapitation of F1rats and collection of hippocampal tissues were done on PND 14 and 37. Assessment of mGluR5 and mGluR3 mRNA was done with PCR while mGluR1 methylation profile was assessed with the Quantitative MassARRAY analysis. Results showed that PFS significantly leads to decreased sucrose consumption in the SPT and increased immobility time in the FST in both generations of rats. It also leads to significant decrease in mGluR5 mRNA expression with a resultant increased expression of mGluR3 mRNA expression and hypermethylation of mGluR1 gene across both generations of rats. This study suggested that PFS led to behavioral changes which could be transmitted on to the next generation in rats."

Using the anthropological concept of ""big men"" who relied on influence to lead their communities, we examine the role of weight upon persuasiveness. We present the results of six studies that suggest a tendency for raters to expect larger body mass to correspond with more persuasiveness among men. In the sixth, pre-registered study, we find evidence that fits the hypothesis that weight among men is positively associated with perceived persuasiveness. While the ""big man"" leadership concept is based on studies of pre-industrial societies where weight embodied status, our findings suggest an evolved bias to favor moderately big men-with respect to perceived persuasiveness-even in environments where there is no reason to interpret over-consumption of food and conservation of energy as a signal of wealth. Our studies contribute novel perspectives on the relevance of weight as an understudied dimension of ""big"" and offer an important qualification informed by evolutionary perspectives for the stigmatizing effects of relatively large body mass."

One of those genes, the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A gene (AVPR1A) and one of its SNPs, rs10877969, has been associated with pain and disability in other pain populations. In patients with SCD, clinical factors such as pain and stress have been associated with increased health care utilization, but it is not known if the presence of the AVPR1A SNP plays a role in this observation. The study purpose was to explore the relationships between rs10877969 and self-reported pain, stress, and acute care utilization events among individuals with SCD.In a cross-sectional investigation of outpatients with SCD, participants completed PAINReportIt®, a computerized pain measure, to describe their pain experience and contributed blood or saliva samples for genetic analysis. We extracted emergency department and acute care utilization from medical records.The SNP genotype frequencies (%) for this sample were CC 30 (28%), CT 44 (41%), TT 33 (31%). Acute care utilization and stress as an aggravator of pain were significantly associated with the rs10877969 genotype (p = .02 and p = .002, respectively). The CT genotype had the highest mean utilization and CC genotype was associated with not citing stress as a pain aggravator. Chronic pain was not associated with rs10877969 (p = .41).This study shows that rs10877969 is related to indicators of stress and acute pain. Further research is recommended with other measures of stress and acute pain."
https://openalex.org/W2983132369,"A new telemetric system for the electrochemical monitoring of dissolved oxygen is showed. The device, connected with two amperometric sensors, has been successfully applied to the wireless detection of the extracellular oxygen in the central complex of freely-walking Gromphadorhina portentosa. The unit was composed of a potentiostat, a two-channel sensor conditioning circuit, a microprocessor module, and a wireless serial transceiver. The amperometric signals were digitalized and sent to a notebook using a 2.4 GHz transceiver while a serial-to-USB converter was connected to a second transceiver for completing the communication bridge. The software, running on the laptop, allowed to save and graph the oxygen signals. The electronics showed excellent stability and the acquired data was linear in a range comprised between 0 and -165 nA, covering the entire range of oxygen concentrations. A series of experiments were performed to explore the dynamics of dissolved oxygen by exposing the animals to different gases (nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide), to low temperature and anesthetic agents (chloroform and triethylamine). The resulting data are in agreement with previous O2 changes recorded in the brain of awake rats and mice. The proposed system, based on simple and inexpensive components, can constitute a new experimental model for the exploration of central complex neurochemistry and it can also work with oxidizing sensors and amperometric biosensors."

https://openalex.org/W2987689102,"The qualitative analysis of colocalisation in fluorescence microscopy is of critical importance to the understanding of biological processes and cellular function. However, the degree of accuracy achieved may differ substantially when executing different yet commonly utilized colocalisation analyses. We propose a novel biological visual analysis method that determines the correlation within the fluorescence intensities and subsequently uses this correlation to assign a colourmap value to each voxel in a three-dimensional sample while also highlighting volumes with greater combined fluorescence intensity. This addresses the ambiguity and variability which can be introduced into the visualisation of the spatial distribution of correlation between two fluorescence channels when the colocalisation between these channels is not considered. Most currently employed and generally accepted methods of visualising colocalisation using a colourmap can be negatively affected by this ambiguity, for example by incorrectly indicating non-colocalised voxels as positively correlated. In this paper we evaluate the proposed method by applying it to both synthetic data and biological fluorescence micrographs and demonstrate how it can enhance the visualisation in a robust way by visualising only truly colocalised regions using a colourmap to indicate the qualitative measure of the correlation between the fluorescence intensities. This approach may substantially support fluorescence microscopy applications in which precise colocalisation analysis is of particular relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2984544070,"In oncology, the aim of dose-finding phase I studies is to find the maximum tolerated dose for further studies. The use of combinations of two or more agents is increasing. Several dose-finding designs have been proposed for this situation. Numerous publications have however pointed out the complexity of evaluating therapies in combination due to difficulties in choosing between different designs for an actual trial, as well as complications related to their implementation and application in practice.In this work, we propose R functions for Wang and Ivanova's approach. These functions compute the dose for the next patients enrolled and provide a simulation study in order to calibrate the design before it is applied and to assess the performance of the design in different scenarios of dose-toxicity relationships. This choice of the method was supported by a simulation study which the aim was to compare two designs in the context of an actual phase I trial: i) in 2005, Wang and Ivanova developed an empirical three-parameter model-based method in Bayesian inference, ii) in 2008, Yuan and Yin proposed a simple, adaptive two-dimensional dose-finding design. In particular, they converted the two-dimensional dose-finding trial to a series of one-dimensional dose-finding sub-trials by setting the dose of one drug at a fixed level. The performance assessment of Wang's design was then compared with those of designs presented in the paper by Hirakawa et al. (2015) in their simulation context.It is recommended to assess the performances of the designs in the context of the clinical trial before beginning the trial. The two-dimensional dose-finding design proposed by Wang and Ivanova is a comprehensive approach that yields good performances. The two R functions that we propose can facilitate the use of this design in practice."

And 2) What are their priorities with respect to quality assessment of primary health care aimed at satisfying children's needs?Nine potential attributes of quality of primary care were operationalized in 40 quality aspects. An online survey was used to elicit opinions in a representative sample of citizens of Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Data collection comprised: background characteristics; perceived quality of primary health care for children; and priority setting of quality aspects. Descriptive analysis was performed and differences between groups were tested using Chi-Square test and ANOVA.Valid results were obtained from 2403 respondents. Mean satisfaction with quality of primary care ranged from 5.5 (Poland) to 7.2 (Spain). On average, between 56% (Poland) and 70% (Netherlands) of respondents had a positive perception of the primary health care system for children in their country. The ability of a child to limit their parents' access to the child's medical records was judged most negatively in all countries (average agreement score 28%, range 12-36%). The right of a child to a confidential consultation was judged most differently between countries (average agreement score 61%, range 40-75%). Overall top-10 priorities in ensuring high quality primary care were: timeliness (accessibility); skills/competences, management, facilities (appropriateness); no costs (affordability); information, dignity/respect (continuity); and swift referrals, collaboration (coordination).Between countries, significant differences exist in the perceived quality of primary care and priorities with regard to quality assessment. Taking into account the citizens' perspective in decision-making means that aspects with low perceived quality that are highly prioritized warrant further action."

Untangling the precise relations between the different elements of the PN has been challenging due to the myriad of events that are triggered simultaneously by protein misfolding and aggregation but might provide necessary insights for drug development against these malfunctions. The PN prevents the accumulation of misfolded proteins in part through the ubiquitin proteasome system, which targets proteins for proteasomal destruction (1Galves M. Rathi R. Prag G. Ashkenazi A. Ubiquitin Signaling and Degradation of Aggregate-Prone Proteins.Trends Biochem.

To this end, they used a protein termed AgDD engineered by Wandless and colleagues (3Miyazaki Y. Mizumoto K. Dey G. Kudo T. Perrino J. Chen L.-C. Meyer T. Wandless T.J. A method to rapidly create protein aggregates in living cells.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27229621): 1168910.1038/ncomms11689Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). AgDD contains the FK506-binding protein (FKBP1A) mutant that typifies the DDs but is extended on the N terminus with an aggregation-prone peptide and on the C terminus with superfolder GFP (Fig. 1A). The fusion protein is stable when bound to the high-affinity synthetic ligand Shield-1 (S1) but readily aggregates and is ubiquitinated upon S1 removal (3Miyazaki Y. Mizumoto K. Dey G. Kudo T. Perrino J. Chen L.-C. Meyer T. Wandless T.J. A method to rapidly create protein aggregates in living cells.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27229621): 1168910.1038/ncomms11689Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). With these constructs in hand, the authors were able to identify the first proteins that undergo changes in ubiquitination upon S1 removal and consequently AgDD aggregation in a time-resolved manner using ubiquitin remnant immunoaffinity profiling and a quantitative MS approach with tandem mass tagging. Among the 48 identified proteins, including AgDD, members of the proteostasis network were highly enriched and showed increased ubiquitination levels within 2.5–10 min. Interestingly, many ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors were identified next to proteasomal subunits, indicating a rapid targeting of key players of the protein synthesis and degradation machineries. Of particular interest is the strong increase in ubiquitination of RPN13 (also known as ADRM1) on residues Lys-21 and Lys-34. Ubiquitination of AgDD and RPN13 upon S1 washout was confirmed by pulldown analysis. Importantly, the authors did not observe any changes in the degradation kinetics of another model substrate targeted by the ubiquitin proteasome system upon aggregation of AgDD, indicating that the observed RPN13 ubiquitination was unlikely to be leading to a general impairment of the 26S proteasome activity. Interestingly, the proteolytic activity itself was increased in these conditions, when measured with a small proteasomal peptide substrate. The E3 ligase UBE3C was previously shown to ubiquitinate a nonaggregating DD reporter and RPN13 (4Chu B.W. Kovary K.M. Guillaume J. Chen L.-C. Teruel M.N. Wandless T.J.

Importantly, these events occurred rapidly, within minutes of the induced aggregation of AgDD. As a result of the high aggregation rate, it was not easily possible to distinguish whether the observed events were due to AgDD unfolding or aggregation. Therefore, to discriminate between these two possibilities, the authors returned to a DD variant lacking the N-terminal aggregation-prone peptide, which converts to an unfolded yet soluble molten globule-like state in the absence of S1. The observed results were highly congruent to AgDD within the first 10 min, indicating that indeed unfolding but not aggregation of the model substrate was triggering UBE3C recruitment, and RPN13 and AgDD ubiquitination, although aggregation seems to accelerate the response (2Gottlieb C.D.

Notably, the observed time resolution that goes along with the chemical biology approach presented by Gottlieb et al. offers a unique view of the chain of events that take place when the PN is challenged. So, what is the role of RPN13 ubiquitination in the context of protein misfolding? Previous work from Goldberg and colleagues (4Chu B.W. Kovary K.M. Guillaume J. Chen L.-C. Teruel M.N. Wandless T.J. The E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3C enhances proteasome processivity by ubiquitinating partially proteolyzed substrates.J. Biol.

Importantly, UBE3C-mediated ubiquitination of RPN13 reduces the capacity of the proteasome to bind to polyubiquitinated substrates (4Chu B.W. Kovary K.M. Guillaume J. Chen L.-C. Teruel M.N. Wandless T.J. The E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3C enhances proteasome processivity by ubiquitinating partially proteolyzed substrates.J. Biol.

Elsasser S. Zhang N. Chen X. Randles L. Shi Y. Hofmann K. Walters K.J. Finley D. Dikic I.

UBE3C was previously shown to ubiquitinate the nonaggregating DD reporter to promote its degradation by increasing proteasomal processivity (5Besche H.C. Sha Z. Kukushkin N.V. Peth A. Hock E.M. Kim W. Gygi S. Gutierrez J.A. Liao H. Dick L. Goldberg A.L. Autoubiquitination of the 26S Proteasome on Rpn13 regulates breakdown of ubiquitin conjugates.EMBO J. 2014; 33 (24811749): 1159-117610.1002/embj.201386906Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Yet recruitment of UBE3C to the proteasome is also enhanced in the presence of ubiquitinated substrates (7Kuo C.-L. Goldberg A.L. Ubiquitinated proteins promote the association of proteasomes with the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp14 and the ubiquitin ligase Ube3c.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

One model that could reconcile these findings is that UBE3C is recruited to the proteasome to promote the complete degradation of misfolded proteins by conjugating additional ubiquitin moieties, increasing their affinity to the proteasome. The concomitant ubiquitination of RPN13 would then prevent the recruitment of additional proteasome substrates, because RPN13-conjugated complexes would appear to be substrate-engaged particles with potentially “more difficult” proteins to process (Fig. 1B), similar to what Goldberg and colleagues proposed (4Chu B.W. Kovary K.M. Guillaume J. Chen L.-C. Teruel M.N. Wandless T.J. The E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3C enhances proteasome processivity by ubiquitinating partially proteolyzed substrates.J. Biol.

The molecular mechanism that mediates UBE3C proteasomal recruitment remains to be determined in future investigations. More generally, the present study demonstrates that changes at the proteasomal level rapidly occur in the cell in the presence of a single pool of unfolded proteins (i.e. AgDD or DD), in conditions where the overall activity of the ubiquitin proteasome system does not appear to be impaired. The future challenges will be to determine whether this mechanism is specific to proteasome substrates that are potentially more difficult to process (e.g. due to misfolding) and whether it plays a role in proteopathies more broadly."

Correlation analyses revealed that the present norms show strong similarities to prior BOSS norms, although objects were scored as more familiar in the Brazilian relative to all prior norms, especially relative to the Thai norms. In addition, familiarity was greater for living than for non-living items in the English- and French-Canadian norms, but such difference was absent in the Brazilian and Thai norms, suggesting that familiarity is more strongly affected by culture than by semantic domain. In sum, even when cultural differences are considered, the current study reveals that the images of the BOSS data set are in general well known for Brazilians, demonstrating that they can be useful for psychological and neuroscientific research in Brazil."
