https://openalex.org/W2110300022,"Profiling phylogenetic marker genes, such as the 16S rRNA gene, is a key tool for studies of microbial communities but does not provide direct evidence of a community's functional capabilities. Here we describe PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states), a computational approach to predict the functional composition of a metagenome using marker gene data and a database of reference genomes. PICRUSt uses an extended ancestral-state reconstruction algorithm to predict which gene families are present and then combines gene families to estimate the composite metagenome. Using 16S information, PICRUSt recaptures key findings from the Human Microbiome Project and accurately predicts the abundance of gene families in host-associated and environmental communities, with quantifiable uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that phylogeny and function are sufficiently linked that this 'predictive metagenomic' approach should provide useful insights into the thousands of uncultivated microbial communities for which only marker gene surveys are currently available."
https://openalex.org/W2065582606,"The role of parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons in ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) has been a point of contention; here PV-positive cells are shown to initiate competitive periods of plasticity during the critical periods of eye development when ODP occurs, and transient reductions in inhibitory firing from PV-positive cells provides a return to normal firing rates in excitatory neurons, a key step in ODP progression. It has long been known that early sensory experience can significantly affect the development and maturation of neural circuitry. One well-studied example of this is ocular dominance plasticity (ODP), in which loss of vision in one eye results in a reduction of cortical responsiveness to that eye. The mechanisms underlying the manifestation of ODP and the roles of inhibitory neurons in its expression have been a point of contention. Kuhlman et al. now show that parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons initiate competitive periods of plasticity during the critical periods of development when ODP occurs. Transient reductions in inhibitory firing from PV+ cells provides for a return to normal firing rates in excitatory neurons, a key step in the progression of ODP in the adolescent cortex. Early sensory experience instructs the maturation of neural circuitry in the cortex1,2. This has been studied extensively in the primary visual cortex, in which loss of vision to one eye permanently degrades cortical responsiveness to that eye3,4, a phenomenon known as ocular dominance plasticity (ODP). Cortical inhibition mediates this process4,5,6, but the precise role of specific classes of inhibitory neurons in ODP is controversial. Here we report that evoked firing rates of binocular excitatory neurons in the primary visual cortex immediately drop by half when vision is restricted to one eye, but gradually return to normal over the following twenty-four hours, despite the fact that vision remains restricted to one eye. This restoration of binocular-like excitatory firing rates after monocular deprivation results from a rapid, although transient, reduction in the firing rates of fast-spiking, parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, which in turn can be attributed to a decrease in local excitatory circuit input onto PV interneurons. This reduction in PV-cell-evoked responses after monocular lid suture is restricted to the critical period for ODP and appears to be necessary for subsequent shifts in excitatory ODP. Pharmacologically enhancing inhibition at the time of sight deprivation blocks ODP and, conversely, pharmacogenetic reduction of PV cell firing rates can extend the critical period for ODP. These findings define the microcircuit changes initiating competitive plasticity during critical periods of cortical development. Moreover, they show that the restoration of evoked firing rates of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons by PV-specific disinhibition is a key step in the progression of ODP."
https://openalex.org/W1968126063,"Mammalian genomes contain several billion base pairs of DNA that are packaged in chromatin fibres. At selected gene loci, cohesin complexes have been proposed to arrange these fibres into higher-order structures, but how important this function is for determining overall chromosome architecture and how the process is regulated are not well understood. Using conditional mutagenesis in the mouse, here we show that depletion of the cohesin-associated protein Wapl stably locks cohesin on DNA, leads to clustering of cohesin in axial structures, and causes chromatin condensation in interphase chromosomes. These findings reveal that the stability of cohesin-DNA interactions is an important determinant of chromatin structure, and indicate that cohesin has an architectural role in interphase chromosome territories. Furthermore, we show that regulation of cohesin-DNA interactions by Wapl is important for embryonic development, expression of genes such as c-myc (also known as Myc), and cell cycle progression. In mitosis, Wapl-mediated release of cohesin from DNA is essential for proper chromosome segregation and protects cohesin from cleavage by the protease separase, thus enabling mitotic exit in the presence of functional cohesin complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1984607812,"Beta-cell dysfunction and impaired insulin production are hallmarks of diabetes, but despite the growing diabetes epidemic, the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease have remained unclear. We identified thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a cellular redox regulator, as a crucial factor in beta-cell biology and show that beta-cell TXNIP is upregulated in diabetes, whereas TXNIP deficiency protects against diabetes by preventing beta-cell apoptosis. Here we show that TXNIP and diabetes induce beta-cell expression of a specific microRNA, miR-204, which in turn blocks insulin production by directly targeting and downregulating MAFA, a known insulin transcription factor. In particular, we first discovered the regulation of miR-204 by TXNIP by microarray analysis, followed by validation studies in INS-1 beta cells, islets of Txnip-deficient mice, diabetic mouse models and primary human islets. We then further found that TXNIP induces miR-204 by inhibiting the activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a transcription factor that is involved in miR-204 regulation. We also identified MAFA as a target that is downregulated by miR-204. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TXNIP controls microRNA expression and insulin production and that miR-204 is involved in beta-cell function. The newly identified TXNIP-miR-204-MAFA-insulin pathway may contribute to diabetes progression and provides new insight into TXNIP function and microRNA biology in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2014761647,"Background The classical serotonergic psychedelics LSD, psilocybin, mescaline are not known to cause brain damage and are regarded as non-addictive. Clinical studies do not suggest that psychedelics cause long-term mental health problems. Psychedelics have been used in the Americas for thousands of years. Over 30 million people currently living in the US have used LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline. Objective To evaluate the association between the lifetime use of psychedelics and current mental health in the adult population. Method Data drawn from years 2001 to 2004 of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health consisted of 130,152 respondents, randomly selected to be representative of the adult population in the United States. Standardized screening measures for past year mental health included serious psychological distress (K6 scale), mental health treatment (inpatient, outpatient, medication, needed but did not receive), symptoms of eight psychiatric disorders (panic disorder, major depressive episode, mania, social phobia, general anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-affective psychosis), and seven specific symptoms of non-affective psychosis. We calculated weighted odds ratios by multivariate logistic regression controlling for a range of sociodemographic variables, use of illicit drugs, risk taking behavior, and exposure to traumatic events. Results 21,967 respondents (13.4% weighted) reported lifetime psychedelic use. There were no significant associations between lifetime use of any psychedelics, lifetime use of specific psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, peyote), or past year use of LSD and increased rate of any of the mental health outcomes. Rather, in several cases psychedelic use was associated with lower rate of mental health problems. Conclusion We did not find use of psychedelics to be an independent risk factor for mental health problems."
https://openalex.org/W2084211225,"In Caenorhabditis elegans, genome instability in the form of exogenous and endogenous DNA damage in germ cells evokes elevated heat- and oxidative-stress resistance in somatic tissues; this is mediated by MPK-1, which triggers the induction of putative secreted peptides associated with innate immunity, leading to activation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Björn Schumacher and colleagues have identified a systemic response to DNA damage in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. They find that exogenous and endogenous DNA damage in germ cells induces stress resistance in somatic tissues cell non-autonomously. The process involves DNA-damage-induced activation of ERK MAPK signalling in germ cells and enhanced proteostasis associated with innate immunity in somatic tissues. DNA damage responses have been well characterized with regard to their cell-autonomous checkpoint functions leading to cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis1. In contrast, systemic responses to tissue-specific genome instability remain poorly understood. In adult Caenorhabditis elegans worms germ cells undergo mitotic and meiotic cell divisions, whereas somatic tissues are entirely post-mitotic. Consequently, DNA damage checkpoints function specifically in the germ line2, whereas somatic tissues in adult C. elegans are highly radio-resistant3. Some DNA repair systems such as global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) remove lesions specifically in germ cells4. Here we investigated how genome instability in germ cells affects somatic tissues in C. elegans. We show that exogenous and endogenous DNA damage in germ cells evokes elevated resistance to heat and oxidative stress. The somatic stress resistance is mediated by the ERK MAP kinase MPK-1 in germ cells that triggers the induction of putative secreted peptides associated with innate immunity. The innate immune response leads to activation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) in somatic tissues, which confers enhanced proteostasis and systemic stress resistance. We propose that elevated systemic stress resistance promotes endurance of somatic tissues to allow delay of progeny production when germ cells are genomically compromised."
https://openalex.org/W2007542113,"Helicobacter pylori infection induces chronic inflammation that contributes to gastric tumorigenesis. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) is a proinflammatory cytokine, and polymorphism in the TNF-α gene increases the risk of gastric cancer. We herein investigated the role of TNF-α in gastric tumorigenesis using Gan mouse model, which recapitulates human gastric cancer development. We crossed Gan mice with TNF-α (Tnf) or TNF-α receptor TNFR1 (Tnfrsf1a) knockout mice to generate Tnf−/− Gan and Tnfrsf1a−/− Gan mice, respectively, and examined their tumor phenotypes. Notably, both Tnf−/− Gan mice and Tnfrsf1a−/− Gan mice showed similar, significant suppression of gastric tumor growth compared with control Tnf+/+ or Tnfrsf1a+/+ Gan mice. These results indicate that TNF-α signaling through TNFR1 is important for gastric tumor development. Bone marrow (BM) transplantation experiments showed that TNF-α expressed by BM-derived cells (BMDCs) stimulates the TNFR1 on BMDCs by an autocrine or paracrine manner, which is important for gastric tumor promotion. Moreover, the microarray analysis and colony formation assay indicated that NADPH oxidase organizer 1 (Noxo1) and Gna14 are induced in tumor epithelial cells in a TNF-α-dependent manner, and have an important role in tumorigenicity and tumor-initiating cell property of gastric cancer cells. Accordingly, it is possible that the activation of TNF-α/TNFR1 signaling in the tumor microenvironment promotes gastric tumor development through induction of Noxo1 and Gna14, which contribute to maintaining the tumor cells in an undifferentiated state. The present results indicate that targeting the TNF-α/TNFR1 pathway may be an effective preventive or therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2131106330,"Increased color in surface waters, or browning, can alter lake ecological function, lake thermal stratification and pose difficulties for drinking water treatment. Mechanisms suggested to cause browning include increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and iron concentrations, as well as a shift to more colored DOC. While browning of surface waters is widespread and well documented, little is known about why some lakes resist it. Here, we present a comprehensive study of Mälaren, the third largest lake in Sweden. In Mälaren, the vast majority of water and DOC enters a western lake basin, and after approximately 2.8 years, drains from an eastern basin. Despite 40 years of increased terrestrial inputs of colored substances to western lake basins, the eastern basin has resisted browning over this time period. Here we find the half-life of iron was far shorter (0.6 years) than colored organic matter (A420 ; 1.7 years) and DOC as a whole (6.1 years). We found changes in filtered iron concentrations relate strongly to the observed loss of color in the western basins. In addition, we observed a substantial shift from colored DOC of terrestrial origin, to less colored autochthonous sources, with a substantial decrease in aromaticity (-17%) across the lake. We suggest that rapid losses of iron and colored DOC caused the limited browning observed in eastern lake basins. Across a wider dataset of 69 Swedish lakes, we observed greatest browning in acidic lakes with shorter retention times (< 1.5 years). These findings suggest that water residence time, along with iron, pH and colored DOC may be of central importance when modeling and projecting changes in brownification on broader spatial scales."
https://openalex.org/W1982259605,"Understanding the interconnectivity of organisms among different habitats is a key requirement for generating effective management plans in coastal ecosystems, particularly when determining component habitat structures in marine protected areas. To elucidate the patterns of habitat use by fishes among coral, seagrass, and mangrove habitats, and between natural and transplanted mangroves, visual censuses were conducted semiannually at two sites in the Philippines during September and March 2010-2012. In total, 265 species and 15,930 individuals were recorded. Species richness and abundance of fishes were significantly higher in coral reefs (234 species, 12,306 individuals) than in seagrass (38 species, 1,198 individuals) and mangrove (47 species, 2,426 individuals) habitats. Similarity tests revealed a highly significant difference among the three habitats. Fishes exhibited two different strategies for habitat use, inhabiting either a single (85.6% of recorded species) or several habitats (14.4%). Some fish that utilized multiple habitats, such as Lutjanus monostigma and Parupeneus barberinus, showed possible ontogenetic habitat shifts from mangroves and/or seagrass habitats to coral reefs. Moreover, over 20% of commercial fish species used multiple habitats, highlighting the importance of including different habitat types within marine protected areas to achieve efficient and effective resource management. Neither species richness nor abundance of fishes significantly differed between natural and transplanted mangroves. In addition, 14 fish species were recorded in a 20-year-old transplanted mangrove area, and over 90% of these species used multiple habitats, further demonstrating the key role of transplanted mangroves as a reef fish habitat in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2161273389,"N-cadherin and HER2/neu were found to be co-expressed in invasive breast carcinomas. To test the contribution of N-cadherin and HER2 in mammary tumor metastasis, we targeted N-cadherin expression in the mammary epithelium of the MMTV-Neu mouse. In the context of ErbB2/Neu, N-cadherin stimulated carcinoma cell invasion, proliferation and metastasis. N-cadherin caused fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) upmodulation, resulting in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem/progenitor like properties, involving Snail and Slug upregulation, mammosphere formation and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. N-cadherin potentiation of the FGFR stimulated extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation resulting in differential effects on metastasis. Although ERK inhibition suppressed cyclin D1 expression, cell proliferation and stem/progenitor cell properties, it did not affect invasion or EMT. Conversely, AKT inhibition suppressed invasion through Akt 2 attenuation, and EMT through Snail inhibition, but had no effect on cyclin D1 expression, cell proliferation or mammosphere formation. These findings suggest N-cadherin/FGFR has a pivotal role in promoting metastasis through differential regulation of ERK and AKT, and underscore the potential for targeting the FGFR in advanced ErbB2-amplified breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2014345338,"The KCNH voltage-dependent potassium channels (ether-à-go-go, EAG; EAG-related gene, ERG; EAG-like channels, ELK) are important regulators of cellular excitability and have key roles in diseases such as cardiac long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2), epilepsy, schizophrenia and cancer. The intracellular domains of KCNH channels are structurally distinct from other voltage-gated channels. The amino-terminal region contains an eag domain, which is composed of a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain and a PAS-cap domain, whereas the carboxy-terminal region contains a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD), which is connected to the pore through a C-linker domain. Many disease-causing mutations localize to these specialized intracellular domains, which underlie the unique gating and regulation of KCNH channels. It has been suggested that the eag domain may regulate the channel by interacting with either the S4-S5 linker or the CNBHD. Here we present a 2 Å resolution crystal structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex of the mouse EAG1 (also known as KCNH1) channel. It displays extensive interactions between the eag domain and the CNBHD, indicating that the regulatory mechanism of the eag domain primarily involves the CNBHD. Notably, the structure reveals that a number of LQT2 mutations at homologous positions in human ERG, in addition to cancer-associated mutations in EAG channels, localize to the eag domain-CNBHD interface. Furthermore, mutations at the interface produced marked effects on channel gating, demonstrating the important physiological role of the eag domain-CNBHD interaction. Our structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex of mouse EAG1 provides unique insights into the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of KCNH channels."
https://openalex.org/W1999125098,"Kcnq1, which encodes for the pore-forming α-subunit of a voltage-gated potassium channel, was identified as a gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancer susceptibility gene in multiple Sleeping Beauty DNA transposon-based forward genetic screens in mice. To confirm that Kcnq1 has a functional role in GI tract cancer, we created Apc(Min) mice that carried a targeted deletion mutation in Kcnq1. Results demonstrated that Kcnq1 is a tumor suppressor gene as Kcnq1 mutant mice developed significantly more intestinal tumors, especially in the proximal small intestine and colon, and some of these tumors progressed to become aggressive adenocarcinomas. Gross tissue abnormalities were also observed in the rectum, pancreas and stomach. Colon organoid formation was significantly increased in organoids created from Kcnq1 mutant mice compared with wild-type littermate controls, suggesting a role for Kcnq1 in the regulation of the intestinal crypt stem cell compartment. To identify gene expression changes due to loss of Kcnq1, we carried out microarray studies in the colon and proximal small intestine. We identified altered genes involved in innate immune responses, goblet and Paneth cell function, ion channels, intestinal stem cells, epidermal growth factor receptor and other growth regulatory signaling pathways. We also found genes implicated in inflammation and in cellular detoxification. Pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis confirmed the importance of these gene clusters and further identified significant overlap with genes regulated by MUC2 and CFTR, two important regulators of intestinal homeostasis. To investigate the role of KCNQ1 in human colorectal cancer (CRC), we measured protein levels of KCNQ1 by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing samples from CRC patients with liver metastases who had undergone hepatic resection. Results showed that low expression of KCNQ1 expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival."
https://openalex.org/W2028884946,"Tumor metastasis is the leading cause of death among breast cancer patients. PELP1 (proline, glutamic acid and leucine rich protein 1) is a nuclear receptor coregulator that is upregulated during breast cancer progression to metastasis and is an independent prognostic predictor of shorter survival of breast cancer patients. Here, we show that PELP1 modulates expression of metastasis-influencing microRNAs (miRs) to promote cancer metastasis. Whole genome miR array analysis using PELP1-overexpressing and PELP1-underexpressing model cells revealed that miR-200 and miR-141 levels inversely correlated with PELP1 expression. Consistent with this, PELP1 knockdown resulted in lower expression of miR-200a target genes ZEB1 and ZEB2. PELP1 knockdown significantly reduced tumor growth and metastasis compared with parental cells in an orthotopic xenograft tumor model. Furthermore, re-introduction of miR-200a and miR-141 mimetics into PELP1-overexpressing cells reversed PELP1 target gene expression, decreased PELP1-driven migration/invasion in vitro and significantly reduced in vivo metastatic potential in a preclinical model of experimental metastasis. Our results demonstrated that PELP1 binds to miR-200a and miR-141 promoters and regulates their expression by recruiting chromatin modifier histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, small interfering RNA and HDAC inhibitor assays. Taken together, our results suggest that PELP1 regulates tumor metastasis by controlling the expression and functions of the tumor metastasis suppressors miR-200a and miR-141."
https://openalex.org/W2121399461,"Objective We aimed to mine the data in the Electronic Medical Record to automatically discover patients' Rheumatoid Arthritis disease activity at discrete rheumatology clinic visits. We cast the problem as a document classification task where the feature space includes concepts from the clinical narrative and lab values as stored in the Electronic Medical Record. Materials and Methods The Training Set consisted of 2792 clinical notes and associated lab values. Test Set 1 included 1749 clinical notes and associated lab values. Test Set 2 included 344 clinical notes for which there were no associated lab values. The Apache clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System was used to analyze the text and transform it into informative features to be combined with relevant lab values. Results Experiments over a range of machine learning algorithms and features were conducted. The best performing combination was linear kernel Support Vector Machines with Unified Medical Language System Concept Unique Identifier features with feature selection and lab values. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) is 0.831 (σ = 0.0317), statistically significant as compared to two baselines (AUC = 0.758, σ = 0.0291). Algorithms demonstrated superior performance on cases clinically defined as extreme categories of disease activity (Remission and High) compared to those defined as intermediate categories (Moderate and Low) and included laboratory data on inflammatory markers. Conclusion Automatic Rheumatoid Arthritis disease activity discovery from Electronic Medical Record data is a learnable task approximating human performance. As a result, this approach might have several research applications, such as the identification of patients for genome-wide pharmacogenetic studies that require large sample sizes with precise definitions of disease activity and response to therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2051400608,"Elucidating targets of physiological tumor metastasis suppressors can highlight key signaling pathways leading to invasion and metastasis. To identify downstream targets of the metastasis suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP/PEBP1), we utilized an integrated approach based upon statistical analysis of tumor gene expression data combined with experimental validation. Previous studies from our laboratory identified the architectural transcription factor and oncogene, high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), as a target of inhibition by RKIP. Here we identify two signaling pathways that promote HMGA2-driven metastasis. Using both human breast tumor cells and an MMTV-Wnt mouse breast tumor model, we show that RKIP induces and HMGA2 inhibits expression of miR-200b; miR-200b directly inhibits expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX), leading to decreased invasion. RKIP also inhibits syndecan-2 (SDC2), which is aberrantly expressed in breast cancer, via downregulation of HMGA2; but this mechanism is independent of miR-200. Depletion of SDC2 induces apoptosis and suppresses breast tumor growth and metastasis in mouse xenografts. RKIP, LOX and SDC2 are coordinately regulated and collectively encompass a prognostic signature for metastasis-free survival in ER-negative breast cancer patients. Taken together, our findings reveal two novel signaling pathways targeted by the metastasis suppressor RKIP that regulate remodeling of the extracellular matrix and tumor survival."
https://openalex.org/W1992118957,"Salivary gland tumors (SGT) are a group of highly heterogeneous head and neck malignancies with widely varied clinical outcomes and no standard effective treatments. The CRTC1–MAML2 fusion oncogene, encoded by a recurring chromosomal translocation t(11;19)(q14-21;p12-13), is a frequent genetic alteration found in >50% of mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MEC), the most common malignant SGT. In this study, we aimed to define the role of the CRTC1–MAML2 oncogene in the maintenance of MEC tumor growth and to investigate critical downstream target genes and pathways for therapeutic targeting of MEC. By performing gene expression analyses and functional studies via RNA interference and pharmacological modulation, we determined the importance of the CRTC1–MAML2 fusion gene and its downstream AREG–EGFR signaling in human MEC cancer cell growth and survival in vitro and in vivo using human MEC xenograft models. We found that CRTC1–MAML2 fusion oncogene was required for the growth and survival of fusion-positive human MEC cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The CRTC1–MAML2 oncoprotein induced the upregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand Amphiregulin (AREG) by co-activating the transcription factor CREB, and AREG subsequently activated EGFR signaling in an autocrine manner that promoted MEC cell growth and survival. Importantly, CRTC1–MAML2-positive MEC cells were highly sensitive to EGFR signaling inhibition. Therefore, our study revealed that aberrantly activated AREG–EGFR signaling is required for CRTC1–MAML2-positive MEC cell growth and survival, suggesting that EGFR-targeted therapies will benefit patients with advanced, unresectable CRTC1–MAML2-positive MEC."
https://openalex.org/W1978135247,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a very aggressive tumor with no known curative treatment. Better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of mesothelial carcinogenesis is required to develop new therapeutic strategies. MPM, like all cancer cells, needs to maintain telomere length to prevent senescence. Previous studies suggested that the telomere lengthening mechanism in MPM is based mainly on telomerase activity. For this reason, we focused on the key catalytic enzyme, TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), by analyzing its gene expression in MPM and by studying the mechanism underlying its upregulation. We used our large collection of MPM composed of 61 MPM in culture and 71 frozen MPM tumor samples. Evaluation of TERT mRNA expression by quantitative RT–PCR showed overexpression in MPM in culture compared with normal mesothelial cells, and in MPM tumor samples compared with normal pleura. We identified a ‘hot spot’ of mutations in the TERT gene core promoter in both MPM in culture and in MPM tumor samples with an overall frequency of 15%. Furthermore, data clearly identified mutation in the TERT promoter as a mechanism of TERT mRNA upregulation in MPM. In contrast, gene copy number amplification was not associated with TERT overexpression. Then, we analyzed the clinicopathological, etiological and genetic characteristics of MPM with mutations in the TERT promoter. TERT promoter mutations were more frequent in MPM with sarcomatoid histologic subtype (P<0.01), and they were frequently associated with CDKN2A gene inactivation (P=0.03). In conclusion, a subgroup of MPM presents TERT promoter mutations, which lead to TERT mRNA upregulation. This is the first recurrent gain-of-function oncogenic mutations identified in MPM."

https://openalex.org/W2017455204,"The rare wild species of snow lotus Saussurea involucrata is a commonly used medicinal herb with great pharmacological value for human health, resulting from its uniquely high level of phenylpropanoid compound production. To gain information on the phenylpropanid biosynthetic pathway genes in this critically important medicinal plant, global transcriptome sequencing was performed. It revealed that the phenylpropanoid pathway genes were well represented in S. involucrata. In addition, we introduced two key phenylpropanoid pathway inducing transcription factors (PAP1 and Lc) into this medicinal plant. Transgenic S. involucrata co-expressing PAP1 and Lc exhibited purple pigments due to a massive accumulation of anthocyanins. The over-expression of PAP1 and Lc largely activated most of the phenylpropanoid pathway genes, and increased accumulation of several phenylpropanoid compounds significantly, including chlorogenic acid, syringin, cyanrine and rutin. Both ABTS (2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzotiazo-line-6-sulfonic acid) and FRAP (ferric reducing anti-oxidant power) assays revealed that the antioxidant capacity of transgenic S. involucrata lines was greatly enhanced over controls. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of phenylpropanoid metabolism, our results potentially enable an alternation of bioactive compound production in S. involucrata through metabolic engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2075562229,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which is closely associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), is a metastasis-prone epithelial cancer. We previously showed that tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2) is highly expressed in NPC tumor tissues and is correlated with metastasis and poor survival in NPC patients. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the EBV oncoprotein, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), can transcriptionally induce TNFAIP2 expression via NF-κB. Quantitative RT–PCR and western blotting revealed that LMP1 induces TNFAIP2 expression through its C-terminal-activating region (CTAR2) domain, which is required for transduction of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling. Inhibition of NF-κB activation or depletion of p65 (a component of NF-κB) by RNA interference abolished the LMP1-induced expression of TNFAIP2, whereas ectopic expression of p65 was sufficient to induce TNFAIP2 expression. Luciferase reporter assays showed that LMP1 transcriptionally induces TNFAIP2 expression through a newly identified NF-κB-binding site within the TNFAIP2 promoter (−3 869 to −3 860 bp). Immunohistochemical analysis of NPC biopsy specimens further revealed a significant correlation between the protein levels of TNFAIP2 and activated p65 (R=0.689, P<0.001), indicating that our findings are clinically relevant. Immunofluorescence microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that TNFAIP2 associates with actin and is involved in the formation of actin-based membrane protrusions. Furthermore, transwell migration assays demonstrated that TNFAIP2 contributes to LMP1-induced cell motility. Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into the regulation of TNFAIP2 and its role in promoting NPC tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2155345063,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial process for the invasion and metastasis of epithelial tumors. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this transition are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that interferon regulatory factor 4 binding protein (IBP) regulates EMT and the motility of breast cancer cells through Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 signaling pathways. We found that increased expression of IBP was associated with the progression of breast cancer and that IBP protein levels were significantly elevated in matched distant metastases. High IBP levels also predict shorter overall survival of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the forced expression of IBP decreased the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin but increased the mesenchymal markers in breast cancer cells. In contrast, silencing IBP in metastatic breast tumor cells promoted a shift toward an epithelial morphology concomitant with increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers. IBP silencing also reduced the expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors (Snail, Slug, ZEB1 and ZEB2). Moreover, we identified a role for IBP in endogenous EMT induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and deletion of IBP attenuated EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, IBP regulates the migration, invasion and matrix metalloprotease production in breast cancer cells as well as actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and the activation of GTP-Rac1, GTP-RhoA and GTP-Cdc42. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an oncogenic property for IBP in promoting the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2169579622,"In chronic degenerative syndromes, neuronal death occurs over long periods, during which cells progressively lose their axons and, ultimately, their cell bodies. Although apoptosis is recognized as a key event in neuronal death, the molecular mechanisms involved in CNS axons degeneration are poorly understood. Due to the highly polarized phenotypes of CNS neurons, the different neuronal subcompartments are likely to be targeted by light repetitive and localized aggression. Such locally initiated deleterious signal transduction pathways could theoretically spread through the cytoplasm. However, where axon-degenerative signals initiate, what these early signals are, and how they lead to axon degeneration are unanswered questions that limit our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and our ability to identify novel therapeutic targets. Using a microfluidic culture device adapted to CNS primary neurons, allowing specific access to the axonal and somatodendritic compartments, we analyzed the molecular pathways involved in axonal degeneration of differentiated neurons. We show here that local application of proapoptotic stimuli on the somatodentritic compartment triggers a dying-back pattern involving caspase-dependent axonal degeneration. Using complementary pharmacological and genetic approaches, we further demonstrate that NAD+ and grape wine polyphenols prevent axonal apoptosis and act via mitochondrial SirT3 activation in axons.—Magnifico, S., Saias, L., Deleglise, B., Duplus, E., Kilinc, D., Miquel, M.-C., Viovy, J.-L., Brugg, B., Peyrin, J.-M.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of nimotuzumab in its effects of enhancing cancer cell radiosensitivity.Lung cancer A549 cells and breast cancer MCF-7 cells were pretreated with or without nimotuzumab for 24 h before radiation to perform the clonogenic survival assay and to analyze the cell apoptosis by flow ctyometry. γ-H2AX foci were detected by confocal microscopy to assess the effect of nimotuzumab on radiation induced DNA repair. EGFR activation was examined and the levels of DNA damage repair related proteins in A549 cells at different time point and at varying doses exposure after nimotuzumab and radiation treatment were examined by Western blot. Pretreatment with nimotuzumab reduced clonogenic survival after radiation, inhibited radiation-induced EGFR activation and increased the radiation-induced apoptosis in both A549 cells and MCF-7 cells. The foci of γ-H2AX 24 h after radiation significantly increased in nimotuzumab pretreated cells with different doses. The phosphorylation of AKT and DNA-PKcs were remarkably inhibited in the combination group at each dose point as well as time point.Our results revealed that the possible mechanism of nimotuzumab enhancing the cancer radiosensitivity is that nimotuzumab inhibited the radiation-induced activation of DNA-PKcs through blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway, which ultimately affected the DNA DSBs repair."
https://openalex.org/W2001524537,"Podoplanin is highly expressed in human cancers. However, mechanisms regulating podoplanin expression remain elusive. Here we show that podoplanin promotes tumorigenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and precancerous cells both in vitro and in vivo, and the ErbB3-binding protein-1 (Ebp1) can be activated in oral tumorigenesis and can serve as a transcriptional activator to drive podoplanin expression in the malignant progression. Most of the OSCC cell lines have no detectable podoplanin protein in low-density cultures. However, the protein becomes detectable in high-density cultures and is required for in-vivo tumor formation of OSCC and oral premalignancies. In a high-density culture condition, podoplanin expression can be triggered at both mRNA and protein levels. In this condition, we showed that Ebp1 is upregulated, translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and binds to the podoplanin promoter to result in a dramatic increase of podoplanin mRNA and protein. Ebp1 downregulation significantly reduced podoplanin expression levels in OSCC cells with a decreased anchorage-dependent growth, invasion and wound healing. Conversely, Ebp1 overexpression enhanced these malignant features through podoplanin upregulation both in vitro and in vivo. In 81 patients with oral premalignant lesions, we found that Ebp1 expression is strongly related to OSCC development. We conclude that Ebp1 has a key role in the upregulation of podoplanin and may contribute to oral tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2045767984,"Social capital is said to influence health, mostly in research undertaken in high income countries' settings. Because social capital may differ from one setting to another, it is suggested that its measurement be context specific. We examine the association of individual and neighbourhood level social capital, and neighbourhood deprivation to self-rated health using a multi-level analysis.Data are taken from the 2008 South Africa National Income Dynamic Survey. Health was self-reported on a scale from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Two measures of social capital were used: individual, measured by two variables denoting trust and civic participation; and neighbourhood social capital, denoting support, association, behaviour and safety in a community.Compared to males, females were less likely to report good health (Odds Ratio 0.82: Confidence Interval 0.73, 0.91). There were variations in association of individual social capital and self-rated health among the provinces. In Western Cape (1.37: 0.98, 1.91) and North West (1.39: 1.13, 1.71), trust was positively associated with reporting good health, while the reverse was true in Limpopo (0.56: 0.38, 0.84) and Free State (0.70: 0.48, 1.02). In Western Cape (0.60: 0.44, 0.82) and Mpumalanga (0.72: 0.55, 0.94), neighbourhood social capital was negatively associated with reporting good health. In North West (1.59: 1.27, 1.99) and Gauteng (1.90: 1.21, 2.97), increased neighbourhood social capital was positively associated with reporting good health.Our study demonstrated the importance of considering contextual factors when analysing the relationship between social capital and health. Analysis by province showed variations in the way in which social capital affected health in different contexts. Further studies should be undertaken to understand the mechanisms through which social capital impacts on health in South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2066465196,"Although the intensification of therapy for children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) has substantially improved clinical outcomes, T-ALL remains an important challenge in pediatric oncology. Here, we report that the cooperative synergy between prostate apoptosis response factor-4 (Par-4) and THAP1 induces cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) gene expression and cellular apoptosis in human T-ALL cell line Jurkat cells, CEM cells and primary cultured neoplastic T lymphocytes from children with T-ALL. Par-4 and THAP1 collaborated to activate the promoter of CCAR1 gene. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Par-4 and THAP1 formed a protein complex by the interaction of their carboxyl termini, and THAP1 bound to CCAR1 promoter though its zinc-dependent DNA-binding domain at amino terminus. Par-4/THAP1 complex and Notch3 competitively bound to CCAR1 promoter and competitively modulated alternative pre-mRNA splicing of CCAR1, which resulted in two different transcripts and played an opposite role in T-ALL cell survival. Despite Notch3 induced a shift splicing from the full-length isoform toward a shorter form of CCAR1 mRNA by splicing factor SRp40 and SRp55, Par-4/THAP1 complex strongly antagonized this inductive effect. Our finding revealed a mechanistic rationale for Par-4/THAP1-induced apoptosis in T-ALL cells that would be of benefit to develop a new therapy strategy for T-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2062189223,"The classical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling pathway has been shown to be important in a number of models of inflammation-associated cancer. In a mouse model of Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer, impairment of classical NF-κB signaling in the gastric epithelium led to the development of increased preneoplastic pathology, however the role of specific NF-κB proteins in Helicobacter-associated gastric cancer development remains poorly understood. To investigate this C57BL/6, Nfkb1−/−, Nfkb2−/− and c-Rel−/− mice were infected with Helicobacter felis for 6 weeks or 12 months. Bacterial colonization, gastric atrophy and preneoplastic changes were assessed histologically and cytokine expression was assessed by qPCR. Nfkb1−/− mice developed spontaneous gastric atrophy when maintained for 12 months in conventional animal house conditions. They also developed more pronounced gastric atrophy after short-term H. felis colonization with a similar extent of preneoplasia to wild-type (WT) mice after 12 months. c-Rel−/− mice developed a similar degree of gastric atrophy to WT mice; 3 of 6 of these animals also developed lymphoproliferative lesions after 12 months of infection. Nfkb2−/− mice developed minimal gastric epithelial pathology even 12 months after H. felis infection. These findings demonstrate that NF-κB1- and NF-κB2-mediated signaling pathways differentially regulate the epithelial consequences of H. felis infection in the stomach, while c-Rel-mediated signaling also appears to modulate the risk of lymphomagenesis in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2074659837,"The three FET (FUS, EWSR1, and TAF15) family RNA binding proteins are expressed in all tissues and almost all cell types. The disordered N-terminal parts are always present in FET fusion oncoproteins of sarcomas and leukemia. Mutations in FUS and TAF15 cause aggregation of FET proteins in neurological disorders. Here we used recombinant proteins in pulldown experiments and mass spectrometry to identify major interaction partners of the FET N-terminal parts. We report that FUS, EWSR1, and TAF15 form homo- and heterocomplexes as major binding partners and identify an evolutionarily conserved N-terminal motif (FETBM1) that is required for this interaction. The binding is RNA and DNA independent and robust up to 1 M of NaCl. The localization of FETBM1 and its target sequences supports a simple model for FET protein aggregation as reported in neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and essential tremor. The FETBM1 localization also explains the binding of normal full-length FET proteins to their oncogenic fusion proteins.—Thomsen, C., Grundevik, P., Elias, P., Ståhlberg, A., Åman, P., A conserved N-terminal motif is required for complex formation between FUS, EWSR1, TAF15 and their oncogenic fusion proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2141438128,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) consists of three types of subunits: a catalytic (C), a scaffolding (A), and a regulatory (B) subunit. In Arabidopsis thaliana and other organisms the regulatory B subunits are divided into at least three non-related groups, B55, B’ and B″. Flowering time in plants mutated in B55 or B' genes were investigated in this work. The PP2A-b55α and PP2A-b55β (knockout) lines showed earlier flowering than WT, whereas a PP2A-b’γ (knockdown) line showed late flowering. Average advancements of flowering in PP2A-b55 mutants were 3.4 days in continuous light, 6.6 days in 12 h days, and 8.2 days in 8 h days. Average delays in the PP2A-b’γ mutant line were 7.1 days in 16 h days and 4.7 days in 8 h days. Expression of marker genes of genetically distinct flowering pathways (CO, FLC, MYB33, SPL3), and the floral integrator (FT, SOC1) were tested in WT, pp2a mutants, and two known flowering time mutants elf6 and edm2. The results are compatible with B55 acting at and/or downstream of the floral integrator, in a non-identified pathway. B’ γ was involved in repression of FLC, the main flowering repressor gene. For B’γ the results are consistent with the subunit being a component in the major autonomous flowering pathway. In conclusion PP2A is both a positive and negative regulator of flowering time, depending on the type of regulatory subunit involved."
https://openalex.org/W2158986215,"Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are caused by out-of-frame and in-frame mutations, respectively, in the dystrophin encoding DMD gene. Molecular therapies targeting the precursormRNA are in clinical trials and show promising results. These approaches will depend on the stability and expression levels of dystrophin mRNA in skeletal muscles and heart. We report that the DMD gene is more highly expressed in heart than in skeletal muscles, in mice and humans. The transcript mutated in the mdx mouse model shows a 5′ to 3′ imbalance compared with that of its wild-type counterpart and reading frame restoration via antisense-mediated exon skipping does not correct this event. We also report significant transcript instability in 22 patients with Becker dystrophy, clarifying the fact that transcript imbalance is not caused by premature nonsense mutations. Finally, we demonstrate that transcript stability, rather than transcriptional rate, is an important determinant of dystrophin protein levels in patients with Becker dystrophy. We suggest that the availability of the complete transcript is a key factor to determine protein abundance and thus will influence the outcome of mRNA-targeting therapies.—Spitali, P., van den Bergen, J.

https://openalex.org/W2048035463,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a static encephalopathy occurring when a lesion to the developing brain results in disordered movement and posture. Patients present with sometimes overlapping spastic, athetoid/dyskinetic, and ataxic symptoms. Spastic CP, which is characterized by stiff muscles, weakness, and poor motor control, accounts for ∼80% of cases. The detailed mechanisms leading to disordered movement in spastic CP are not completely understood, but clinical experience and recent studies suggest involvement of peripheral motor synapses. For example, it is recognized that CP patients have altered sensitivities to drugs that target neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), and protein localization studies suggest that NMJ microanatomy is disrupted in CP. Since CP originates during maturation, we hypothesized that NMJ disruption in spastic CP is associated with retention of an immature neuromotor phenotype later in life. Scoliosis patients with spastic CP or idiopathic disease were enrolled in a prospective, partially-blinded study to evaluate NMJ organization and neuromotor maturation. The localization of synaptic acetylcholine esterase (AChE) relative to postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), synaptic laminin β2, and presynaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2) appeared mismatched in the CP samples; whereas, no significant disruption was found between AChR and SV2. These data suggest that pre- and postsynaptic NMJ components in CP children were appropriately distributed even though AChE and laminin β2 within the synaptic basal lamina appeared disrupted. Follow up electron microscopy indicated that NMJs from CP patients appeared generally mature and similar to controls with some differences present, including deeper postsynaptic folds and reduced presynaptic mitochondria. Analysis of maturational markers, including myosin, syntrophin, myogenin, and AChR subunit expression, and telomere lengths, all indicated similar levels of motor maturation in the two groups. Thus, NMJ disruption in CP was found to principally involve components of the synaptic basal lamina and subtle ultra-structural modifications but appeared unrelated to neuromotor maturational status."
https://openalex.org/W2076400706,"Dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1) modulates opioid reinforcement, reward, and opioid-induced neuroadaptation. We propose that DRD1 polymorphism affects susceptibility to opioid dependence (OD), the efficiency of transition to OD, and opioid-induced pleasure response. We analyzed potential association between seven DRD1 polymorphisms with the following traits: duration of transition from the first use to dependence (DTFUD), subjective pleasure responses to opioid on first use and post-dependence use, and OD risk in 425 Chinese with OD and 514 healthy controls. DTFUD and level of pleasure responses were examined using a semi-structured interview. The DTFUD of opioid addicts ranged from 5 days to 11 years. Most addicts (64.0%) reported non-comfortable response upon first opioid use, while after dependence, most addicts (53.0%) felt strong opioid-induced pleasure. Survival analysis revealed a correlation of prolonged DTFUD with the minor allele-carrying genotypes of DRD1 rs4532 (hazard ratios (HR) = 0.694; p = 0.001) and rs686 (HR = 0.681, p = 0.0003). Binary logistic regression indicated that rs10063995 GT genotype (vs. GG+TT, OR = 0.261) could predict decreased pleasure response to first-time use and the minor alleles of rs686 (OR = 0.535) and rs4532 (OR = 0.537) could predict decreased post-dependence pleasure. Moreover, rs686 minor allele was associated with a decreased risk for rapid transition from initial use to dependence (DTFUD≤30 days; OR = 0.603) or post-dependence euphoria (OR = 0.603) relative to major allele. In conclusion, DRD1 rs686 minor allele decreases the OD risk by prolonging the transition to dependence and attenuating opioid-induced pleasure in Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2159267097,"We have reported that the P-gp substrate digoxin required basolateral and apical uptake transport in excess of that allowed by digoxin passive permeability (as measured in the presence of GF120918) to achieve the observed efflux kinetics across MDCK-MDR1-NKI (The Netherlands Cancer Institute) confluent cell monolayers. That is, GF120918 inhibitable uptake transport was kinetically required. Therefore, IC50 measurements using digoxin as a probe substrate in this cell line could be due to inhibition of P-gp, of digoxin uptake transport, or both. This kinetic analysis is now extended to include three additional cell lines: MDCK-MDR1-NIH (National Institute of Health), Caco-2 and CPT-B2 (Caco-2 cells with BCRP knockdown). These cells similarly exhibit GF120918 inhibitable uptake transport of digoxin. We demonstrate that inhibition of digoxin transport across these cell lines by GF120918, cyclosporine, ketoconazole and verapamil is greater than can be explained by inhibition of P-gp alone. We examined three hypotheses for this non-P-gp inhibition. The inhibitors can: (1) bind to a basolateral digoxin uptake transporter, thereby inhibiting digoxin's cellular uptake; (2) partition into the basolateral membrane and directly reduce membrane permeability; (3) aggregate with digoxin in the donor chamber, thereby reducing the free concentration of digoxin, with concomitant reduction in digoxin uptake. Data and simulations show that hypothesis 1 was found to be uniformly acceptable. Hypothesis 2 was found to be uniformly unlikely. Hypothesis 3 was unlikely for GF120918 and cyclosporine, but further studies are needed to completely adjudicate whether hetero-dimerization contributes to the non-P-gp inhibition for ketoconazole and verapamil. We also find that P-gp substrates with relatively low passive permeability such as digoxin, loperamide and vinblastine kinetically require basolateral uptake transport over that allowed by +GF120918 passive permeability, while highly permeable P-gp substrates such as amprenavir, quinidine, ketoconazole and verapamil do not, regardless of whether they actually use the basolateral transporter."

Interestingly, the Lgr4K5 KO female mice were subfertile, and their embryos had impaired development. Notably, the contributions of uterine development to the subfertility phenotype were not elucidated in the previous report. In a readdress, the following study explores uterine aberration in Lgr4K5 KO female mice. Histological analysis revealed that the uteri of Lgr4K5 KO mice displayed altered epithelial differentiation characterized by a reduction in the number of uterine glands. Furthermore, Lgr4 deletion led to the reduced expression of morphoregulatory genes related to the Wnt signaling pathway. Additionally, the uteri of the Lgr4K5 KO mice lost the ability to undergo induced decidualization. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis and administration of recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) demonstrated that the impaired decidualization in Lgr4K5 KO mice resulted from the decreased secretion of LIF concurrent with a reduction in uterine gland count. Thus, we propose that LGR4 contributes to uterine gland development, which supports decidualization during pregnancy.—Sone, M., Oyama, K., Mohri, Y., Hayashi, R., Clevers, H., Nishimori, K., LGR4 expressed in uterine epithelium is necessary for uterine gland development and contributes to decidualization in mice.

https://openalex.org/W1981975893,"Background Temperature and humidity strongly affect the physiology, longevity, fecundity and dispersal behavior of Aedes aegypti, vector of dengue fever. Contrastingly, the statistical associations measured between time series of mosquito abundance and meteorological variables are often weak and contradictory. Here, we investigated the significance of these relationships at different time scales. Methods and Findings A time series of the adult mosquito abundance from a medium-sized city in Brazil, lasting 109 weeks was analyzed. Meteorological variables included temperature, precipitation, wind velocity and humidity. As analytical tools, generalized linear models (GLM) with time lags and interaction terms were used to identify average effects while the wavelet analysis was complementarily used to identify transient associations. The fitted GLM showed that mosquito abundance is significantly affected by the interaction between lagged temperature and humidity, and also by the mosquito abundance a week earlier. Extreme meteorological variables were the best predictors, and the mosquito population tended to increase at values above and 54% humidity. The wavelet analysis identified non-stationary local effects of these meteorological variables on abundance throughout the study period, with peaks in the spring-summer period. The wavelet detected weak but significant effects for precipitation and wind velocity. Conclusion Our results support the presence of transient relationships between meteorological variables and mosquito abundance. Such transient association may be explained by the ability of Ae. aegypti to buffer part of its response to climate, for example, by choosing sites with proper microclimate. We also observed enough coupling between the abundance and meteorological variables to develop a model with good predictive power. Extreme values of meteorological variables with time lags, interaction terms and previous mosquito abundance are strong predictors and should be considered when understanding the climate effect on mosquito abundance and population growth."
https://openalex.org/W2059346226,"Triazoles are known for their non-toxicity, higher stability and therapeutic activity. Few nucleoside (L1, L2 and L3) and non-nucleoside 1,2,3-triazoles (L4–L14) were synthesised using click chemistry and they were screened for tumor cell cytotoxicity and proliferation. Among these triazole ligands studied, nucleoside ligands exhibited higher potential than non-nucleoside ligands. The nucleoside triazole analogues, 3′-Phenyl-1,2,3- triazole-thymidine (L2) and 3′-4-Chlorophenyl-1,2,3-triazole-thymidine (L3), demonstrated higher cytotoxicity in tumor cells than in normal cells. The IC50 value for L3 was lowest (50 µM) among the ligands studied. L3 terminated cell cycle at S, G2/M phases and enhanced sub-G1 populations, manifesting induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. Confocal studies indicated that nucleoside triazole ligands (L2/L3) cause higher DNA fragmentation than other ligands. Preclinical experiments with tumor-induced mice showed greater reduction in tumor size with L3. In vitro DNA synthesis reaction with L3 exhibited higher DNA synthesis inhibition with quadruplex forming DNA (QF DNA) than non quadruplex forming DNA (NQF DNA). Tm of quadruplex DNA increased in the presence of L3, indicating its ability to enhance stability of quadruplex DNA at elevated temperature and the results indicate that it had higher affinity towards quadruplex DNA than the other forms of DNA (like dsDNA and ssDNA). From western blot experiment, it was noticed that telomerase expression levels in the tissues of tumor-induced mice were found to be reduced on L3 treatment. Microcalorimetry results emphasise that two nucleoside triazole ligands (L2/L3) interact with quadruplex DNA with significantly higher affinity (Kd≈10−7 M). Interestingly the addition of an electronegative moiety to the phenyl group of L2 enhanced its anti-proliferative activity. Though IC50 values are not significantly low with L3, the studies on series of synthetic 1,2,3-triazole ligands are useful for improving and building potential pro-apoptotic ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2113037557,"Nor-BNI, GNTI and JDTic induce selective κ opioid antagonism that is delayed and extremely prolonged, but some other effects are of rapid onset and brief duration. The transient effects of these compounds differ, suggesting that some of them may be mediated by other targets.In binding assays, the three antagonists showed no detectable affinity (K(i)≥10 µM) for most non-opioid receptors and transporters (26 of 43 tested). There was no non-opioid target for which all three compounds shared detectable affinity, or for which any two shared sub-micromolar affinity. All three compounds showed low nanomolar affinity for κ opioid receptors, with moderate selectivity over μ and δ (3 to 44-fold). Nor-BNI bound weakly to the α(2C)-adrenoceptor (K(i) = 630 nM). GNTI enhanced calcium mobilization by noradrenaline at the α(1A)-adrenoceptor (EC₅₀ = 41 nM), but did not activate the receptor, displace radioligands, or enhance PI hydrolysis. This suggests that it is a functionally-selective allosteric enhancer. GNTI was also a weak M₁ receptor antagonist (K(B) = 3.7 µM). JDTic bound to the noradrenaline transporter (K(i) = 54 nM), but only weakly inhibited transport (IC₅₀ = 1.1 µM). JDTic also bound to the opioid-like receptor NOP (K(i) = 12 nM), but gave little antagonism even at 30 µM. All three compounds exhibited rapid permeation and active efflux across Caco-2 cell monolayers.Across 43 non-opioid CNS targets, only GNTI exhibited a potent functional effect (allosteric enhancement of α(1A)-adrenoceptors). This may contribute to GNTI's severe transient effects. Plasma concentrations of nor-BNI and GNTI may be high enough to affect some peripheral non-opioid targets. Nonetheless, κ opioid antagonism persists for weeks or months after these transient effects dissipate. With an adequate pre-administration interval, our results therefore strengthen the evidence that nor-BNI, GNTI and JDTic are highly selective κ opioid antagonists."

SRA stem Loop Interacting RNA-binding Protein (SLIRP) is a Steroid receptor RNA Activator (SRA) RNA-binding protein that is a potent repressor of NR activity. SLIRP is present in complexes associated with NR target genes in the nucleus; however, it is also abundant in mitochondria where it affects mitochondrial mRNA transcription and energy turnover. In further characterisation studies, we observed SLIRP protein in the testis where its localization pattern changes from mitochondrial in diploid cells to peri-acrosomal and the tail in mature sperm. To investigate the in vivo effects of SLIRP, we generated a SLIRP knockout (KO) mouse. This animal is viable, but sub-fertile. Specifically, when homozygous KO males are crossed with wild type (WT) females the resultant average litter size is reduced by approximately one third compared with those produced by WT males and females. Further, SLIRP KO mice produced significantly fewer progressively motile sperm than WT animals. Electron microscopy identified disruption of the mid-piece/annulus junction in homozygous KO sperm and altered mitochondrial morphology. In sum, our data implicates SLIRP in regulating male fertility, wherein its loss results in asthenozoospermia associated with compromised sperm structure and mitochondrial morphology."
https://openalex.org/W1987786699,"We have recently shown that p38MAP kinase (p38MAPK) stimulates ROS generation via the activation of NADPH oxidase during neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) brain injury. However, how p38MAPK is activated during HI remains unresolved and was the focus of this study. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a key role in brain synapse development, neural transduction and synaptic plasticity. Here we show that CaMKII activity is stimulated in rat hippocampal slice culture exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic the condition of HI. Further, the elevation of CaMKII activity, correlated with enhanced p38MAPK activity, increased superoxide generation from NADPH oxidase as well as necrotic and apoptotic cell death. All of these events were prevented when CaMKII activity was inhibited with KN93. In a neonatal rat model of HI, KN93 also reduced brain injury. Our results suggest that CaMKII activation contributes to the oxidative stress associated with neural cell death after HI."
https://openalex.org/W2080979523,"Defective DNA replication can result in genomic instability, cancer and developmental defects. To understand the roles of DNA damage response (DDR) genes on carcinogenesis in mutants defective for core DNA replication components, we utilized the Mcm4Chaos3/Chaos3 (‘Chaos3’) mouse model that, by virtue of an amino-acid alteration in MCM4 that destabilizes the MCM2-7 DNA replicative helicase, has fewer dormant replication origins and an increased number of stalled replication forks. This leads to genomic instability and cancer in most Chaos3 mice. We found that animals doubly mutant for Chaos3 and components of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) double-strand break response pathway (Atm, p21/Cdkn1a and Chk2/Chek2) had decreased tumor latency and/or increased tumor susceptibility. Tumor latency and susceptibility differed between genetic backgrounds and genders, with females demonstrating an overall greater cancer susceptibility to Atm and p21 deficiency than males. Atm deficiency was semilethal in the Chaos3 background and impaired embryonic fibroblast proliferation, suggesting that ATM drug inhibitors might be useful against tumors with DNA replication defects. Hypomorphism for the 9–1–1 component Hus1 did not affect tumor latency or susceptibility in Chaos3 animals, and tumors in these mice did not exhibit impaired ATR pathway signaling. These and other data indicate that under conditions of systemic replication stress, the ATM pathway is particularly important both for cancer suppression and viability during development."

In addition, via a Trx-independent mechanism, Txnip regulates glucose metabolism and thus maintains intracellular glucose levels. Previously, we found Txnip mRNA highly expressed in immature germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes, but currently there is no report describing the role of Txnip in oocytes. Therefore, we conducted the present study to determine the function of Txnip in mouse oocytes' maturation and meiosis by using RNA interference (RNAi) method. Upon specific depletion of Txnip, 79.5% of oocytes were arrested at metaphase I (MI) stage. Time-lapse video microscopy analysis revealed that the formation of granules in the oocyte cytoplasm increased concurrent with retarded cytoplasmic streaming after Txnip RNAi treatment. Txnip RNAi-treated oocytes had upregulated glucose uptake and lactate production. To confirm the supposition that mechanism responsible for these observed phenomena involves increased lactate in oocytes, we cultured oocytes in high lactate medium and observed the same increased granule formation and retarded cytoplasmic streaming as found by Txnip RNAi. The MI-arrested oocytes exhibited scattered microtubules and aggregated chromosomes indicating that actin networking was disturbed by Txnip RNAi. Therefore, we conclude that Txnip is a critical regulator of glucose metabolism in oocytes and is involved in maintaining cytoplasmic streaming in mouse oocytes."

Those who were found to have abnormalities were required to take another diagnostic test in the health center. The ""Klockhoff digit"" method was used to classify NIHL in the present study.The main source of noise inside restaurants was the stoves. The mean hearing thresholds showed a typical dip at 3 to 6 KHz and a substantial proportion (23.7%) of the workers fulfilled the criteria for presumptive NIHL. For entertainment sectors, employees in radio and television stations generally had higher exposure levels than those in the halls or auditoria of the LCSD and karaoke bars. The mean hearing thresholds showed a typical dip at 6 KHz and a substantial proportion of the employees fulfilled the criteria for presumptive NIHL (38.6%, 95%CI: 35.1-42.1%). Being male, older, and having longer service and daily alcohol consumption were associated with noise-induced hearing impairment both in restaurant workers and entertainment employees.Excessive noise exposure is common in the Chinese restaurant and entertainment industries and a substantial proportion of restaurant workers and entertainment employees suffer from NIHL.

In particular, attention has been focused on both the hydrogen bonds between MHC class II and peptide, and the occupancy of the P1 anchor pocket. We sought to solve the crystal structure of a HLA-DR1 molecule containing a truncated hemagglutinin peptide missing three N-terminal residues compared to the full-length sequence (residues 306-318) to determine the nature of the MHC class II:peptide species that binds HLA-DM. Here we present structural evidence that HLA-DR1 that is loaded with a peptide truncated to the P1 anchor residue such that it cannot make select hydrogen bonds with the peptide N-terminus, adopts the same conformation as molecules loaded with full-length peptide. HLA-DR1:peptide combinations that were unable to engage up to four key hydrogen bonds were also unable to bind HLA-DM, while those truncated to the P2 residue bound well. These results indicate that the conformational changes in MHC class II molecules that are recognized by HLA-DM occur after disengagement of the P1 anchor residue."

RA signaling is reliant on strict enzymatic regulation of RA synthesis and metabolism. Improper spatiotemporal expression of RA during development can result in vertebrate axis defects. microRNAs (miRNAs) are also pivotal in orchestrating developmental processes. While mechanistic links between miRNAs and axial development are established, the role of miRNAs in regulating metabolic enzymes responsible for RA abundance during axis formation has yet to be elucidated. Our results uncovered a role of miR-19 family members in controlling RA metabolism through the regulation of CYP26A1 during vertebrate axis formation. Global miRNA expression profiling showed that developmental RA exposure suppressed the expression of miR-19 family members during zebrafish somitogenesis. A reporter assay confirmed that cyp26a1 is a bona fide target of miR-19 in vivo. Transient knockdown of miR-19 phenocopied axis defects caused by RA exposure. Exogenous miR-19 rescued the axis defects induced by RA exposure. Taken together, these results indicate that the teratogenic effects of RA exposure result, in part, from repression of miR-19 expression and subsequent misregulation of cyp26a1. This highlights a previously unidentified role of miR-19 in facilitating vertebrate axis development via regulation of RA signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2071690676,"Understanding the impact that human memory B-cells (MBC), primed by previous infections or vaccination, exert on neutralizing antibody responses against drifted influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is key to design best protective vaccines. A major obstacle to these studies is the lack of practical tools to analyze HA-specific MBCs in human PBMCs ex vivo. We report here an efficient method to identify MBCs carrying HA-specific BCR in frozen PBMC samples. By using fluorochrome-tagged recombinant HA baits, and vaccine antigens from mismatched influenza strains to block BCR-independent binding, we developed a protocol suitable for quantitative, functional and molecular analysis of single MBCs specific for HA from up to two different influenza strains in the same tube. This approach will permit to identify the naive and MBC precursors of plasmablasts and novel MBCs appearing in the blood following infection or vaccination, thus clarifying the actual contribution of pre-existing MBCs in antibody responses against novel influenza viruses. Finally, this protocol can allow applying high throughput deep sequencing to analyze changes in the repertoire of HA+ B-cells in longitudinal samples from large cohorts of vaccinees and infected subjects with the ultimate goal of understanding the in vivo B-cell dynamics driving the evolution of broadly cross-protective antibody responses."
https://openalex.org/W2079402640,"It has been estimated that there are more than 60 million Hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers in the World Health Organisation's Western Pacific region (WHO-WPR), where liver cancer is among the top three causes of cancer death. WHO and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention report the prevalence of HCV in the South Pacific islands (countries within the WHO-WPR) to be high (5-10% and >2% respectively). However, since HCV is not tested for in many of these countries, there is sparse data available to support this assertion. We screened ∼2000 apparently healthy individuals from Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Kiribati and found a sero-prevalence of 2.0%, 0.1% and 0%, respectively. All sero-positive samples tested negative for HCV RNA. Curious as to why all the sero-positive individuals were negative for HCV-RNA, we also screened them for the HCV protective IL28B SNP markers rs12979860 and rs8099917. All antibody-positive participants bar one had HCV protective haplotypes. Our results suggest that HCV is present in these Pacific island countries, albeit at a prevalence lower than previous estimates. As none of our participants had undergone antiviral treatment, and therefore must have cleared infection naturally, we hypothesise that genotypes 1 and/or 4 are circulating in South Pacific Island people and that these peoples are genetically predisposed to be more likely to spontaneous resolve HCV infection than to become chronic carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2171362354,"Docking Approach using Ray Casting (DARC) is structure-based computational method for carrying out virtual screening by docking small-molecules into protein surface pockets. In a complementary study we find that DARC can be used to identify known inhibitors from large sets of decoy compounds, and can identify new compounds that are active in biochemical assays. Here, we describe our adaptation of DARC for use on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), leading to a speedup of approximately 27-fold in typical-use cases over the corresponding calculations carried out using a CPU alone. This dramatic speedup of DARC will enable screening larger compound libraries, screening with more conformations of each compound, and including multiple receptor conformations when screening. We anticipate that all three of these enhanced approaches, which now become tractable, will lead to improved screening results."
https://openalex.org/W2011579863,"Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are effective therapeutics that preserve favorable actions of estrogens on bone and act as antiestrogens in breast tissue, decreasing the risk of vertebral fractures and breast cancer, but their potential in neuroprotective and procognitive therapy is limited by: 1) an increased lifetime risk of thrombotic events; and 2) an attenuated response to estrogens with age, sometimes linked to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) dysfunction. Herein, three 3(rd) generation SERMs with similar high affinity for estrogen receptors (ERα, ERβ) were studied: desmethylarzoxifene (DMA), FDMA, and a novel NO-donating SERM (NO-DMA). Neuroprotection was studied in primary rat neurons exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation; reversal of cholinergic cognitive deficit was studied in mice in a behavioral model of memory; long term potentiation (LTP), underlying cognition, was measured in hippocampal slices from older 3×Tg Alzheimer's transgenic mice; vasodilation was measured in rat aortic strips; and anticoagulant activity was compared. Pharmacologic blockade of GPR30 and NOS; denudation of endothelium; measurement of NO; and genetic knockout of eNOS were used to probe mechanism. Comparison of the three chemical probes indicates key roles for GPR30 and eNOS in mediating therapeutic activity. Procognitive, vasodilator and anticoagulant activities of DMA were found to be eNOS dependent, while neuroprotection and restoration of LTP were both shown to be dependent upon GPR30, a G-protein coupled receptor mediating estrogenic function. Finally, the observation that an NO-SERM shows enhanced vasodilation and anticoagulant activity, while retaining the positive attributes of SERMs even in the presence of NOS dysfunction, indicates a potential therapeutic approach without the increased risk of thrombotic events."
https://openalex.org/W2154867312,"A surplus of Ph.D. graduates and cuts in funding risks the future of science. In fact, several recent surveys indicate that the Ph.D. job market in relevant science fields is in a state of contracture, yet many universities continue to maintain or even expand Ph.D. programs. An assessment of job advertisements in the journal Science supports the survey conclusions and suggests that advertising for tenure-track faculty positions as well as postdoctoral opportunities have both significantly declined since the 2008 financial collapse, leaving few opportunities for recent Ph.D. graduates in traditional career tracks. Incentives to expand Ph.D. programs continue to influence university administration despite their detrimental effects on students and possibly to the field. Active mentoring, however, could help establish less-is-more programs that benefit students and universities while maintaining the necessary stream of trainees critical to the future of science. Such programs would also require significant changes to university administration that may be unpopular, but are likely inevitable.—Rodgers, B. D., When is education a disservice?
