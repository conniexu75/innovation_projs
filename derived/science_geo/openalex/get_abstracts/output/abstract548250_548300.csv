While the cell dose limitation is partially mitigated by using two UCB units, larger-dosed single units would be preferable. We have evaluated the feasibility and safety of StemRegenin-1 (SR-1), an aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist that expands CD34+ cells, by placing one of the two units in expansion culture. SR-1 produced a 330-fold increase in CD34+ cells and led to engraftment in 17/17 patients at a median of 15 days for neutrophils and 49 days for platelets, significantly faster than in patients treated with unmanipulated UCB. Taken together, the marked expansion, absence of graft failure, and enhanced hematopoietic recovery support testing of SR-1 expansion as a stand-alone graft and suggest it may ameliorate a limitation of UCB transplant.

Unrelated donor umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a major source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for transplantation with more than an estimated 30,000 recipients to date (Ballen et al., 2013Ballen K.K. Gluckman E. Broxmeyer H.E. Umbilical cord blood transplantation: the first 25 years and beyond.Blood. 2013; 122: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). While UCB has the advantages of rapid availability, absent donor attrition, and relatively less human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction compared to HSCs from adult volunteer donors (Smith and Wagner, 2009Smith A.R.

Transplant. 2013; 3: 99-112Google Scholar), the use of UCB is substantially limited by the low finite number of HSCs and progenitor cells that can be collected from a placenta, resulting in prolonged periods of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and suboptimal engraftment and impeding its widespread application (Ballen et al., 2013Ballen K.K.

As a result, there is considerable interest in finding ways to increase the absolute number of hematopoietic cells in an UCB graft, such as with of ex vivo expansion culture before transplantation. StemRegenin-1 (SR-1) was first identified in an unbiased screen for compounds that promoted expansion of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors (Boitano et al., 2010Boitano A.E. Wang J. Romeo R. Bouchez L.C. Parker A.E. Sutton S.E. Walker J.R. Flaveny C.A. Perdew G.H. Denison M.S. et al.Aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonists promote the expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells.Science. 2010; 329: 1345-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). SR-1 expanded HSCs retained multi-lineage potential and significantly augmented early and late engraftment of human cells in immune-deficient murine recipients. SR-1’s effect on CD34+ cell expansion is mediated through direct binding and inhibition of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which normally promotes HSC differentiation during cytokine-driven expansion culture. Preclinical data demonstrate that SR-1 in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT-3L), thrombopoietin (TPO), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) leads to greater numbers of CD34+ cells when compared to previously reported expansion methods being evaluated in clinical trials (de Lima et al., 2008de Lima M.

To explore the clinical utility of SR-1 mediated expansion, a current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) expansion protocol was developed using SR-1 to expand UCB CD34+ cells and manufacture the product, referred to as HSC835, to speed hematopoietic recovery after transplantation. The double UCB transplant platform, i.e., the infusion of two partially HLA-matched UCB units, was pioneered at the University of Minnesota (Barker et al., 2001Barker J.N. Weisdorf D.J. Wagner J.E.

With this approach, one unit can be left unmanipulated while the other is placed in expansion culture, offering two significant advantages: (1) enhanced safety by incorporating an unmanipulated unit as a backup should the expansion culture fail or interfere with engraftment and (2) a means of tracking the relative contributions of the expanded and unmanipulated UCB units to hematopoietic recovery over time based on the inherent genetic differences between donors. Therefore, as in other recent trials evaluating hematopoietic cell expansion (de Lima et al., 2008de Lima M. McMannis J. Gee A. Komanduri K. Couriel D. Andersson B.S. Hosing C. Khouri I. Jones R. Champlin R. et al.Transplantation of ex vivo expanded cord blood cells using the copper chelator tetraethylenepentamine: a phase I/II clinical trial.Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008; 41: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, de Lima et al., 2012de Lima M.

Invest. 2014; 124: 3121-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we used the double UCB platform to explore the safety and efficacy of HSC835. In the study, 20 patients were enrolled and 17 completed the prescribed treatment plan receiving HSC835 after myeloablative conditioning in the double UCB transplant setting (Figure 1A). Demographics and graft characteristics for the recipients of HSC835 are shown (Table 1), along with the characteristics of a comparison historical control cohort selected on the basis of disease type and similarities in treatment plan (i.e., conditioning and graft-versus-host disease [GVHD] prophylaxis), to assess the safety profile of HSC835 in terms of hematopoietic recovery and engraftment. All patients had leukemia or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome and similar performance status. Donor-recipient HLA match and blood group A, B, and O (ABO) compatibility were similar as well. By study design, the most desirable of the two units based on cell dose and HLA match was left unmanipulated (unit 1), while the second best unit with a lower cell dose (unit 2) was selected for ex vivo expansion culture. As expected, HSC835 had significantly greater numbers of CD34 cells compared to unmanipulated units (Table 2), with a median of 17.5 × 106 CD34 (range, 1.4–48.3) per kilogram actual body weight for HSC835 units in contrast to the median number of 0.2 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg present in unmanipulated UCB units. In contrast, the CD3 cell dose was significantly less in recipients of HSC835, because it was derived from the smaller unit 2 and had resultant nonspecific losses with re-cryopreservation of the CD34− fraction, which was collected 15 days before transplantation.Table 1Characteristics of PatientsDemographicsExpansion Cohort (n = 17)Historical Conventional Cohort (n = 111)p valueMedian recipient age (range)29.9 years (12–54)25.6 years (11–51)0.07Median recipient weight (range)87.1 kg (42–130)69.6 kg (32–149)0.09Diagnosis––0.01Acute Myelocytic LeukemiaFirst CR4 (23.5%)33 (29.7%)Second CR–24 (21.6%)Third CR–4 (3.6%)Acute Lymphocytic LeukemiaFirst CR10 (58.8%)30 (27.0%)Second CR–14 (12.6%)Third CR1 (5.9%)2 (1.8%)Myelodysplastic syndrome2 (11.8%)4 (3.6%)CMV SerostatusRecipient positive9 (52.9%)61 (55.0%)0.88Recipient negative8 (47.1%)50 (45.0%)HLA Match with Recipient (Maximum Disparity)Unit 1aUnit 1 is the larger of the two units.Unit 2Unit 1aUnit 1 is the larger of the two units.Unit 26/63 (17.7%)1 (5.9%)9 (8.1%)12 (10.8%)0.275/69 (52.9%)9 (52.9%)34 (30.6%)52 (46.9%)4/65 (29.4%)7 (41.2%)68 (61.3%)47 (42.3%)ABO Match with RecipientUnit 1aUnit 1 is the larger of the two units.Unit 2Unit 1aUnit 1 is the larger of the two units.Unit 2Match5 (29.4%)7 (41.2%)36 (32.4%)23 (20.7%)0.07Major mismatch12 (70.6%)10 (58.8%)53 (47.8%)53 (47.8%)Minor mismatch0022 (19.8%)35 (31.5%)Performance Score1008 (47.1%)54 (48.6%)0.59908 (47.1%)55 (49.5%)801 (5.9%)2 (1.8%)Conditioning and GVHD ProphylaxisCY 120 mg/kg, FLU 75 mg/m2, TBI 1,320 cGy100%100%NSCYclosporin A and mycophenolate mofetil100%100%NSCR, complete remission; CY, cyclophosphamide; FLU, fludarabine; TBI, total body irradiation (total doses shown).a Unit 1 is the larger of the two units.

Cell numbers at each step of the HSC835 manufacturing process (CD34 selection and expansion culture) are shown for each patient (Table 3). After CD34+ cell selection, a median of 4.4 × 106 total CD34+ cells (range, 2.1–14.3) were placed in expansion culture. After 15 days, a median of 1,440 × 106 total CD34+ cells (range, 140–6,361) were recovered. Based on these results, SR-1 expansion cultures yielded a median of a 330-fold (range, 67–848) increase in the number of CD34+ cells and an 854-fold (range, 168–2,121) increase in numbers of total nucleated cells (TNC). In three patients, each identified by a unique patient number (UPN; UPN04, UPN17, and UPN20), the final HSC835 product exceeded the maximum allowable cell dose permitted, resulting in the infusion of only a proportion of the cells available (see Dose Capping). Importantly, the fold expansion of CD34+ cells was independent of the starting CD34 number. In all but one case (UPN03), CD34+ cell expansion exceeded >200-fold. For UPN03, expansion kinetics differed from all other cultures in that there was no evidence of expansion in nucleated cells after the first 3 days of culture.Table 3Selection and Expansion ProfilesUPNPatient Weight (kg)CryopreservedAfter ThawingAfter CD34 SelectionHSC835 (After Expansion)CD34 Depleted (Infused)Total NC (x 108)Total CD34+ (x 106)Total NC (x 108)Total CD34+ (x 106)CD34 Recovery (%)aMethodology in the University of Minnesota Medical Center Clinical Laboratory differs from that in the Cord Blood Banks, resulting in a uniformly higher percentage of CD34 than previously reported (Flores et al., 2009).Total NC (x 106)Total CD34+ (x 106)Total NC (x 108)Total CD34+ (x 106)Fold CD34 ExpansionFold NC ExpansionTotal NC (x 108)Total CD34+ (x 106)Total CD3+ (x 106)0186.214.24.511.66.6146.92.82.623.9965.83718544.81.5227.702119.931.29.624.514.7153.311.510.549.62,496.923843114.16.2592.70364.513.45.212.07.4142.42.22.13.7140.2671684.00.2185.704bCell expansion exceeded the dose allowed; patients received the maximum allowed at dose level 1.110.920.614.317.631.7221.915.614.3118.46,361.94457597.93.1308.905102.527.512.421.615.1122.09.28.290.43,066.537498213.15.8393.0068914.28.79.68.597.95.24.941.71,191.52438022.50.239.407131.222.911.522.17.161.75.24.330.41,123.02615859.50.885.10890.716.63.313.59.5284.02.82.322.3461.82017965.32.4237.60963.111.67.510.413.0171.97.06.058.41,483.02478345.00.8246.11068.921.112.717.717.2135.85.82.997.92,460.38481,6888.81.3210.81184.314.45.811.96.4112.02.92.638.7746.12871,3347.22.7229.21263.118.19.015.713.2146.94.64.297.62,557.86092,1215.30.5257.31352.410.17.78.410.6137.14.74.595.32,175.94842,0284.70.7102.414113.519.05.418.112.5231.84.53.750.01,440.33891,1115.90.5199.01548.022.59.219.117.4188.96.46.0NANANANANANANA16105.920.86.417.513.6211.44.13.432.41,183.73487908.72.5339.817bCell expansion exceeded the dose allowed; patients received the maximum allowed at dose level 1.40.529.721.422.441.2192.712.29.7115.03,196.63309436.81.9190.01844.917.77.814.313.8177.34.03.643.21,212.73371,080NANANA19113.223.35.820.017.6304.36.15.957.51,241.1210943NANANA20bCell expansion exceeded the dose allowed; patients received the maximum allowed at dose level 1.4919.119.916.634.1171.68.07.843.31,677.52155417.83.4195.3Median86.219.18.317.113.4162.55.24.449.61,440.33308546.81.5227.7Numbers of cells infused do not match the total numbers manufactured, because samples were sent for lot release or quality control and research assays.

Eighteen HSC835 products met lot release (see Unit Processing and Table S1). Two products (for UPN15 and UPN19) failed lot release due to a positive bacterial culture. In addition, one product (UPN13) that met lot release had a positive surveillance culture reported 18 hr after infusion. While this patient’s blood cultures remained negative after transplant, transient hypotension occurred 4 hr after infusion, which was the only observed infusional toxicity event. For the three positive cultures, the isolates differed (Propionibacterium acnes [UPN13], coagulase negative Staphylococcus [UPN15], and Leifsonia aquatica [UPN19]). Process improvements in product manufacture, specifically batch production of expansion media and reduced in-process testing, subsequently resulted in 13 of 13 validation study and clinical products meeting lot release. For the 17 recipients of HSC835, neutrophil recovery was achieved in all patients at a median of 15 days (6–30 days), while 86% patients in the control group recovered at a median of 24 days (Figure 1B). Like neutrophil recovery, platelets also recovered more rapidly at a median of 49 days (28–136 days) versus 89 days (p = 0.001), respectively. Six months after transplantation, 76% (CI, 50%–100%) of HSC835 recipients achieved platelet transfusion independence compared to 61% (CI, 50%–72%) of historical controls (Figure 1C). After double UCB transplant, we and others have previously shown that one unit typically predominates and the second unit is lost (Barker et al., 2001Barker J.N. Weisdorf D.J. Wagner J.E.

In this study, the origin of hematopoietic recovery (unit 1 versus unit 2 versus host) was determined at fixed time points by discriminating short tandem repeat loci in sorted CD15+/CD33+ myeloid cells, the most prevalent population in the peripheral blood after transplant (Figure 1D). Hematopoiesis was principally derived from the expanded unit (HSC835) in 11 patients and the unmanipulated unit in 6 patients. In those engrafting with HSC835, time to neutrophil recovery was more rapid at a median 11 days (range, 6–23 range) and correlated with CD34+ cell dose (Figure 1D, left panel). In contrast, no correlation was observed in the 6 patients engrafting with the unmanipulated unit, and speed of recovery was significantly slower (median, 23 days; range, 14–30 range). For those engrafting with HSC835, myeloid engraftment was durable (median follow-up, 272 days; range, 35–688 range) (Figure 1E). A detailed analysis of chimerism, including an evaluation of sorted CD3 cells in the peripheral blood, revealed three patterns: (1) in six patients, the CD15/CD33 (myeloid) and CD3 (T cell) populations are entirely derived from HSC835 (Figure 1E, upper panel); (2) in six patients, the CD15/CD33 and CD3 populations are entirely derived from the unmanipulated unit (lower panel); and (3) in five patients, a unique chimerism pattern was observed with the CD15/CD33 population predominantly derived from HSC835 and the CD3 population almost exclusively derived from the unmanipulated unit (middle panel). These five patients (UPN04, UPN12, UPN14, UPN17, and UPN20) with myeloid chimerism from both HSC835 and the unmanipulated unit had particularly rapid neutrophil recovery (median, 7 days; range, 6–10 days). In all patients, HSC835 myeloid chimerism was near complete on day 7. However, it was not sustained in six patients. As shown in Figure 2A, a more detailed analysis of the HSC835 product demonstrated expansion of the CD34+CD133+CD90+ in all products, the population enriched for the HSCs (Radtke et al., 2015Radtke S.

Since there was an even greater expansion of committed progenitors (CD34+CD133+CD90− and CD34+CD133−CD90−), these data suggest that the expansion culture did not have a deleterious effect on the engraftment potential of HSC835 even in the six patients ultimately engrafting with the unmanipulated unit.

Of seven patients in whom sufficient numbers of CD8+ T cells could be recovered, five patients had interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-producing T cells in the peripheral blood derived from the predominating unit in response to the non-engrafting unit (Figure 2B). Specifically, UPN02 and UPN05 showed reactivity against the unmanipulated unit and engrafted with HSC835, and UPN03, UPN09, and UPN10 showed reactivity against HSC835 and engrafted with the unmanipulated unit. In the two remaining patients, one had no reactivity to either HSC835 or the unmanipulated unit and engrafted with both HSC835 and the unmanipulated unit (UPN04), and one had borderline reactivity (UPN08) to HSC835 and engrafted with the unmanipulated unit.

A full understanding of the networks controlling stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, however, has not yet been realized. To systematically dissect these networks and identify their components, we performed an unbiased, transcriptome-wide in vivo RNAi screen in female Drosophila germline stem cells (GSCs). Based on characterized cellular defects, we classified 646 identified genes into phenotypic and functional groups and unveiled a comprehensive set of networks regulating GSC maintenance, survival, and differentiation. This analysis revealed an unexpected role for ribosomal assembly factors in controlling stem cell cytokinesis. Moreover, our data show that the transition from self-renewal to differentiation relies on enhanced ribosome biogenesis accompanied by increased protein synthesis. Collectively, these results detail the extensive genetic networks that control stem cell homeostasis and highlight the intricate regulation of protein synthesis during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2197594583,"The superior antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are well-documented, but the exact mechanisms underlying Ag-NP microbial toxicity remain the subject of intense debate. Here, we show that Ag-NP concentrations as low as 10 ppm exert significant toxicity against Bacillus subtilis, a beneficial bacterium ubiquitous in the soil. Growth arrest and chromosomal DNA degradation were observed, and flow cytometric quantification of propidium iodide (PI) staining also revealed that Ag-NP concentrations of 25 ppm and above increased membrane permeability. RedoxSensor content analysis and Phag-GFP expression analysis further indicated that reductase activity and cytosolic protein expression decreased in B. subtilis cells treated with 10-50 ppm of Ag NPs. We conducted X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses to directly clarify the valence and fine structure of Ag atoms in B. subtilis cells placed in contact with Ag NPs. The results confirmed the Ag species in Ag NP-treated B. subtilis cells as Ag2O, indicating that Ag-NP toxicity is likely mediated by released Ag+ ions from Ag NPs, which penetrate bacterial cells and are subsequently oxidized intracellularly to Ag2O. These findings provide conclusive evidence for the role of Ag+ ions in Ag-NP microbial toxicity, and suggest that the impact of inappropriately disposed Ag NPs to soil and water ecosystems may warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2186574849,"Skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are required for regeneration of adult muscle following injury, a response that demands activation of mainly quiescent MuSCs. Despite the need for dynamic regulation of MuSC quiescence, relatively little is known about the determinants of this property. Here, we show that Suv4-20h1, an H4K20 dimethyltransferase, controls MuSC quiescence by promoting formation of facultative heterochromatin (fHC). Deletion of Suv4-20h1 reduces fHC and induces transcriptional activation and repositioning of the MyoD locus away from the heterochromatic nuclear periphery. These effects promote MuSC activation, resulting in stem cell depletion and impaired long-term muscle regeneration. Genetic reduction of MyoD expression rescues fHC formation and lost MuSC quiescence, restoring muscle regeneration capacity in Suv4-20h1 mutants. Together, these findings reveal that Suv4-20h1 actively regulates MuSC quiescence via fHC formation and control of the MyoD locus, thereby guarding and preserving the stem cell pool over a lifetime."
https://openalex.org/W2212972121,"Texture indices (TI) calculated from 18F-FDG PET tumor images show promise for predicting response to therapy and survival. Their calculation involves a resampling of standardized uptake values (SUV) within the tumor. This resampling can be performed differently and significantly impacts the TI values. Our aim was to investigate how the resampling approach affects the ability of TI to reflect tissue-specific pattern of metabolic activity.18F-FDG PET were acquired for 48 naïve-treatment patients with non-small cell lung cancer and for a uniform phantom. We studied 7 TI, SUVmax and metabolic volume (MV) in the phantom, tumors and healthy tissue using the usual relative resampling (RR) method and an absolute resampling (AR) method. The differences in TI values between tissue types and cancer subtypes were investigated using Wilcoxon's tests.Most RR-based TI were highly correlated with MV for tumors less than 60 mL (Spearman correlation coefficient r between 0.74 and 1), while this correlation was reduced for AR-based TI (r between 0.06 and 0.27 except for RLNU where r = 0.91). Most AR-based TI were significantly different between tumor and healthy tissues (pvalues <0.01 for all 7 TI) and between cancer subtypes (pvalues<0.05 for 6 TI). Healthy tissue and adenocarcinomas exhibited more homogeneous texture than tumor tissue and squamous cell carcinomas respectively.TI computed using an AR method vary as a function of the tissue type and cancer subtype more than the TI involving the usual RR method. AR-based TI might be useful for tumor characterization."

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are commonly used in basic research and hold great promise for regenerative medicine based on their ability to differentiate to every cell type of the human body and their extensive self-renewal capacity. The indefinite self-renewal of hPSCs in vitro enables their prolonged propagation in culture but poses major challenges to their genome stability maintenance (reviewed in Weissbein et al., 2014Weissbein U.

During culture propagation, hPSCs tend to acquire both structural and numerical aberrations (reviewed in Lund et al., 2012Lund R.J. Närvä E. Lahesmaa R.

Interestingly, numerical chromosomal aberrations in hPSCs tend to result in the acquisition of defined chromosomal aneuploidies. The typical changes are additional copies of chromosomes 12, and 17 X similar to changes found in germ cell tumors (Ben-David et al., 2011Ben-David U. Mayshar Y. Benvenisty N.

While chromosomal aberrations are presumed to occur randomly, giving rise to karyotypically heterogeneous cultures (Peterson et al., 2008Peterson S.E. Westra J.W. Paczkowski C.M. Chun J.

Karyotypic changes of chromosomes 12, and 17 confer hPSCs with a tumorigenic capacity (Baker et al., 2007Baker D.E.C. Harrison N.J. Maltby E. Smith K. Moore H.D. Shaw P.J. Heath P.R. Holden H. Andrews P.W. Adaptation to culture of human embryonic stem cells and oncogenesis in vivo.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Moreover, the most common aberration in hPSCs, trisomy 12, induces profound changes in global gene expression of hPSCs, resulting in increased proliferation rate and tumorigenicity (Ben-David et al., 2014Ben-David U.

Aneuploidy is a hallmark of cancer (reviewed in Gordon et al., 2012Gordon D.J. Resio B. Pellman D. Causes and consequences of aneuploidy in cancer.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 189-203PubMed Google Scholar). Aneuploidy in cancer can be induced by stress on DNA replication (Burrell et al., 2013Burrell R.A. McClelland S.E. Endesfelder D. Groth P. Weller M.-C. Shaikh N. Domingo E. Kanu N. Dewhurst S.M. Gronroos E. et al.Replication stress links structural and numerical cancer chromosomal instability.Nature. 2013; 494: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Replication stress is characterized by increased numbers of stalled and collapsed replication forks, leading to DNA damage. One mechanism underlying replication-induced chromosomal instability is the formation of anaphase bridges due to unreplicated or unresolved regions that restrain chromosome segregation by creating a physical link between sister chromatids (reviewed in Ozeri-Galai et al., 2012Ozeri-Galai E. Bester A.C. Kerem B. The complex basis underlying common fragile site instability in cancer.Trends Genet. 2012; 28: 295-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In somatic cells, incomplete DNA replication activates checkpoints resulting in prolonged mitotic arrest to enable replication completion and damage repair. However, in hPSCs, incomplete DNA replication fails to generate the single-stranded DNA regions necessary for checkpoint activation and repair initiation (Desmarais et al., 2012Desmarais J.A. Hoffmann M.J. Bingham G. Gagou M.E. Meuth M. Andrews P.W. Human embryonic stem cells fail to activate CHK1 and commit to apoptosis in response to DNA replication stress.Stem Cells. 2012; 30: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recurrent hPSC aneuploidies lead to increased proliferation and sensitivity to replication inhibitors (Ben-David et al., 2014Ben-David U. Arad G. Weissbein U. Mandefro B. Maimon A. Golan-Lev T. Narwani K. Clark A.T. Andrews P.W. Benvenisty N. Carlos Biancotti J. Aneuploidy induces profound changes in gene expression, proliferation and tumorigenicity of human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This suggests that hPSCs, and particularly aneuploid hPSCs, may be exceptionally vulnerable to replication stress. In addition to the hPSC-inherent deficiency in the intra-S checkpoints (Filion et al., 2009Filion T.M. Qiao M. Ghule P.N. Mandeville M. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Altieri D.C. Stein G.S.

Ben-David U. Quality control: Genome maintenance in pluripotent stem cells.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 204: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the G2/M decatenation checkpoint is also deficient in these cells (Damelin et al., 2005Damelin M. Sun Y.E. Sodja V.B. Bestor T.H. Decatenation checkpoint deficiency in stem and progenitor cells.Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 479-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This checkpoint delays entry into mitosis until chromosomes have been detangled. Hence, in hPSCs, uncondensed chromosomes are able to form mitotic spindles and attempt anaphase separation of their entangled chromatids (Damelin et al., 2005Damelin M. Sun Y.E. Sodja V.B. Bestor T.H. Decatenation checkpoint deficiency in stem and progenitor cells.Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 479-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Proper chromosome condensation requires complete DNA replication (Gotoh, 2007Gotoh E. Visualizing the dynamics of chromosome structure formation coupled with DNA replication.Chromosoma. 2007; 116: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the effect of replication stress on chromosome condensation in hPSCs has yet to be studied. Here we show that aneuploid hPSCs exhibit inherent perturbed DNA replication, resulting in a high prevalence of partially condensed metaphase chromosomes and chromosomal segregation errors. Moreover, our findings reveal that actin cytoskeleton impairment caused by reduced SRF levels underlies the ongoing chromosomal instability in hPSCs. We studied the replication dynamics in hPSCs with common aneuploidies. We focused on hPSCs with the gain of chromosomes 17q or 12, which are highly recurrent in cultured hPSCs and provide a selective propagation advantage (Baker et al., 2007Baker D.E.C. Harrison N.J.

We validated that CSES10 and HUES9 exhibit normal karyotypes; CSES22 harbors trisomy 12 (hereafter referred to as T12-hPSCs); and HUES7 harbors trisomy of both chromosomes 12 and 17 (hereafter referred to as T12+17-hPSCs), which is commonly present in hPSCs (Baker et al., 2007Baker D.E.C.

The replication dynamics was studied using the DNA combing approach (Figure 1A). First, we analyzed the DNA replication fork rate (Figures 1B–1D), which showed a significant increase in the percentage of very slow forks (0.75 kb/min and below) in T12-hPSCs and T12+17-hPSCs compared to their diploid counterparts (Figures 1B and 1C). The average replication rate of the two aneuploid hPSC lines was significantly lower than that of the two diploid counterparts (Figure 1D). Slow fork progression leads to activation of additional origins to enable the completion of DNA replication (Ge et al., 2007Ge X.Q. Jackson D.A. Blow J.J. Dormant origins licensed by excess Mcm2-7 are required for human cells to survive replicative stress.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Hence, we studied origin density in diploid and in aneuploid hPSCs by measuring the distance between two sister forks (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This analysis showed a significant increase in the fraction of DNA fibers with a very short fork distance (100 kb and below) in aneuploid hPSCs compared to their diploid counterparts (Figures 1E and 1F). Furthermore, the average fork distance was significantly lower in aneuploid than in diploid hPSCs (Figure 1G). All together, our results show that the replication dynamics was perturbed in aneuploid hPSCs that had common chromosomal aberrations. Replication stress leads to gaps, constrictions, and local perturbations in chromosome condensation. Therefore, we studied the effect of the replication stress on chromosome condensation in aneuploid hPSCs. To our surprise, even after a long colcemid-induced metaphase arrest, metaphase spreads of hPSCs showed partially condensed entangled chromosomes in addition to the expected local condensation perturbations (Figures 2A and S1). Chromosome condensation in hPSCs ranged from fully condensed chromosomes to long and less compact chromosomes to fully entangled chromosomes. We classified the chromosomes into four groups according to their degree of condensation (1 represents normally condensed metaphases and 4 corresponds to fully entangled metaphases) (Figures 2A and S1). First, we studied the prevalence of condensation perturbations under normal conditions by analyzing the frequency of each subgroup in three aneuploid hPSCs (T12, T17, and T12+17), eight diploid hPSCs (both hESCs and iPSCs), and the following four diploid somatic cell lines: fibroblasts (BJ), epithelial cells (RPE and HCT116), and lymphocytes (GM07027). On average, ∼95% of the metaphases from diploid somatic cells were scored in group 1, whereas only <5% were partially condensed (group 2). No entangled chromosomes were identified (groups 3 and 4) (Figures 2B and S2). In diploid hPSC metaphases, ∼80% showed normal condensation (group 1), 10% were scored in group 2, and 10% were scored in groups 3 and 4. Strikingly, in metaphases of the aneuploid hPSCs, only 37% showed normal condensation, whereas condensation 2 was the largest subgroup (55%). Groups 3 and 4 accounted for ∼20% of the metaphases in aneuploid hPSCs (Figure 2B). Next we examined whether perturbed condensation also characterizes somatic trisomies. We analyzed two somatic cell lines (HCT116 and RPE) harboring trisomy 5 and 21, respectively. There was no significant difference between the aneuploid somatic cells and their diploid counterparts (Figures S2A and S2B). All together, these results show that perturbed condensation is extremely rare in both diploid and aneuploid somatic cells. However, these defects are more frequent in diploid hPSCs and are highly prevalent in aneuploid hPSCs, indicating that diploid hPSCs have an inherent tendency toward condensation defects, which is dramatically increased in aneuploid hPSCs. Proper chromosome condensation requires complete DNA replication (Gotoh, 2007Gotoh E. Visualizing the dynamics of chromosome structure formation coupled with DNA replication.Chromosoma. 2007; 116: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the high fraction of partially condensed metaphases in aneuploid hPSCs is a result of inherent replication stress, we used aphidicolin (APH), an inhibitor of DNA polymerase α and δ, to induce replication stress (Figures 2C and S2). APH treatment led to an increase in the number of partially condensed metaphases in all cell lines (Figures 2C and S2) and was positively correlated with the extent of APH-induced replication stress (Figures 2C and S2). However, while in diploid somatic fibroblasts (BJs) only ∼17% of the metaphases were partially condensed even under severe replication stress conditions (0.4 μM APH), in diploid and aneuploid hPSCs under the same conditions, 60% and 80% of the metaphases were partially condensed, respectively (Figure 2C). These results indicate that chromosome condensation in hPSCs is highly sensitive to replication stress. Notably, while under normal growth conditions condensation defects in all four analyzed diploid somatic cell lines were rare, under induced replication stress, a cell-type-specific sensitivity was found (Figures 2C and S2). In addition, the analysis of somatic diploid cells and their trisomic counterparts under stress conditions also did not show any significant difference in the prevalence of partially condensed metaphases (Figures S2A and S2B), indicating that the effect of aneuploidy on chromosome condensation is a characteristic feature of hPSCs. Replication stress and partially condensed metaphases result in anaphase segregation errors characterized by anaphase bridges and lagging chromosomes (Downes et al., 1994Downes C.S. Clarke D.J. Mullinger A.M. Giménez-Abián J.F. Creighton A.M. Johnson R.T. A topoisomerase II-dependent G2 cycle checkpoint in mammalian cells/.Nature. 1994; 372: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, Burrell et al., 2013Burrell R.A. McClelland S.E. Endesfelder D. Groth P. Weller M.-C. Shaikh N. Domingo E. Kanu N. Dewhurst S.M. Gronroos E. et al.Replication stress links structural and numerical cancer chromosomal instability.Nature. 2013; 494: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Hence, we studied chromosome segregation in hPSCs. Anaphases with bridges and/or lagging chromosomes were defined as abnormal anaphases (Figure 2D). The analysis showed that under normal conditions, abnormal anaphases were significantly more frequent in hPSCs than in somatic cells (Figure 2E). Moreover, there were significantly more abnormal anaphases in aneuploid than in diploid hPSCs (Figure 2E), further supporting the findings that aneuploid hPSCs experience replication stress that leads to perturbation of chromosome condensation during metaphase. If the identified characteristics of aneuploid cells are causal to aneuploidy, one would expect that aneuploid cells would become more aneuploid as these factors continue to act. In fact, hPSCs with T12 or T17 often harbor additional aberrations and become more aneuploid with time (Amps et al., 2011Amps K. Andrews P.W. Anyfantis G. Armstrong L. Avery S. Baharvand H. Baker J. Baker D. Munoz M.B. Beil S. et al.International Stem Cell InitiativeScreening ethnically diverse human embryonic stem cells identifies a chromosome 20 minimal amplicon conferring growth advantage.Nat.

Adaptation to culture of human embryonic stem cells and oncogenesis in vivo.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). To further examine instability in aneuploid hPSCs, six of our diploid hPSC cell lines were karyotyped. Only 4/140 karyotyped metaphases (2.9%) showed chromosomal aberrations (Table S1). In contrast, three aneuploid hPSC lines harboring trisomy 12 or 17 were highly unstable: in 25/74 (34%) analyzed metaphases, additional aberrations were present (p < 0.0001) (Table S2). These data strongly support the notion that aneuploid cells are highly unstable compared to their diploid counterparts and experience ongoing chromosomal instability. We next investigated the molecular basis of the marked perturbations in DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and segregation by comparing the global gene expression patterns of diploid and aneuploid hPSCs. We compiled a database of 31 expression microarrays of diploid hPSCs from nine studies, 8 microarrays of aneuploid hPSCs with culture-acquired trisomy 12 from five studies, and 4 microarrays of aneuploid hPSCs with culture-acquired trisomy 17 from four studies (Table S3). One of the samples was from cells with trisomy 12 and 17, and another was from cells with trisomies 12 and 3 (Table S3). Previous gene expression analyses have focused on the effect of specific chromosomal aberrations on global gene expression patterns (Ben-David et al., 2014Ben-David U. Arad G. Weissbein U. Mandefro B. Maimon A. Golan-Lev T. Narwani K. Clark A.T. Andrews P.W. Benvenisty N. Carlos Biancotti J. Aneuploidy induces profound changes in gene expression, proliferation and tumorigenicity of human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, here we focused on the gene expression changes that occur in culture-adapted aneuploid hPSCs regardless of the specific aberration, since the replication, condensation, and segregation changes observed in aneuploid hPSCs did not depend on the type of aberration (Figures 1 and 2). We performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with all expressed genes to identify pathways that are perturbed in aneuploid hPSCs. This analysis revealed that genes in the DNA replication and chromosome condensation pathways were among the most downregulated groups of genes in the aneuploid hPSCs (Figures 3A and 3B ). We next subjected the lists of the 100 most upregulated and the 100 most downregulated probe sets in aneuploid hPSCs (compared to diploid hPSCs) to DAVID functional annotation enrichment analysis. Importantly, probe sets were required to be differentially expressed in both hPSCs with trisomy 12 and 17 so that genes with altered expression in only one type of aberration were excluded from the analysis (see Experimental Procedures). Whereas the list of genes upregulated in aneuploid hPSCs was not significantly enriched with any cellular process, the list of genes downregulated in recurrent aneuploid hPSCs was significantly enriched with actin cytoskeleton-related annotations (Figure 3C). The differentially expressed genes in this group included several of the hallmark cytoskeleton genes (Figure 3D). The actin cytoskeleton is highly important for chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis (Gachet et al., 2001Gachet Y. Tournier S. Millar J.B. Hyams J.S. A MAP kinase-dependent actin checkpoint ensures proper spindle orientation in fission yeast.Nature. 2001; 412: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); therefore, its perturbation in aneuploid hPSCs may underlie the phenotype observed in these cells. We next performed a PRIMA analysis to identify transcription factors whose binding sites were enriched in the list of the 100 most downregulated probe sets. The only significant enrichment was found for the targets of the serum response factor (SRF) transcription factor (Figure 3E). SRF controls transcription of many cellular “immediate-early” genes whose expression is activated by mitogenic stimuli such as serum and growth factor addition (Esnault et al., 2014Esnault C. Stewart A. Gualdrini F. East P. Horswell S. Matthews N. Treisman R. Rho-actin signaling to the MRTF coactivators dominates the immediate transcriptional response to serum in fibroblasts.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 943-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Spencer et al., 1999Spencer J.A. Major M.L. Misra R.P. Basic fibroblast growth factor activates serum response factor gene expression by multiple distinct signaling mechanisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3977-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In line with its role as a positive regulator, and the downregulation of its targets in aneuploid hPSCs, we found SRF itself to be downregulated in hPSCs with either trisomy 12 or trisomy 17 (Figure S3A). Next, we validated SRF downregulation in T12 and T12+17-hPSCs by RT-qPCR. Both cell lines displayed a significant reduction in their SRF expression level compared to diploid cell lines (Figure 3F). Western blot analysis showed also a reduction in the SRF protein level (Figure 3G). Next, using RT-qPCR, we confirmed the expression levels of several actin cytoskeletal genes that are SRF targets and were significantly downregulated in the microarray data. Consistent with the reduced SRF levels found in T12 and T12+17-hPSCs, we found a significant reduction in SRF-targeted actin cytoskeletal genes in both cell lines (Figures 3H and S3B). SRF regulates genes via combinatorial interaction with additional transcription factors, cofactors, and signaling pathways. We next studied the expression level of additional known targets of SRF involved in different SRF-controlled pathways (Esnault et al., 2014Esnault C. Stewart A. Gualdrini F. East P. Horswell S. Matthews N. Treisman R. Rho-actin signaling to the MRTF coactivators dominates the immediate transcriptional response to serum in fibroblasts.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 943-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) in diploid and aneuploid hPSCs. Only two pathways were significantly (p < 0.01) downregulated in aneuploid hPSCs: the “associated with F-actin and actomyosin” and the “focal adhesion” pathways, both related to the actin cytoskeleton (Table S4). These results indicate that not all SRF targets are equally sensitive to a reduction in its expression. Next, we studied whether SRF overexpression in aneuploid hPSCs was sufficient to rescue the impaired chromosome condensation and segregation perturbations. We stably transfected T12-hPSCs with an SRF plasmid. SRF protein levels were measured, and two clones showing significant increased SRF levels were selected for further analysis (Figure 3I). SRF overexpression in these aneuploid hPSCs led to a significant decrease in the prevalence of impaired chromosome condensation (Figure 3G). Importantly, in the SRF-overexpressing aneuploid hPSCs, the prevalence of perturbed condensation was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) and reached levels similar to those found in diploid hPSCs. Similarly, the prevalence of abnormal anaphases was significantly reduced following SRF overexpression (Figures S3C and S3D). These results show that SRF overexpression is sufficient to significantly rescue the abnormal phenotype of aneuploid hPSCs. We then studied whether reduced SRF expression is sufficient to induce replication stress and perturbation in chromosome condensation. We transfected diploid hPSCs with siRNA smart pool against SRF. Western blot analysis showed an ∼50% reduction in the SRF levels (Figure S4A). SRF downregulation led to a significant reduction in the average fork rate and distance (Figures 4A and 4B and S4B and S4C). Subsequently we treated diploid hPSCs with APH for 24 hr and found that APH did not affect SRF protein levels (Figure S4D), indicating that replication stress was not the initiating event leading to insufficient SRF. Last, we studied the effect of SRF downregulation on chromosome condensation. Analysis of metaphase spreads revealed a significant increase in the percentage of partially condensed metaphases in SRF-siRNA-transfected diploid hPSCs (Figure 4C), clearly showing that reduced SRF levels in diploid hPSCs result in the replication stress and impaired chromosome condensation that characterize aneuploid hPSCs. In order to study the effect of actin cytoskeletal genes on DNA replication and chromosome condensation, we cultured diploid hPSCs in a medium containing Latrinculin B (Lat B), an inhibitor of actin polymerization. Lat B increases the level of monomeric actin, which inhibits the formation of the SRF-MRTF complex required for the transcription of actin and actin-related genes. Therefore, Lat B indirectly inhibits transcription of the SRF-MRTF targets only. Lat B led to a significant reduction in the average fork rate and fork distance (Figures 4D and 4E and S4E and S4F), suggesting that disruption of actin polymerization leads to replication stress in diploid hPSCs. Next, we studied the effect of Lat B on chromosome condensation during metaphase. Cells cultured in Lat B showed a significant increase in the percentage of partially condensed metaphases (Figure 4F). Moreover, the percentage of metaphases in condensation groups 3 and 4, which were very rare in untreated hPSCs, increased significantly in Lat-B-treated cells (Figure 4F). These results show that inhibition of actin polymerization by Lat B leads to a dramatic increase in partially condensed metaphases in diploid hPSCs, similar to the level found in untreated aneuploid hPSCs (Figure 2). An important question emerging from these results is whether perturbation in actin function is sufficient to induce ongoing chromosomal instability. For this we karyotyped the CSES10 diploid hPSC line after Lat B treatment. As described above, chromosomal aberrations in diploid hPSCs are highly uncommon, and in CSES10 cells specifically, all untreated metaphases were diploid (Table S1). In contrast, after Lat B treatment, 20% of the CSES10 metaphases were aneuploid (Figure 4G) (p < 0.01). These data show that perturbation in actin cytoskeleton function by Lat B drives genome instability in diploid hPSCs. Here we identified a mechanism leading to the ongoing chromosomal instability in hPSCs that harbor recurrent aneuploidies. This may explain the propensity of these cells to acquire a complex karyotype. We showed that the DNA replication dynamics in aneuploid hPSCs is perturbed, resulting in a high prevalence of partially condensed metaphase chromosomes, chromosomal segregation errors, and genome instability. Why does replication stress in hPSCs result in a robust phenotype of partially condensed metaphases, whereas in somatic cells it only results in local perturbations in chromosome condensation? A reasonable explanation is the different efficiencies of checkpoint activations between somatic cells and hPSCs. In somatic cells, the effective intra-S and G2/M checkpoints arrest cells whose replication was perturbed and incomplete. The only cells that manage to escape these checkpoints suffer mild replication perturbation resulting in local condensation defects at these sites. hPSCs, however, are not arrested by the intra-S and G2/M checkpoints and proceed along the cell cycle even if their replication is significantly perturbed, resulting in a robust phenotype of partially condensed metaphases. Our bioinformatics analyses revealed reduced transcription levels of actin cytoskeleton genes and their common transcription factor SRF in aneuploid hPSCs. Moreover, diploid hPSCs treated with Lat B, an inhibitor of both actin polymerization and SRF-dependent transcription, recapitulated the replication and condensation defects in untreated aneuploid hPSCs. These results indicate that the perturbation of actin transcription and organization is the mechanism leading to instability and ongoing chromosomal aberrations in aneuploid hPSCs. Based on the results presented here, we suggest a model for the cellular events leading to ongoing chromosomal instability in aneuploid hPSCs (Figure 4H). According to this model, SRF downregulation leads to downregulation of actin-cytoskeleton genes, leading to replication stress and partially condensed metaphases. This further leads to abnormal anaphases and provides the cells with the ability to acquire additional aberrations (Figure 4H). SRF was first identified in studies that investigated the response of fibroblasts to serum addition. Hence, our results raise the question of whether certain culture conditions (e.g., growth factor starvation) might induce genetic instability in hPSC cultures by reducing the expression of SRF. Importantly, culturing hPSCs with bFGF-depleted medium resulted in decreased levels of SRF (Figure S4G). In our study the diploid and aneuploid hPSCs were grown in the exact same medium; hence this cannot account for the different SRF levels found between them. Nevertheless, these results emphasize the importance of optimal culture conditions to protect SRF levels and genome stability. Here we show that in hPSCs, replication stress results in chromosome condensation defects. Therefore, the consequences of replication stress in hPSCs might be even more deleterious than in somatic cells and may also operate during initiation of instability in diploid hPSCs. In summary, our results suggest a mechanism that might also be relevant for the development of germ cell tumors (and potentially other tumor types with impaired intra-S or decatenation checkpoints). Total RNA was extracted from undifferentiated hPSCs using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). RNA was subjected to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarray platform (Affymetrix); original microarray data are accessible at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under the accession number GEO: GSE64647 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). In addition, microarray data of undifferentiated hPSCs were downloaded from the GEO database (detailed in Table S3). Arrays were normalized using MAS5 algorithm in the Affymetrix Expression Console. Probe sets absent in both diploid and aberrant hPSCs were filtered out by the MAS5 Absent/Present call. Probe sets with expression values below 100 were raised to this level. The karyotype of the analyzed cell lines was validated by virtual karyotyping. Lists of differentially expressed genes between diploid hPSCs and aneuploid hPSCs were derived by applying the following thresholds: minimal fold-change between diploid and aneuploid hPSCs, fold-change between diploid and T12-hPSCs < 0.8, fold-change between diploid and T17-hPSCs < 0.8. To detect significantly over-represented KEGG pathways, we subjected the lists of differentially expressed genes to the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/). To detect significantly over-represented transcription binding sites, we subjected the lists of differentially expressed genes to PRIMA analysis (http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/prima/).

https://openalex.org/W2202540184,"The use of intranasal oxytocin (OT) in research has become increasingly important over the past decade. Although researchers have acknowledged a need for further investigation of the physiological effects of intranasal administration, few studies have actually done so. In the present double-blind cross-over study we investigated the longevity of a single 24 IU dose of intranasal OT measured in saliva in 40 healthy adult males. Salivary OT concentrations were significantly higher in the OT condition, compared to placebo. This significant difference lasted until the end of testing, approximately 108 minutes after administration, and peaked at 30 minutes. Results showed significant individual differences in response to intranasal OT administration. To our knowledge this is the largest and first all-male within-subjects design study to demonstrate the impact of intranasal OT on salivary OT concentrations. The results are consistent with previous research in suggesting that salivary OT is a valid matrix for OT measurement. The results also suggest that the post-administration ‘wait-time’ prior to starting experimental tasks could be reduced to 30 minutes, from the 45 minutes typically used, thereby enabling testing during peak OT concentrations. Further research is needed to ascertain whether OT concentrations after intranasal administration follow similar patterns in females, and different age groups."
https://openalex.org/W2215575251,"School closure is considered as an effective measure to prevent pandemic influenza. Although Japan has implemented many class, grade, and whole school closures during the early stage of the pandemic 2009, the effectiveness of such a school closure has not been analysed appropriately. In addition, analysis based on evidence or data from a large population has yet to be performed. We evaluated the preventive effect of school closure against the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and examined efficient strategies of reactive school closure.Data included daily reports of reactive school closures and the number of infected students in the pandemic in Oita City, Japan. We used a regression model that incorporated a time delay to analyse the daily data of school closure based on a time continuous susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model of infectious disease spread. The delay was due to the time-lag from transmission to case reporting. We simulated the number of students infected daily with and without school closure and evaluated the effectiveness.The model with a 3-day delay from transmission to reporting yielded the best fit using R2 (the coefficient of determination). This result suggests that the recommended period of school closure is more than 4 days. Moreover, the effect of school closure in the simulation of school closure showed the following: the number of infected students decreased by about 24% at its peak, and the number of cumulative infected students decreased by about 8.0%.School closure was an effective intervention for mitigating the spread of influenza and should be implemented for more than 4 days. School closure has a remarkable impact on decreasing the number of infected students at the peak, but it does not substantially decrease the total number of infected students."
https://openalex.org/W2201066361,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. More than 70% of the deaths of TB patients occur during the first two months of TB treatment. The major risk factors that increase early death of TB patients are being positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), being of old age, being underweight or undergoing re-treatment. Objective To assess the time of reported deaths and associated factors in a cohort of patients with TB during TB treatment. Methods An institution-based retrospective cohort study was analyzed in Dangila Woreda, Northwest Ethiopia from March 1st through March 30, 2014. All TB patients registered in the direct observed treatment (DOTs) clinic from 2008–2012 were included in the study. Data were entered into EpiData and exported to SPSS for analysis. The survival probability was analyzed by the Kaplan Meier method and Cox regression analysis was applied to investigate factors associated with death during TB treatment. Results From a total of 872 cases registered in TB registry log book, 810 were used for the analysis of which 60 (7.4%) died during the treatment. The overall mortality rate was 12.8/1000 person months of observation. A majority of TB deaths 34 (56.7%) occurred during the intensive phase of the treatment, and the median time of death was at two months of the treatment. Age, HIV status and baseline body weight were independent predictors of death during TB treatment. Conclusions Most deaths occurred in the first two months of TB treatment. Old age, TB/HIV co-infection and a baseline body weight of <35 kg increased the mortality during TB treatment. Therefore, a special follow up of TB patients during the intensive phase, of older patients and of TB/HIV co-infected cases, as well as nutritionally supplementing for underweight patients may be important to consider as interventions to reduce deaths during TB treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2199271899,"Background Managing blood stream infection in Africa is hampered by lack of bacteriological support needed for antimicrobial stewardship, and background data needed for empirical treatment. A combined pro- and retrospective approach was used to overcome thresholds in clinical research in Africa. Methods Outcome and characteristics including age, HIV infection, pancytopenia and bacteriological results were studied in 292 adult patients with two or more SIRS criteria using univariate and confirming multivariate logistic regression models. Expected randomly distributed resistance covariation was compared with observed co-resistance among gram-negative enteric bacteria in 92 paediatric blood culture isolates that had been harvested in the same hospital during the same period of time. Results Mortality was fivefold increased among patients with positive blood culture results [50.0% vs. 9.8%; OR 11.24 (4.38–25.88), p < 0.0001], and for this group of patients mortality was significantly associated with antimicrobial resistance [OR 23.28 (3.3–164.4), p = 0.002]. All 11 patients with Enterobacteriaceae resistant to 3rd. generation cephalosporins died. Eighty-nine patients had pancytopenia grade 3–4. Among patients with negative blood culture results, mortality was significantly associated with pancytopenia [OR 3.12 (1.32–7.39), p = 0.01]. HIV positivity was not associated with increased mortality. Antimicrobial resistance that concerned gram-negative enteric bacteria, regardless of species, was characterized by co-resistance between third generation cephalosporins, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole. Conclusion Mortality was strongly associated with growth of bacteria resistant to empirical treatment, and these patients were dead or dying when bacteriological reports arrived. Because of co-resistance, alternative efficient antibiotics would not have been available in Ethiopia for 8/11 Enterobacteriaceae-infected patients with isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporins. Strong and significant resistance covariation between 3rd. generation cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and co-trimoxazole was identified. Pronounced pancytopenia was common and associated with increased mortality. HIV positive patients had no excess mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2202850844,"Oxidative stress is a pathological feature of many neurological disorders; therefore, utilizing proteins that are protective against such cellular insults is a potentially valuable therapeutic approach. Oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1) has been shown previously to be critical for oxidative stress resistance in neuronal cells; deletion of this gene causes neurodegeneration in mice, yet conversely, overexpression of OXR1 is protective in cellular and mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are unclear. OXR1 contains the Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC), lysin motif (LysM), domain catalytic (TLDc) domain, a motif present in a family of proteins including TBC1 domain family member 24 (TBC1D24), a protein mutated in a range of disorders characterized by seizures, hearing loss, and neurodegeneration. The TLDc domain is highly conserved across species, although the structure-function relationship is unknown. To understand the role of this domain in the stress response, we carried out systematic analysis of all mammalian TLDc domain-containing proteins, investigating their expression and neuroprotective properties in parallel. In addition, we performed a detailed structural and functional study of this domain in which we identified key residues required for its activity. Finally, we present a new mouse insertional mutant of Oxr1, confirming that specific disruption of the TLDc domain in vivo is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. Our data demonstrate that the integrity of the TLDc domain is essential for conferring neuroprotection, an important step in understanding the functional significance of all TLDc domain-containing proteins in the cellular stress response and disease. Oxidative stress is a pathological feature of many neurological disorders; therefore, utilizing proteins that are protective against such cellular insults is a potentially valuable therapeutic approach.

Significantly, oxidative stress is implicated in many progressive neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), yet the exact role of this process in neuronal cell death is still unclear (4Andersen J.K.

Given the importance of oxidative stress in many disease states, it has been suggested that proteins that counteract or reduce the levels of ROS in cells could be employed for therapeutic benefit (2Melo A. Monteiro L. Lima R.M. Oliveira D.M. Cerqueira M.D. El-Bachá R.S. Oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases: mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives.Oxid. Med.

The oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1) gene was originally identified in a screen conducted in Escherichia coli for genes that were able to protect cells against oxidative damage (7Volkert M.R.

We and others demonstrated subsequently that modulating the levels of OXR1 can influence the cellular response to oxidative stress (8Oliver P.L. Finelli M.J. Edwards B. Bitoun E. Butts D.L.

Lee S. Finelli M.J. Davies B. Davies K.E. Oliver P.L. Neuron-specific antioxidant OXR1 extends survival of a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Brain. 2015; 138: 1167-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as well as restore the cellular defects associated with familial ALS mutations (15Finelli M.J.

Genet. 2015; 24: 3529-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, the function of OXR1 remains unknown. It is noteworthy, however, that OXR1 contains a conserved protein motif of ∼200 amino acids named the TLDc domain (16Murphy K.C. Volkert M.R.

Copley R.R. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Systematic identification of novel protein domain families associated with nuclear functions.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Moreover, OXR1 is expressed as several isoforms that all contain this C-terminal region, and it has been shown that even the shortest of these isoforms functionally compensates for the full-length protein in vitro (8Oliver P.L. Finelli M.J. Edwards B. Bitoun E. Butts D.L. Becker E.B. Cheeseman M.T. Davies B. Davies K.E. Oxr1 is essential for protection against oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This suggests that it is the TLDc domain that plays a key role in oxidative stress resistance. In mammals the TLDc domain is also found in a family of proteins including nuclear receptor coactivator 7 (NCOA7), TBC1D24, KIAA1609 (also referred to as TLDC1), and C20ORF118 (or TLDC2) (19Durand M.

The OXR domain defines a conserved family of eukaryotic oxidation resistance proteins.BMC Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to studies on OXR1, TBC1D24 is associated with a range of severe human neurological disorders. An increasing series of compound heterozygous and homozygous TBC1D24 coding and frameshift mutations has been identified, including mutations in the TLDc domain itself, which cause diverse forms of epileptic syndromes including familial myoclonic epilepsy (20Poulat A.-L.

Initial functional studies of TBC1D24 have focused on the TBC domain, suggesting that mutant forms of the protein influence cortical maturation and migration via control of GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) activation (21Falace A.

Reduced synaptic vesicle protein degradation at lysosomes curbs TBC1D24/sky-induced neurodegeneration.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 207: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that OXR1 and TBC1D24 are important for normal brain function. NCOA7 is also expressed in the brain (32Shao W. Halachmi S. Brown M. ERPA140, a conserved tissue-specific nuclear receptor coactivator.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3358-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although nothing is known regarding its transcriptional role in the nervous system. To assist these studies, the three-dimensional structure of the TLDc domain has been solved (17Blaise M. Alsarraf H.M. Wong J.E. Midtgaard S.R. Laroche F. Schack L. Spaink H. Stougaard J. Thirup S. Crystal structure of the TLDc domain of oxidation resistance protein 2 from zebrafish.Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2012; 80: 1694-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, due in part to the lack of structural similarity to known protein folds, it remains unclear whether other TLDc proteins possess similar functional properties and how the TLDc domain contributes to essential cellular processes; indeed, there is no evidence that the TLDc domain imparts catalytic properties as originally predicted (18Doerks T. Copley R.R. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Systematic identification of novel protein domain families associated with nuclear functions.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). To, therefore, understand the functional significance of this domain, we carried out a structural-functional study of all mammalian TLDc proteins, demonstrating that they share a common protective role in neurons and identifying critical residues in the domain. Our data provide valuable new insight into the function of TLDc domain-containing proteins in the neuronal stress response. Regions representing all isoforms of Oxr1 (2723–3139 bp of NCBI accession number NM_130885), Ncoa7 (2650–3284 bp of NM_172495), Tbc1d24 (2705–3558 bp of NM_001163847), Kiaa1609 (1337–1959 bp of NM_028883), and C20Orf118 (231–620 bp of NM_001177439) were amplified by RT-PCR or PCR and cloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen). Riboprobe synthesis and slide hybridization was carried out as previously described (33Chodroff R.A. Goodstadt L. Sirey T.M. Oliver P.L. Davies K.E. Green E.D. Molnár Z. Ponting C.P. Long noncoding RNA genes: conservation of sequence and brain expression among diverse amniotes.Genome Biol. 2010; 11: R72Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). All slides shown were developed for 16 h. Total RNA was extracted from Neuro 2a (N2a) cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and reversed-transcribed (ThermoScientific). Subsequent qRT-PCR was performed in an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and primers shown in Table 1. The housekeeping gene Gapdh was used as an internal normalizing control, and the ΔΔCt method was used to calculate the level of mRNA -fold changes, or the mean Ct value of each TLDc gene was compared with the mean Ct value for C20Orf118.TABLE 1List of primers used for qRT-PCRPrimerSequence 5′–3′Gapdh FAGAACATCATCCCTGCATCCGapdh RCACATTGGGGGTAGGAACAOxr1FL FCAGTCGTGACTGGACAGGTTTOxr1FL RATGGGCTACATCTGGAGTCGOxr1 C FCCATAAATACACTCTGGTAGTGTCGOxr1 C RTTTGGTCGGAAAGATTCAGGNcoa7 FL FTGTCGCTACTTCACTGATGGNcoa7 FL RGCGTCTTTGATCTTCATGTGNcoa7 B FGCCCCTGGACATTCAGATTNcoa7 B RCTGTGGGGCTGTAGGATAGGTbc1d24 FAATGGCCAATGAGAAAGCATbc1d24 RAGGGATCCAGGACCAAATGKiaa1609 FGCAGGCTGAGGTAGACAAGKiaa1609 RCCCTCTGCATGCCGTTATACC20Orf118 FTCAGCTTACAGAAGCTAGCCC20Orf118 RCTGTCCATCCTGATCTCTGA Open table in a new tab Alignments were produced with T-Coffee (34Notredame C.

Sequences were named with their Uniprot identifiers. The corresponding secondary structures were acquired from the zebrafish OXR2-TLDc domain structure (PDB ID 4ACJ) (17Blaise M. Alsarraf H.M.

The amino acid evolutionary conservation was based on alignment BLOSUM62 scores. Full-length cDNAs representing mouse Ncoa7, Tbc1d24, Kiaa1609, and C20Orf118 (accession numbers as above) and short isoform Ncoa7-B were cloned into a pcDNA3 vector with an HA tag in-frame at the C-terminus. Oxr1-FL and Oxr1-C have been described previously (8Oliver P.L. Finelli M.J. Edwards B. Bitoun E. Butts D.L. Becker E.B. Cheeseman M.T. Davies B. Davies K.E. Oxr1 is essential for protection against oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For Ncoa7, Tbc1d24, and Kiaa1609 knockdown experiments, shRNA constructs were purchased from Sigma (NM_172495.5–2897s21c1, NM_173186.2–1208s1c1, and NM_028883.2–256s1c1, respectively). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the various mutations into the pcDNA3 constructs above as per the manufacturer's protocol (Agilent Technologies) and confirmed by sequencing. Neuronal N2a cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with glutamax (Gibco), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), and 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco). Cells were transfected with either FuGENE 6 (Promega) for 48 h (for shRNA experiments and overexpression for lipid peroxidation and S-nitrosylation assays) or Magnetofection (OZBiosciences) for 24 h (for all other overexpression experiments) as per the manufacturers' protocol. Cells were treated with arsenite (50 μm for 5 h to quantify ROS, 50 μm for 4 h lipid peroxidation and S-nitrosylated assays, or 150 μm for 4 h to quantify cell death) in water or with water-only as a control. To visualize pyknotic nuclei, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed with PBS twice, blocked with blocking buffer (5% goat serum, 0.5% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature, and mounted in DAPI medium (Vectorlabs). Cells were visualized using a fluorescent microscope (Leica), and those with typical condensed and fragmented nuclei were counted as pyknotic cells. Anti-HA immunostaining was carried out as previously described (15Finelli M.J. Liu K.X. Wu Y. Oliver P.L. Davies K.E. Oxr1 improves pathogenic cellular features of ALS-associated FUS and TDP-43 mutations.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24: 3529-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cortical cells from wild-type P1 pups were prepared and cultured as previously described (37Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Isolation and culture of adult neurons and neurospheres.Nat. Protocols. 2007; 2: 1490-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices were dissected in cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (Gibco), and meninges and hippocampi were removed and trypsinized for 15 min at 37 °C. Trypsin was inactivated using trypsin inhibitor (Life Technologies) for 5 min, and cortices were triturated and purified on an OptiPrep gradient following Brewer and Torricelli (37Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Isolation and culture of adult neurons and neurospheres.Nat. Protocols. 2007; 2: 1490-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in culture medium (Neurobasal phenol-free, 5% FCS, 2% B27, 0.5 mm l-glutamine, Gibco) and cultured for 5 days before treating with vehicle or arsenite (0.5 μm for 2 h). Cells were cultured in 96-well plates as described above. Cells were treated for 5 h with arsenite (50 μm) or vehicle supplemented with dihydroethidium (Sigma) diluted in culture medium (15 μm). After experimental treatment, cells were washed twice in PBS, wells were filled with 100 μl PBS, and the fluorescence was immediately measured on a Fluostar Omega (BMG Labtech) plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 430 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. N2a cells were transfected for 48 h and treated with 50 μm arsenite for 4 h before the levels of lipid peroxidation were quantified using a lipid peroxidation assay as per the manufacturer's protocol (Abcam). Briefly, one confluent 63-cm2 dish was used per condition, and cells were washed with cold PBS, homogenized by sonication in the lysis buffer provided, and clarified by centrifugation. Three volumes of thiobarbituric acid were added to the samples and incubated for 1 h at 95 °C. Samples containing a known concentration of malondialdehyde were processed in parallel and used to generate a standard curve. Samples were transferred to a transparent 96-well plate, and absorbance was read in duplicate at 532 nm on a FluostarOmega (BMG Labtech) plate reader. N2a cells were transfected for 48 h on coverslips and treated with 50 μm arsenite for 4 h, and the levels of S-nitrosylated proteins were assessed by using a S-NO protein detection kit (Cayman). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and subsequently washed and blocked using buffers provided following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were incubated with reducing and labeling reagents for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation for an additional hour with fluorescein detection reagent. Cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Leica). All images were captured using Axiovision software. The signal intensity of each cell was measured using ImageJ software and expressed as the mean gray value divided by the surface of the cell. Approximately 40 cells were assessed per condition. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was carried out on fresh frozen brain sections as recommended by the manufacturer (In situ cell death kit, Roche Applied Science). For quantification, four 12 μm sections at 60 μm intervals across the midline of the cerebellum were counted for TUNEL-positive cells per replicate. β-Galactosidase staining was also carried out on fresh frozen brain sections as previously described (38West D.B.

Protein extracts were prepared from cells using standard radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and protein levels were quantified using BCA assays (Millipore). Proteins were run on pre-cast NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies) and transferred as per the manufacturer's protocol. Primary antibodies used were as follows: Ncoa7 (Abcam ab103993), Oxr1 (antiserum as previously described (8Oliver P.L. Finelli M.J. Edwards B. Bitoun E. Butts D.L. Becker E.B. Cheeseman M.T.

All experiments were conducted in adherence to the guidelines set forth by the UK Home Office regulations and with the approval of the University of Oxford Ethical Review Panel. The Oxr1 “knock-out first” allele (Oxr1tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi) was generated as part of the International Knock-out Mouse Consortium (IKMC) program (IKMC project 84243).

https://openalex.org/W2207711208,"Rev-erbα and Rev-erbβ are heme-binding nuclear receptors (NR) that repress the transcription of genes involved in regulating metabolism, inflammation, and the circadian clock. Previous gene expression and co-immunoprecipitation studies led to a model in which heme binding to Rev-erbα recruits nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) into an active repressor complex. However, in contradiction, biochemical and crystallographic studies have shown that heme decreases the affinity of the ligand-binding domain of Rev-erb NRs for NCoR1 peptides. One explanation for this discrepancy is that the ligand-binding domain and NCoR1 peptides used for in vitro studies cannot replicate the key features of the full-length proteins used in cellular studies. However, the combined in vitro and cellular results described here demonstrate that heme does not directly promote interactions between full-length Rev-erbβ (FLRev-erbβ) and an NCoR1 construct encompassing all three NR interaction domains. NCoR1 tightly binds both apo- and heme-replete FLRev-erbβ·DNA complexes; furthermore, heme, at high concentrations, destabilizes the FLRev-erbβ·NCoR1 complex. The interaction between FLRev-erbβ and NCoR1 as well as Rev-erbβ repression at the Bmal1 promoter appear to be modulated by another cellular factor(s), at least one of which is related to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Our studies suggest that heme is involved in regulating the degradation of Rev-erbβ in a manner consistent with its role in circadian rhythm maintenance. Finally, the very slow rate constant (10−6 s−1) of heme dissociation from Rev-erbβ rules out a prior proposal that Rev-erbβ acts as an intracellular heme sensor."
https://openalex.org/W2215863350,"Bacterial ghosts (BGs) are empty cell envelopes derived from Gram-negative bacteria. They not only represent a potential platform for development of novel vaccines but also provide a tool for efficient adjuvant and antigen delivery system. In the present study, we investigated the interaction between BGs of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and bovine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). MoDCs are highly potent antigen-presenting cells and have the potential to act as a powerful tool for manipulating the immune system. We generated bovine MoDCs in vitro from blood monocytes using E. coli expressed bovine GM-CSF and IL-4 cytokines. These MoDCs displayed typical morphology and functions similar to DCs. We further investigated the E. coli BGs to induce maturation of bovine MoDCs in comparison to E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We observed the maturation marker molecules such as MHC-II, CD80 and CD86 were induced early and at higher levels in BG stimulated MoDCs as compared to the LPS stimulated MoDCs. BG mediated stimulation induced significantly higher levels of cytokine expression in bovine MoDCs than LPS. Both pro-inflammatory (IL-12 and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines were induced in MoDCs after BGs stimulation. We further analysed the effects of BGs on the bovine MoDCs in an allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). We found the BG-treated bovine MoDCs had significantly (p<0.05) higher capacity to stimulate allogenic T cell proliferation in MLR as compared to the LPS. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the E. coli BGs induce a strong activation and maturation of bovine MoDCs."
https://openalex.org/W2277206534,"Background The Xpert® MTB/RIF (Xpert) is an automated molecular test for simultaneous detection of tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance, recommended by the World Health Organization as the preferred diagnostic method for individuals presumed to have multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) or HIV-associated TB. We describe the performance of Xpert and key lessons learned during two years of implementation under routine conditions in 33 projects located in 18 countries supported by Médecins Sans Frontières across varied geographic, epidemiological and clinical settings. Methods Xpert was used following three strategies: the first being as the initial test, with microscopy in parallel, for all presumptive TB cases; the second being only for patients at risk of MDR-TB, or with HIV- associated TB, or presumptive paediatric TB; and the third being as the initial test for these high-risk patients plus as an add-on test to microscopy in others. Routine laboratory data were collected, using laboratory registers. Qualitative data such as logistic aspects, human resources, and tool acceptance were collected using a questionnaire. Findings In total, 52,863 samples underwent Xpert testing from April 2011 to December 2012. The average MTB detection rate was 18.5%, 22.3%, and 11.6% for the three different strategies respectively. Analysis of the results on samples tested in parallel showed that using Xpert as add-on test to microscopy would have increased laboratory TB confirmation by 49.7%, versus 42.3% for Xpert replacing microscopy. The main limitation of the test was the high rate of inconclusive results, which correlated with factors such as defective modules, cartridge version (G3 vs. G4) and staff experience. Operational and logistical hurdles included infrastructure renovation, basic computer training, regular instrument troubleshooting and maintenance, all of which required substantial and continuous support. Conclusion The implementation of Xpert was feasible and significantly increased TB detection compared to microscopy, despite the high rate of inconclusive results. Xpert implementation was accompanied by considerable operational and logistical challenges. To further decentralize diagnosis, simpler, low-cost TB technologies well-suited to low-resource settings are still urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2199980832,"Objectives The aims of this study were to test the utility of benchtop NGS platforms for NIPT for trisomy 21 using previously published z score calculation methods and to optimize the sample preparation and data analysis with use of in silico and physical size selection methods. Methods Samples from 130 pregnant women were analyzed by whole genome sequencing on benchtop NGS systems Ion Torrent PGM and MiSeq. The targeted yield of 3 million raw reads on each platform was used for z score calculation. The impact of in silico and physical size selection on analytical performance of the test was studied. Results Using a z score value of 3 as the cut-off, 98.11% - 100% (104-106/106) specificity and 100% (24/24) sensitivity and 99.06% - 100% (105-106/106) specificity and 100% (24/24) sensitivity were observed for Ion Torrent PGM and MiSeq, respectively. After in silico based size selection both platforms reached 100% specificity and sensitivity. Following the physical size selection z scores of tested trisomic samples increased significantly—p = 0.0141 and p = 0.025 for Ion Torrent PGM and MiSeq, respectively. Conclusions Noninvasive prenatal testing for chromosome 21 trisomy with the utilization of benchtop NGS systems led to results equivalent to previously published studies performed on high-to-ultrahigh throughput NGS systems. The in silico size selection led to higher specificity of the test. Physical size selection performed on isolated DNA led to significant increase in z scores. The observed results could represent a basis for increasing of cost effectiveness of the test and thus help with its penetration worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2208971151,"Development of synthetic strategies to combat Staphylococcal infections, especially those caused by methicillin resistant Staphyloccus aureus (MRSA), needs immediate attention. In this manuscript we report the ability of aryl-alkyl-lysines, simple membrane active small molecules, to treat infections caused by planktonic cells, persister cells and biofilms of MRSA. A representative compound, NCK-10, did not induce development of resistance in planktonic cells in multiple passages and retained activity in varying environments of pH and salinity. At low concentrations the compound was able to depolarize and permeabilize the membranes of S. aureus persister cells rapidly. Treatment with the compound not only eradicated pre-formed MRSA biofilms, but also brought down viable counts in bacterial biofilms. In a murine model of MRSA skin infection, the compound was more effective than fusidic acid in bringing down the bacterial burden. Overall, this class of molecules bears potential as antibacterial agents against skin-infections."
https://openalex.org/W2202196513,"Positive psychological constructs have been given increasing attention in research on the coping resources of cancer-related distresses. However, little research is available on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with hematological malignancies. The purposes of this study were to assess the prevalence of PTSD symptoms and to explore the associations of perceived social support (PSS), hope, optimism and resilience with PTSD symptoms among Chinese patients with hematological malignancies.A cross-sectional study was conducted during the period from July 2013 through April 2014. A total of 225 inpatients with hematological malignancies, which were eligible for the study, completed the Post-traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian Version, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Adult Hope Scale, Life Orientation Scale-Revised, and Resilience Scale. Hierarchical regression analysis was performed to explore the correlates of PTSD symptoms.Overall, the prevalence of PTSD symptoms was 10.7%. Initially, PSS was negatively associated with PTSD symptoms (β = -0.248, P < 0.01). However, when positive psychological variables were added, optimism was negatively associated with PTSD symptoms (β = -0.452, P < 0.01), and gender had a significant effect on PTSD symptoms. Women were more vulnerable to these symptoms than men (β = 0.123, P < 0.05). When the analysis was performed separately by gender, only optimism showed a significantly negative association with PTSD symptoms in both men (β = -0.389, P < 0.01) and women (β = -0.493, P < 0.01).Some patients with hematological malignancies suffer from PTSD symptoms. The positive effects of PSS and optimism on PTSD symptoms suggest that an integrated approach to psychosocial intervention from both external and internal perspectives could have practical significance. Gender difference should be considered in developing potential interventions in reducing cancer-related PTSD symptoms."

Upon stimulation with receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), myeloid precursors commit to becoming polyploid, largely via cell fusion.

Polyploidy, in which a cell has more than the diploid complement of chromosomes, is a widespread physiological phenomenon observed especially in plants, fungi, and insects (1Otto S.P. The evolutionary consequences of polyploidy.Cell. 2007; 131: 452-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Although it is less common in mammals, polyploidization occurs in selected tissues, including the placenta, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and bone marrow during normal development and aging (2Pandit S.K.

During developmental programs, cells obtain additional sets of chromosomes by various mechanisms, including endocycles, endomitosis, incomplete cytokinesis, and cell fusion. In endocycles and endomitosis, the cell undergoes successive rounds of DNA replication without intervening mitosis or karyokinesis (abort mitosis during metaphase). These cycles do not produce two nuclei in the cell. The best-studied examples of endocycles and endomitosis are trophoblast giant cells and megakaryocytes, respectively (3Sakaue-Sawano A. Hoshida T.

In incomplete cytokinesis, the cell undergoes karyokinesis but skips cytokinesis, resulting in a cell with two nuclei; this process has been implicated in the normal development of hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes (7Gentric G.

Endocycles, endomitosis, and incomplete cytokinesis are directly associated with the proliferative state of the cell. By contrast, cell fusion is entirely independent of cell proliferation (10Srinivas B.P. Woo J. Leong W.Y. Roy S. A conserved molecular pathway mediates myoblast fusion in insects and vertebrates.Nat.

These cells are hematopoietic in origin and are derived from myeloid precursors that also give rise to macrophages and dendritic cells. When myeloid precursors receive signals mediated by the osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL, 3The abbreviations used are: RANKLreceptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligandMGCmultinucleated giant cellBMMbone marrow-derived macrophagedTgdouble-transgenic7-AAD7-aminoactinomycinBPband path filtermAGmonomeric Azami Green. which is mainly produced by osteoblasts, they commit to becoming pre-osteoclasts and ultimately differentiate into multinucleated osteoclasts (12Walsh M.C.

Although generation of polyploid osteoclasts is thought to occur due to cell fusion, independently of cell proliferation (14Oren-Suissa M. Podbilewicz B. Cell fusion during development.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), some researchers have pointed out a relationship between cell proliferation and osteoclast differentiation. For example, in osteoclast progenitors, progression and subsequent withdrawal from the cell cycle are required for differentiation into osteoclasts (15Mizoguchi T. Muto A. Udagawa N. Arai A.

These reports prompted us to investigate whether cell cycle progression has an impact on polyploidization during osteoclastogenesis and, if so, how and to what extent the cell cycle regulates the polyploidization of osteoclasts. The fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci) is a powerful tool for studying coordination of the cell cycle with other developmental processes (19Aiba Y. Kometani K. Hamadate M.

Visualization of cell cycle in mouse embryos with Fucci2 reporter directed by Rosa26 promoter.Development. 2013; 140: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The Fucci probe was generated by fusing red fluorescent protein and green fluorescent protein to human Cdt1 and human geminin, respectively. These two chimeric proteins accumulate reciprocally in the nuclei during the cell cycle, labeling the nuclei of cells in G0/G1 phase red and those in S/G2/M phase green. Thus, these proteins function as effective G0/G1 and S/G2/M markers. Here, using monocytes derived from Fucci transgenic mice, we show that RANKL-induced polyploidization occurs not only by cell fusion but also by incomplete cytokinesis. In these cells, RANKL stimulation transiently increased basal proliferation and induced incomplete cytokinesis as well as cell fusion. Also, cells that underwent incomplete cytokinesis had the potential to undergo cell fusion. In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that some of osteoclasts exhibited nuclear polyploidy (i.e. they contained nuclei with more than the diploid complement of chromosomes (>2N)) in vivo, suggesting that cells that undergo incomplete cytokinesis are involved in physiological polyploidization of osteoclasts. Furthermore, RANKL stimulation induced phosphorylation of Akt, which is required for efficient polyploidization by either incomplete cytokinesis or cell fusion. Collectively, our findings reveal an unexpected pattern of cell division and fusion during the generation of polyploid osteoclasts. Fucci transgenic mouse lines FucciS/G2/M-#474 and FucciG1-#639 were obtained from the RIKEN BioResource Center. These lines were cross-bred to obtain Fucci double-transgenic mice. The generation of TRAP promoter-tdTomato transgenic mice and V-type H+-ATPase a3 subunit-GFP fusion protein expressing mice (a3-GFP) were described previously (23Kikuta J. Wada Y. Kowada T. Wang Z.

All animal work was performed under veterinary supervision in an accredited facility using protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania and Osaka University. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from wild type (WT) or Fucci double-transgenic (dTg) mice were obtained from cultures of bone marrow collected from 6- to 8-week-old male tibias and femurs, as described previously. In brief, bone marrow progenitor cells were cultured with M-CSF (60 ng/ml) in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS. After 3–4 days, cells were gathered as BMMs. For osteoclast differentiation, BMMs were cultured for 3 days in α-minimal essential medium containing M-CSF (60 ng/ml) and RANKL (150 ng/ml). After culture for 3 days, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then stained for TRAP using the acid phosphatase, leukocyte (TRAP) kit (Sigma). TRAP-positive multinucleated cells containing three or more nuclei were counted. For differentiation of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), BMMs derived from wild type mice were cultured in the presence of IL-3 (100 ng/ml) (R&D Systems) and IL-4 (100 ng/ml) (PeproTech) for 2 days. MGCs were stained with May-Grunewald Giemsa stain (Life Technologies, Inc.). For inhibitor assays, BMMs were cultured with M-CSF (60 ng/ml) and RANKL (150 ng/ml) or with IL-4 (100 ng/ml) plus IL-3 (100 ng/ml) in the presence of Y27632 (10 μm) (Wako), Akt inhibitor VIII (5 μm) (Sigma), SN50 (50 μg/ml) (BioVision), LY294003 (5 μm) (Wako), aphidicolin (500 nm) (Sigma), or DMSO for 72 h. Wild Type-BMMs were cultured with M-CSF (60 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of RANKL (150 ng/ml) or cultured with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) plus IL-3 (100 ng/ml) for the indicated amount of time (in hours). BrdU (10 μm) were added to the culture for the last 6 h. After culture, cells were washed with PBS and detached using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Millipore) at 37 °C for 5 min. After generation of single-cell suspensions, cells were counted and suspended at 1 × 106/ml in PBS in polystyrene tubes. The cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Aqua (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min on ice to exclude dead cells. Cells were washed with PBS with 2% FCS and fixed with BrdU fixation buffer (eBioscience) for 1 h on ice followed by DNase treatment. Cells were stained with FITC-labeled anti-BrdU antibody (clone Bu20a, eBioscience) for 20 min, and after washing, cells were further stained with 7-AAD. Finally, the cells were analyzed using a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). Numbers indicate the percentages of S phase cells. Results are representative of three independent experiments. dTg-BMMs stimulated with RANKL for the indicated times in the presence of M-CSF were washed with PBS and detached using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Millipore) at 37 °C for 5 min. After generation of single-cell suspensions, cells were counted and suspended at 1 × 106/ml in phenol red-free α-minimal essential medium containing 2% FCS and 2 mm EDTA in polystyrene tubes. Then the cells were stained with 5 μm Vybrant DyeCycle Violet (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 60 min. Finally, the cells were stained with TO-PRO-3 (Life Technologies, Inc.) to exclude dead cells and analyzed using an LSR (BD Biosciences). Excitation laser lines and emission filters were as follows: Vybrant DyeCycle Violet: excitation, 405-nm laser line, and emission, 450/50 BP; mAG: excitation, 488-nm laser line, and emission, 515/20 BP;mKO2: excitation, 532-nm laser line, and emission, 585/42 BP; TO-PRO-3: excitation, 640-nm laser line, and emission, 660/20 BP. Data were analyzed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star). dTg-BMMs cultured in a glass-bottom dish were stimulated with RANKL (150 ng/ml) in the presence of M-CSF (60 ng/ml) or stimulated with IL-4 (100 ng/ml) and IL-3 (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times, and then subjected to time lapse imaging. Cell-tracking experiments were performed using a Deltavision microscope (Applied Precision) from an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with a ×20 or ×40 objective, 300-watt xenon lamp, and a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ 12-bit monochrome-cooled CCD camera. A series of images was collected every 5 min at 37 °C. To acquire large square fields of view, multipoint time-lapse imaging was performed. Image acquisition and processing were performed using the Deltavision SoftWorx software (Applied Precision), and image analysis was performed using the Fiji software (National Institutes of Health). Cells were manually tracked. Mononucleated cell fusion was counted as “cell fusion.” Mononucleated or binucleated cells that went through cell fusion following incomplete cytokinesis, or daughter cells of a binucleated cell that underwent cell fusion, were counted as “cell fusion involving incomplete cytokinesis.” Doubling times of cytokinesis/incomplete cytokinesis were assessed using a Nikon BioStation IMQ imaging system, and image analysis was performed using the Imaris software (Bitplane). The time from the end of cytokinesis/incomplete cytokinesis to the next end of cytokinesis/incomplete cytokinesis was measured as the doubling time. Final graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). dTg-BMMs cultured with M-CSF (60 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of RANKL (150 ng/ml) for 48 h were washed with PBS and detached using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Millipore) at 37 °C for 5 min. After generation of single-cell suspensions, cells were counted and suspended at 1 × 106/ml in PBS in polystyrene tubes. Cells were stained with 1 μm LIVE/DEAD NearIR (Life Technologies, Inc.) on ice for 30 min to exclude dead cells, washed with PBS with 2% FCS, and stained with allophycocyanin-labeled antibodies against integrin β3 or F4/80 (integrin β3, clone 2C9.G3; F4/80, clone MB8 (eBioscience)) on ice for 30 min. After washing, cells were further stained with 5 μm Vybrant DyeCycle Violet (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 60 min. A Fucci transgenic mouse line FucciG1-#610 obtained from the RIKEN BioResource Center and a3-GFP mice line were cross-bred to obtain Fucci-mKO2 and a3-GFP expressing mice (Fucci-mKO2/a3-GFP). BMMs were prepared from Fucci-mKO2/a3-GFP mice and cultured with M-CSF (60 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of RANKL (150 ng/ml) for the indicated times. After generation of single-cell suspensions, cells were stained with 5 μm Vybrant DyeCycle Violet (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 60 min. Finally, the cells were stained with TO-PRO-3 (Life Technologies, Inc.) to exclude dead cells. Peripheral blood cells or bone marrow cells of Fucci-mAG transgenic mice were stained with allophycocyanin-labeled antibodies against Ly6C (clone HK1.4 (eBioscience)) on ice for 30 min. After washing, cells were further stained with 5 μm Vybrant DyeCycle Violet (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 60 min. Finally, the cells were stained with 7-AAD (eBioscience) to exclude dead cells. Cells were analyzed using LSR (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) gelatin-coated glass bottom dishes were prepared as described previously (24Yamaguchi H. Yoshida S. Muroi E. Yoshida N. Kawamura M. Kouchi Z. Nakamura Y. Sakai R. Fukami K. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway mediated by p110α regulates invadopodia formation.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 1275-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). dTg-BMMs were cultured on the FITC gelatin-coated dishes for 24 h with M-CSF (60 ng/ml) and RANKL (150 ng/ml) and then subjected to time-lapse imaging using a confocal A1 microscope system (Nikon). A series of images was collected every 30 min at 37 °C. Image analysis was performed using NIS-elements software (Nikon). TRAP promoter-tdTomato transgenic mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde plus sucrose for fixation, and bone tissues were further fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde plus sucrose for 3 h at 4 °C. Next, the bones were incubated with 10% EDTA for 2 weeks for decalcification and embedded in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek). Sections 5 μm thick were prepared using Kawamoto's film method and treated with pepsin, and then FISH probe mixture was added. The sections were denatured at 90 °C for 10 min and then kept overnight at 37 °C for hybridization. After hybridization, the sections were washed with 5% formamide, 2× SSC for 20 min at 37 °C, and then 1× SSC for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, the sections were stained with DAPI, and images were acquired using the Leica CW-4000 system (Leica) with a ×100 objective. After treatment of cells with the indicated cytokines or inhibitors for the indicated times, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped from the plastic plate with a cell lifter (Costar), and then whole-cell lysates were isolated in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and PhosSTOP (Roche Applied Science). Equivalent amounts of protein (20–40 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed using antibodies specific for phospho-Akt (Ser-473), Akt, phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182), p38, phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr-202/Tyr-204), ERK1/2, JNK (Cell Signaling), and phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) (BD Biosciences). For RhoA activation assay, cell lysates were incubated with Rhotekin-RBD protein beads and blotted with anti-RhoA mAb (Cytoskeleton). Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance or unpaired t test with Welch's correction and are presented as means ± S.D. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. To determine the impact of RANKL stimulation on the cell cycle during osteoclast development, we first examined the proportions of cells in the G1 and S/G2/M phases during RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. Fucci double-transgenic mouse-derived bone marrow monocytes (dTg-BMMs) were stimulated with or without RANKL in the presence of M-CSF, and the proportions of the cells positive for green fluorescence (S/G2/M phase) and red fluorescence (G1 phase) were measured by flow cytometry. The proportion of green cells increased 24 h after RANKL stimulation, but this increase disappeared 48 h after stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). M-CSF alone did not significantly influence the proportion of green or red cells during this period (Fig. 1, A and B). These results suggested that RANKL stimulation transiently promotes cell cycle progression. The increase in cell cycle progression was confirmed by BrdU incorporation assay (Fig. 1C). Using time-lapse imaging, we measured the doubling time of dTg-BMMs cultured with M-CSF in the presence or absence of RANKL for 48 h. RANKL significantly reduced doubling time in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D), along with increasing formation of multinucleated osteoclasts (Fig. 1E). These results support the idea that RANKL stimulation increases the basal proliferation of dTg-BMMs. We next performed ploidy analysis during osteoclast formation. dTg-BMMs were stimulated with RANKL for the indicated times in the presence of M-CSF, and ploidy was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2). As expected, stimulation with RANKL induced generation of polyploid cells (red fluorescence-positive 4C, 6C, 8C, and >10C) (Fig. 2). Among these polyploid cells, 4C and 8C cells were detected first after RANKL stimulation for 24 h (Fig. 2). By contrast, 6C cells were not detected until 48 h after the onset of RANKL stimulation, and 6C cells were less common than 8C cells (Fig. 2 and Table 1).TABLE 1Percentage of diploid and polyploid cells among mKO2+ cells2C4C6C8C>10CMonocytes98.321.00Monocytes97.931.200.03Monocytes94.253.89Monocytes92.425.360.040.08Monocytes93.394.110.090.09OC (day2)84.7712.940.250.490.02OC (day2)83.1713.040.170.73OC (day2)77.2716.020.661.27OC (day3)77.9213.101.321.471.61OC (day3)81.8113.800.591.13 Open table in a new tab To examine how these polyploid cells were generated, we performed time-lapse imaging. In these experiments, dTg-BMMs were stimulated by RANKL for various times (1–16 h) in the presence of M-CSF, and then cell cycle progression and polyploidization were observed by time-lapse imaging. Regardless of the period of RANKL stimulation, almost all cells were mononucleated at the beginning of imaging. No cell fusion was observed within 24 h, but fusion was observed at and after 36 h of RANKL stimulation (average time of the beginning of fusion was 50.5 ± 5.63 h; Fig. 3A). The majority of cells that went through cell fusion were red fluorescence-positive mononucleated cells (Fig. 3B and Table 2), and the resultant fused cells rarely went through mitosis (Table 2). Instead, they continued to undergo cell fusion, and finally became large multinucleated osteoclast-like cells with red nuclei. These observations suggested that 4C and 8C cells detected after 24 h of RANKL stimulation were not fusion products. Unexpectedly, incomplete cytokinesis was observed during this period (Fig. 4A and supplemental Movie 1). The incomplete cytokinesis resulted in formation of 4C binucleated cells (Fig. 4A). Some of these cells re-entered mitosis but failed to complete cytokinesis, resulting in formation of binucleated 8C cells (Fig. 4A). Consistent with this, after RANKL stimulation for 24 h, flow cytometric analysis detected S/G2/M phase cells between the 4C and 8C peaks (Fig. 2), consistent with the observation that some of the tetraploid cells re-entered the cell cycle. Together, these observations suggested that 4C and 8C cells detected at 24 h after RANKL stimulation resulted from incomplete cytokinesis.TABLE 2Fusion summary of osteoclastsFusion combinationEventmKO2 (DN) × mKO2 (DN)mKO2 (DN) × mAGmAG × mAGTotal no.

The advantages and disadvantages of being polyploid.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 836-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar), we speculated that cells that undergo incomplete cytokinesis might merely be abnormal, rather than critical intermediates in the formation of mature osteoclasts. To address this issue, we continued time-lapse imaging to trace the fates of cells that underwent incomplete cytokinesis. Cell-tracking analysis revealed that binucleated cells generated by incomplete cytokinesis could undergo cell fusion (Fig. 5A and supplemental Movie 2). Indeed, 11% of fused cells had previously undergone incomplete cytokinesis (Table 2). These results indicated that such cells had the potential to undergo cell fusion during RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. Some of the binucleated cells generated by incomplete cytokinesis ultimately succeeded in undergoing cytokinesis and formed mononucleated polyploid cells (Fig. 4B and supplemental Movie 3). These mononucleated polyploid cells also had the potential to undergo cell fusion (Fig. 5B and supplemental Movie 4). Notably, ∼50% of 4C cells sorted from dTg-BMMs cultured with RANKL for 66 h were mononucleated. 4N. Takegahara and Y. Choi, unpublished observations. These observations strongly suggested that mononucleated cells involved in cell fusion consisted of both 2C and polyploid cells. During time-lapse imaging, target cells often migrated away from the field of view. In this case, the fate of the target cells could not be traced, and consequently those cells were uncounted."

Here, we investigated whether inhibition of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) could counteract the disturbed substrate metabolism of late-stage heart failure. The heart failure-like substrate metabolism was reproduced in a novel transgenic model of myocardium-specific expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), the major palmitate-synthesizing enzyme. The increased fatty acid utilization of FASN transgenic neonatal cardiomyocytes rapidly switched to a heart failure phenotype in an adult-like lipogenic milieu. Similarly, adult FASN transgenic mice developed signs of heart failure. The development of disturbed substrate utilization of FASN transgenic cardiomyocytes and signs of heart failure were retarded by the transgenic expression of GRKInh, a peptide inhibitor of GRK2. Cardioprotective GRK2 inhibition required an intact ERK axis, which blunted the induction of cardiotoxic transcripts, in part by enhanced serine 273 phosphorylation of Pparg (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ). Conversely, the dual-specific GRK2 and ERK cascade inhibitor, RKIP (Raf kinase inhibitor protein), triggered dysfunctional cardiomyocyte energetics and the expression of heart failure-promoting Pparg-regulated genes.

https://openalex.org/W2202120377,"Cannabinoid CB1 receptors peripherally modulate energy metabolism. Here, we investigated the role of CB1 receptors in the expression of glucose/pyruvate/tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism in rat abdominal muscle. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), a flavoprotein component (E3) of α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes with diaphorase activity in mitochondria, was specifically analyzed. After assessing the effectiveness of the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (3 mg kg-1, 14 days) on food intake and body weight, we could identified seven key enzymes from either glycolytic pathway or TCA cycle—regulated by both diet and CB1 receptor activity—through comprehensive proteomic approaches involving two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/LC-ESI trap mass spectrometry. These enzymes were glucose 6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), enolase (Eno3), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHa), glyoxalase-1 (Glo1) and the mitochondrial DLD, whose expressions were modified by AM251 in hypercaloric diet-induced obesity. Specifically, AM251 blocked high-carbohydrate diet (HCD)-induced expression of GPI, TPI, Eno3 and LDHa, suggesting a down-regulation of glucose/pyruvate/lactate pathways under glucose availability. AM251 reversed the HCD-inhibited expression of Glo1 and DLD in the muscle, and the DLD and CB1 receptor expression in the mitochondrial fraction. Interestingly, we identified the presence of CB1 receptors at the membrane of striate muscle mitochondria. DLD over-expression was confirmed in muscle of CB1-/- mice. AM251 increased the pyruvate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase activity in C2C12 myotubes, and the diaphorase/oxidative activity in the mitochondria fraction. These results indicated an up-regulation of methylglyoxal and TCA cycle activity. Findings suggest that CB1 receptors in muscle modulate glucose/pyruvate/lactate pathways and mitochondrial oxidative activity by targeting DLD."
https://openalex.org/W2209588939,"Gene delivery into hCD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) using human immunodeficiency virus, type 1-derived lentiviral vectors (LVs) has several promising therapeutic applications. Numerous clinical trials are currently underway. However, the efficiency, safety, and cost of LV gene therapy could be ameliorated by enhancing target cell transduction levels and reducing the amount of LV used on the cells. Several transduction enhancers already exist, such as fibronectin fragments or cationic compounds. Recently, we discovered Vectofusin-1, a new transduction enhancer, also called LAH4-A4, a short histidine-rich amphipathic peptide derived from the LAH4 family of DNA transfection agents. Vectofusin-1 enhances the infectivity of lentiviral and γ-retroviral vectors pseudotyped with various envelope glycoproteins. In this study, we compared a family of Vectofusin-1 isomers and showed that Vectofusin-1 remains the lead peptide for HSPC transduction enhancement with LVs pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins and also with modified gibbon ape leukemia virus glycoproteins. By comparing the capacity of numerous Vectofusin-1 variants to promote the modified gibbon ape leukemia virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentiviral vector infectivity of HSPCs, the lysine residues on the N-terminal extremity of Vectofusin-1, a hydrophilic angle of 140° formed by the histidine residues in the Schiffer-Edmundson helical wheel representation, hydrophobic residues consisting of leucine were all found to be essential and helped to define a minimal active sequence. The data also show that the critical determinants necessary for lentiviral transduction enhancement are partially different from those necessary for efficient antibiotic or DNA transfection activity of LAH4 derivatives. In conclusion, these results help to decipher the action mechanism of Vectofusin-1 in the context of hCD34+ cell-based gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2220802499,"Background Fish fin is a widely used, non-lethal sample material in studies using stable isotopes to assess the ecology of fishes. However, fish fin is composed of two distinct tissues (ray and membrane) which may have different stable isotope values and are not homogeneously distributed within a fin. As such, estimates of the stable isotope values of a fish may vary according to the section of fin sampled. Methods To assess the magnitude of this variation, we analysed carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N), hydrogen (δ2H) and oxygen (δ18O) stable isotopes of caudal fin from juvenile, riverine stages of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). Individual fins were sub-sectioned into tip, mid and base, of which a further subset were divided into ray and membrane. Findings Isotope variation between fin sections, evident in all four elements, was primarily related to differences between ray and membrane. Base sections were13C depleted relative to tip (~ 1 ‰) with equivalent variation evident between ray and membrane. A similar trend was evident in δ2H, though the degree of variation was far greater (~ 10 ‰). Base and ray sections were 18O enriched (~ 2 ‰) relative to tip and membrane, respectively. Ray and membrane sections displayed longitudinal variation in 15N mirroring that of composite fin (~ 1 ‰), indicating that variation in15N values was likely related to ontogenetic variation. Conclusions To account for the effects of intra-fin variability in stable isotope analyses we suggest that researchers sampling fish fin, in increasing priority, 1) also analyse muscle (or liver) tissue from a subsample of fish to calibrate their data, or 2) standardize sampling by selecting tissue only from the extreme tip of a fin, or 3) homogenize fins prior to analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2285028791,"Disinhibition of reflexes is a problem amongst spastic patients, for it limits a smooth and efficient execution of motor functions during gait. Treadmill belt accelerations may potentially be used to measure reflexes during walking, i.e. by dorsal flexing the ankle and stretching the calf muscles, while decelerations show the modulation of reflexes during a reduction of sensory feedback. The aim of the current study was to examine if belt accelerations and decelerations of different intensities applied during the stance phase of treadmill walking can evoke reflexes in the gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior in healthy subjects. Muscle electromyography and joint kinematics were measured in 10 subjects. To determine whether stretch reflexes occurred, we assessed modelled musculo-tendon length and stretch velocity, the amount of muscle activity, as well as the incidence of bursts or depressions in muscle activity with their time delays, and co-contraction between agonist and antagonist muscle. Although the effect on the ankle angle was small with 2.8±1.0°, the perturbations caused clear changes in muscle length and stretch velocity relative to unperturbed walking. Stretched muscles showed an increasing incidence of bursts in muscle activity, which occurred after a reasonable electrophysiological time delay (163–191 ms). Their amplitude was related to the muscle stretch velocity and not related to co-contraction of the antagonist muscle. These effects increased with perturbation intensity. Shortened muscles showed opposite effects, with a depression in muscle activity of the calf muscles. The perturbations only slightly affected the spatio-temporal parameters, indicating that normal walking was retained. Thus, our findings showed that treadmill perturbations can evoke reflexes in the calf muscles and tibialis anterior. This comprehensive study could form the basis for clinical implementation of treadmill perturbations to functionally measure reflexes during treadmill-based clinical gait analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2196932646,"Objectives We have previously shown that overweight may increase the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in autoantibody positive individuals. Adipose tissue could contribute to the development of RA by production of various bioactive peptides. Therefore, we examined levels of adipokines in serum and synovial tissue of subjects at risk of RA. Methods Fifty-one individuals positive for immunoglobulin M rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), without arthritis, were included in this prospective study. Levels of adiponectin, vaspin, resistin, leptin, chemerin and omentin were determined in baseline fasting serum samples (n = 27). Synovial tissue was obtained by arthroscopy at baseline and we examined the expression of adiponectin, resistin and visfatin by immunohistochemistry. Results The development of clinically manifest arthritis after follow-up was associated with baseline serum vaspin levels (HR1.5 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.2); p = 0.020), also after adjustment for overweight (HR1.7 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.5); p = 0.016). This association was not seen for other adipokines. Various serum adipokine levels correlated with BMI (adiponectin r = -0.538, leptin r = 0.664; chemerin r = 0.529) and systemic markers of inflammation such as CRP levels at baseline (adiponectin r = -0.449, omentin r = -0.557, leptin r = 0.635, chemerin r = 0.619, resistin r = 0.520) and ESR (leptin r = 0.512, chemerin r = 0.708), p-value<0.05. Synovial expression of adiponectin, resistin and visfatin was not associated with development of clinically manifest arthritis. Conclusions In this exploratory study, serum adipokines were associated with an increased inflammatory state in autoantibody-positive individuals at risk of developing RA. Furthermore, serum vaspin levels may assist in predicting the development of arthritis in these individuals."

Although mutations of Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 have not been linked to any human diseases, disruption of Slc26a1, Slc26a6 or Slc26a7 expression in animals causes severe dysregulation of acid-base balance and disorder of anion homeostasis. Amelogenesis, especially the enamel formation during maturation stage, requires complex pH regulation mechanisms based on ion transport. The disruption of stage-specific ion transporters frequently results in enamel pathosis in animals. Here we present evidence that Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 are highly expressed in rodent incisor ameloblasts during maturation-stage tooth development. In maturation-stage ameloblasts, Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 show a similar cellular distribution as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr) to the apical region of cytoplasmic membrane, and the distribution of Slc26a7 is also seen in the cytoplasmic/subapical region, presumably on the lysosomal membrane. We have also examined Slc26a1 and Slc26a7 null mice, and although no overt abnormal enamel phenotypes were observed in Slc26a1-/- or Slc26a7-/- animals, absence of Slc26a1 or Slc26a7 results in up-regulation of Cftr, Ca2, Slc4a4, Slc4a9 and Slc26a9, all of which are involved in pH homeostasis, indicating that this might be a compensatory mechanism used by ameloblasts cells in the absence of Slc26 genes. Together, our data show that Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 are novel participants in the extracellular transport of bicarbonate during enamel maturation, and that their functional roles may be achieved by forming interaction units with Cftr."

Among all the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, infection preferentially up-regulated expression of MCL-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels and compared with infected control, MCL-1-silenced infected macrophages documented enhanced caspase activity and increased apoptosis when subjected to actinomycin D treatment.

During infection, MCL-1 was found to be localized in mitochondria and this was significantly reduced in Tom70-silenced macrophages, suggesting the active role of TOM70 in MCL-1 transport. In the mitochondria, MCL-1 interacts with the major pro-apoptotic protein BAK and prevents BAK-BAK homo-oligomer formation thereby preventing cytochrome c release-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W2207956082,"Background Collagen VI related myopathies encompass a range of phenotypes with involvement of skeletal muscle, skin and other connective tissues. They represent a severe and relatively common form of congenital disease for which there is no treatment. Collagen VI in skeletal muscle and skin is produced by fibroblasts. Aims & Methods In order to gain insight into the consequences of collagen VI mutations and identify key disease pathways we performed global gene expression analysis of dermal fibroblasts from patients with Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy with and without vitamin C treatment. The expression data were integrated using a range of systems biology tools. Results were validated by real-time PCR, western blotting and functional assays. Findings We found significant changes in the expression levels of almost 600 genes between collagen VI deficient and control fibroblasts. Highly regulated genes included extracellular matrix components and surface receptors, including integrins, indicating a shift in the interaction between the cell and its environment. This was accompanied by a significant increase in fibroblasts adhesion to laminin. The observed changes in gene expression profiling may be under the control of two miRNAs, miR-30c and miR-181a, which we found elevated in tissue and serum from patients and which could represent novel biomarkers for muscular dystrophy. Finally, the response to vitamin C of collagen VI mutated fibroblasts significantly differed from healthy fibroblasts. Vitamin C treatment was able to revert the expression of some key genes to levels found in control cells raising the possibility of a beneficial effect of vitamin C as a modulator of some of the pathological aspects of collagen VI related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2204920372,"Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) 0ΔNLS is a live HSV-2 ICP0- mutant vaccine strain that is profoundly attenuated in vivo due to its interferon-hypersensitivity. Recipients of the HSV-2 0ΔNLS vaccine are resistant to high-dose HSV-2 challenge as evidenced by profound reductions in challenge virus spread, shedding, disease and mortality. In the current study, we investigated the requirements for HSV-2 0ΔNLS vaccine-induced protection. Studies using (UV)-inactivated HSV-2 0ΔNLS revealed that self-limited replication of the attenuated virus was required for effective protection from vaginal or ocular HSV-2 challenge. Diminished antibody responses in recipients of the UV-killed HSV-2 vaccine suggested that antibodies might be playing a critical role in early protection. This hypothesis was investigated in B-cell-deficient μMT mice. Vaccination with live HSV-2 0ΔNLS induced equivalent CD8+ T cell responses in wild-type and μMT mice. Vaccinated μMT mice shed ~40-fold more infectious HSV-2 at 24 hours post-challenge relative to vaccinated wild-type (B-cell+) mice, and most vaccinated μMT mice eventually succumbed to a slowly progressing HSV-2 challenge. Importantly, passive transfer of HSV-2 antiserum restored full protection to HSV-2 0ΔNLS-vaccinated μMT mice. The results demonstrate that B cells are required for complete vaccine-induced protection against HSV-2, and indicate that virus-specific antibodies are the dominant mediators of early vaccine-induced protection against HSV-2."
https://openalex.org/W2205158938,"Nischarin is a cytoplasmic protein expressed in various organs that plays an inhibitory role in cell migration and invasion and the carcinogenesis of breast cancer cells. We previously reported that Nischarin is highly expressed in neuronal cell lines and is differentially expressed in the brain tissue of adult rats. However, the physiological function of Nischarin in neural cells remains unknown. Here, we show that Nischarin is expressed in rat primary cortical neurons but not in astrocytes. Nischarin is localized around the nucleus and dendrites. Using shRNA to knockdown the expression of endogenous Nischarin significantly increases the percentage of neurite-bearing cells, remarkably increases neurite length, and accelerates neurite extension in neuronal cells. Silencing Nischarin expression also promotes dendrite elongation in rat cortical neurons where Nischarin interacts with p21-activated kinase 1/2 (PAK1/2) and negatively regulates phosphorylation of both PAK1 and PAK2. The stimulation of neurite growth observed in cells with decreased levels of Nischarin is partially abolished by IPA3-mediated inhibition of PAK1 activity. Our findings indicate that endogenous Nischarin inhibits neurite outgrowth by blocking PAK1 activation in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2204097328,"Objective In patients with postoperative recurrence of Crohn’s disease endoscopic and clinical remission can be maintained for up to 1 year with low infliximab doses (3 mg/Kg). However, in theory low-dose infliximab treated patients could develop subtherapeutic trough levels, infiximab antibodies, and might loose response to therapy. To verify this hypothesis infliximab pharmacokinetics and clinical/endoscopic response were checked in a group of patients treated in the long term with low infliximab doses. Design Infliximab antibodies, infliximab levels, highly-sensitive CRP and fecal calprotectin were measured during the 8-week interval in 5 consecutive patients in clinical (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index < 150) and endoscopic (Rutgeerts scores 0–1) remission after one year of therapy with infliximab 3 mg/Kg. For comparison with reported standards, infliximab pharmacokinetics and inflammatory parameters were also tested in 6 Crohn’s disease patients who did not undergo surgery and who were in clinical remission while on infliximab 5 mg/Kg. Patients on low infliximab dose also underwent colonoscopy after 18 additional months of therapy. Results Highly sensitive CRP and fecal calprotectin increased in all patients during the 8-week interval. Infliximab trough levels were lower in patients treated with the low dose compared to controls (mean±SE: 2.0±0.3 vs 4.75±0.83 μg/mL respectively p<0.05). Infliximab antibodies were present in two of the subjects treated with low infliximab dose and in none of the controls. However, in low dose-treated patients after 18 additional months of therapy endoscopy continued to show mucosal remission and none of them developed clinical recurrence or side effects. Conclusions Patients treated with low infliximab doses had lower trough levels compared to patients treated with 5 mg/Kg and some developed antibodies to infliximab. However, low infliximab doses sustained clinical and endoscopic remission for a total of 30 months of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2215021171,"The neurocognitive basis of the effect of long-term high altitude exposure on conflict control is unclear. Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in a flanker task to investigate the influence of high altitude on conflict control in the high-altitude group (who had lived at high altitude for three years but were born at low altitude) and the low-altitude group (living in low altitude only). Although altitude effect was not significant at the behavioral level, ERPs showed cognitive conflict modulation. The interaction between group and trial type was significant: P3 amplitude was greater in the low-altitude group than in the high-altitude group in the incongruent trial. This result suggests that long-term exposure to high altitude affects conflict control in the conflict-resolving stage, and that attentional resources are decreased to resist the conflict control in the high-altitude group."
https://openalex.org/W2205980680,"Hypertension is a well established cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the effect of prehypertension on risk of CKD is controversial. The aim of this study is to determine whether prehypertension increases the risk of CKD events in the Chinese population. We enrolled 20,034 with prehypertension and 12,351 with ideal blood pressure in this prospective study. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min 1.73 m2. The new occurrences of CKD events were collected during follow-up. Cumulative survival and freedom for the occurrence of new CKD events was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier approach. Multivariate Cox Regression was used to analyze the effect of prehypertension on CKD. The median follow-up time was 47 (interquartile range 44-51) months. 601 new onset CKD events occurred during the follow-up period. The cumulative incidence of new CKD events was higher in the prehypertensive population than that in the ideal blood pressure population (2.10% vs 1.46%, P = 0.0001). Multivariate Cox Regression showed that relative risks (RRs) for the new onset CKD events in the prehypertensive population were 1.69 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.41~2.04, P = 0.001) higher than those in the ideal blood pressure population. Similarly, the risks were 1.68 (95% CI: 1.33~2.13 P = 0.001) times higher in females and 2.14 (95% CI: 1.58~2.91 P = 0.001) times higher in males by adjustment for traditional CV risk factors. Our findings demonstrated prehypertension is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of new CKD events in the Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2198605875,"Each breast cancer has its unique spatial shape, but the clinical importance and the underlying mechanism for the three-dimensional tumor shapes are mostly unknown. We collected the data on the three-dimensional tumor size and tumor volume data of invasive breast cancers from 2,250 patients who underwent surgery between Jan 2000 and Jul 2007. The degree of tumor eccentricity was estimated by using the difference between the spheroid tumor volume and ellipsoid tumor volume (spheroid-ellipsoid discrepancy, SED). In 41 patients, transcriptome and exome sequencing data obtained. Estimation of more accurate tumor burden by calculating ellipsoid tumor volumes did not improve the outcome prediction when compared to the traditional longest diameter measurement. However, the spatial tumor eccentricity, which was measured by SED, showed significant variation between the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Additionally, the degree of tumor eccentricity was associated with well-known prognostic factors of breast cancer such as tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Transcriptome data from 41 patients showed significant association between MMP13 and spatial tumor shapes. Network analysis and analysis of TCGA gene expression data suggest that MMP13 is regulated by ERBB2 and S100A7A. The present study validates the usefulness of the current tumor size method in determining tumor stages. Furthermore, we show that the tumors with high eccentricity are more likely to have aggressive tumor characteristics. Genes involved in the extracellular matrix remodeling can be candidate regulators of the spatial tumor shapes in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2268388363,"Factor XIIa (fXIIa) is a serine protease that triggers the coagulation contact pathway and plays a role in thrombosis. Because it interferes with coagulation testing, the need to inhibit fXIIa exists in many cases. Infestin-4 (Inf4) is a Kazal-type inhibitor of fXIIa. Its specificity for fXIIa can be enhanced by point mutations in the protease-binding loop. We attempted to adapt Inf4 for the selective repression of the contact pathway under various in vitro conditions, e.g., during blood collection and in ‘global’ assays of tissue factor (TF)-dependent coagulation. First, we designed a set of new Inf4 mutants that, in contrast to wt-Inf4, had stabilized canonical conformations during molecular dynamics simulation. Off-target activities against factor Xa (fXa), plasmin, and other coagulation proteases were either reduced or eliminated in these recombinant mutants, as demonstrated by chromogenic assays. Interactions with fXIIa and fXa were also analyzed using protein-protein docking. Next, Mutant B, one of the most potent mutants (its Ki for fXIIa is 0.7 nM) was tested in plasma. At concentrations 5–20 μM, this mutant delayed the contact-activated generation of thrombin, as well as clotting in thromboelastography and thrombodynamics assays. In these assays, Mutant B did not affect coagulation initiated by TF, thus demonstrating sufficient selectivity and its potential practical significance as a reagent for coagulation diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2214335804,"In fungal cells, a phosphate (Pi) responsive signaling and metabolism (PHO) pathway regulates Pi-homeostasis. NUC-2/PHO81 and its homologs are one of the most important components in the regulation pathway. In soil-borne phytopathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae, we identified a Neurospora crassa nuc-2 homolog gene VdNUC-2. VdNUC-2 is composed of 1,018 amino acids, and is highly conserved in tested filamentous fungi. Under conditions of Pi-starvation, compared with the wild-type strain and ectopic complementation strains, the VdNUC-2 knocked out mutants exhibited reduced radial growth, decreased production of conidia and microsclerotia, and were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress. The virulence of VdNUC-2 defective mutants was significantly compromised, and that was unable to be restored by exogenous application of extra Pi. Additionally, the deletion mutants of VdNUC-1, a key transcription factor gene positively controlled by VdNUC-2 in the PHO pathway, showed the similar cultural phenotypes as VdNUC-2 mutants when both of them grew in Pi-limited conditions. However, the virulence of VdNUC-1 mutants was comparable to the wild-type strain. These evidences indicated that the virulence reduction in VdNUC-2 mutants is not due to the interruptions in the PHO pathway or the disturbance of Pi-homeostasis in V. dahliae cytoplasm. VdNUC-2 is not only a crucial gene in the PHO pathway in V. dahliae, but also is required for the full virulence during host-infection."
https://openalex.org/W2209440326,"Divergence in song between allopatric populations can contribute to premating reproductive isolation in territorial birds. Song divergence is typically measured by quantifying divergence in vocal traits using audio recordings, but field playback experiments provide a more direct way to behaviorally measure song divergence between allopatric populations. The White-breasted Wood-Wren (Henicorhina leucosticta; hereafter ""WBWW"") is an abundant Neotropical species with four mitochondrial clades (in Central America, the Darién, the Chocó and the Amazon) that are deeply divergent (~5-16% sequence divergence). We assessed the possibility that the WBWW as currently defined may represent multiple biological species by conducting both statistical analysis of vocal characters and field playback experiments within three clades (Central America, Chocó and Amazon). Our analysis of vocal traits revealed that Central American songs overlapped in acoustic space with Chocó songs, indicating vocal similarity between these two populations, but that Central American songs were largely divergent from Amazonian songs. Playback experiments in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica revealed that Central American WBWWs typically responded aggressively to songs from the Chocó population but did not respond to playback of songs from the Amazonian population, echoing the results of the vocal trait analysis. This marked difference in behavioral response demonstrates that the songs of Central American and Amazonian WBWWs (but not Central American and Chocó WBWWs) have diverged sufficiently that Central American WBWWs no longer recognize song from Amazonian WBWWs as a signal to elicit territorial defense. This suggests that significant premating reproductive isolation has evolved between these two populations, at least from the perspective of the Central American population, and is consistent with the possibility that Central American and Amazonian populations represent distinct biological species. We conclude by advocating for the further use of field playback experiments to assess premating reproductive isolation (and species limits) between allopatric songbird populations, a situation where behavioral systematics can answer questions that phylogenetic systematics cannot."
https://openalex.org/W2214181294,"The intracellular protease inhibitor Sb9 (SerpinB9) is a regulator of the cytotoxic lymphocyte protease GzmB (granzyme B). Although GzmB is primarily involved in the destruction of compromised cells, recent evidence suggests that it is also involved in lysosome-mediated death of the cytotoxic lymphocyte itself. Sb9 protects the cell from GzmB released from lysosomes into the cytosol. Here we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated within cytotoxic lymphocytes by receptor stimulation are required for lyososomal permeabilization and release of GzmB into the cytosol. Importantly, ROS also inactivate Sb9 by oxidizing a highly conserved cysteine pair (P1-P1′ in rodents and P1′-P2′ in other mammals) in the reactive center loop to form a vicinal disulfide bond. Replacement of the P4-P3′ reactive center loop residues of the prototype serpin, SERPINA1, with the P4-P5′ residues of Sb9 containing the cysteine pair is sufficient to convert SERPINA1 into a ROS-sensitive GzmB inhibitor. Conversion of the cysteine pair to serines in either human or mouse Sb9 results in a functional serpin that inhibits GzmB and resists ROS inactivation. We conclude that ROS sensitivity of Sb9 allows the threshold for GzmB-mediated suicide to be lowered, as part of a conserved post-translational homeostatic mechanism regulating lymphocyte numbers or activity.

This is exemplified by mice lacking Sb9, which have lower than normal numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells during infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. By contrast, mice lacking both Sb9 and GzmB have normal numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, implicating uncontrolled GzmB as a mediator of CD8+ T cell disappearance (11Zhang M. Park S.-M. Wang Y.

Overall, such data suggest that the GzmB-Sb9 axis plays an important role in the maintenance of immune cell populations. For GzmB to cause apoptosis of CLs during an immune response, it must access the CL cytosol. It could be delivered from a neighboring cell (fratricide), as observed in Sendai virus infection where regulatory T cells limit effector CD8+ T cell life span by killing these cells in a GzmB- and perforin-dependent manner (15Salti S.M.

Alternatively, it can be released from the cytotoxic granules of the CL if they are destabilized and undergo lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). LMP in CLs has been demonstrated following engagement of either CD2 or CD16 on NK cells or CD3 restimulation of activated CD8+ T cells, resulting in translocation of GzmB to the cytosol and GzmB-mediated death (17Ida H.

ROS can also come from the external environment, generated by neighboring neutrophils and macrophages (25Hansson M. Asea A. Ersson U. Hermodsson S. Hellstrand K. Induction of apoptosis in NK cells by monocyte-derived reactive oxygen metabolites.J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 42-47PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate an additional role for ROS in CLs, namely in promoting GzmB-mediated death via induction of LMP and inactivation of Sb9. ROS promotes GzmB release from lysosomes into the cytoplasm and also oxidizes highly conserved Cys residues in the RCL of Sb9 preventing it from interacting with GzmB. As a consequence of Sb9 inactivation, the CL becomes more sensitive to LMP and GzmB-mediated death. ROS-mediated LMP coupled to suppression of Sb9 may therefore be an important factor in an emerging cell autonomous mechanism that controls CL (and other immune cell) life span (19Bird C.H.

Purified CTLs were 70.11 ± 13.90% CD3+ and 74.14 ± 8.01% CD8+. Mouse CTL were generated from splenocytes obtained from C57BL/6 (WT), GzmB KO, or Sb9 KO mice and activated with 0.1 mg/ml anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, 100 units/ml IL-2, and 2 ng/ml IL-7 for 3 days as described previously (19Bird C.H.

The cells were cultured in complete medium containing 5 μg/ml acridine orange (AO; MP Biomedicals) for 15 min prior to lysosomal disruption. Changes in AO distribution were determined by FACS analysis using FL1 to monitor cytosolic AO and FL3 to measure lysosomal AO. Medium lacking 2-ME was used throughout this experiment. YT cells cultured overnight were transferred to fresh medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were pretreated as indicated with 10 mm C20 for 2 h. Appropriate samples were exposed to 40 μm H2O2 for 10 min before addition of 125 μm Leu-Leu-methyl ester (LLOMe). Cell morphology and viability was examined by trypan blue staining after 45 min of incubation. Trypan blue-negative cells with unaltered morphology were scored as viable; trypan blue-positive cells with clear membrane blebbing were scored as dying; trypan blue-negative cells were scored as dead. The lentiviral vector pLox-dsRed was constructed by replacing the SmaI-NheI EGFP-encoding fragment from the lentiviral vector pLOX/EWgfp (Addgene) with the SmaI-XbaI fragment from pIRES2-dsRED-Express (Clontech) containing the IRES-dsRed element. An EcoRI fragment containing either the human or mouse Sb9 coding sequence was then inserted into the EcoRI site of pLox-dsRed. An extension-overlap PCR approach was used to convert the two Cys residues to Ser in the human or mouse Sb9 RCL (SS mutants). The mutagenic primers were 5′-GCAGAGAGCTCCATGGAATCTG-3′ and complement (human) and 5′-CATCATAGAATTCTCGAGTGCCTCTTC-3′ and complement (mouse). The human flanking primers were 5′-GGGGATCCATGGAAACTCTTTCTAATGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGATCCTTATGGCGATGAGAACC-3′. Mouse flanking primers were 5′-GGGGATCCATGAATACTCTGTCTGAAGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGATCCTTATGGAGATGAGAACCTGCCAC-3′. Mutated products were cloned into pZeroBlunt (Invitrogen) and sequenced, then the plasmid was cleaved with BamHI to release the Sb9 fragment which was inserted into the unique BamHI site of pLox-dsRed. Lentivirus was produced as described (26Tiscornia G. Singer O. Verma I.M. Production and purification of lentiviral vectors.Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) via co-transfection of HEK-293T cells with a pLox-ds-Red construct and packaging plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 (Addgene). Jurkat cells were plated in a flat-bottomed 96-well tray at 3 × 104 cells/well in RPMI-10 containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene and lentivirus particles (multiplicity of infection, 5–10; total volume, 100 μl). The cells were then centrifuged at 1500 × g for 45 min at 30 °C. Following centrifugation, 100 μl of RPMI-10 was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. The cells were assessed for expression of the transduced gene by analyzing dsRed expression via FACS. After expansion, the positive cells from each transduction were sorted into populations expressing comparable levels of dsRed.

Serpin/serine protease complexes are SDS stable and can be visualized by immunoblotting following separation via SDS-PAGE. For analysis of Sb9 function, complexes were allowed to form postlysis. The cells were lysed in ½ volume Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 μg/ml PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to facilitate complex formation. ½ volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (LSB) was then added to halt the reaction. Cell extracts for analysis of protein without allowing postlysis complex formation were prepared by directly lysing cells in LSB. Any complexes detected under these conditions are formed within the cell, prelysis. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting and visualization via chemiluminescence. Substrates based on the RCL of Sb9 incorporating the fluorophore anthranilic acid and fluorescence quencher dinitrophenyllysine (K-dnp) were synthesized as described (29Northfield S.E. Roberts K.D.

Quenched fluorescence peptide substrates (Abz-IEPDSSMESK-dnp or Abz-LEYDLGALK-dnp) were added to 100 μl of cell extract, and GzmB activity was assayed using a fluorescence plate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA; BMG LABTECH). To measure recombinant GzmB activity, peptide substrates were diluted into TBS containing either 5 mm 2-ME or 100 μm H2O2 and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. GzmB was added, and the activity on the substrate was assayed as above. Where indicated, cells were preincubated with the selective human GzmB inhibitor compound 20 (C20) (19Bird C.H.

Protease and serpin were mixed together at the indicated ratio and incubated for 37 °C for 10–40 min to facilitate complex formation. For experiments assessing complex formation under different oxidative conditions, the protein was first dialyzed against TBS containing either 100 μm H2O2 or 5 mm 2-ME. Assay samples were co-spotted onto the MALDI target plate with Matrix solution of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Laser BioLabs, Sophia-Antipolis, France) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA. The samples were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI TOF/TOF in Reflectron mode with a mass range of 1000–4000 Da, focus mass of 1500 Da at 2000 shots per spectra. The spectra were calibrated using the default calibration that was updated by the plate model method against 4700 peptide mix immediately prior to sample acquisition. The data were processed using the 4700 Series Explorer software. The hybrid Sb9-α1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1 (A1AT)) serpin was constructed by replacing the P4-P3′ residues of the human A1AT RCL with the P4-P5′ residues of the Sb9 RCL using a PCR extension/overlap strategy. The template plasmid carried the human A1AT gene modified to remove the signal sequence and include six His residues and TEV cleavage site immediately after the initiation codon.

The flanking primers were 5′-TCTGCCATCATGAGAGGATCTCACCATCACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGGCAGTTATTTTTGGGTGGG-3′ (antisense). The resulting chimeric product was cloned into pZeroBlunt, verified by DNA sequencing, and then cloned using EcoRI into the Pichia pastoris expression vector, pHILD2.

Method 150 volunteers aged 50 (SD: 12) years with plantar heel pain (>4 weeks) were enrolled after responding to advertisements and eligibility determined by telephone and at first visit. Participants were randomly allocated to receive commercially available contoured sandals (n = 49), flat flip-flops (n = 50) or over the counter, pre-fabricated full-length foot orthotics (n = 51). Primary outcomes were a 15-point Global Rating of Change scale (GROC: 1 = a very great deal worse, 15 = a very great deal better), 13 to 15 representing an improvement and the 20-item Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) on which participants rate 20 common weight bearing activities and activities of daily living on a 5-point scale (0 = extreme difficulty, 4 = no difficulty). Secondary outcomes were worst level of heel pain in the preceding week, and the foot and ankle ability measure. Outcomes were collected blind to allocation. Analyses were done on an intention to treat basis with 12 weeks being the primary outcome time of interest. Results The contoured sandal was 68% more likely to report improvement in terms of GROC compared to flat flip-flop. On the LEFS the contoured sandal was 61% more likely than flat flip-flop to report improvement. The secondary outcomes in the main reflected the primary outcomes, and there were no differences between contoured sandal and shoe insert. Conclusions and Relevance Physicians can have confidence in supporting a patient's decision to wear contoured sandals or in-shoe orthoses as one of the first and simple strategies to manage their heel pain.

https://openalex.org/W2206754247,"Formin 2 (Fmn2), a member of the FMN family of formins, plays an important role in early development. This formin cooperates with profilin and Spire, a WASP homology domain 2 (WH2) repeat protein, to stimulate assembly of a dynamic cytoplasmic actin meshwork that facilitates translocation of the meiotic spindle in asymmetric division of mouse oocytes. The kinase-like non-catalytic domain (KIND) of Spire directly interacts with the C-terminal extension of the formin homology domain 2 (FH2) domain of Fmn2, called FSI. This direct interaction is required for the synergy between the two proteins in actin assembly. We have recently demonstrated how Spire, which caps barbed ends via its WH2 domains, activates Fmn2. Fmn2 by itself associates very poorly to filament barbed ends but is rapidly recruited to Spire-capped barbed ends via the KIND domain, and it subsequently displaces Spire from the barbed end to elicit rapid processive assembly from profilin·actin. Here, we address the mechanism by which Spire and Fmn2 compete at barbed ends and the role of FSI in orchestrating this competition as well as in the processivity of Fmn2. We have combined microcalorimetric, fluorescence, and hydrodynamic binding assays, as well as bulk solution and single filament measurements of actin assembly, to show that removal of FSI converts Fmn2 into a Capping Protein. This activity is mimicked by association of KIND to Fmn2. In addition, FSI binds actin at filament barbed ends as a weak capper and plays a role in displacing the WH2 domains of Spire from actin, thus allowing the association of actin-binding regions of FH2 to the barbed end.

https://openalex.org/W2207604739,"Airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are characterized by excessive inflammation and are exacerbated by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Airway epithelial cells mount the initial innate immune responses to invading pathogens and thus modulate inflammation. While inflammation is necessary to eliminate a pathogen, excessive inflammation can cause damage to the host tissue. Therefore, the inflammatory response must be tightly regulated and deciphering the signaling pathways involved in this response will enhance our understanding of the regulation of the host inflammatory response. NTHi binds to TLR2 and signal propagation requires the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). An alternative spliced form of MyD88 is called MyD88 short (MyD88s) and has been identified in macrophages and embryonic cell lines as a negative regulator of inflammation. However, the role of MyD88s in NTHi-induced inflammation in airway epithelial cells remains unknown. Here we show that NTHi induces MyD88s expression and MyD88s is a negative regulator of inflammation in airway epithelial cells. We further demonstrate that MyD88s is positively regulated by IKKβ and CREB and negatively regulated by ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Taken together these data indicate that airway inflammation is controlled in a negative feedback manner involving MyD88s and suggest that airway epithelial cells are essential to maintain immune homeostasis."

Barley cultivars Kanto Nijo-5 (KN5) and K-3 (K3) showed lower efficiency of shoot regeneration in a 16-h photoperiod during callus-induction than those in continuous darkness, whereas shoot regeneration was enhanced in cultures under a 16-h photoperiod in Golden Promise (GP) and Lenins (LN). These cultivars were classified as photo-inhibition type (KN5 and K3) or photo-induction type (GP and LN) according to their response to light. Contents of endogenous plant hormones were determined in calli cultured under a 16-h photoperiod and continuous darkness. In photo-inhibition type, higher accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) was detected in calli cultured under a 16-h photoperiod, whereas calli showed lower levels of endogenous ABA in continuous darkness. However, cultivars of photo-induction type showed lower levels of ABA in calli cultured under both light conditions, similarly to photo-inhibition type in continuous darkness. Exogenous ABA inhibited the callus growth and shoot regeneration independent of light conditions in all cultivars. In photo-inhibition type, lower levels of endogenous ABA induced by ABA biosynthesis inhibitor, fluridone, reduced the photo-inhibition of shoot regeneration. Expression of ABA biosynthesis gene, HvNCED1, in calli was regulated by the light conditions. Higher expression was observed in calli cultured under a 16-h photoperiod. These results indicate that ABA biosynthesis could be activated through the higher expression of HvNCED1 in a 16-h photoperiod and that the higher accumulations of ABA inhibit shoot regeneration in the photo-inhibition type cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2281232801,"Human brucellosis has reemerged as a serious public health threat to the Bedouin population of southern Israel in recent years. Little is known about its economic implications derived from elevated healthcare utilization (HCU). Our objective was to estimate the HCU costs associated with human brucellosis from the insurer perspective. A case-control retrospective study was conducted among Clalit Health Services (CHS) enrollees. Brucellosis cases were defined as individuals that were diagnosed with brucellosis at the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of Soroka University Medical Center in the 2010-2012 period (n = 470). Control subjects were randomly selected and matched 1:3 by age, sex, clinic, and primary physician (n = 1,410). HCU data, demographic characteristics and comorbidities were obtained from CHS computerized database. Mean±SD age of the brucellosis cases was 26.6±17.6 years. 63% were male and 85% were Bedouins. No significant difference in Charlson comorbidity index was found between brucellosis cases and controls (0.41 vs. 0.45, respectively, P = 0.391). Before diagnosis (baseline), the average total annual HCU cost of brucellosis cases was slightly yet significantly higher than that of the control group ($439 vs. $382, P<0.05), however, no significant differences were found at baseline in the predominant components of HCU, i.e. hospitalizations, diagnostic procedures, and medications. At the year following diagnosis, the average total annual HCU costs of brucellosis cases was significantly higher than that of controls ($1,327 vs. $380, respectively, P<0.001). Most of the difference stems from 7.9 times higher hospitalization costs (p<0.001). Additional elevated costs were 3.6 times higher laboratory tests (P<0.001), 2.8 times higher emergency room visits (P<0.001), 1.8 times higher medication (P<0.001) and 1.3 times higher diagnostic procedures (P<0.001). We conclude that human brucellosis is associated with elevated HCU costs. Considering these results in cost-effective analyses may be crucial for both reducing health inequities and optimal allocation of health systems' scarce resources."
https://openalex.org/W2198957583,"The efficacy of radiotherapy on tumors is hampered by its devastating adverse effects on healthy tissue, particularly that of the gastrointestinal tract. These effects cause acute symptoms that are so disruptive to patients that they can lead to interruption of the radiotherapy program. These adverse effects could limit the intensity of radiation received by the patient, resulting in a sublethal dose to the tumor, thus increasing the risk of tumor resistance. The lack of an effective treatment to protect the bowel during radiation therapy to allow higher radiation doses that are lethal to the tumor has become a barrier to implementing effective therapy. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of both intestinal and tumor tissue in regard to the efficacy and the preventive impact of a short-term growth hormone (GH) treatment in tumor-bearing rats as a protective agent during radiotherapy. Our data show that the exogenous administration of GH improved intestinal recovery after radiation treatment while preserving the therapeutic effect against the tumor. GH significantly increased proliferation in the irradiated intestine but not in the irradiated tumors, as assessed by Positron Emission Tomography and the proliferative markers Ki67, cyclin D3, and Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen. This proliferative effect was consistent with a significant increase in irradiated intestinal villi and crypt length. Furthermore, GH significantly decreased caspase-3 activity in the intestine, whereas GH did not produce this effect in the irradiated tumors. In conclusion, short-term GH treatment protects the bowel, inducing proliferation while reducing apoptosis in healthy intestinal tissue and preserving radiotherapy efficacy on tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2202915967,"We previously identified heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) as a specific target of miR-155, and inhibition of HO-1 activity restored the capacity of miR-155-/- CD4+ T cells to promote antigen-driven inflammation after adoptive transfer in antigen-expressing recipients. Protoporphyrins are molecules recognized for their modulatory effect on HO-1 expression and function. In the present study, we investigated the effect of protoporphyrin treatment on the development of autoimmunity in miR-155-deficient mice. MiR-155-mediated control of HO-1 expression in promoting T cell-driven chronic autoimmunity was confirmed since HO-1 inhibition restored susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in miR-155-deficient mice. The increased severity of the disease was accompanied by an enhanced T cell infiltration into the brain. Taken together, these results underline the importance of miR-155-mediated control of HO-1 expression in regulating the function of chronically-stimulated T cells in EAE."
https://openalex.org/W2212152034,"A focal visual stimulus outside the classical receptive field (RF) of a V1 neuron does not evoke a spike response by itself, and yet evokes robust changes in the local field potential (LFP). This subthreshold LFP provides a unique opportunity to investigate how changes induced by surround stimulation leads to modulation of spike activity. In the current study, two identical Gabor stimuli were sequentially presented with a variable stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) ranging from 0 to 100 ms: the first (S1) outside the RF and the second (S2) over the RF of primary visual cortex neurons, while trained monkeys performed a fixation task. This focal and asynchronous stimulation of the RF surround enabled us to analyze the modulation of S2-evoked spike activity and covariation between spike and LFP modulation across SOA. In this condition, the modulation of S2-evoked spike response was dominantly facilitative and was correlated with the change in LFP amplitude, which was pronounced for the cells recorded in the upper cortical layers. The time course of covariation between the SOA-dependent spike modulation and LFP amplitude suggested that the subthreshold LFP evoked by the S1 can predict the magnitude of upcoming spike modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2221432184,"Glucocorticoid signaling regulates target genes by multiple mechanisms, including the repression of transcriptional activities of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) though direct protein-protein interactions and subsequent O-GlcNAcylation of RNA polymerase II (pol II). Recent studies have shown that overexpression of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), which adds an O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) group to the C-terminal domain of RNA pol II, increases the transrepression effects of glucocorticoids (GC). As O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is an enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc from O-GlcNAcylated proteins, we hypothesized that the potentiation of GC effects following OGT overexpression could be similarly observed via the direct inhibition of OGA, inhibiting O-GlcNAc removal from pol II. Here we show that despite pharmacological evidence of target engagement by a selective small molecule inhibitor of OGA, there is no evidence for a sensitizing effect on glucocorticoid-mediated effects on TNF-α promoter activity, or gene expression generally, in human cells. Furthermore, inhibition of OGA did not potentiate glucocorticoid–induced apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. Thus, despite evidence for O-GlcNAc modification of RNA pol II in GR-mediated transrepression, our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of OGA does not potentiate or enhance glucocorticoid-mediated transrepression."

We explored the role of IL28B, APOH and ITPA SNPs on the outcomes of triple therapy including telaprevir or boceprevir in patients with compensated cirrhosis chronically infected with HCV-1.A total of 256 HCV-1 Caucasian treatment-experienced patients with compensated cirrhosis from the ANRS CO20-CUPIC cohort were genotyped for a total of 10 candidate SNPs in IL28B (rs12979860 and rs368234815), APOH (rs8178822, rs12944940, rs10048158, rs52797880, rs1801689 and rs1801690) and ITPA (rs1127354 and rs7270101). We tested the association of IL28B and APOH SNPs with sustained virological response and of ITPA SNPs with anemia related phenotypes by means of logistic regression assuming an additive genetic model.None of the six APOH SNPs were associated with sustained virological response. The favorable alleles of the IL28B SNPs rs12979860 and rs368234815 were associated with sustained virological response (rs12979860: OR = 2.35[1.50-3.70], P = 2x10(-4)). Refined analysis showed that the effect of IL28B SNPs on sustained virological response was restricted to prior PegIFN/RBV relapse (OR = 3.80[1.82-8.92], P = 8x10(-4)). We also confirmed the association between ITPA low activity alleles and protection against early hemoglobin decline in triple therapy (P = 2x10(-5)).Our results suggest that the screening of rs12979860 may remain interesting for decision making in prior relapse HCV-1 Caucasian patients with compensated cirrhosis eligible for a telaprevir- or boceprevir-based therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2204912383,"Basal-like breast cancer is an aggressive subtype generally characterized as poor prognosis and lacking the expression of the three most important clinical biomarkers, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2. Cell lines serve as useful model systems to study cancer biology in vitro and in vivo. We performed mutational profiling of six basal-like breast cancer cell lines (HCC38, HCC1143, HCC1187, HCC1395, HCC1954, and HCC1937) and their matched normal lymphocyte DNA using targeted capture and next-generation sequencing of 1,237 cancer-associated genes, including all exons, UTRs and upstream flanking regions. In total, 658 somatic variants were identified, of which 378 were non-silent (average 63 per cell line, range 37-146) and 315 were novel (not present in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database; COSMIC). 125 novel mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (59 exonic, 48 3'UTR and 10 5'UTR, 1 splicing), with a validation rate of 94% of high confidence variants. Of 36 mutations previously reported for these cell lines but not detected in our exome data, 36% could not be detected by Sanger sequencing. The base replacements C/G>A/T, C/G>G/C, C/G>T/A and A/T>G/C were significantly more frequent in the coding regions compared to the non-coding regions (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.0-5.3, P<0.0001; OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.9-6.6, P<0.0001; OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.8-3.1, P<0.0001; OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7, P = 0.024, respectively). The single nucleotide variants within the context of T[C]T/A[G]A and T[C]A/T[G]A were more frequent in the coding than in the non-coding regions (OR 3.7, 95% CI 2.2-6.1, P<0.0001; OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.0-7.2, P = 0.001, respectively). Copy number estimations were derived from the targeted regions and correlated well to Affymetrix SNP array copy number data (Pearson correlation 0.82 to 0.96 for all compared cell lines; P<0.0001). These mutation calls across 1,237 cancer-associated genes and identification of novel variants will aid in the design and interpretation of biological experiments using these six basal-like breast cancer cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2204404639,"In a current procedure for periodontal tissue regeneration, enamel matrix derivative (EMD), which is the active component, is mixed with a propylene glycol alginate (PGA) gel carrier and applied directly to the periodontal defect. Exposure of EMD to physiological conditions then causes it to precipitate. However, environmental changes during manufacture and storage may result in modifications to the conformation of the EMD proteins, and eventually premature phase separation of the gel and a loss in therapeutic effectiveness. The present work relates to efforts to improve the stability of EMD-based formulations such as Emdogain™ through the incorporation of arginine, a well-known protein stabilizer, but one that to our knowledge has not so far been considered for this purpose. Representative EMD-buffer solutions with and without arginine were analyzed by 3D-dynamic light scattering, UV-Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy at different acidic pH and temperatures, T, in order to simulate the effect of pH variations and thermal stress during manufacture and storage. The results provided evidence that arginine may indeed stabilize EMD against irreversible aggregation with respect to variations in pH and T under these conditions. Moreover, stopped-flow transmittance measurements indicated arginine addition not to suppress precipitation of EMD from either the buffers or the PGA gel carrier when the pH was raised to 7, a fundamental requirement for dental applications."
https://openalex.org/W2211963631,"Predictive coding has been previously introduced as a hierarchical coding framework for the visual system. At each level, activity predicted by the higher level is dynamically subtracted from the input, while the difference in activity continuously propagates further. Here we introduce modular predictive coding as a feedforward hierarchy of prediction modules without back-projections from higher to lower levels. Within each level, recurrent dynamics optimally segregates the input into novelty and familiarity components. Although the anatomical feedforward connectivity passes through the novelty-representing neurons, it is nevertheless the familiarity information which is propagated to higher levels. This modularity results in a twofold advantage compared to the original predictive coding scheme: the familiarity-novelty representation forms quickly, and at each level the full representational power is exploited for an optimized readout. As we show, natural images are successfully compressed and can be reconstructed by the familiarity neurons at each level. Missing information on different spatial scales is identified by novelty neurons and complements the familiarity representation. Furthermore, by virtue of the recurrent connectivity within each level, non-classical receptive field properties still emerge. Hence, modular predictive coding is a biologically realistic metaphor for the visual system that dynamically extracts novelty at various scales while propagating the familiarity information."
