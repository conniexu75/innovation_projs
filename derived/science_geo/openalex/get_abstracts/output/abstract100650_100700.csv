https://openalex.org/W1970898019,"The Bloom's syndrome (BS) gene, BLM, plays an important role in the maintenance of genomic stability in somatic cells. A candidate for BLM was identified by direct selection of a cDNA derived from a 250 kb segment of the genome to which BLM had been assigned by somatic crossover point mapping. In this novel mapping method, cells were used from persons with BS that had undergone intragenic recombination within BLM. cDNA analysis of the candidate gene identified a 4437 bp cDNA that encodes a 1417 amino acid peptide with homology to the RecQ helicases, a subfamily of DExH box-containing DNA and RNA helicases. The presence of chain-terminating mutations in the candidate gene in persons with BS proved that it was BLM."

Co-expression of constitutively active forms of Rac and Cdc42 leads to activation of p38 while dominant negative Rac and Cdc42 inhibit the ability of interleukin-1 to increase p38 activity. p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) is a potential mediator of Rac/Cdc42 signaling, and we observe that Pak1 stimulates p38 activity. A dominant negative Pak1 suppresses both interleukin-1- and Rac/Cdc42-induced p38 activity. Rac and Cdc42 appear to regulate a protein kinase cascade initiated at the level of Pak and leading to activation of p38 and JNK."
https://openalex.org/W2114437978,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that regulate gene transcription in response to peroxisome proliferators and fatty acids. PPARs also play an important role in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation. It is unclear, however, what naturally occurring compounds activate each of the PPAR subtypes. To address this issue, a screening assay was established using heterologous fusions of the bacterial tetracycline repressor to several members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family. This assay was employed to compare the activation of PPAR family members by known PPAR activators including peroxisome proliferators and fatty acids. Interestingly, the activation of PPARs by fatty acids was partially inhibited by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, which prevents prostaglandin synthesis. Indeed, prostaglandins PGA1 and 2, PGD1 and 2, and PGJ2-activated PPARs, while a number of other prostaglandins had no effect. We also screened a variety of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) for the ability to activate PPARs. 8(S)-HETE, but not other (S)-HETEs, was a strong activator of PPAR alpha. Remarkably, PPAR activation by 8(S)-HETE was stereoselective. In addition, 8(S)-HETE was able to induce differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. These results indicate that PPARs are differentially activated by naturally occurring eicosanoids and related molecules."

To define the molecular events involved in this process, we have analyzed the function of WNT7a, a secreted factor expressed in the dorsal ectoderm, and LMX1, a LIM homeodomain transcription factor expressed in the dorsal mesenchyme. Ectopic expression of Wnt7a is sufficient to induce and maintain Lmx1 expression in limb mesenchyme, both in vivo and in vitro. Ectopic expression of Lmx1 in the ventral mesenchyme is sufficient to generate double-dorsal limbs. Thus, the dorsalization of limb mesoderm appears to involve the WNT7a-mediated induction of Lmx1 in limb mesenchymal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055684980,"The Hsc70-interacting protein Hip, a tetratricopeptide repeat protein, participates in the regulation of the eukaryotic 70 kDa heat shock cognate Hsc70. One Hip oligomer binds the ATPase domains of at least two Hsc70 molecules dependent on activation of the Hsc70 ATPase by Hsp40. While hydrolysis remains the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle, Hip stabilizes the ADP state of Hsc70 that has a high affinity for substrate protein. Through its own chaperone activity, Hip may contribute to the interaction of Hsc70 with various target proteins. We propose a mechanism for the regulation of eukaryotic Hsc70 that is distinct from that of bacterial Hsp70. The Hsc70/Hsp40/Hip system is apparently independent of a GrpE-like nucleotide exchange factor."
https://openalex.org/W1966760093,"The chaperonin GroEL is a large, double-ring structure that, together with ATP and the cochaperonin GroES, assists protein folding in vivo. GroES forms an asymmetric complex with GroEL in which a single GroES ring binds one end of the GroEL cylinder. Cross-linking studies reveal that polypeptide binding occurs exclusively to the GroEL ring not occupied by GroES (trans). During the folding reaction, however, released GroES can rebind to the GroEL ring containing polypeptide (cis). The polypeptide is held tightly in a proteolytically protected environment in cis complexes, in the presence of ADP. Single turnover experiments with ornithine transcarbamylase reveal that polypeptide is productively released from the cis but not the trans complex. These observations suggest a two-step mechanism for GroEL-mediated folding. First, GroES displaces the polypeptide from its initial binding sites, sequestering it in the GroEL central cavity. Second, ATP hydrolysis induces release of GroES and productive release of polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2052406246,"The karyophilic properties of the viral matrix (MA) protein govern HIV nuclear import in nondividing cells such as macrophages. A critical regulator of this process is the C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation of MA during virus maturation. Here, we reveal the mechanism of this phenomenon, by demonstrating that tyrosine phosphorylation induces the binding of MA to integrase (IN). This leads to the incorporation of MA molecules into virus cores, and subsequently into uncoated viral nucleoprotein complexes. A direct interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated MA and the central domain of IN can be demonstrated in vitro. It is blocked by phosphotyrosine, indicating that IN recognizes the phosphorylated C-terminal residue of MA. These results explain how the karyophilic potential of MA is conferred to the HIV nucleoprotein complex."
https://openalex.org/W2026046334,"Cdx1 is expressed along the embryonic axis from day 7.5 postcoitum until day 12, by which time the anterior limit of expression has regressed from the hindbrain level to the forelimb bud region. To assign a functional role for Cdx1 in murine embryonic development, we have inactivated the gene via homologous recombination. Viable fertile homozygous mutant mice were obtained that show anterior homeotic transformations of vertebrae. These abnormalities were concomitant with posterior shifts of Hox gene expression domains in the somitic mesoderm. The presence of putative Cdx1-binding sites in Hox gene control regions as well as in vitro transactivation of Hoxa-7 indicates a direct regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2158595559,"In C. elegans embryogenesis, the MS blastomere produces predominantly mesodermal cell types, while its sister E generates only endodermal tissue. We show that a maternal gene, pop-1, is essential for the specification of MS fate and that a mutation in pop-1 results in MS adopting an E fate. Previous studies have shown that the maternal gene skn-1 is required for both MS and E development and that skn-1 encodes a transcription factor. We show here that the pop-1 gene encodes a protein with an HMG box similar to the HMG boxes in the vertebrate lymphoid-specific transcriptional regulators TCF-1 and LEF-1. We propose that POP-1 and SKN-1 function together in the early embryo to allow MS-specific differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2084072384,"The release of iron from transferrin (Tf) in the acidic milieu of endosomes and its translocation into the cytosol are integral steps in the process of iron acquisition via receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME). The translocated metal is thought to enter a low molecular weight cytoplasmic pool, presumed to contain the form of iron which is apparently sensed by iron responsive proteins and is the direct target of iron chelators. The process of iron delivery into the cytoplasmic chelatable pool of K562 cells was studied in situ by continuous monitoring of the fluorescence of cells loaded with the metal-sensitive probe calcein. Upon exposure to Tf at 37°C, intracellular fluorescence decayed, corresponding to an initial iron uptake of 40 nM/min. The Tf-mediated iron uptake was profoundly inhibited by weak bases, the protonophore monensin, energy depletion, or low temperatures (<25°C), all properties characteristic of RME. Cell iron levels were affected by the slowly permeating chelator desferrioxamine only after prolonged incubations. Conversely, rapidly penetrating, lipophilic iron(II) chelators such as 2,2′-bipyridyl, evoked swift increases in cell calcein fluorescence, equivalent to sequestration of 0.2-0.5 μM cytosolic iron, depending on the degree of pre-exposure to Tf. Addition of iron(III) chelators to permeabilized 2,2′-bipyridyl-treated cells, failed to reveal significant levels of chelatable iron(III). The finding that the bulk of the in situ cell chelatable pool is comprised of iron(II) was corroborated by pulsing K562 cells with Tf-55Fe, followed by addition of iron(II) and/or iron(III) chelators and extraction of chelator-55Fe complexes into organic solvent. Virtually all of the accumulated 55Fe in the chelatable pool could be complexed by iron(II) chelators. The cytoplasmic concentration of iron(II) fluctuated between 0.3 and 0.5 μM, and its mean transit time through the chelatable pool was 1-2 h. We conclude that after iron is translocated from the endosomes, it is maintained in the cytosol as a transit pool of chelatable iron(II). The ostensible absence of chelatable iron(III) implicates the intracellular operation of vigorous reductive mechanisms.

Cell iron metabolism is characterized by regulated trafficking of the metal between different cellular stations. In animal cells, these include supply stations such as transferrin (Tf) 1The abbreviations used are: TftransferrinRMEreceptor-mediated endocytosisBIP2,2′-BipyridylPDT3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazineDFOdesferrioxamine methylsulfonatePHE1,10-phenanthrolineSIHsalicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazonePIHpyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazoneFASferrous ammonium sulfateDTPAdiethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acidBPSbathophenanthroline disulfonic acidMADmethylanthranilic acid-DFONTAnitrilotriacetic acidMEMminimum essential mediumAMacetoxymethyl ester. -containing endosomes and cytosolic ferritin and target stations in the cytosol and organelles(3Crichton R.R. Ward R.J. Laufer R.B. Iron and Human Diseases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 23-76Google Scholar). The crossroad between the different stations has been associated with a cytoplasmic pool of low molecular weight iron (2Jacobs A. Blood. 1977; 50: 4331-4336Crossref Google Scholar, 3Crichton R.R. Ward R.J. Laufer R.B. Iron and Human Diseases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 23-76Google Scholar, 4Pollack S. Am. J. Hematol. 1992; 39: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) which is also presumed to be the immediate intracellular target of iron chelators(5Hershko C. Weatherall D.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1988; 26: 303-345Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Rothman R.J. Serroni A. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 703-710PubMed Google Scholar). The trafficking of iron is assumed to be regulated by appropriate adjustments in the levels of membrane Tf receptors (Tf-R) (iron acquisition) and cytosolic ferritin (iron storage). A key step in that regulatory process is the monitoring of a loosely bound form of the iron in the “chelatable pool,” which reflects the metabolic status of iron in the cell. This has been attributed to a cytosolic iron-responsive protein which contains a 3Fe-4S cubane cluster that reversibly forms a 4Fe-4S complex in the presence of excess iron. Partial iron occupancy of the cluster has been implicated in the conversion to the iron-responsive protein conformation which is active in translational regulation of cellular Tf-R and ferritin levels(7Klausner R.D.

Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis 2,2′-Bipyridyl 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine desferrioxamine methylsulfonate 1,10-phenanthroline salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone ferrous ammonium sulfate diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid methylanthranilic acid-DFO nitrilotriacetic acid minimum essential medium acetoxymethyl ester. The importance of the chelatable iron pool in iron metabolism is generally accepted, although it has been difficult to assess both quantitatively and qualitatively. Analytical techniques which depend on cell-disruptive steps are of limited use, due to the dynamic nature of the cytosolic iron pool and the metastable properties of the metal in ambient conditions. Nonetheless, cell extracts were shown to contain a chelatable form of iron which is distinct from tightly bound metal(6Rothman R.J. Serroni A. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 703-710PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ponka P. Grady R.W. Wilczynska A. Schulman H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 802: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Baker E.

Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1993; 15: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Likewise, soluble cell fractions have been found to contain low molecular weight forms of iron which are chromatographically separable from ferritin and other iron-binding proteins(2Jacobs A. Blood. 1977; 50: 4331-4336Crossref Google Scholar, 3Crichton R.R. Ward R.J. Laufer R.B. Iron and Human Diseases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 23-76Google Scholar, 4Pollack S. Am. J. Hematol. 1992; 39: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A number of putative iron ligands have been identified, including peptides(11Deighton N. Hider R.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 490-497Crossref Google Scholar), proteins(12Nunez N.T. Coles E.S. Glass J. Blood. 1980; 55: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Conrad M.E. Umbreit J.N. Moore E.G.

Hematol. 1992; 39: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, their association with the chelatable iron pools prevailing in intact cells has not been unequivocally established. The same degree of uncertainty exists regarding the relative levels of di- and trivalent iron forms present in the cytosolic (chelatable) pool. Physicochemical determinations of iron in tissue and cell preparations implicated iron(II) as the most abundant low molecular weight form of the metal(25Pierre St., T.G. Richardson D.R. Baker E. Webb J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, chemical determinations of iron in cell and tissue extracts have given variable values, a situation which reflects the propensity of iron(II) for oxidation(2Jacobs A. Blood. 1977; 50: 4331-4336Crossref Google Scholar, 4Pollack S. Am. J. Hematol. 1992; 39: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Rothman R.J. Serroni A. Farber J.L. Mol.

In this work we assessed the in situ levels and chemical forms of chelatable iron which prevail in the cytosol of K562 cells. We used the method of continuous monitoring of intracellular fluorescence associated with the metal-sensitive probe calcein(1Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik Z.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This method, in conjunction with the application of permeant and impermeant iron(II) and iron(III) chelators, provided information regarding: (a) the dynamics of cytosolic (chelatable) iron delivery from endocytosed Tf, (b) the chemical form (i.e. valence) of iron associated with the chelatable pool, and (c) the maintenance of that pool under different iron supply conditions. A complementary methodology was adapted here for quantitative analysis of cell chelatable iron, based on labeling with radioactive 55Fe and direct cell extraction of chelator-55Fe complexes with an organic solvent. It enabled us to reinforce the basic findings obtained by non-invasive fluorimetry and also to provide estimates for the mean transit time of Tf-derived iron through the chelatable pool. The methodologies offered also a convenient means for assessing chelators' capacity for iron sequestration and removal from cells, with implications for pathological conditions of iron overload. Calcein and its acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Ionophore A23187, octyl β-D-glucoside detergent, ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS), and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), nitrilotriacetate (NTA), and bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid (BPS) were from Sigma. All materials were of the highest available grade. The following iron chelators were prepared as 50 mM stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide: 2,2′-bipyridyl (BIP), 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine (PDT) (from Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), desferrioxamine methylsulfonate (from Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland), 1,10-phenanthroline (PHE) (from BDH Chemicals, Poole, United Kingdom); salicylaldehyde and pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazones (SIH and PIH) were generous gifts from Dr. P. Ponka (Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Montreal, Canada); methylanthranilic-DFO (MAD) was prepared by Dr. Brenda Meister (Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel). Chromatographically pure Tf and apo-Tf were from Kama-Da Industries (Kibbutz Kama, Israel). Human erythroleukemia K562 cells were propagated in α-MEM medium containing 7% fetal calf serum supplemented with L-glutamine and antibiotics(1Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik Z.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were loaded at a density of 1-3 × 106 cells/ml with 0.125 μM calcein-AM for 5 min at 37°C in HEPES-buffered, bicarbonate-free α-MEM medium containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3 (α-MEM-HEP), washed of excess calcein-AM, resuspended in α-MEM-HEP medium, and maintained at room temperature until use. Just prior to measurements, 1 ml of calcein-loaded cell suspension (approximately 5 × 106 cells) was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, and the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of prewarmed 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.3 (HBS buffer). The cell suspension was transferred to a stirred, thermostated (37°C) cuvette, and fluorescence measurements were initiated. The magnitude of the base-line fluorescent signal remained relatively stable throughout the measurements, the estimated leakage of the probe was lower than 10%/h at 37°C. A fluorescence-quenching, anti-calcein antibody (10 μl/cuvette) was added to eliminate all extracellular fluorescence, which amounted to approximately 2% of the total fluorescence. The base-line signal under this condition remained stable for ≥20 min, indicating minimal leakage of the probe during the experimental period. Detergent permeabilization of the cells in the presence of the anti-calcein antibody resulted in 90% quenching, therefore experiments involving cell permeabilization with the detergent were carried out in the absence of antibody. Calcein fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 517 nm; slits, 10 nm) was measured in a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B fluorimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder and magnetic stirrer. Data were recorded on line on a GP-100 Graphics Printer (Perkin-Elmer). Optimal fluorescence setting might differ for different instrument brands. The concentration of free calcein inside cells was found to be directly proportional to the length of incubation and calcein-AM concentration. It was estimated as follows: approximately 2 × 107 calcein-loaded cells were centrifuged in a narrow-bore microcentrifuge giving a packed cell volume of 20 μl. The cell pellet was solubilized in 2 ml of HBS buffer containing 1.5% octyl glucoside and 200 μM DTPA. The calcein concentration in the cell lysate was determined from its fluorescence and compared with that of calcein standards in the same solution, giving an intracellular calcein concentration of 20 μM. The relationship between fluorescence changes and intracellular iron concentration was determined for each experiment as follows. A base-line signal was obtained for a suspension of cells in the cuvette. Ionophore A23187 (10 μM) was added (this produced a < 5% change in the signal), followed by serial doses of 0.5 or 1.0 μM iron(II) added as FAS, and the change in the fluorescence corresponding to each dose was recorded. The procedure of Klausner et al.(14Klausner R.D. Van Renswoude J. Ashwell G. Kempf C. Schechter A.N. Dean A. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4715-4724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications was used. 55FeCl3, 0.4 mCi, (Amersham, Bucks, UK) was complexed to NTA at a ratio of 0.18 μmol of Fe:1.8 μmol of NTA, followed by the addition of 0.045 μmol of apotransferrin dissolved in 0.5 M Tris•HCl, 0.1 mM NaHCO3, pH 8.5. Tf-55Fe was separated from non-bound 55Fe by gel filtration on a PD-10 column pre-equilibrated with HBS (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). A 55FeCl3•NTA complex at a 1:20 molar ratio was prepared and diluted to a final concentration of 0.43 μM55FeCl3 in HBS buffer containing 0.25% Triton X-100 (the detergent was present in order to mimic the conditions used with cellular extracts). Various chelators were added from concentrated stocks to 0.5 ml of the 55Fe•NTA solution. Following a 10-min incubation at room temperature, 0.5 ml of benzyl alcohol was added, and the tubes were shaken vigorously for 40 s and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 5 min in order to separate the two phases(17Roberts S. Bomford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19181-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of 300 μl were removed from the top (aqueous phase) and the bottom (benzyl alcohol phase) layers for scintillation counting. In experiments with cells, to a suspension of approximately 5 × 107 cells in 20 ml of α-MEM-HEP medium was added Tf-55Fe (final Tf concentration 5 μg/ml), and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were then washed twice, resuspended in HBS buffer, and divided into equal aliquots of approximately 5 × 106 cells in 1 ml. Various chelators were added to the cell suspensions, followed by incubation for 10 min at 37°C. The cells were then centrifuged (a sample of the supernatant was taken for determination of 55Fe release) and washed twice in 1 ml of HBS. Cell pellets were solubilized by the addition of 0.6 ml of HBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and incubation for 5 min at room temperature. Particulate debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. A 0.5-ml sample of the cell extract was added to 0.5 ml of benzyl alcohol and the two-phase extraction was carried out as described above. The denatured cell protein formed a precipitate at the interface between the two phases. This precipitate contained 5-10% of the total 55Fe, but was not routinely quantified. We have utilized the fluorescent probe calcein to study the uptake of iron from Tf. Addition of 50 μg/ml Tf to a suspension of calcein-loaded K562 cells at 37°C resulted in a slow time-dependent quenching of intracellular fluorescence (Fig. 1). The quenching rate was linear for 8-12 min, after which it leveled off. The intracellular location of calcein was ascertained in this experiment by the presence of specific anti-calcein antibody which quenches all extracellular calcein fluorescence; intracellular calcein is not accessible to the antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, the estimated uptake of iron derived from Tf was 0.04 μM iron/min at 37°C and was virtually undetectable at temperatures below 25°C (bottom traces in Fig. 1). In contrast, the uptake of iron(II) from the medium (10 μM FAS) occurred at 0.16 and 0.14 μM Fe/min at 37 and 25°C, respectively. It was also less sensitive to temperature, as expected for a facilitated diffusion-controlled process (see also (1Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik Z.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In order to confirm that the quenching of intracellular calcein is the consequence of the established endocytic pathway of uptake of iron from Tf, we tested the effects of several classical inhibitors of RME(14Klausner R.D. Van Renswoude J. Ashwell G. Kempf C. Schechter A.N. Dean A. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4715-4724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Thorstensen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16837-16841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monensin, chloroquine, and NH4Cl, all of which alkalinize acidic compartments, and the metabolic poison sodium azide, inhibited the rate of quenching of calcein (Table 1).Table 1 Open table in a new tab The affinity constants of calcein for iron(II) and (III) are very similar to those of EDTA (1014 and 1024M-1, respectively), based on our measurements of the capacity of EDTA to prevent the quenching of calcein fluorescence by iron(II) and (III). These estimates are compatible with the structure of calcein, since it contains two ethyleneaminediacetate iron binding moieties identical to those in EDTA. Addition of iron(II) as FAS to a calcein solution at a 1:1 molar ratio resulted in 41% quenching of the fluorescence (Fig. 2, trace a). This quenching was readily reversible by the addition of iron(III) chelators such as SIH and DFO (Fig. 2, traces c and d), but not by iron(II) chelators such as BIP, BPS, or PHE (Fig. 2, trace d). The latter group caused dequenching only in the presence of ascorbate, as exemplified for BIP (Fig. 2, traces a and b). The degree of dequenching of cytoplasmic calcein by a high affinity iron chelator could provide an indication of the amount of cellular iron bound to calcein (Fig. 3). Exposure of calcein-loaded K562 cells to the chelators DFO and BPS caused no short term change in the signal, probably due to their membrane impermeability. However, the permeant chelator BIP (but not its inactive isomer 4,4′-bipyridyl, not shown), produced a marked increase in the fluorescence, corresponding to 0.27 μM iron (Fig. 3, trace a). Following exposure of the cells to 50 μg/ml Tf for 6 min, the magnitude of BIP-chelatable iron level increased to a value of 0.51 μM (Fig. 3, trace b). This increment is in full agreement with the rate of iron uptake of 0.04 μM/min estimated from Fig. 1 and indicates that BIP chelates the accumulated calcein-bound iron with high efficiency. Exposure of the cells to 10 μM iron(II), in the form of FAS, produced a further rise in the BIP-chelatable iron level (0.76 μM) (Fig. 3, trace c). However, when high levels of iron(II) were acquired from FAS, a portion of the internalized iron was lost from calcein after removal of the external FAS. This is manifested by the slow upward trend of the fluorescent signal in trace c after washing of the cells. Whether this occurred due to efflux of iron out of the cells down the outwardly directed concentration gradient, or removal of iron from calcein by cytoplasmic-binding factors, is not clear. The purpose of the experiments shown in Fig. 4 was to assess (i) whether all the calcein-detectable cytoplasmic iron is iron(II) (i.e. BIP-reactive), (ii) the relative levels of iron(II) and iron(III) in the chelatable pool, and (iii) whether the presence of calcein affected Tf-mediated iron(II) accumulation. Calcein-preloaded cells showed detectable levels of BIP-reactive iron(II), which increased after incubation with Tf (Fig. 4A, preloaded). Permeabilization by addition of a non-ionic detergent (0.75% octyl β-D-glucoside) caused transient noise due to changes in light scattering (shown as an interruption in the traces). Ascorbate was added to reduce any available iron (III) to iron(II) and to make it available for chelation by BIP. It led to a 15-20% increase in fluorescence. This indicates that the level of chelatable iron(III) present in the intact cytosol is relatively small and probably inaccessible to or unaffected by BIP. Moreover, even the above figure of 20% might be overestimated, since it might represent BIP-inaccessible iron(II) that had undergone rapid oxidation upon cell solubilization. DFO was added at the end of each set of experiments to ensure complete removal of all iron forms (II and III) bound to calcein. Similar results were obtained when the order of exposure was reversed, i.e. the cells were first exposed to Tf and then loaded with calcein (Fig. 4B, postloaded). Addition of BIP 3 min after the detergent was ineffective in restoring fluorescence, unless reduction was artificially imposed by 50 μM ascorbate (Fig. 4C). In order to confirm that the calcein/BIP method provides a valid measure of the chelatable pool of cytoplasmic iron, K562 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of DFO for 20 h and then assayed for steady-state chelatable iron(II) as well as for delivery of iron(II) into this pool. As shown in Fig. 5(left side traces), the steady-state calcein/BIP-detectable iron(II) concentration was 0.40, 0.18, 0.13, and 0.06 μM, respectively, in cells treated with 0, 50, 100, and 300 μM DFO. The delivery of iron from Tf into the calcein-detectable pool was also affected by DFO, as shown in Fig. 5(right side traces). After exposure of the cells to 50 μg/ml of Tf for 8-10 min, the estimated chelatable iron(II) concentration (determined from BIP dequenching) was 0.81, 0.76, 0.32, and 0 μM, respectively, in cells treated with 0, 50, 100, and 300 μM DFO. The addition of SIH (a membrane permeable chelator which binds both iron(II) and (III)) revealed the presence of a minor BIP-inaccessible pool, which may correspond to iron(III); however, this pool was not significantly affected by the DFO pretreatments. We applied an independent method of estimating the chelatable iron(II) pool using 55Fe as a tracer. The water-soluble complex 55Fe(III)•NTA was 98% retained in the water phase in the absence of chelators, but in the presence of 100 μM PIH, SIH, and MAD, >97% of the 55Fe was found in the alcohol phase (Fig. 6). This occurred regardless of the presence or absence of ascorbate, which is consistent with the known capacity of these chelators to bind both iron(II) and iron(III)(8Ponka P. Grady R.W. Wilczynska A. Schulman H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 802: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Loyevsky M. Lytton S. Meister B. Libman J. Shanzer A. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, the iron(II)-specific chelators BIP and PHE translocated the 55Fe into the organic phase only in the presence of ascorbate. The slightly elevated chelation of 55Fe(III) by PHE can be attributed to a shift in the iron(II):iron(III) equilibrium induced by this powerful iron(II) chelator. In the case of DFO, only 42% of the total DFO•55Fe(III) complex was extracted into benzyl alcohol, whereas 44% was retained in the water phase, and 14% was presumably trapped at the interphase. This occurred because the partition of the chelator-iron complexes into benzyl alcohol is directly related to their hydrophobicity, so the hydrophilic DFO was extracted inefficiently. The DFO analogue, MAD, contains a methylanthranilate group attached to DFO, which renders the molecule sufficiently hydrophobic to be organic-solvent extractable. The benzyl alcohol extraction system was applied to the determination of chelatable iron in intact cells (Fig. 7). K562 cells which had accumulated 55Fe from Tf were incubated for 10 min with 200 μM chelators, and the chelator-bound 55Fe associated with the cells after washing was determined in the cell extracts. In the absence of added chelators 1.0 ± 0.4% of the total cellular 55Fe was extracted into the organic phase, whereas 82 ± 4.6% was water-soluble. The residual 15-17% of the 55Fe was principally found in the denatured protein fraction which precipitated at the water-benzyl alcohol interphase. The iron(II)-specific chelators BIP, PHE, and PDT chelated 15-22% of the cellular 55Fe when they were added to intact cells. Similar values were obtained when these chelators were added to cells together with Triton X-100 detergent during preparation of the cell extracts (data not shown). The iron(II)/(III) binding chelators PIH, SIH, and MAD chelated 14.5-16.5% of the 55Fe when they were added to the cells together with the solubilizing buffer (systems labeled with an asterisk in Fig. 7). However, in intact cells they appeared to chelate only 8-9% of the 55Fe. Examination of the cell supernatants following the 10-min incubation with the chelators revealed that although BIP and PDT did not cause a significant efflux of 55Fe from the cells, PHE, PIH, SIH, and MAD caused losses of 55Fe from the cells ranging from 6 to 30% (data not shown), presumably due to their capacity for shuttling iron in and out of cells(8Ponka P. Grady R.W. Wilczynska A. Schulman H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 802: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This would explain the apparently reduced chelation by PIH, SIH, and MAD in intact cells. An average of 0.011 nmol of 55Fe/5 × 106 cells were incorporated from Tf during the 30-min incubation, of which an average of 0.0022 nmol of 55Fe/5 × 106 cells were present in the chelatable iron(II) pool. Using an approximate value of 1000 fl/cell for the cellular volume(19Law F.-Y. Steinfeld R. Knauf P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: C68-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we calculate that the iron(II) concentration in the chelatable pool is approximately 0.44 μM. The organic extraction system permitted the estimation of the time spent by incoming 55Fe in the chelatable pool (Fig. 8). At the conclusion of a 30-min pulse with Tf-55Fe, 18.1% of the incorporated 55Fe was found in the BIP- and PIH-chelatable pool. This level decreased in a linear fashion for 2 h (down to 3.4%) and thereafter declined more slowly. The 55Fe in the non-chelatable pool increased proportionately. Therefore the estimated transit time through the chelatable pool is approximately 2 h. Since this value was obtained by chasing the incorporated 55Fe with saturating amounts of unlabeled Tf-iron, it is presumed to represent the maximal rate of flow of iron through the system. Calcein is a derivative of fluorescein with two metal binding moieties and affinities for iron(II) and iron(III) identical to those of EDTA (1014 and 1024M-1, respectively, in aqueous salt solutions). Quenching of fluorescence ensues upon binding of iron and other metals, but not Ca(II) or Mg(II), even at 1000-fold excess. In physiological salt solutions, binding to iron(II) is considerably faster than to iron(III), reflecting the different solubility and chemical activity of the two forms of iron(1Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik Z.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However iron(II) rapidly oxidizes upon binding to the probe in ambient air, as noticed previously with other chelators(20Burkitt M.J. Gilbert B.C. Free Radical Res. Comm. 1991; 14: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consequently, the quenched fluorescence of the calcein-iron(II) complex in solution is fully restored by addition of excess chelators such as DTPA, DFO, SIH, and PIH, but not by iron(II)-specific chelators such as BIP, PHE, PDT, or BPS. The latter require the presence of a reducing agent (Fig. 2). Calcein loaded into cells was recently used by us for measuring uptake of non-transferrin bound iron(II) and other metals into K562 and other cells. Fluorescent cell imaging showed it to be homogeneously distributed in the cytosol(1Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik Z.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitivity of iron uptake measurements was found to be inversely proportional to the intracellular calcein concentration, i.e. the lower the background fluorescence, the greater the iron-mediated quenching response. Hence, Tf-mediated iron uptake could be detected in K562 cells loaded with 0.125 μM (this study), but not with 0.5 μM(1Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik Z.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) calcein-AM, containing, respectively, 20 and 140 μM intracellular calcein, presumably due to the higher signal-to-noise ratio at lower calcein levels. The presence of 20 μM calcein in the cytoplasm does not appear to significantly affect the chelatable iron pool, since (i) calcein-detectable cellular iron levels were similar when cells were loaded with calcein before or after exposure to Tf (Fig. 4, A and B), and (ii) in cells labeled with 55Fe and then loaded with increasing concentrations of calcein (20-140 μM inside), the level of BIP-chelatable 55Fe increased by ≤9% relative to controls (not shown). Also, in cells preloaded with calcein (20 μM inside) and then labeled with Tf-55Fe, the level of the BIP-chelatable 55Fe pool was increased by 18% relative to controls (not shown), indicating that calcein competes weakly with intracellular ligands for iron(II) entering the cytoplasm. The present assessment of the chelatable iron pool in situ in K562 cells is based on the availability of fast permeating high affinity chelators and their capacity to abstract iron from calcein, causing a dequenching of its fluorescence. Although only data with BIP are shown, virtually identical responses were obtained with two other iron(II) chelators, PHE and PDT, and with the iron(II) and (III) chelators, SIH and PIH. All these permeant chelators acted apparently on common cellular iron pool sources, as judged by the fact that pretreatment of cells with one precluded further iron retrieval by the other. The poorly permeant DFO acted only after prolonged incubations with cells or after permeabilization with detergent. However, as with SIH, DFO also failed to increase the fluorescence in solubilized cells pre-exposed to BIP (Fig. 4). Taken together, the data shown in Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5: indicate that the calcein-detectable iron pool of K562 cells is composed primarily of iron(II) with a possible minor component of iron(III). This conclusion is compatible with our previous results that the divalent metal-specific ionophore A23187, in the presence of an extracellular metal sink, DTPA, could mobilize iron out of the cells (1Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik Z.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present value of 0.2-0.5 μM chelatable iron might be somewhat underestimated, as some chelatable iron might be bound to ligands with higher affinity than calcein. Nonetheless, the above value is comparable with that obtained in 55Fe labeling experiments (see below) and with rough estimates in the literature of 0.5-1.0 μM cytosolic iron(3Crichton R.R. Ward R.J. Laufer R.B. Iron and Human Diseases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 23-76Google Scholar, 5Hershko C. Weatherall D.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1988; 26: 303-345Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An independent confirmation for the idea that iron(II) is the major component of the chelatable iron pool was obtained with the aid of a method for hydrophobic metal-chelator extraction into benzyl alcohol(17Roberts S. Bomford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19181-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which allowed the separation of non-chelated iron from chelator-iron complexes (Fig. 6). This technique enabled us to quantitate the chelator-55Fe complexes in intact cells and in cell extracts (Fig. 7). The estimated 55Fe-labeled chelatable pool was similar for both iron(II)-specific and iron(II) and iron(III) chelators, from which we deduced that it is comprised primarily of iron(II). The value of a chelatable pool of 0.44 μM, which was similar to the one estimated with calcein (0.2-0.5 μM in Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:), represented approximately 18% of the total 55Fe acquired from Tf within 30 min. The bulk of this iron transited through the cytosol in about 2 h. Similar results were obtained in studies with rat hepatocytes labeled with 55FeCl3 and analyzed for DFO-chelatable 55Fe(6Rothman R.J. Serroni A. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 703-710PubMed Google Scholar). A cellular iron(II) pool has been suspected previously (3Crichton R.R. Ward R.J. Laufer R.B. Iron and Human Diseases.

Metals. 1991; 4: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and has been indicated by spectroscopic studies of rat liver extracts by electron paramagnetic resonance in conjunction with iron(II) chelation (10Yegorov D.Y. Kozlov A.V. Azizova O.A. Vladimirov Y.A. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1993; 15: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and of hepatoma cells by 55Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy (25Pierre St., T.G. Richardson D.R. Baker E. Webb J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, these approaches entailed disruption of cells, possibly inducing changes in the iron distribution(3Crichton R.R. Ward R.J. Laufer R.B. Iron and Human Diseases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 23-76Google Scholar). Our spectroscopic approach allowed dynamic and in situ monitoring of the cytosolic chelatable iron pool in living cells without violation of their integrity and proliferation capacity. 2H. Glickstein and Z. I. Cabantchik, unpublished data. Once cell integrity was disrupted, the technique fully reflected iron(II) oxidation by ambient air, as shown by BIP's failure to recover the metal-quenched fluorescence (Fig. 4C). The present approach provided a simple and quantitative tool for assessing (i) iron entry via facilitated diffusion or RME of Tf(22Young S.P. Bomford A. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), (ii) the efficacy and speed of action of iron chelators as scavengers of chelatable cell iron, and (iii) the status of chelatable cell iron, without apparently affecting the total cytosolic iron pools per se. Neither calcein nor specific iron(II) chelators such as BIP were found to significantly enhance conversion of iron(III) to iron(II) during measurements in aqueous solutions (Fig. 2, 4C, and 6). This would indicate that all fluorescence recovered by addition of BIP or other iron(II)-specific chelators to K562 cells represents actual intracellular iron(II). Results with other methods support that contention, however, they cannot unequivocally discern between a genuine intracellular iron(II) pool and a coexisting mixed pool of iron(II) and iron(III) which is very rapidly reduced upon addition of iron(II) chelators such as BIP. Such putative and extremely fast reduction of iron(III) might be compatible with the reducing conditions proposed to prevail in the cytosol of most cells(26Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9397-9400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, for reduction to occur intracellularly only when driven by iron(II) chelation is rather unlikely and is not supported by studies with calcein in solution. Also, iron acquired by RME of Tf showed qualitatively the chemical properties of iron(II), in agreement with previous studies(16Nunez M.-T. Gaete V. Watkins J.A. Glass J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6688-6692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bridges K.R. Cudkowicz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12970-12977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Iron(II) is most likely the form which is incorporated into ferritin(27Bakker G.R. Boyer R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13182-13185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), heme(28Dailey H.A. Sellers V.M. Dailey T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 390-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and possibly ribonucleotide reductase (31Mulliez E. Fontecave M. Gaillard J. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2296-2299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and iron-responsive protein(29Constable A. Quick S. Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4554-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although this form might compromise cell integrity due to its potential for participation in Fenton reactions(30McCord J.M. Laufer R.B. Iron and Human Diseases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 509-518Google Scholar), it might represent the metabolically active form of the metal.

Bohn and co-workers originally isolated a glycoprotein from human placenta that they designated placental protein 14 or PP14 1The abbreviations used are: PP14placental protein 14PAEPprogesterone-associated endometrial proteinESelectrosprayFABfast atom bombardmentGCgas chromatographyHexhexoseHexNAcN-acetylhexosaminelacdiNAcN,N‘-diacetyllactosediaminelacNAcN-acetyllactosamineLCmicrobore liquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometryPNGase Fpeptide N-glycosidase FrHPCrecombinant human Protein CTICtotal ion chromatogram. (Bohn et al., 1982). PP14 was subsequently found to be synthesized not by the placenta but by the secretory and decidualized endometrium (Julkunen et al., 1986a, 1988). PP14 was therefore also referred to as progesterone-associated endometrial protein or PAEP in accordance with its endometrial origin. More recent evidence indicates that PAEP is also synthesized by the hematopoietic tissues of the bone marrow (Kamarainen et al., 1994) and perhaps other tissues. Since the glycoprotein referred to as PP14 or PAEP is not of placental origin nor is it exclusively synthesized in the endometrium, previous designations may not truly reflect its diverse sites of synthesis or its function. Therefore in this paper, we have designated PP14/PAEP as “glycodelin” to eliminate confusion over these issues and to emphasize the unique nature of oligosaccharides in this glycoprotein. placental protein 14 progesterone-associated endometrial protein electrospray fast atom bombardment gas chromatography hexose N-acetylhexosamine N,N‘-diacetyllactosediamine N-acetyllactosamine microbore liquid chromatography mass spectrometry peptide N-glycosidase F recombinant human Protein C total ion chromatogram. The temporal and spatial expression of glycodelin in the reproductive organs of the human female is highly regulated. During the menstrual cycle, glycodelin is not expressed in the proliferative endometrium but increases significantly from the fourth postovulatory day, peaking around the 12th day (Julkunen et al., 1986a). Thus glycodelin expression is at a minimum during the peri-ovulatory period of the cycle. However, at the time of implantation of the embryo, glycodelin synthesis in the decidua is induced to very high levels (4-10% of total protein) (Julkunen et al., 1985). Glycodelin is also secreted into the amniotic fluid in substantial amounts, reaching a peak in the 10th to 14th week of gestation (Julkunen et al., 1985). In addition, glycodelin is also found in the serum under normal conditions and during pregnancy, although at a much lower level than in amniotic fluid or decidual cells (Julkunen et al., 1986b). Glycodelin manifests several significant biological activities when tested in immunological assay systems. Crude decidual extracts containing this glycoprotein were initially shown to suppress thymidine uptake in both normal and mitogen-stimulated human mixed lymphocyte culture (Bolton et al., 1987; Pockley et al., 1988). Decidual extracts containing glycodelin also decreased the synthesis of cytokines (interleukin-1 and interleukin-2) and interleukin-2 receptors by mitogen-stimulated cells (Pockley and Bolton, 1989, 1990). Purified glycodelin also suppresses the lysis of K562 cells by human natural killer cells at low concentrations (Okamoto et al., 1991). Therefore, glycodelin may be one of several factors that induce highly regiospecific immunosuppression of the maternal response to the human embryo/fetus. Another significant biological activity of glycodelin is its ability to inhibit human sperm-zona pellucida binding in the hemizona assay system (Oehninger et al., 1995). To date, glycodelin is the most potent glycoprotein inhibitor of human sperm-zona pellucida binding in this assay system. We have recently proposed that human sperm-zona pellucida binding requires a selectin-like interaction between human sperm and human zona pellucida (Patankar et al., 1993a, 1993b). Therefore, we hypothesized that glycodelin probably manifested its immunosuppressive and contraceptive activities via its oligosaccharide chains. Previous work has indicated that this glycoprotein contains 17.5% carbohydrate by weight (Bohn et al., 1982). However, no oligosaccharide structures have been reported. In this study, we have performed structural analysis of glycodelin-derived N-linked oligosaccharides and glycopeptides using mapping strategies (Morris et al., 1983, Dell et al., 1983) based upon fast atom bombardment (FAB) and electrospray (ES) mass spectrometry. Glycodelin has three consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (Julkunen et al., 1988) (Fig. 1), and we have shown that the first two of these sites are glycosylated with defined and substantially different heterogeneous populations of glycans. Many of these glycans have antennae composed of sialylated or fucosylated GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc(lacdiNAc) sequences, which are rare in higher animals. N-Linked oligosaccharides of this type have been shown to be potent inhibitors of selectin-mediated adhesions (Grinnell et al., 1994), consistent with our hypothesis that glycodelin blocks both human sperm-zona pellucida binding and immune cell function via its oligosaccharide chains. Isolation and purification procedures were the same as those described elsewhere (Riittinen et al., 1991) using 140 ml of midtrimester amniotic fluid as starting material. Glycodelin (250 μg) was dialyzed against 4 × 2.0 liters of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at 4°C for 48 h. After lyophilization tryptic digestion was carried out as described (Dell et al., 1994). Glycodelin (160 μg) was dialyzed against 2 liters of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5 at 4°C for 12 h, after which time it was dialyzed against 2 liters of water for another 12 h at 4°C and then lyophilized. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in 100 μl of a solution of CNBr in 70% formic acid and left in the dark for 12 h. The reaction was terminated by drying in vacuo. An additional 5 μl of water was added and the sample dried in vacuo. The sample was then dissolved in 25 μl of triethylamine, 2.5 μl of water and reduced using a 4-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol over the number of S-S bridges. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37°C, after which time it was dried in vacuo. An additional 5 μl of water was added and the sample dried in vacuo. PNGase F (EC 3.2.2.18, Boehringer Mannheim) digestion was carried out on tryptic digests of glycodelin (250 μg) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer (50 mM, pH 8.4) for 16 h at 37°C using 0.6 unit of the enzyme. The reaction was terminated by lyophilization and the products were purified on C18-Sep-Pak (Waters Ltd.) as described (Dell et al., 1994). These were carried out on glycans released from 250 μg of glycodelin except for the α-mannosidase digest, where 80 μg was used. N-Acetyl-β-D-hexosaminidase (from bovine kidney, EC 3.2.1.30, Boehringer Mannheim): 0.2 unit in 100 μl of 50 mM sodium-citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4.6, initially for 18 h and then for another 18 h with another aliquot of fresh enzyme; β-galactosidase (from bovine testes, EC 3.2.1.23, Boehringer Mannheim): 10 milliunits in 100 μl of 50 mM sodium-citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4.6, for 12 h and then for another 12 h with another aliquot of fresh enzyme; α-L-fucosidase (from bovine kidney, EC 3.2.1.51, Boehringer Mannheim): 0.2 unit in 200 μl of 100 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.5-5.0, for 24 h; neuraminidase (from Vibrio cholerae, EC 3.2.1.18, Boehringer Mannheim): 25 milliunits in 100 μl of 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, for 24 h; α-mannosidase (from jack bean, EC 3.2.1.24, Boehringer Mannheim): 0.5 unit in 200 μl of 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, for a total of 48 h, a fresh aliquot of enzyme being added after each 12 h. All enzyme digestions were incubated at 37°C and terminated by boiling for 3 min before lyophilization. For sequential enzyme digestions, an appropriate aliquot was taken after each digestion and permethylated for FAB-MS analysis. The reagent was prepared by bubbling dry HCl gas into methanol as described (Dell et al., 1994). After cooling, a 20-μl aliquot of this reagent was added to the permethylated sample, which was then heated for 2 min at 40°C. A 1-μl aliquot was removed for FAB-MS analysis, and the remainder of the sample was dried under nitrogen. Permethylation using the sodium hydroxide procedure was performed as described (Dell et al., 1994). Partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from permethylated samples for GC-MS linkage analysis as described (Albersheim et al., 1967). Trimethylsilyl ether methyl glycosides were prepared for sugar analysis as described (Merkle and Poppe, 1994). GC-MS analysis was carried out on a Fisons Instruments MD800 machine fitted with a DB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm, internal diameter, J & W Scientific). The partially methylated alditol acetates were dissolved in hexanes prior to on-column injection at 65°C. The GC oven was held at 65°C for 1 min before being increased to 290°C at a rate of 8°C/min. FAB-MS spectra were acquired using a ZAB-2SE 2FPD mass spectrometer fitted with a cesium ion gun operated at 30 kV. Data acquisition and processing were performed using the VG Analytical Opus software. Solvents and matrices were as described (Dell et al., 1994). LC-ES-MS was performed on various digests of glycodelin using an on-line microbore reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography system (Brownlee C18 Aquapore column) coupled to a VG BioQ triple quadrupole electrospray mass spectrometer. The sample was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer A) for injection on the column. The column was held for 5 min at 0% B (90% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) followed by increase to 100% B over 90 min. The flow rate was 50 μl/min. After passage through a UV spectrophotometer with a microflow cell, monitoring at 214 nm, the eluant was mixed with a 1:1 mixture of propan-1-ol and 2-methoxyethanol prior to stream splitting 1:9 for ES-MS analysis and collection, respectively. A unique feature of mass spectrometry, namely the ability to derive definitive structural information from mixtures (in contrast to other spectroscopies normally requiring pure samples for study), was recognized and exploited by us in specifically designed strategies for “mixture analysis” some years ago (Geddes et al., 1969; Morris et al., 1971; Morris et al., 1978). The masses of component peaks alone (even in the absence of fragmentation) are diagnostic not only for the composition of biopolymers but also for sequence, by relating the masses observed to biosynthetic pathways (oligosaccharides) or amino acid/cDNA-derived sequences (oligopeptides), leading to the concept of mapping biopolymer structures by mass spectrometry (Lemaire et al., 1982; Dell et al., 1983; Morris et al., 1983). These strategies have been applied here to glycodelin to map and differentiate the glycopeptides from proteolytic digests and to define and locate glycosylation in the molecule. Glycodelin was digested sequentially with trypsin and PNGase F. Released glycans were separated from peptides and were analyzed by FAB-MS after permethylation (Fig. 2, Table 1). Notable features of these data are: (i) the major ion at m/z 1557 has the composition of a high mannose structure containing five mannoses; (ii) molecular ions corresponding to complex- and hybrid-type structures occur in the mass range from m/z 1800 to m/z 4000 and, taken together, these are significantly more abundant than m/z 1557; (iii) the majority of the molecular ions have compositions consistent with biantennary structures; (iv) the A-type fragment ions in Fig. 2b indicate that both Gal-GlcNAc (lacNAc) and GalNAc-GlcNAc (lacdiNAc) antennae are present; (v) the lacNAc and lacdiNAc antennae may be substituted with either sialic acid or fucose but not both; (vi) minor fragment ions of composition Hex2HexNAc2 and Hex3HexNAc3 are indicative of low levels of poly-N-acetyllactosamine.Table 1 Open table in a new tab FAB-MS was carried out on the tryptic digest before and after PNGase F digestion (Table 2). The following conclusions may be drawn from these data. (i) The molecular ion for the non-glycosylated peptide spanning the consensus site at Asn-85 was observed prior to PNGase F digestion and there was no evidence for the formation of its Asp-85 analogue after PNGase F digestion, indicating that Asn-85 is unlikely to be glycosylated; (ii) the tryptic peptide spanning Asn-28 was observed only after PNGase F digestion and its mass was consistent with conversion of Asn to Asp during the digestion, consistent with Asn-28 being glycosylated; (iii) the tryptic peptide corresponding to the third consensus site was not observed in these experiments.Table 2 Open table in a new tab Linkage analysis on the PNGase F-released glycans and their desialylated counterparts gave the data shown in Table 3. Key features of these data are as follows. (i) The majority of the complex glycans are biantennary but low levels of 2,4-Man and 2,6-Man suggest that minor tri- and/or tetraantennary structures are present; (ii) GalNAc, Gal, and Man are the major non-reducing sugars; (iii) after desialylation, 6-linked GalNAc and 6-linked Gal disappear and there is a concomitant increase in terminal GalNAc and terminal Gal, indicating that sialic acid residues were attached to the 6-positions of Gal and GalNAc prior to desialylation; (iv) some terminal GlcNAc is present but most of the GlcNAc is 4-linked, 3,4-linked, or 4,6-linked; (v) a very minor amount of 3-linked Gal is present, the majority of which is retained after desialylation and is therefore likely to be derived from the minor poly-N-acetyllactosamine moieties suggested by the FAB data (m/z 913 and 1362 in Fig. 2, see above); (vi) the minor 3,4,6-linked Man is indicative of some bisected structures; (vii) 3-linked Man and 6-linked Man are present but only as very minor components; they are indicative of hybrid and/or high mannose structures.Table 3 Open table in a new tab The attachment sites of the fucosyl residues were established by linkage analysis after removal of the fucoses by mild methanolysis and remethylation of the newly formed hydroxyl groups (see footnotes to Table 3). Comparison of linkage data before and after mild methanolysis indicates that loss of fucosyl residues from the antennae is accompanied by loss of the 3,4-linked GlcNAc and a concomitant increase in 4-linked GlcNAc. Importantly no 3-linked GlcNAc was observed after methanolysis. These data establish that fucose is attached to the 3-position of 3,4-linked GlcNAc. The glycan mixture was treated sequentially with α-sialidase, α-fucosidase, β-hexosaminidase, and β-galactosidase, and the reactions were monitored by FAB-MS after permethylation. The FAB spectrum of the fully digested sample was dominated by an A-type ion at m/z 872 (Hex3HexNAc+) and an [M + H]+ ion at m/z 1149 corresponding to Hex3HexNAc2 (data not shown), confirming that the majority of the complex structures can be degraded to the trimannosyl core by this series of exoglycosidases. Thus the NeuAc and Fuc residues are in normal α linkages and the Gal, GalNAc, and GlcNAc residues are all β linked. The signal at m/z 1557 (see Fig. 2) was unaffected by the above exoglycosidase digestions, a result that is consistent with the assignment of a high mannose structure to this ion. This was corroborated in a separate experiment in which the intact glycans were subjected to α-mannosidase digestion. The resulting FAB spectrum was very similar to Fig. 2 except that m/z 1557 had disappeared and a new signal was present at m/z 1149 corresponding to Man3GlcNAc2 (data not shown). In addition the signal at m/z 2368 was no longer present, consistent with the proposed composition of NeuAcHex6HexNAc3 (Table 1), which corresponds to a hybrid structure. In the analysis of tryptic digests of glycodelin, a well resolved intense late-eluting peak in the UV chromatogram gave electrospray data transformed to a mass of 4749, which maps onto the non-glycosylated disulfide bridged peptide Ile-84 to Arg-124. Summation of scans surrounding this peak and in earlier eluting fractions produced no evidence for glycosylated versions of this peptide (data not shown). Thus it is clear that site Asn-85 is not glycosylated at the level of detection of the method. In a separate experiment, glycodelin was digested with cyanogen bromide and following a disulfide reduction step the products were analyzed by on-line microbore LC-ES-MS (Table 4). Fig. 3 shows the UV (analog) trace above the total ion current (TIC) trace produced on ionization of samples entering the mass spectrometer ion source. The short time delay indicates the UV cell to source flow time at 100 μl min-1. Scans corresponding to UV and TIC peaks were summed, and the data on multiply charged ions thus created were transformed to give masses shown in Table 4. From these LC-ES-MS digest data, the whole of the molecule is effectively mapped, including the glycosylation sites discussed below. Scans 53-60 (analogue peak 7.10) gave the transformed ES mass spectrum shown in Fig. 4. The cluster of molecular ions observed is indicative of a heterogeneous mixture of glycopeptides. Taking into account the location of methionine in the sequence (Fig. 1), it was considered likely that this early eluting glycopeptide peak comprised glycoforms of the peptide spanning residues 25-32, which includes the consensus site at Asn-28. Subtraction of the mass of this peptide from each observed signal in the ES spectrum yields the tentative glycan compositions shown in Table 5. In order to confirm these assignments, including resolving the NeuAc/Fuc2 ambiguity (see legend to Table 5), and to check for additional minor components, the collected fractions 41-43 were pooled and digested with PNGase F. The released glycans were permethylated and analyzed by FAB-MS (Fig. 5, Table 6). The FAB data show that, with the exception of Hex4HexNAc5Fuc2, all the fucosylated glycans contain only a single fucose residue ruling out the other tentative Fuc2 assignments in Table 5. The FAB spectrum contains one minor molecular ion not observed in the ES spectrum (corresponding to NeuAcHex5HexNAc4Fuc), but otherwise all molecular ion signals observed in the FAB spectrum (Fig. 5, Table 6) have their counterparts in the ES spectrum (Fig. 4, Table 5). The peptide released in the glycanase experiment was found to produce a quasimolecular ion at m/z 834, corresponding to peptide residues 25-32. Glycosylation site 28 is thus proven to carry the glycans in Table 6, and the LC-ES-MS data show it to be well separated from other molecular species.Table 4 Open table in a new tab Figure 4:Transformed electrospray mass spectrum of the glycopeptides spanning Asn-28 of glycodelin.

The complex appearance of this spectrum, which contrasts with the clean single signals of different charge states expected for a peptide, is immediately indicative of the expected heterogeneity seen in a glycopeptide. Computing the charge states shown, and transformation of the data produces component masses of 11,835.5, 11,879.3, and 12,126.8 for the most abundant peaks. These masses are approximately 2000 Da higher than the anticipated mass of peptide Ala-33 to Met-117, indicating glycosylation of the peptide. The peptide contains potential glycosylation sites Asn-63 and Asn-85, but since we have already proven that Asn-85 is not glycosylated (see earlier FAB and ES mapping experiments), it follows that the glycans on peptide Ala-33 to Met-117 are attached to Asn-63. Their identities were studied in detail by FAB-MS analysis after their release by PNGase F from the glycopeptides in collected fractions 56-57 (see Fig. 7 and Table 7). It is noteworthy that the majority of glycans in this sample are different from those attached at Asn-28 (see below).Figure 7:FAB mass spectrum of permethylated released N-glycans from Asn-63 of glycodelin.

N-Glycans were isolated by Sep-Pak and the void fraction dried and permethylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table 7 Open table in a new tab Unequivocal evidence for full glycan occupancy of Asn-28 was provided by a combination of the FAB Mapping experiments on tryptic and PNGase F digests of glycodelin (Table 4) and the on-line LC-ES-mapping experiments on tryptic and CNBr digests (Fig. 3). The latter experiments also established that only one (Asn-63) of the remaining two consensus sites is glycosylated at observable levels (Fig. 6). The separation of the occupied sites in the LC-ES mapping experiments on reduced CNBr digests of glycodelin allowed identification of the differing oligosaccharide structures at Asn-28 and Asn-63 (see below). The proposed structures for the major oligosaccharides are shown in Fig. 8. The glycans fall into three classes, namely high mannose (i), hybrid (ii and iii) and complex (iv-xx), of which the first two classes are only found at Asn-28, whereas complex structures occur at both glycosylation sites. Among the complex structures only (ix and xiii) are common to both sites. The most notable differences between the complex structures at Asn-28 and Asn-63 are the increased levels of sialylation and fucosylation of the glycans at the latter site. The high sensitivity achieved in the FAB-MS analyses of the total glycan population allowed the detection of very minor components giving molecular ions at masses above m/z 3000 (see Fig. 2 and Table 1). These correspond to tri- and tetraantennary structures and/or bi- and tri-antennary structures with N-acetyllactosamine repeats in their antennae. The FAB fragmentation data and the linkage analysis results suggest that both types of structure are present (see above). The very low abundance of these components has to date precluded precise structural analysis or determination of attachment sites. The major non-reducing epitopes in the glycodelin complex-type glycans are: (i) Galβ1-4GlcNAc (lacNAc), (ii) GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc (lacdiNAc), (iii) NeuAcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc (sialylated lacNAc), (iv) NeuAcα2-6GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc (sialylated lacdiNAc), (v) Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc (LewisX), and (vi) GalNAcβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc (the lacdiNAc analogue of Lewisx). The relative abundances of molecular ions in the ES and FAB spectra indicated that lacNAc- and lacdiNAc-containing epitopes are of comparable abundance and that approximately 60% of the glycans are sialylated and about 20% of the glycans have fucosylated antennae. It is notable that about 30% of the biantennary glycans bear lacNAc and lacdiNAc antennae within a single structure. Additional quantitative information was obtained from sugar analysis of trimethylsilyl ether methyl glycosides of the total glycan population (data not shown). These experiments gave a Gal:GalNAc ratio (translating into a lacNAc:lacdiNAc ratio) of 1.2:1, which supports the conclusions from the MS data. The majority of the glycodelin N-linked oligosaccharides characterized in this study are not typically found in mammalian glycoproteins. In particular, the presence of lacdiNAc-containing antennae is unusual because, with the exception of the pituitary glycohormones, this sequence has been rarely observed in the glycoproteins of higher animals (see Dell and Khoo(1993), van den Eijnden et al.(1995), and references cited therein). The best characterized family of mammalian lacdiNAc glycoproteins are the pituitary glycohormones, which contain sulfated lacdiNAc structures (Baenziger and Green, 1988). The GalNAc transferase, which adds GalNAc to these glycoproteins, recognizes the tripeptide motif Pro-Xaa-Arg/Lys (PXR/K) located 6-9 residues NH2-terminal to an Asn glycosylation site (Smith and Baenziger, 1992). This GalNAc transferase, together with the sulfotransferase responsible for synthesizing the unique sulfated epitope on the pituitary glycohormones, is present in a number of tissues other than the pituitary, and the two enzymes appear to be co-ordinately expressed (Dharmesh et al., 1993). However, we consider it unlikely that glycodelin is a substrate for the PXR/K-specific GalNAc transferase because it does not contain a recognition motif 6-9 residues upstream of either glycosylation site. Furthermore, we were not able to detect sulfated structures in glycodelin using acetylation/FAB-MS strategies, which are optimized for the detection of sulfated oligosaccharides (data not shown) (Khoo et al., 1993). Non-sulfated lacdiNAc structures of the type present in glycodelin have previously been found in a three categories of mammalian glycoproteins. The first comprises glycoproteins produced by bovine mammary glands, including lactotransferrin (Coddeville et al., 1992), CD36 (Nakata et al., 1993), and butyrophilin (Sato et al., 1995). The second contains three human glycoproteins, all of which are serine proteases with important physiological functions, namely Bowes melanoma tissue plasminogen activator (Chan et al., 1991) and urinary type plasminogen activator (urokinase) (Bergwerff et al., 1992), both of which convert plasminogen to plasmin, and urinary kallidinogenase (Tomiya et al., 1993), which cleaves kininogens to liberate lysyl-bradykinin, a vasoactive peptide. The third category contains only a single glycoprotein at present, namely human recombinant Protein C (rHPC) expressed in human kidney 293 cells (Yan et al., 1993), but we anticipate the discovery of many more examples with the increasing use of this human cell line for the expression of recombinant glycoproteins. Due to its availability in large quantities, rHPC is among the best characterized of the mammalian lacdiNAc-containing glycoproteins. Like glycodelin, rHPC carries a heterogeneous population of complex-type oligosaccharides composed of lacNAc and lacdiNAc building blocks, which are substituted with either sialic acid or fucose (Yan et al., 1993). Interestingly, the sialylated lacNAc antennae in rHPC have both α2-3 and α2-6 linked sialic acid, but the the former linkage was not observed in the lacdiNAc antennae. It is notable that NeuAcα2-3GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc has not, to our knowledge, been found in mammalian glycoproteins, although this structure has been identified in serine proteases derived from snake venoms (Pfeiffer et al., 1992; Lochnit and Geyer, 1995). It is possible that, by analogy with PXR/K-specific GalNAc transferase and sulfotransferase (Dharmesh et al., 1993), there could be co-ordinate expression of GalNAc transferase and α2-6-sialyltransferase in mammalian cell lines that synthesize sialylated lacdiNAc structures. Several lines of evidence indicate that oligosaccharides are essential recognition sequences in cell-mediated adhesions in both inflammatory and immune responses (Phillips et al., 1990; Springer, 1990; Lasky, 1992; Bevilacqua, 1993). Oligosaccharides terminated with sialylated or sulfated Lewisx/a type sequences have been shown to act as specific ligands for selectin-mediated adhesions (Berg et al., 1991; Yuen et al., 1992). Other oligosaccharide sequences can, however, act as selectin ligands (Varki, 1994). Importantly, in the rHPC study (see above) it was shown that a biantennary N-linked oligosaccharide bearing GalNAcβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc antennae is a potent inhibitor of E-selectin-mediated adhesion (Grinnell et al., 1994). Since the same fucosylated epitope is also expressed on glycodelin, it is possible that a component of the immunosuppressive effect exhibited by glycodelin is mediated via blocking of the selectin-like binding sites by this carbohydrate sequence. Other specific antennae associated with glycodelin may also interact with alternative bioactive receptor proteins of the human immune system. CD22 is a B cell-associated receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily that acts as both an adhesion molecule and an activation molecule (Clark and Lane, 1991; Clark, 1993; Ledbetter et al., 1993; Peaker, 1994). Transfected cells that stably express CD22 on their surfaces show greatly enhanced binding to T and B lymphocytes (Wilson et al., 1991). CD22 is closely associated with the subset of responsive B lymphocytes as defined by stimulation with anti-μ (Pezzutto et al., 1988). CD22 also binds to CD45, the leukocyte-specific receptor-linked phosphotyrosine phosphatase involved in T-cell activation (Stamenkovic et al., 1991). Previous studies have revealed that CD22 binds to NeuAcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc sequences (Powell and Varki, 1994). More recent studies indicate that CD22 also binds the NeuAcα2-6GalNAc disaccharide with approximately equal affinity as it does the NeuAcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc sequences (Powell et al., 1995). Therefore we believe that glycodelin may bind to CD22 via its NeuAcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc and/or NeuAcα2-6GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc antennae and may inhibit specific immune cell adhesion and activation events mediated via this receptor protein. We also find it significant that glycodelin has glycoforms carrying NeuAcα2-6GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc and GalNAcβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc antennae on a single biantennary oligosaccharide (structure xviii; Fig. 8). Although this structure has been previously observed in rHPC (Yan et al., 1993), we are now the first to demonstrate its expression in a naturally occurring glycoprotein. The biological activities expressed by this glycan remain to be determined. It is possible that this oligosaccharide could interact with the selectins or other adhesion molecules with selectin-like specificity via the fucosylated antenna whereas its sialylated antenna could bind to CD22. Such an oligosaccharide could manifest multiple biological effects, including blocking inflammatory responses, attenuating CD22-dependent immune responses or perhaps inhibiting other selectin-like adhesion processes. It is also possible that certain carbohydrate-binding proteins associated with either the immune or reproductive systems may require the precise spatial arrangement of fucose and sialic acid provided by the antennae for optimal binding. Evidence collected from diverse species in both the plant and animal kingdoms indicates that the appropriate recognition of surface carbohydrates is a crucial event in the binding of sperm to the eggs during fertilization (Macek and Shur, 1988; Miller and Ax, 1990; Wassarman, 1990). In the mouse, oligosaccharides associated with the zona pellucida glycoprotein ZP3 have been shown to be recognized by specific egg-binding proteins located on the sperm plasma membrane (Wassarman, 1990). It is probable that a similar paradigm is utilized in the human system. We have previously suggested that initial human sperm-zona pellucida binding involves a selectin-like adhesion (Patankar et al., 1993a, 1993b). This proposed specificity was initially based upon our observation that fucoidan blocked initial human sperm-zona pellucida binding (Oehninger et al., 1990) and a selectin-mediated adhesion process (lymphocyte homing) in the same concentration range (Yednock and Rosen, 1989). Fucoidan also blocked induction of the sperm's acrosome reaction by solubilized human zona pellucida, consistent with its ability to block sperm-zona pellucida binding (Mahony et al., 1991). We recently reported in a preliminary study that sialyl-Lewisx oligosaccharide and human orosomucoid also inhibit initial human sperm-zona pellucida binding in the same concentration-dependent manner as is observed for E-selectin-mediated adhesion (Clark et al., 1995a). Although these studies suggest that the egg-binding protein is a selectin, our preliminary studies using specific anti-selectin monoclonal antibodies indicate that these adhesion proteins are not expressed on human sperm (Clark et al., 1995b). Therefore, we have hypothesized that the human egg-binding protein, though not itself a selectin, may have converged with the selectins in its carbohydrate binding specificity. Glycodelin also inhibits initial human sperm-zona pellucida binding in a potent concentration-dependent manner (Oehninger et al., 1995). The expression of putative selectin ligands on this glycoprotein provides further evidence supporting our hypothesis that initial human sperm-zona pellucida binding is dependent upon a selectin-like adhesion process. The structural studies reported in this paper provide the necessary foundation for effectively addressing the above issues. We are now investigating the potential contribution of the variety of glycans attached to glycodelin to its immunosuppressive and contraceptive activities. Finally, since glycodelin is expressed in bone marrow (Kamarainen et al., 1994; Morrow et al., 1994) and perhaps other tissues, it will be of great interest to see whether their glycosylation and function are the same. Until that information is available we propose to designate this glycoprotein isolated from amniotic fluid “glycodelin-A.”"

Recently, we showed that vacuolar membranes are strongly enriched in Rab7, a small GTP binding protein largely present on late endosomal compartments (18Papini E. De Bernard M. Milia E. Bugnoli M.

This finding suggests that VacA alters membrane trafficking events taking place at the late endosomal stage. vacuolating toxin of Helicobacter pylori phosphate-buffered saline minimal essential medium fetal calf serum bovine serum albumin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Here, we report on a remarkable property of VacA: its exposure to acidic solutions causes a very strong potentiation of vacuolating activity. Activated VacA is resistant to low pH and pepsin. VacA activation is accompanied by spectroscopic changes and by a different limited proteolysis pattern. H. pylori cytotoxic strain CCUG 17874 was grown as before(18Papini E. De Bernard M. Milia E. Bugnoli M. Zerial M. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9720-9724Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). VacA was isolated either as described (12Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 287: 10570-10575Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) or with a novel procedure to be described elsewhere. 3R. Manetti, P. Massari, D. Burroni, M. de Bernard, A. Marchini, R. Olivieri, C. Montecucco, R. Rappuoli, and J. L. Telford, submitted for publication. VacA was stored as diluted solutions in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (<0.1 mg/ml) at 4°C. Protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad DC Microassay. HeLa cells were cultivated and seeded as detailed before (11Papini E. Bugnoli M. De Bernard M. Figura N. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in 96-well titration plates in MEM, 10% FCS at a density of 10 × 103/cm2. Cells were incubated with VacA (9 μg/ml) in MEM, 2% FCS, 5 mM NH4+. To a VacA solution in PBS (1 μM), various amounts of HCl (150 mM) were added under stirring to minimize local denaturating effects, according to a previously determined titration curve. After 15 min at 37°C (or other time periods (see Fig. 2B)), the solution was neutralized by addition of 150 mM NaOH under stirring or by dilution (10-20-fold) in MEM, 2% FCS, 5 mM NH4Cl. Vacuolation was measured as described before(11Papini E. Bugnoli M. De Bernard M. Figura N. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco (Tokyo, Japan) model J-710 spectropolarimeter as detailed before(19De Filippis V. Vangelista L. Schiavo G. Tonello F. Montecucco C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mean residue molecular weight for VacA residues was 110 Da, based on its sequence. CD spectra in the far-UV region (250-195 nm) were recorded in PBS, pH 7.4, at 37°C in a 1- or 10-mm pathlength cuvette at a VacA concentration of 25 or 90 μg/ml. The protein secondary structure content was estimated with a Jasco computer program(20Yang J.T. Wu C.-S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). A Perkin-Elmer LS-50 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a 1-cm pathlength quartz cell thermostatted at 37°C was used. VacA (32 μg/ml in PBS) fluorescence emission was monitored from 285 to 500 nm (excitation at 280 nm) and from 300 to 500 nm (excitation at 295 nm) with 5-nm slits for both excitation and emission. Spectra were averaged over four accumulations and corrected by subtracting the corresponding base line. VacA solutions were acidified and neutralized as above; the spectrum of denaturated VacA was recorded after addition of guanidinium Cl to a final concentration of 3.5 M. VacA (96 μg/ml) in PBS was either kept at 37°C or acidified to pH 2.0 with HCl, incubated for 15 min at 37°C, and then neutralized to pH 7.4. Pronase (Boehringer, Germany) or proteinase K (Sigma) was added to a protease/substrate ratio of 1:16 and 1:50, respectively (by mass). Samples of VacA at pH 2.0 or BSA (84 μg/ml) in the same buffer were incubated with pepsin (Boehringer, Germany) at a protease/substrate ratio of 1:500 (by mass). Samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 or 2 h, and proteolysis was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 6%). After centrifugation, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE as before (19De Filippis V. Vangelista L. Schiavo G. Tonello F. Montecucco C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and stained with silver staining. Samples were scanned with a Shimadzu CS-630 dual wavelength densitometer. In the course of studies on the mechanism of cell vacuolization induced by VacA, we experienced large variations in the potency of different batches of VacA. These variations were associated with different handling of samples with respect to storage. In particular, we noticed that freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing activated VacA, particularly when phosphate ions were present. Since neutral phosphate buffers acidify upon freezing(21van den Berg L. Rose D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 81: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of exposure of non-frozen VacA to acidic pH values. Fig. 1 shows that HeLa cells incubated with VacA, exposed for 15 min to pH 2.0, and then neutralized to pH 7.4, develop very large vacuoles, whereas cells exposed to a non-acid-treated VacA are very weakly vacuolized. A quantitative assay of the extent of low pH activation is shown in Fig. 1A. The pH dependence profile of Fig. 2A indicates that activation of VacA takes place already at pH 5.5. It is noteworthy that VacA is activated rather than damaged by exposure to a pH as low as 1.5, similar to that of the stomach lumen(22Guyton A.C. Textbook of Medical Physiology. W. B. Saunders & Co., Philadelphia1991Google Scholar). A sample of VacA in PBS frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed was activated by this procedure to about one-fourth of the value attained by a corresponding sample exposed to pH 2.0. Activation by slower freezing at −70 and −20°C is very weak (not shown). Low pH-induced activation of VacA is very rapid, being essentially complete within 10 s at pH 2.0 at 37°C (Fig. 2B). Once activated, VacA retains its activity at neutral pH for long periods; after 24 h, VacA still has 70% of its original vacuolating activity and, after 3 days, the remaining activity is 20% of the control kept at neutral pH and then low pH-activated before cell assay. This slow rate of VacA inactivation at neutral pH is not due to a decay to the original preactivation state, because VacA cannot any longer be activated by re-exposure to low pH. Control SDS-PAGE gels show no VacA degradation. The alteration of membrane trafficking at the late endosome level caused by VacA is consistent with an activity displayed in the cytosol. Several bacterial protein toxins with intracellular targets penetrate cells via internalization into acidic intracellular compartments, wherefrom the active toxin domain is released in the cytosol(23Menestrina G. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Mol. Aspects Med. 1994; 15: 79-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Low pH-activated VacA does not require intracellular acidification because it is fully active in the cell vacuolation assay of Fig. 1, which requires the presence of NH4+ ions(10Cover T.L. Puryear W. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Papini E. Bugnoli M. De Bernard M. Figura N. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Papini E. De Bernard M. Milia E. Bugnoli M. Zerial M. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9720-9724Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), an agent known to neutralize intracellular acidic compartments. To test the possibility that VacA is activated inside acidic cell compartments, VacA not exposed to low pH was added to HeLa cells in the absence of NH4+ ions, for different time periods up to 2 h. Cells were then allowed to vacuolize in the presence of NH4+ ions, but no vacuoles were observed (not shown). This result indicates that VacA cannot be activated inside acidic cellular compartments, though control immunofluorescence experiments indicated that VacA had been internalized (not shown). Low pH activation of VacA is accompanied by a structural change that can be monitored spectroscopically (Fig. 3). The far-UV CD spectrum of VacA at pH 7.4 shows a minimum at 215 nm and has a substantial amount of β-like secondary structure (39%) and a lower content of α-helix (15%) and turn (15%) conformation. A substantial decrease of the CD signal is observed upon acidification to pH 2.0, and this accounts for an estimated increase of β-structure (47%) and a concomitant decrease of turn (9%) with no change in α-helix content. Reneutralization of low pH-exposed VacA causes a further decrease in ellipticity at 215 nm. Variations of secondary structure content of VacA are reasonably consistent with a turn →β-structure transition. However, the far-UV CD spectrum of a protein can be influenced by several factors such as the contribution of aromatic residues(24Vuilleumier S. Sancho J.B. Loewenthal R. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 32: 10303-10313Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25De Filippis V. Vindigni A. Altichieri L. Fontana A. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 9552-9564Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a change of the twisting angle of the β-sheets strands(26Lakowicz J.R. Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1986: 341-381Google Scholar), as well as a possible change in quaternary structure. However, VacA is frequently found as a heptamer in electron microscopy, and the amount and shape of the VacA heptamer does not change upon low pH treatment.2 The lack of reversibility and the decrease of CD signal upon reneutralization indicate that VacA undergoes a transition to a conformational state different from those present at pH 7.4 and 2.0. The fluorescence spectra of Fig. 3B provide another evidence of the VacA structural transition induced by low pH. At pH 7.4, VacA has an emission maximum at 345 nm, indicating that the 10 Trp residues of VacA are, on average, solvent-exposed(26Lakowicz J.R. Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1986: 341-381Google Scholar). In addition, the absence of Tyr fluorescence indicates a strong Tyr-Trp energy transfer, and this is a useful structural probe of VacA structural changes. Upon acidification, VacA shows a reduced fluorescence quantum yield (60-65%) (Fig. 3B), with respect to non-acid-treated VacA solutions (100%), whereas the wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission is red-shifted of about 2 nm. Fluorescence measurements conducted on model compounds (Na-acetyl-L-tyrosinamide:Na-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide in a molar ratio of 2.6:1, the one of VacA) demonstrate that acid quenching of Trp fluorescence accounts for about 90% of the Trp quantum yield decrease observed on acidification to pH 2.0. The remaining decrease may result from change of solvent exposure of Trp residues and/or protonation of neighbor groups. After reneutralization, in agreement with the CD findings, the Trp quantum yield is further reduced with respect to that observed at pH 2.0. The high degree of Tyr-Trp energy transfer at pH 2.0 and after reneutralization indicates that VacA is still highly structured. Only denaturation induces a distinct band of Tyr fluorescence at 303-305 nm and a shift of Trp emission to 352 nm (Fig. 3B). Different structural states of proteins can be monitored with high sensitivity by determining their susceptibility to proteinases(19De Filippis V. Vangelista L. Schiavo G. Tonello F. Montecucco C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Fontana A. Fassina G. Vita C. Dalzoppo D. Zamai M. Zambonin M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1847-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that VacA is fragmented by Pronase and proteinase K differently, depending on a preliminary exposure to pH 2.0. Identification of the sites of proteolytic cleavage is under way and can provide relevant information on exposed loops(27Fontana A. Fassina G. Vita C. Dalzoppo D. Zamai M. Zambonin M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1847-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The present data clearly indicate that the two VacA forms are structurally different and are therefore degraded differently. Fig. 4B shows that VacA at pH 2.0 is very resistant to pepsin, the major proteinase of stomach juice, whereas BSA is completely degraded. Spectroscopic and limited proteolysis data indicate that VacA can exist in at least three different structural states: neutral VacA (cytotoxin never exposed to low pH), acid VacA (VacA at low pH), and reneutralized VacA (VacA exposed to low pH and returned to neutrality). Reneutralized VacA is very active in inducing cell vacuolization, whereas VacA kept at neutral pH is virtually inactive. Some reneutralized form of VacA was inadvertently obtained previously by freezing in phosphate-containing buffers(10Cover T.L. Puryear W. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Papini E. Bugnoli M. De Bernard M. Figura N. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol.

Montecucco C. Parente L. Rappuoli R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1653-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The activity of acid VacA cannot be measured because of the very nature of the cell vacuolization assay, which requires cultivation of epithelial cell for several hours. For a similar reason, also limited proteolysis only monitors the neutral and reneutralized states of VacA. The present findings are very relevant to the characterization of the structure-function relationship of VacA, a major virulence factor in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal ulcers(9Marchetti M.

At the same time, they may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcers. In fact, it is known that H. pylori penetrates the mucus layer of the stomach and adheres to the apical portion of parietal epithelial cells(5Blaser M.J.

In H. pylori-infected patients, justamucosal pH of the gastric body is lowered to the mean value of 5.7(31Frieri G. Depetris G. Aggio A. Santarelli D. Ligas E. Rosoni R. Caprilli R. Digestion. 1995; 56: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here we show that VacA is strongly activated at pH <6.0 down to pH 1.5, without being affected by such an extreme pH. At the same time, VacA is strongly resistant to pepsin at pH 2.0. Hence, it can be envisaged that some VacA molecules are released and activated in the stomach juice and pass through the pylorus in the intestine. Here, activated VacA can induce vacuolization of epithelial cells of the duodenum, before being digested by intestinal proteases, which would thus protect later portions of the intestine. Such a process could contribute to the development of duodenal lesions without the physical presence of H. pylori. We thank Barbara Satin for help with some experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2064480241,"In mammalian melanocytes, melanin synthesis is controlled by tyrosinase, the critical enzyme in the melanogenic pathway. We and others showed that the stimulation of melanogenesis by cAMP is due to an increased tyrosinase expression at protein and mRNA levels. However, the molecular events connecting the rise of intracellular cAMP and the increase in tyrosinase activity remain to be elucidated. In this study, using B16 melanoma cells, we showed that cAMP-elevating agents stimulated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, p44mapk. This effect was mediated by the activation of MAP kinase kinase. cAMP-elevating agents induced a translocation of p44mapk to the nucleus and an activation of the transcription factor AP-1. cAMP-induced AP-1 contained FOS-related antigen-2 in association with JunD, while after phorbol ester stimulation AP-1 complexes consist mainly of JunD/c-Fos heterodimers. In an attempt to connect these molecular events to the control of tyrosinase expression that appears to be the pivotal point of melanogenesis regulation, we hypothesized that following its activation by cAMP, p44mapk activates AP-1. Then AP-1 could stimulate tyrosinase expression through the interaction with specific DNA sequences present in the mouse tyrosinase promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2061734201,"The sex myoblasts (SMs) in C. elegans hermaphrodites undergo anteriorly directed cell migrations that allow for the proper localization of the egg-laying muscles. These migrations are controlled in part by a signal emanating from gonadal cells that allows the SMs to be attracted to their precise final positions flanking the center of the gonad. Mutations in egl-15 alter the nature of the interaction between the gonad and the SMs, resulting in the posterior displacement of the SMs. Here we show that egl-15 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) subfamily with multiple roles in development. Three genes were identified that behave genetically as activators or mediators of egl-15 activity. One of these genes, sem-5, encodes an adaptor molecule that transduces signals from a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases. Like egl-15 and sem-5, the other two genes may similarly act in FGFR signaling pathways in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2088217641,"We have developed a functional screen in yeast to identify ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases. Using this method, we cloned two Xenopus genes that activate the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. These encode novel secreted proteins, designated FRL1 and FRL2, distantly related to the epidermal growth factor and angiogenin/ribonuclease families, respectively. Both genes activate the FGF receptor in Xenopus oocytes as well as in yeast. Overexpression induces mesoderm and neural-specific genes in Xenopus explants; induction is blocked by a dominant negative inhibitor of the FGF receptor. FRL1 is broadly expressed during gastrulation and neurulation, while FRL2 is expressed principally in the axial mesoderm and brain at later stages. Our results indicate that despite their lack of similarity with FGF, FRL1 and FRL2 are ligands for the FGF receptor that play distinct roles in development."

The density of Tsup-1 cell high- affinity receptors was low for PGE2 and high for LTB4, resulting in respectively predominant chemokinetic and chemotactic stimulation of migra-tion. Migration-enhancing concentrations of PGE2 and LTB4 also increased Tsup-1 cell content and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2, 3, and 9, which were quantified by Western blots and zymography, and augmented Tsup-1 cell-surface expression of the MMPs, as shown by flow cytometry. That a specific MMP inhibitor suppressed migration of blood T cells and Tsup-1 cells through Matrikel, but did not affect PGE2- and LTB4-initiated T cell migration through micropore filters without Ma-trigel, suggests dual requirements for MMP expres-sion and enhanced motility in T cell passage through basement membranes.—Leppert, D., Hauser, S L., Kishiyama, J.

Focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) and paxillin were identified as prominent substrates for SPC-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK was detected as soon as 30 s after SPC stimulation, reaching a maximum after 2.5 min. SPC induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in a concentration-dependent fashion; a half-maximum effect occurred at 250 nM. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK induced by SPC could be dissociated from both protein kinase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. SPC induced a unique pattern of reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton with a rapid appearance of actin microspikes at the plasma membrane that was followed by the formation of actin stress fibers. This pattern of cytoskeletal changes was clearly distinguishable from that induced by bombesin and 1oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid. Formation of microspikes and actin stress fibers were accompanied by striking assembly of focal adhesion plaques. Cytochalasin D, which disrupts the network of actin microfilaments, completely prevented SPC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK was markedly inhibited in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor at a concentration (30 ng/ml) that disrupts actin stress fibers. Finally, microinjection of Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which inactivates p21rho, prevented SPC-induced formation of actin stress fibers, focal adhesion assembly, and tyrosine phosphorylation.

The effects, if any, of exogenously added SPC on tyrosine phosphorylation, the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion assembly, and the potential involvement of small G proteins such as p21rho in this signaling pathway remain unknown. In this paper, we demonstrate that SPC rapidly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins including p125FAK and paxillin in Swiss 3T3 cells and induces a unique pattern of actin organization, which was accompanied by the formation of focal contacts. Microinjection of C.botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates p21rho, blocked the changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, the assembly of focal contacts, and tyrosine phosphorylation in response to SPC. Cell culture of Swiss 3T3 cells and down-regulation of PKC by prolonged pretreatment with PDB were performed as described in the accompanying paper(6Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24334-24342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells (1-2 × 106) were washed twice with DMEM, treated with SPC or other factors in 10 ml of DMEM for the times indicated, and lysed at 4°C in 1 ml of a solution containing 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 100 μM Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100 (lysis buffer). Proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4°C for 14 h with anti-mouse IgG-agarose-linked mAbs directed against phosphotyrosine, paxillin, or p125FAK as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and extracted for 10 min at 95°C in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mM Tris/HCl, 6% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Treatment of quiescent cultures of cells with factors, cell lysis, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes. Membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.2, and incubated for 2 h at 22°C with a mixture of Py20 and 4G10 anti-Tyr(P) mAbs (1 μg/ml of each). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by autoradiography using 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) followed by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned using an LKB Ultrascan XL densitometer, and labeled bands were quantified using the Ultrascan XL internal integrator. The values expressed represent percentages of the maximum increase in tyrosine phosphorylation above control values. Confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells in 100-mm dishes were washed twice with DMEM and incubated for 10 min in DMEM containing 1 μM fura-2-tetraacetoxymethyl ester. After this time, the cells were washed twice with PBS at 37°C and once with electrolyte solution, which contained 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.9 mM MgCl2, 25 mM glucose, 16 mM HEPES, 6 mM Tris/HCl, and a mixture of amino acids at the same concentrations as are present in DMEM, pH 7.2. The cells were then suspended in 2 ml of electrolyte solution by gentle scraping and transferred to a 1-cm2 quartz cuvette, which was placed in a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 luminescence spectrophotometer. The cell suspension was stirred continuously at 37°C, and fluorescence was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 336 nm and emission wavelength of 510 nm. Factors were added to the cell suspension while fluorescence was being monitored as indicated. [Ca2+]i was determined as described previously(30Nånberg E. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2741-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated for the indicated time at 37°C with the indicated concentration of SPC or other factors. Thereafter, for staining of actin, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4°C, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 8 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (0.25 μg/ml) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and visualized utilizing a Zeiss Axiophot immunofluorescence microscope. In experiments in which quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were labeled with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin and anti-vinculin or anti-Tyr(P) antibody, after fixing and permeabilizing the cells as described above, TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (0.25 μg/ml) and anti-vinculin antibody (dilution 1:100) or anti-Tyr(P) mAb 4G10 (dilution 1:300) were added together to the cells for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed three times in PBS and then incubated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG as a second antibody at a dilution of 1:100 for another 30 min at room temperature. In the microinjection experiments shown in Fig. 8, triple labeling was used. Cells injected with C3 exoenzyme and rabbit IgG were fixed and permeabilized as described above. TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (0.25 μg/ml) and anti-vinculin antibody (dilution 1:100) or anti-Tyr(P) mAb 4G10 (dilution 1:300) were added together to the cells for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed three times in PBS and then incubated with FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG to control for microinjection efficiency together with Cy5-conjugated affinity pure sheep anti-mouse IgG to label either vinculin or Tyr(P) at a dilution of 1:100 each for another 30 min at room temperature. Confocal imaging was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 laser scanning head fitted onto a Diaphot 200 microscope. A 60 × N. A. 1.4 planapochromat oil immersion lens (Nikon) and the dicroic filter blocks T1 and E2 were used. Images were collected sequentially using a krypton/argon mixed gas laser (Bio-Rad) with excitation filters at 488, 568, and 647 nm for FITC, TRITC, and Cy5 fluorochromes, respectively, and emission filters at 622, 605, and 680 nm, respectively. Correction of images for bleed through and other processing was carried out using the COMOS program (Bio-Rad) run on a QE 486 33C computer. Optical sections were recorded at 0.5 μm. Final images were photographed directly from the VDU screen or processed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo XS 24 workstation using a Sony digital color printer. For microinjection experiments, Swiss 3T3 cells were plated in 35-mm Nunc Petri dishes at 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used after 6-8 days when the cells were confluent and quiescent. To facilitate localization of microinjected cells, a circle was scored on the bottom of the dishes, and in each experiment approximately 60 cells in the circle were microinjected. The efficiency of injection was determined by coinjecting rabbit IgG at 0.5 mg/ml followed by staining of the cells with FITC-linked anti-rabbit IgG. The same batch of C3 exoenzyme was used in all experiments described. SPC, LPA, PDB, bombesin, cytochalasin D, TRITC-conjugated phalloidin, monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody, and FITC-linked anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Sigma. Cy5-conjugated affinity pure sheep anti-mouse IgG and chrome pure rabbit IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. The specific PKC inhibitor GF 109203X and thapsigargin were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Ltd. (Nottingham, UK). Anti-mouse IgG-agarose-linked anti-Tyr(P) mAb clone Py72 was obtained from the hybridoma development unit (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). Py20 anti-Tyr(P) mAb and the mAb directed against paxillin (mAb 165) were from ICN (High Wycombe, UK). 4G10 anti-Tyr(P) mAb and mAb 2A7 directed against p125FAK were from TCS Biologicals Ltd. (Buckingham, UK). Anti-p125FAK mAb for Western blotting was obtained from AFFINITI Research Products Ltd. (Nottingham, UK). 125I-Sheep anti-mouse IgG (15 mCi/mg) and recombinant BB homodimer PDGF were from Amersham. Recombinant C. botulinum exoenzyme C3 was the kind gift of Prof. Shuh Narumiya (Dept. of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan). All other reagents used were of the purest grade available. To examine the effect of SPC on protein tyrosine phosphorylation, quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were incubated with 5 μM SPC for 5 min and lysed. Lysates of the treated cells were incubated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb, and the immunoprecipitates were further analyzed by Western blotting with a mixture of anti-Tyr(P) mAbs. As shown in Fig. 1, upperpanel, left, SPC stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple components including bands migrating with an apparent Mr of 110,000-130,000 and 70,000-80,000. The pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced by SPC was comparable to that obtained with 10 nM bombesin (Fig. 1, upperpanel, left). SPC stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the Mr 110,000-130,000 and 70,000-80,000 bands in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching half-maximum and maximum effects at concentrations of 0.25 and 2.5 μM, respectively (Fig. 1, upperpanel, right). The increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Mr 110,000-130,000 and the Mr 70,000-80,000 bands in response to 5 μM SPC occurred rapidly, reaching half-maximum levels after 45 s and 2 min and maximum levels after 2.5 and 10 min, respectively (Fig. 1, lowerpanel).

As SPC elicited a pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated bands similar to that induced by bombesin (Fig. 1, upperpanel, left), we determined whether p125FAK and paxillin were also substrates for SPC-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Lysates of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells incubated with 5 μM SPC for 5 min were immunoprecipitated with mAb 2A7 directed against p125FAK or mAb 165 directed against paxillin and further analyzed by immunoblotting with a mixture of anti-Tyr(P) mAbs. Fig. 2, toppanel, left and right, shows that SPC markedly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin, respectively. Thus, p125FAK is a component of the broad Mr 110,000-130,000 band, and paxillin is a component of the diffuse Mr 70,000-80,000 band of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in SPC-treated Swiss 3T3 cells. The degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of these specific substrates in response to 5 μM SPC was comparable to that induced by 10 nM bombesin in parallel cultures (Fig. 2, toppanel, left and right). As shown in Fig. 2, middlepanel, SPC induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in a concentration-dependent manner; half-maximum and maximum effects were achieved at 0.25 and 1 μM SPC, respectively. The kinetics of SPC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK is shown in Fig. 2, lowerpanel. An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK was first detectable after 0.5 min and reached its maximum after 2.5 min of incubation in the presence of SPC. SPC is known to induce rapid mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores leading to an increase in [Ca2+]i(2Desai N.N. Carlson R.O. Mattie M.E. Olivera A. Buckley N.E. Seki T. Brooker G.

Chem. 1994; 268: 12353-12358Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Changes in [Ca2+]i have been implicated in tyrosine phosphorylation of a Mr 125,000 band induced by angiotensin II or GP IIbIIIa(31Huckle W.R. Prokop C.A. Dy R.C. Herman B. Earp S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To examine whether SPC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK could also be dependent on [Ca2+]i, quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were pretreated with the tumor promoter thapsigargin, an agent that specifically inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and thereby depletes Ca2+ from intracellular stores(32Thastrup O. Linnebjerg H. Bjerrum P.J. Knudsen J.B. Christensen S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with 30 nM thapsigargin for 30 min did not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK stimulated by SPC (Fig. 3, upperpanel) but blocked the increase in [Ca2+]i by SPC (data not shown). To examine whether the extracellular [Ca2+] could be important for SPC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK, extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by addition of 3 mM EGTA 30 min before stimulation with SPC. This procedure also failed to attenuate tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in response to SPC. Thus, SPC stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK independently of either intracellular Ca2+ release or Ca2+ influx. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with 30 nM thapsigargin for 30 min also did not inhibit SPC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the Mr 70,000-80,000 band, which corresponds to paxillin (data not shown). SPC induces activation of MAPK by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism, suggesting the involvement of a G protein of the Gi/Gi subfamily in the signaling pathway(6Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24334-24342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To examine whether SPC stimulates p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation via Gi, quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of pertussis toxin for 3 h and subsequently challenged with 5 μM SPC for 5 min. Pertussis toxin at concentrations between 0.1 and 100 ng/ml did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in response to SPC (data not shown). In the accompanying paper(6Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24334-24342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we show that SPC stimulates activation of PKC in Swiss 3T3 cells. As activation of PKC is also a potential pathway leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin(8Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the role of PKC in SPC-induced p125FAK and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. PKC was either selectively inhibited by pretreatment of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells for 1 h with the bisindolylmaleimide GF 109203X at 3.5 μM(33Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellervergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Löriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol.

Commun. 1984; 120: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, middlepanel, both treatments completely blocked stimulation of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by 200 nM PDB. In contrast, inhibition or down-regulation of PKC only slightly reduced p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in response to 5 μM SPC (Fig. 3, middlepanel). Thus, SPC induces p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation largely through a PKC-independent pathway. Paxillin contains several potential target sites for phosphorylation by PKC(35Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in response to bombesin, LPA, or phorbol esters is accompanied by a mobility shift that results in the appearance of slower migrating forms of this protein, a process mediated by PKC(9Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Turner C.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SPC at 5 μM also induced this mobility shift of paxillin (Fig. 3, lowerpanel). Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with GF 109203X did not affect the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin induced by SPC but prevented the appearance of the slower migrating forms of paxillin. Interestingly, the sphingolipid breakdown product sphingosine at 12.5 μM induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin to a lesser degree than SPC, and no mobility shift of paxillin could be detected (Fig. 3, lowerpanel). This is probably due to the fact that sphingosine, in contrast to SPC, does not strongly activate PKC(14Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27610-27617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results depicted in Fig. 3 indicate that SPC induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin through a pathway largely independent of Ca2+ mobilization, a Gi protein, or PKC activation. As p125FAK and paxillin are localized at focal adhesion plaques, the distinct sites on the plasma membrane where actin stress fibers emanate, we examined whether SPC modulates actin cytoskeletal organization and focal adhesion assembly. As shown in Fig. 4A, quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells contain only very few actin stress fibers. Incubation of cells with SPC for various times induced dramatic changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Within 1 min, SPC induced actin reorganization with loss of punctate actin and an increase in polymerized actin as cell surface protrusions. These protrusions formed microspikes. The reorganization of actin into microspikes peaked within 3-5 min of addition of SPC. Interestingly, 7-10 min after addition of SPC the pattern of actin organization changed, and a diffuse increase in actin fibers throughout the cytoplasm was visible. By 20 min, the cells contained numerous densely packed stress fibers, whereas the microspikes were markedly reduced (Fig. 4A). All of these effects were independent of an increase in [Ca2+]i as treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with 30 nM thapsigargin for 30 min did not prevent the subsequent changes in the actin cytoskeleton in response to SPC (data not shown). Both the neuropeptide bombesin and the bioactive lipid LPA stimulate the reorganization of actin with a time course comparable to that of SPC. However, these compounds primarily induce organization of actin into stress fibers visible as early as 1 min after addition of the factors but not into microspikes(21Ridley A. Hall A.

Although weaker non-covalent interactions may occur between apoB and apo(a), it is the presence of a disulfide bond that binds them covalently(1Armstrong V.W. Walli A.K. Seidel D. J.

Many of these studies were based upon the use of fluorescent probes that bind to free cysteine residues of proteins. Fluorescently labeled tryptic peptides of apoB that contain Cys-3734 were absent in the apoB of Lp(a), suggesting that this cysteine was unavailable for binding to the fluorescent probe because of an association with apo(a)(8Guevara Jr., J.

Computer modeling also demonstrated that the peptide region around Cys-3734 was the most energetically favorable to associate with the amino acids surrounding Cys-4057 of apo(a)(8Guevara Jr., J.

Both of these approaches, however, lacked direct experimental evidence for the involvement of Cys-3734 in the binding of apoB to apo(a). Studies utilizing a truncated form of apoB (apoB-90) expressed in transgenic mice suggested that one of the two cysteines in the deleted terminal 10% of the molecule, Cys-4190 or −4326, could be involved in binding to apo(a)(10McCormick S.P.A. Linton M.F. Hobbs H.H. Taylor S. Curtiss L.K. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24284-24289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another study, using a truncated apoB-94 peptide produced in cell culture, presented evidence not indicated by the fluorescent labeling studies and suggested that Cys-4326, the terminal cysteine of apoB, is involved in disulfide linkage with apo(a) (11Gabel B. Yao Z. McLeod R.S. Young S.G. Koschinsky M.L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In both of these studies, deletion of the terminal 6 or 10% of the apoB peptide could not be excluded from inhibiting an association with an alternative cysteine such as Cys-3734. This is important because it has been demonstrated that the conformation of apoB may influence the binding characteristics of apo(a) to apoB on LDL. Individuals with lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency have been demonstrated to lack plasma Lp(a)(12Steyrer E. Durovic S. Frank S. GieBauf W. Burger A. Dieplinger H. Zechner R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2330-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The LDL of these individuals was found to be deficient in cholesterol, which suggested that interactions between apo(a) and apoB may be impacted upon by the composition and size of LDL mediating conformational changes in apoB. The low binding characteristics of very low density lipoprotein with apo(a) (13Sandholzer C. Feussner G. Brunzell J. Utermann G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1958-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) may also be due to conformational changes. Truncated forms of apoB could adopt conformations inhibiting an association with apo(a) in a similar manner. Apo(a) is not normally expressed in mice, and in human-apo(a) transgenic mice, apo(a) is not covalently linked to murine apoB(14Lawn R. Wade D. Hammer R. Verstuyft J. Rubin E.

However, in mice that contain both transgenes for human apo(a) and apoB, Lp(a) particles, similar to that observed in humans, are present in the plasma of the double transgenic animals(16Callow M.J.

In this study we have used transgenic mice to study the in vivo interactions of apo(a) and apoB. To determine which free cysteine of human apoB is involved in disulfide linkage to apo(a), we have employed site-directed mutagenesis to convert Cys-3734 and Cys-4326 to serines within separate apoB P1-phagemid genomic clones. The P1 clone of the human apoB gene was then used to prepare transgenic mice expressing the mutated protein. In combination with an apo(a)-expressing yeast artificial chromosome transgene(18Frazer K.A. Narla G. Zhang J.L. Rubin E.M. Nat.

Primer B was used for sequencing of both the parental phage and the mutagenized phage using the Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For mutation of codon 4326, PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used to amplify a 123-bp product from the P1 DNA with primers C and D. Primer C contained the mutation site and was extended to beyond a nearby HindIII site. The mega-primer produced from this PCR reaction was then used for a second round of PCR(23Giebel L.B.

The PCR product was digested with PvuII and HindIII to generate a 160-bp fragment, which was cloned into the HindIII and one of the two PvuII sites of pBluescript II SK+ to form the plasmid pHP. Sequencing of pHP was carried out using the SK primer (Stratagene). A 4.16-kbp ScaI-PvuII fragment of the apoB gene, contiguous with the 160-bp PvuII-HindIII fragment and containing a single HindIII site, was subcloned to a separate PvuII-digested pBluescript plasmid to form pSP.

However, for the replacement of codon 4326, a 4.1-kbp HindIII fragment of the apoB-P1 was selected for removal by RARE digestion. AluI methylase was used to methylate HindIII sites left unprotected by two oligonucleotides targeted to the HindIII sites surrounding codon 4326. The DNA was then digested with HindIII to specifically cut those sites protected from methylation and used directly for ligation of the mutated 4.1-kbp fragment along with the chloramphenicol resistance/sacB selectable markers(27Callow M.J. Ferrin L.J. Rubin E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4348-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing the mutated fragment and the chloramphenicol resistance/sacB genes were selected on chloramphenicol-containing plates. A P1 plasmid was then isolated and characterized by restriction enzyme digestion. The chloramphenicol resistance/sacB genes were removed with selection on 5% sucrose(28Pierce J.C. Sauer B.

To prepare the DNA for microinjection, P1 phagemid DNA that had been prepared as above was gently treated with Geneclean (Bio101) and microdialyzed on 0.025-μm type VS filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) against TE. Microinjection of FVB embryos was performed as described previously(29Gordon J.W. Scangos G.A. Plotkin D.J. Barbosa J.A. Ruddle F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Ser-3734 apoB and Ser-4326 apoB transgenic founder animals were bred with apo(a) yeast artificial chromosome hemizygous transgenic mice (18Frazer K.A. Narla G. Zhang J.L. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to obtain mice expressing both apo(a) and apoB proteins. EDTA plasma was collected from the tail vein of non-fasted mice. The total lipoprotein fraction was prepared by adjusting 25 μl of plasma to a volume of 230 μl and a density of 1.21 g/ml with NaBr before centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 18 h and at 10°C in the type 42.2 rotor. A volume of 25 μl was removed from the tops of the tubes (d < 1.21 g/ml) and also from the bottoms (d > 1.21 g/ml). Plasma fractions of 5 μl were combined with 50 μl of 15% SDS, 6 M urea, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 M Tris, pH 6.8, sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed on precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4-12% acrylamide, Novex, San Diego, CA). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunodetected with a goat polyclonal anti-Lp(a) antibody (Biodesign, Kennebunkport, ME) for the detection of apo(a) (18Frazer K.A. Narla G. Zhang J.L. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or a biotinylated human apoB specific monoclonal antibody for apoB (16Callow M.J. Stoltzfus L.J. Lawn R.M. Rubin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2130-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).

The P1 phagemid genomic clone described here has previously been used in the production of apoB transgenic mice and contained 75 kbp of human genomic sequence including the 43-kbp apoB gene with extensive 5′ and 3′ sequences(16Callow M.J. Stoltzfus L.J. Lawn R.M. Rubin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2130-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Manipulation of the intact phagemid to allow mutagenesis was not feasible due to the lack of conveniently located, infrequent, restriction enzyme sites. To achieve selective removal and reinsertion of small fragments of DNA from the phagemid we utilized RARE digestion. We have previously reported the use of this technique to remove a 1.55-kbp DNA fragment from the apoB-P1 and reinsertion of the mutated fragment(27Callow M.J. Ferrin L.J. Rubin E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4348-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This technique involves protecting specific restriction enzyme sites by forming a triplex DNA complex over the region with a complementary oligonucleotide. Unprotected sites are methylated, followed by dissociation of the complex and inactivation of the methylase. The protected sites can then be specifically cut with the restriction enzyme. We have expanded the use of this technique to include the chloramphenicol resistance/sacB genes as positive and negative selection markers for replacement of the wild-type sequence with the mutated sequence. Mutagenesis of the 1.55-kbp EcoRI fragment containing codon 3734 was carried out in M13, whereas PCR mutagenesis was used for alteration of codon 4326 followed by subcloning of the product to a plasmid for sequencing. The DNA sequences surrounding the mutated sites were determined and compared with that of the published sequence. For both codon 3734 and codon 4326, a single base change was introduced into the apoB sequence converting a thymidine to an adenosine and thus effectively converting a cysteine to a serine in the translated product. No other changes to the apoB gene sequence were detected. Four Ser-3734 apoB and five Ser-4326 apoB founder mice expressing human apoB as determined by immuno-dot blot assay were created, but only two founders of each mutation type were bred with apo(a) transgenic mice to generate transgenic lines. PCR was used to confirm the presence of the mutated DNA sequences in the genomes of the transgenic mice (Fig. 1). Introduction of the point mutations and conversion of thymidine to adenosine within the apoB DNA sequence introduces TaqI and DdeI restriction enzyme sites for codon 3734 and codon 4326, respectively. No product was obtained from non-transgenic mouse genomic DNA in each case, demonstrating that both primer sets were specific for human DNA. Genomic DNA from apoB transgenic mice gave a 203-bp PCR product from the codon 3734 region and a 331-bp product from the codon 4326 region. However, the product from the Ser-3734 apoB genomic DNA was able to produce the TaqI digestion pattern confirming the presence of the mutated apoB in these mice. Similarly, the PCR product for the codon 4326 region was digested with DdeI in Ser-4326 apoB mice. The size of human apoB found in plasma from the various transgenic strains was compared by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2). The human protein found in both of the mutated apoB transgenic lines was identical in size to the human apoB from wild-type (wt) apoB transgenic mouse plasma. Both apoB-48 and apoB-100 bands were present demonstrating normal mRNA editing and synthesis of the peptide. Previous studies have demonstrated that the covalent association of apo(a) with apoB can withstand centrifugation during the separation of lipoproteins from other plasma proteins. Ultracentrifugation was used in this study to demonstrate the presence or absence of apo(a) within the lipoprotein fraction of plasma. Apo(a) was found associated with lipoproteins in plasma from wt apoB/apo(a) transgenic mice and Ser-3734 apoB/apo(a) transgenic mice. However, in apo(a) and Ser-4326 apoB/apo(a) mice, apo(a) was found only within the lipoprotein-free fraction of plasma and was not associated with lipoproteins (Fig. 3). These results clearly demonstrate that the single amino acid conversion of Cys-4326 to serine, in itself, was sufficient to prevent formation of Lp(a). In contrast, conversion of Cys-3734 to serine failed to prevent an association of apo(a) with apoB. A significant proportion of apo(a) was found in the lipoprotein-free fraction of plasma from the wt apoB/apo(a) mice (Fig. 3). This was a consistent feature of this line and was attributed to the low concentration of human apoB in these animals compared with higher expressors. 2M. J. Callow and E. M. Rubin, unpublished observation. To ensure that adequate levels of apoB were available for maximum binding of apo(a), the plasma concentration of human apoB was assessed for those mice presented in Figure 2:, Figure 3: using a human apoB specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The wt apoB line contained 14 mg/dl compared with the Ser-3734 apoB and Ser-4326 apoB lines that contained 59 and 20 mg/dl, respectively. These data demonstrate that the lack of association between Ser-4326 apoB and apo(a) could not be attributed to low levels of circulating apoB in these mice. ApoB contains 25 cysteine residues with at least 16 of these committed to intramolecular disulfide bonds. This leaves 9 potential cysteine residues available for intermolecular interactions(9Yang C. Gu Z.-W. Yang M. Gotto A.M.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67/68: 99-104Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study we chose to replace Cys-3734 and Cys-4326 of human apoB with serine, based upon previous reports suggesting that at least one of these cysteines is a likely candidate for the single disulfide linkage to apo(a). Our results clearly demonstrate that only Cys-4326 is required for the covalent interaction of human apo(a) and human apoB. This is in contrast to a recent study suggesting that 2 molecules of apo(a) are associated per single apoB molecule within the Lp(a) structure(31Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Furbee J.W. Garcia-Hedo M.-T. Mora R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13492-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The complete lack of detectable apo(a) within the lipoprotein fraction of the Ser-4326 apoB mice strongly implies that only one molecule of apo(a) is associated covalently with each apoB molecule. Furthermore, the possibility that Cys-3734 is responsible for binding one of the apo(a) molecules also seems unlikely. Non-reduced Lp(a) from Ser-3734 apoB/apo(a) mice demonstrated identical migration compared with Lp(a) from wt apoB/apo(a) mice on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown), suggesting an equal number of apo(a) molecules bound in each case. However, it is not inconceivable that Lp(a) could require the binding of an initial apo(a) molecule at Cys-4326 to expose alternative binding sites for a second apo(a) molecule. The large size of the apoB gene has made it difficult to study structural features of this protein. However, with the advent of new technologies such as RARE digestion of DNA, site-specific mutagenesis and manipulation of large genomic clones can be achieved. Here, we have used this approach to demonstrate that Cys-4326 of human apoB, and not Cys-3734, is required for the covalent, disulfide linkage between human apoB and apo(a) in vivo. Furthermore, the transgenic mice developed in these studies may prove useful for the analysis of early events leading to the formation of the disulfide bond. Inhibition of this process could provide new approaches to reducing plasma levels of Lp(a) We thank Mary Stevens, Jun-Li Zhang, Pat Blanche, and Phil Cooper for excellent technical assistance."

https://openalex.org/W1625215449,"In this study we describe for the first time the identification of a renal cell line that expresses the kidney-specific high-affinity H+/peptide cotransport system. The kidney cell line SKPT-0193 C1.2 was obtained by SV40 transformation of rat proximal tubular cells. The transport of the dipeptide glycylsarcosine (Gly-Sar) was studied in this cell line grown as a confluent monolayer on impermeable plastic supports. Uptake of the dipeptide was rapid and was stimulated sixfold by an inwardly directed H+ gradient, with optimal uptake occurring at an extracellular pH of 6.0. The uptake was markedly reduced by the protonophore carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone whether measured at pH 7.5 or 6.0. Intracellular acidification of the cells by NH4Cl prepulse also reduced the uptake of glycylsarcosine. The dipeptide uptake was found to be mediated by a high-affinity transport system with a Michaelis-Menten constant (Kt) of 67 +/- 2 microM and a maximal transport velocity of 1.20 +/- 0.02 nmol.10 min-1.mg protein-1. Studied over a concentration range of 5 microM to 5 mM, there was no evidence for a second saturable transport component. Di- and tripeptides, but not glycine, were strong inhibitors of glycylsarcosine uptake, indicating that these peptides also interact with the transport system with high affinity. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+RNA from these cells using cDNA probes specific for the human intestinal peptide transporter (PEPT 1) or the human kidney-specific peptide transporter (PEPT 2) revealed that the transport system expressed in these cells is PEPT 2. It is concluded that the SKPT-0193 C1.2 cell line constitutively expresses the kidney-specific high-affinity H+/peptide cotransporter described in the proximal tubular epithelial cells of the normal kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2089368424,"Chaperonins are known to facilitate protein folding, but their mechanism of action is not well understood.

Here we show that the cycling of α-tubulin by cytosolic chaperonin (c-cpn) can be uncoupled from the action of cofactors required to complete the folding reaction. This results in the accumulation of folding intermediates which are chaperonin-bound, stable, and quasi-native in that they bind GTP nonexchangeably. We present evidence that these intermediates can be generated without the target protein leaving c-cpn.

Activity was assayed using release of labeled noradrenaline from synaptosomes. For some experiments, α-latrotoxin was iodinated using chloramine T(12Petrenko A.G. Kovalenko V.A. Shamotienko O.G.

The antibody against α-latrotoxin (X751) was raised against purified protein in rabbits.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe constructed a series of fusion proteins of bovine neurexin Iα with IgG in order to take advantage of the recent cloning of a large number of independent neurexin Iα cDNAs(16Ullrich B. Ushkaryov Y.A. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The neurexin Iα IgG fusion proteins are depicted schematically in Fig. 1 together with the other IgG fusion proteins used for the current study. Incubation of neurexin Iα-IgG fusion protein immobilized on protein A-Sepharose with purified α-latrotoxin demonstrated stoichiometric and specific binding of α-latrotoxin only in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2, lanes 1-4). Binding was reversible since α-latrotoxin that was bound to neurexin Iα-IgG in the presence of Ca2+ could be readily dissociated by EGTA (Fig. 2, lane 6). Thus, α-latrotoxin binds to the extracellular domains of recombinant neurexin Iα in a Ca2+-dependent manner.Figure 2:Ca2+-dependent binding of α-latrotoxin to neurexin Iα-IgG fusion protein. Protein A-Sepharose preincubated with medium from COS cells transfected with control DNA (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or with the bovine neurexin Iα-IgG expression vector pCMVIGbN1α-1 (lanes 2, 4, and 6) was incubated with 5 μg of purified α-latrotoxin in the presence of 10 mM EGTA (lanes 1 and 2) or 1 mM Ca2+ (lanes 3-6). Beads were washed with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.7, 1 M NaCl in the presence of either 1 mM Ca2+ (lanes 1-4) or 10 mM EGTA (lanes 5 and 6). Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was present in all buffers to block nonspecific binding. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was bound to the protein A from the serum used for cell culture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies using recombinant rat neurexin Iα were unsuccessful in detecting binding. Therefore, we studied the potential dependence of binding on splice variants by analyzing a series of independent cDNAs. Four different neurexin Iα-IgG fusion proteins containing a variety of inserts in the first three splice sites of α-neurexins bound α-latrotoxin, whereas the recombinant proteins corresponding to neurexin IIIα and the previously studied rat neurexin Iα did not (lanes 1-8 versus 13-16, Fig. 3). Furthermore, C-terminal truncations of cDNAs that bound α-latrotoxin as full-length protein abolished binding (lanes 9-12), and the two splice variants of neurexin Iβ were also unable to bind (lanes 17-20, Fig. 3; see Fig. 1 for an overview of the structures of the neurexin-IgG fusion proteins). Thus, several recombinant neurexin Iα proteins with different splice site variants bind α-latrotoxin. Both N-terminal α-specific sequences of neurexin Iα and its C-terminal half are required for binding.Figure 3:Binding of α-latrotoxin to different α- and β-neurexin IgG fusion proteins. Eight α-neurexin IgG (lanes 1-16) and two β-neurexin IgG fusion proteins (lanes 17-20) immobilized on protein A-Sepharose were incubated with purified α-latrotoxin in the presence of 10 mM EGTA or 1 mM Ca2+. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (top panel) or immunoblotting for α-latrotoxin (bottom panel). The different constructs used for production of IgG fusion proteins were: lanes 1 and 2, pCMVIGbNIα-2; lanes 3 and 4, pCMVIGbNIα-3; lanes 5 and 6, pCMVIGbNIα-4; lanes 7 and 8, pCMVIGbNIα-7; lanes 9 and 10, pCMVIGbNIα-15; lanes 11 and 12, pCMVIGbNIα-17; lanes 13 and 14, pCMVIGbNIIIα-2; lanes 15 and 16, pCMVIGNIα-1; lanes 17 and 18, pCMVIGbNIβ-1; lanes 19 and 20, pCMVIGbNIβ-3. Different neurexin IgG fusion constructs vary widely in expression levels, and experiments were normalized for the concentrations of the neurexin IgG fusion proteins. Since neurexin Iβ constructs express much better than the α constructs, no immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgG-HC) is detected in the lanes with neurexin Iβ-IgG constructs because fewer protein A-beads were used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The nearly stoichiometric binding of α-latrotoxin to neurexin Iα suggests a stable interaction of high affinity. To test this, the binding of radiolabeled α-latrotoxin to recombinant neurexin Iα was measured (Fig. 4). A binding affinity of approximately 4 nM was determined, suggesting that neurexin Iα is indeed a high affinity α-latrotoxin-binding protein. The affinity of recombinant neurexin Iα was compared with that of the high affinity binding proteins that were purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized α-latrotoxin(11Scheer H. Meldolesi J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Petrenko A.G. Kovalenko V.A. Shamotienko O.G. Surkova I.N. Tarasyuk T.A. Ushkaryov Y.A. Grishin E.V.

Recombinant neurexin Iα had an almost identical affinity as the purified protein, confirming that the α-latrotoxin binding observed in the purified receptor corresponds to neurexin Iα (Fig. 4).Figure 4:Affinity of α-latrotoxin for neurexin Iα-IgG. Immobilized neurexin Iα-IgG (squares, IG-Nx) or α-latrotoxin binding proteins purified by affinity chromatography on α-latrotoxin (diamonds, LTR) (11Scheer H. Meldolesi J.

The amount of bound and free α-latrotoxin was determined and analyzed in a Scatchard plot as shown. Note that the affinity of recombinant neurexin is virtually identical with that of the purified protein complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The experiment in Fig. 2 suggested that α-latrotoxin binding to neurexin Iα may be Ca2+-dependent. To investigate this further, we studied the effect of different Ca2+ concentrations on binding in the presence of a saturating concentration of Mg2+ (Fig. 5). Mg2+ alone was unable to trigger binding. Ca2+ acted in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of ≈35 μM and with a single apparent binding site. This result suggests that α-latrotoxin and/or neurexins contain a structural Ca2+ binding site which has to be occupied in order for the two proteins to interact. Since previous studies demonstrated that neuroligin 1, the ligand for β-neurexins, also requires Ca2+ for binding(19Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the extracellular domains of neurexins contain structural Ca2+ binding sites that are required to keep the molecule in an active conformation.Figure 5:Ca2+ dependence of α-latrotoxin binding to neurexin Iα. Protein A-beads coated with neurexin Iα-IgG (closed circles) or with neurexin Iβ-IgG (open circles) were incubated with radiolabeled α-latrotoxin in the presence of 2 mM Mg2+ and the indicated Ca2+ concentrations. Binding of α-latrotoxin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (shown in the top panel for neurexin Iα-IgG) and quantified by determining the radioactivity of the bound α-latrotoxin (bottom panel). The curve drawn in the bottom panel was generated with the GraphInPlot program and corresponds to a single binding site with an EC50 of 35 μM and a Hill coefficient of 0.9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The goal of the current study was to investigate the candidacy of neurexin Iα as the α-latrotoxin receptor. This receptor is interesting because binding to it may mediate the ability of α-latrotoxin to trigger massive neurotransmitter release. Synaptotagmin, a nerve terminal Ca2+ sensor(21Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar), co-purifies with this receptor on an α-latrotoxin column, suggesting a possible role of the α-latrotoxin receptor in regulating synaptic vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane(22Petrenko A.G. Perin M.S. Davletov B.A. Ushkaryov Y.A. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The current study demonstrates that the extracellular domains of neurexin Iα bind α-latrotoxin with high affinity in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This binding is specific since it was observed with only a subset of neurexin Iα-IgG fusion proteins and not with control proteins or other IgG fusion proteins.The affinity of the interaction between neurexin Iα and α-latrotoxin agrees well with the α-latrotoxin concentrations required for toxic actions(1Frontali N. Ceccarelli B. Gorio A. Mauro A. Siekevitz P. Tzeng M.C. Hurlbut W.P. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 462-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 2Ceccarelli B. Grohovaz F. Hurlbut W.P. J.

Rugolo M. Scott I.G. Meldolesi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7924-7928Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the Ca2+ dependence of the interaction is puzzling, even though the Ca2+ concentration required for binding is low. Although the α-latrotoxin receptor purified by affinity chromatography also requires Ca2+ for binding, α-latrotoxin binding to brain membranes is decreased but not abolished in the absence of Ca2+(23Meldolesi J. Maddedu L. Torda M. Gatti G. Niutta E. Neuroscience. 1983; 10: 997-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α-latrotoxin is capable of triggering neurotransmitter release in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ if Mg2+ is present. Thus, it is possible that a second high affinity binding protein for α-latrotoxin exists that is distinct from neurexin Iα and binds the toxin in the absence of Ca2+. Since Scatchard plots of α-latrotoxin binding demonstrated only a single class of binding sites, any putative receptor would have to bind α-latrotoxin with the same affinity as neurexin Iα. Alternatively, a neurexin isoform may exist that does not require Ca2+ for α-latrotoxin binding. Future experiments will have to address these possibilities. INTRODUCTIONα-Latrotoxin, a component of black widow spider venom, is one of the most potent excitatory neurotoxins known. α-Latrotoxin stimulates neurotransmitter release from vertebrate nerve terminals by triggering massive exocytosis of small synaptic vesicles(1Frontali N.

Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). α-Latrotoxin-stimulated neurotransmitter release is accompanied by presynaptic membrane depolarization and the influx of Ca2+ through ion channels induced by the toxin(3Grasso A.

Purified α-latrotoxin forms cation channels in black lipid membranes, leading to the hypothesis that the toxin may act as an ionophore although the channel characteristics differ from those observed in intoxicated PC12 cells(5Finkelstein A.

Immunofluorescence localization of bound α-latrotoxin at the neuromuscular junction suggested that the binding sites are localized to the presynaptic plasma membrane(10Valtorta F. Maddedu L. Meldolesi J. Ceccarelli B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that α-latrotoxin acts by binding to presynaptic receptors, which it either activates directly or which serves to target its insertion into the presynaptic plasma membrane.The binding sites for α-latrotoxin in brain membranes are of low abundance (≈0.3 nmol/g of protein) and of high affinity (≈10−9M). Affinity purification of α-latrotoxin-binding proteins from brain resulted in the isolation of a protein fraction that bound α-latrotoxin with high affinity (11Scheer H. Meldolesi J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and contained two classes of proteins (12Petrenko A.G. Kovalenko V.A. Shamotienko O.G. Surkova I.N. Tarasyuk T.A. Ushkaryov Y.A.

The purification of these proteins suggested that they represent components of the α-latrotoxin receptor. However, it was impossible to define the exact binding partner because direct binding of recombinant proteins to α-latrotoxin was not achieved.Neurexin Iα and its isoforms, IIα and IIIα, structurally resemble cell surface proteins(13Ushkaryov Y.A.

The discovery of neurexin Iα as a component of the protein complex that binds α-latrotoxin with high affinity raised the question of whether neurexin Iα represents an α-latrotoxin receptor or is only purified indirectly.

https://openalex.org/W2042486508,"In human cervical carcinomas papillomavirus DNA is frequently integrated in the cell genome. We have cloned the integration site of human papillomavirus-18 DNA in human chromosome region 12q13-15 present in the SW756 cervical carcinoma cell line. Viral DNA is broken from nucleotides 2643 to 3418 in the E1 and E2 open reading frames, resulting in a deletion of 775 bases of viral DNA. Cloning and sequence analysis of the rearranged and germline alleles shows that there is no homology between the target cellular and viral DNA, suggesting it is a nonhomologous recombination. The target cellular region is called papillomavirus associated locus 2 (PAL2). The 5′- and 3′-flanking probes derived from the hybrid viral-cellular clone detect completely different germline restriction fragments in DNA from cells with normal chromosome 12. There is no overlap between the restriction maps of the target germline clones obtained with 5′- and 3′-flanking probes. Probes from these germline clones beyond the breakpoint position do not detect any DNA rearrangement in SW756 cells DNA. These data prove that there is a deletion of cellular DNA as consequence of the integration, with an estimated minimum size of 14 kilobases. Both cellular flanking probes are outside the amplicon of this chromosome region identified in the OSA and RMS13 sarcoma cell lines, comprising SAS-CHOP-CDK4-MDM2 genes and where translocation breakpoints are located in liposarcomas. The integration at 12q13-15 might have been selected by its contribution to the tumor phenotype. In human cervical carcinomas papillomavirus DNA is frequently integrated in the cell genome. We have cloned the integration site of human papillomavirus-18 DNA in human chromosome region 12q13-15 present in the SW756 cervical carcinoma cell line. Viral DNA is broken from nucleotides 2643 to 3418 in the E1 and E2 open reading frames, resulting in a deletion of 775 bases of viral DNA. Cloning and sequence analysis of the rearranged and germline alleles shows that there is no homology between the target cellular and viral DNA, suggesting it is a nonhomologous recombination. The target cellular region is called papillomavirus associated locus 2 (PAL2). The 5′- and 3′-flanking probes derived from the hybrid viral-cellular clone detect completely different germline restriction fragments in DNA from cells with normal chromosome 12. There is no overlap between the restriction maps of the target germline clones obtained with 5′- and 3′-flanking probes. Probes from these germline clones beyond the breakpoint position do not detect any DNA rearrangement in SW756 cells DNA.

We describe a procedure to purify the product of the mouse fgf3 gene and show it to be a potent mitogen for some epithelial cell lines. Using a receptor binding competition assay, Fgf3 was shown to bind with high affinity to the IIIb isoforms of Fgf receptor (FgfR) 1 and FgfR2 (ID50 = ~0.8 nM) and with a lower affinity to the IIIc variant of FgfR2 (ID50 = ~9 nM). No competition for the binding of 125I-Fgf1 was observed for FgfR1 (IIIc), FgfR3 (IIIb and IIIc), or FgfR4. Mitogenicity assays using BaF3 cells containing individual Fgf receptors showed a pattern of response in agreement with the receptor binding results. A comparison of two mammary epithelial cell lines showed a marked difference of potency and dependence upon heparin in their response to mouse Fgf3, suggesting a complex interaction between the ligand and its low and high affinity receptors. fgf3 has been implicated in the embryonic and fetal development of the mouse and as an oncogene in murine breast cancer.

INTRODUCTIONThe fibroblast growth factors constitute a family of nine proteins that share 35-55% amino acid identity over a core region (1Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T.

Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The prototypic members, Fgf1 and Fgf2, have been ascribed a number of properties including the induction of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and cell survival, consistent with roles as autocrine and paracrine signaling molecules. For Fgf2 and Fgf3 there is also good evidence for the translocation of the protein directly to the cell nucleus(5Baldin V. Roman A.-M. Bosc-Bierne I. Amalric F. Bouche G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 6Bouche G. Gas N. Prats H. Baldin V. Tauber J.-P. Teissie J. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pappin D. Peters G. Dickson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4126-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); however, the biological significance of this event is not known. The common route for Fgf signaling is through an interaction of an extracellular Fgf with cell surface receptors (reviewed in (9Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and (10Johnson D. Lee P. Lu J. Williams L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4728-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar)). Two classes of Fgf receptor have been identified: a low affinity receptor typified by heparan sulfate proteoglycans that bind Fgfs to high capacity but seem not to signal (11Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and a high affinity receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (reviewed in (9Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and (10Johnson D. Lee P. Lu J. Williams L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4728-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar)). Four tyrosine kinase receptor genes (fgfr1 to fgfr4) have been identified in mammals that encode an extracellular ligand binding domain composed of two (β-form) or three (α-form) immunoglobulin-like motifs, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic portion that encompasses a tyrosine kinase domain. FgfR1, 1The abbreviations used are: FgfRFgf receptorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbpkilobase pair(s). FgfR2, and FgfR3 but not FgfR4 have a choice of exon encoding the second half of the third Ig loop, termed IIIb and IIIc, respectively. This alternative splicing changes the ligand binding specificity of the receptors(12Dell K.R. Williams L.T. J. Biol.

Both receptor classes are needed for signal transduction. The low affinity receptors are required for high affinity ligand binding and appear to facilitate the dimerization of the tyrosine kinase receptor-Fgf complexes(16Spivak-Kroizman T.

Dimer formation results in tyrosine autophosphorylation of the receptor providing suitable sites for second messenger interactions and consequent signal transduction (reviewed in (19Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar)).fgf3 was identified as a proto-oncogene activated by proviral insertion in mouse mammary tumors(20Dickson C. Deed R. Dixon M. Peters G. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 123-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Peters G. Semin. Virol. 1991; 2: 319-328Google Scholar). Expression of fgf3 was not detected in the normal mammary glands, suggesting that its inappropriate expression contributed to tumorigenesis. This notion gained considerable support from transgenic mouse studies(22Muller W.J. Lee F.S. Dickson C. Peters G. Pattengale P. Leder P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Ornitz D.M. Cardiff R.D. Kuo A. Leder P. J. Natl.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 929-938PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, constitutive ectopic expression of fgf3 led to abnormal mammary gland development manifest as multifocal pregnancy-sensitive epithelial hyperplasia, with the stochastic appearance of frank neoplasia. These observations prompted us to identify the receptors responsible for Fgf3 signaling and to determine which isoforms are present on mammary epithelial cells.In this study, we describe a purification procedure for Fgf3, determine its receptor preferences, and show that these correlate with its ability to induce DNA synthesis in BaF3 cells expressing a single introduced receptor isoform. Mammary epithelial cells are shown to express receptors for and respond mitogenically to Fgf3. Using two mammary cell lines, we observed different response profiles for Fgf3 and other Fgfs that are dependent upon the concentration of heparin.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureCOS-1, C57MG, NIH3T3, and DMI-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. BALB/MK cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM (without calcium) and Ham's F-12 medium containing 8% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor(25Rubin J.S. Osada H. Finch P.W. Taylor W.G. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). HC11 cells were grown in RMPI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (26Ball R. Friis R. Schonenberger C. Doppler W. Groner B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For DNA transfections, 10 μg of purified plasmid DNA was introduced into 5 × 106 COS-1 cells by electroporation (450 V/250 microfarads) using a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser.Purification of Mouse Fgf3DMI-1 cells (27Goldfarb M. Deed R. MacAllan D. Walther W. Dickson C. Peters G. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 65-71PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in roller bottles coated with poly-L-Lysine (Sigma). When subconfluent, the cells were changed to DMEM containing 0.1% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml heparin (Sigma). After 48-72 h, the conditioned medium was harvested, and the following were added at the final concentrations indicated: 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM EDTA. The conditioned medium (400 ml) was gently mixed overnight at 4°C with 80 mg of heparin-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). The mixture was batch washed with 400 ml of isotonic phosphate-buffered saline and poured onto a Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline adjusted to 0.6 M NaCl to remove Fgf7 (see “Results”). Mouse Fgf3 was eluted in 1-ml fractions of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 M NaCl and detected after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels. This procedure resulted in the isolation of a peak of mitogenic activity containing a single band of the correct size (32 kDa) as judged by silver staining. Identity to mouse Fgf3 was checked by Western blot using a polyclonal anti-peptide serum (see Fig. 1). This procedure yielded in average 10 μg of mouse Fgf3 from 4 × 108 cells.Iodination of Fgf1, Fgf3, and Fgf7Recombinant human Fgf1 (BioTech Trade and Service), Fgf3, and recombinant human Fgf7 (Promega) were iodinated by the chloramine T method as described (28Kan M. Shi E. McKeehan W. Barnes D. Mather J. Sato G. Peptide Growth Factors. Academic Press, New York1991: 158-171Google Scholar). The labeled products were separated from free iodine-125 by heparin-Sepharose chromatography and eluted with 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1.5 M NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Specific activities ranged from 10,000 to 30,000 cpm/ng.RT-PCR of the Fgf ReceptorsTotal RNA was recovered by guanidinium thiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride. First strand cDNAs were synthesized using the Amersham kit with oligo(dT) as the primer. PCRs were carried out on 1 μl of template using the Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Promega) (30 cycles with denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 65°C for 2 min, and extension at 72°C for 2.5 min). The extracellular, transmembrane, and juxtamembrane coding regions of FgfR1 and FgfR2 were amplified using pairs of oligonucleotides previously described(29Mathieu M. Kiefer P. Mason I. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6779-6787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The PCR products were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The expected sizes of the PCR products corresponding to the α, β, and β containing the acid box variants are 1.4, 1.1, and 1.2 kbp, respectively. To identify the presence of the IIIb and IIIc isoforms of FgfR1, PCR using the same 5′ primer as indicated above was paired with a 3′ oligonucleotide specific for the antisense region of IIIb (TCGGTCGACTCAGCGGCGTTTGAGTCCGCCAT) or IIIc (GAGTCCGATAGAGTTACCCGCCAA) domains, respectively. To distinguish the IIIb and IIIc isoforms of FgfR2, the PCR products were digested with the restriction endonucleases AvaI, which cleaves specifically IIIb, and EcoRV, which cleaves IIIc, thereby generating a unique set of DNA fragments derived from the α, β, and β plus acid box variants(30Champion-Arnaud P. Ronsin C. Gilbert E. Gesnel M.C. Houssaint E. Breathnach R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar).Fgf Receptor Competition Binding AssayVectors for the expression of mouse FgfR1 (IIIc), FgfR2 (IIIb), FgfR2 (IIIc), and FgfR4 cDNAs in COS-1 cells have been described previously(29Mathieu M.

A human FgfR1 (IIIb) complete cDNA cloned into pBluescript KS (+) (Stratagene) was kindly provided by Dr Sabine Werner(31Werner S. Duan D.-S.R. de Vries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The translation start was optimized according to Kozak (51Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR (5′ oligonucleotide, tcgtctagaccATGgGGAGCTGGAAGTGCCTCCTC and 3′ oligonucleotide, tcgtctagaTCAGCGGCGTTTGAGTCCGCCAT), and the resulting 2.2-kbp fragment was then subcloned into the XbaI site of the expression vector pKC3(32Dixon M. Deed R. Acland P. Moore R. Whyte A. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4896-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lowercase nucleotides are added linker or mutated sequences absent in the cDNA; the start and stop codons are indicated in boldface type. Complementary cDNAs for mouse FgfR3 isoforms were transferred as HindIII-BamHI fragments from MomFR3SV and MomFR3IIIbSV (13Chellaiah A. McEwen D. Werner S. Xu J. Ornitz D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16305-16311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the expression vector pKC3.COS-1 cells were transfected with the appropriate Fgf receptor and seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well into 48-well tissue culture dishes pre-treated with poly-L-Lysine (Sigma) as described by the manufacturer. After 48 h, the cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold binding medium (DMEM containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/ml heparin) and incubated for 3 h at 4°C with the indicated amounts of 125I-Fgf1 or 125I-Fgf3 in binding medium. Competition binding was performed in the presence of up to 200-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. The cell monolayers were then rinsed twice with cold binding medium, and solubilized by incubating in 0.1% SDS and 0.3 M NaOH for 30 min at 37°C, and the associated gamma radiation was counted. To determine specific binding, the radioactivity bound to cells transfected with empty vector was subtracted from that of cells receiving Fgf receptors. The amount of 125I-Fgf bound was plotted against the concentration of competitor, and the dose that inhibits the binding by 50% (ID50) was then calculated.Thymidine Incorporation AssaysFull-length cDNAs encoding the IIIb and IIIc variants of FgfR1 and FgfR2 were cloned into the expression vector MIRB. MIRB contains the Molony murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat, unique EcoRI, BamHI, and SpeI sites followed by the IRES-NEO gene in the Bluescript KS plasmid (described in (13Chellaiah A. McEwen D. Werner S. Xu J. Ornitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The plasmid pSVFgfR1 IIIb (31Werner S. Duan D.-S.R. de Vries C. Peters K.G.

Individual clonal cell lines were isolated by limiting dilution and screened for responsiveness to Fgf1. These cell lines were used in quantitative proliferation assays, measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA as described previously(13Chellaiah A. McEwen D. Werner S. Xu J. Ornitz D. J. Biol.

Thomas, Merck) was used as a positive control in each experiment because Fgf1 is the only Fgf ligand that can activate all splice variants of all Fgf receptors. 2D. Ornitz, unpublished observation. BALB/MK and NIH3T3 cells were transferred to 48-well tissue culture plates (2 × 104 cells/well) in 0.5 ml of growth medium and left for 9 or 7 days, respectively, to become confluent and quiescent(29Mathieu M. Kiefer P. Mason I. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6779-6787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The culture medium was then replaced with serum-free medium containing the test samples and processed as described previously(36Kiefer P. Mathieu M. Close M. Peters G. Dickson C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4159-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). C57MG and HC11 cells were made quiescent by replacing the medium after 24 h of growth with DMEM containing 0.1% new born calf serum. After a further 72 h, the cells were treated with the test samples in fresh medium containing 0.1% serum for 22 h. [3H]Thymidine incorporation assays were performed as described previously(36Kiefer P. Mathieu M. Close M. Peters G. Dickson C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4159-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).RESULTSPurification of Mouse Fgf3As a source of mouse Fgf3, we have used the conditioned culture medium from DMI-1 cells (27Goldfarb M. Deed R. MacAllan D. Walther W. Dickson C. Peters G. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 65-71PubMed Google Scholar). These transformed NIH3T3 cells emerged from a selection procedure in which colonies transfected with fgf3 cDNA in a murine leukemia virus-based vector were tested for their ability to grow as anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar and in a defined medium lacking growth factors(37Zhan X. Culpepper A. Reddy M. Loveless J. Goldfarb M. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 369-376PubMed Google Scholar). The highly transformed phenotype was shown to correlate with high levels of cell-associated and secreted Fgf3 (38Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5929-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this cell line, like several other fibroblast lines, produces mouse Fgf7. To separate these two Fgfs we have taken advantage of their differential capacity to bind heparin-Sepharose (25Rubin J.S. Osada H. Finch P.W. Taylor W.G. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). In an initial experiment, DMI-1 cell-conditioned medium was spiked with recombinant 125I-Fgf7, which eluted from the heparin-Sepharose column with 0.6 M NaCl. The bound Fgf3 was subsequently eluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 M NaCl, and no 125I-Fgf7 was found to co-purify as judged by Western blotting of the column fractions (data not shown). However, to further assess the potential contamination of Fgf3 by Fgf7, we used a sensitive mitogenicity assay in conjunction with a neutralizing antibody to Fgf7 (monoclonal antibody 1G4 was generously provided by J. Rubin and S. Aaronson, National Institutes of Health). The results show that the Fgf7-stimulated incorporation of [3H]thymidine was inhibited to approximately 90% by the antibody, whereas no significant effect was observed on the incorporation induced by Fgf3 (Fig. 1a). When fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining or immunoblotting, the preparations of mouse Fgf3 yielded a major product migrating with a relative mass of 32 kDa (Fig. 1, b and c). Thus, both biochemical and bioassay procedures failed to detect Fgf7 contamination of Fgf3.Relative Receptor Binding Affinities of Fgf3The Fgf receptors that bind mouse Fgf3 were identified by a competition binding assay. Initially, 125I-Fgf1 was used as tracer because it interacts with all known Fgf receptors. COS-1 cells expressing similar amounts of different Fgf receptors were incubated with 0.3 nM125I-Fgf1 in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of Fgf3. ID50 values were calculated from competition binding curves as presented in Fig. 2. The results show that mouse Fgf3 effectively competes with 125I-Fgf1 for binding to the IIIb and IIIc isoforms of FgfR2 and the IIIb isoform of FgfR1. Over the concentration range tested, which gave a molar excess of up to 133-fold, there was no competition for FgfR1 (IIIc), FgfR3 (IIIb and IIIc), or FgfR4. Surprisingly, the apparent affinity of mouse Fgf3 for the FgfR2 receptor isoforms were approximately 10-fold lower than those previously found using the Xenopus homologue of Fgf3 (Table 1 and (29Mathieu M. Kiefer P. Mason I. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6779-6787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). This result indicated that either mouse Fgf3 has a lower intrinsic affinity for these receptors or that its binding site for the receptor diverges from that of Fgf1. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the affinity of mouse Fgf3 was determined in a homologous system using 125I-Fgf3 instead of 125I-Fgf1 (Fig. 3). The ID50 values using 125I-Fgf3 as tracer were found to be 10-fold lower for FgfR1 (IIIb) and for FgfR2 (IIIb) but not for FgfR2 (IIIc). Hence, mouse Fgf3 binds with a high affinity to the IIIb variants of FgfR1 and FgfR2 (ID50 = ~0.8 nM) and binds with a lower affinity to FgfR2 (IIIc) (ID50 = ~9 nM) (see Table 1).Figure 2:Competition between Fgf3 and 125I-Fgf1 for binding to different Fgf receptors. COS-1 cells expressing the IIIb (open circles) or IIIc (closed circles) isoforms of the different Fgf receptors as indicated were incubated with 125I-Fgf1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of Fgf3.

The calculated ID50 values are listed in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mitogenic Activity on Cells Expressing Individual Fgf ReceptorsMouse Fgf3 was compared with Fgf1 and Fgf7 over a range of ligand concentrations for their ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in BaF3 cells expressing individual Fgf receptors. The results show that cells expressing FgfR1 (IIIb) and FgfR2 (IIIb) gave the best response to Fgf3, whereas FgfR2 (IIIc)-expressing cells were only weakly stimulated by this factor (Fig. 4). No growth stimulation occurred on BaF3 cells expressing FgfR1 (IIIc) (Fig. 4), FgfR3 (IIIb), FgfR3 (IIIc), and FgfR4 (data not shown). These findings confirmed the binding specificity of Fgf3 and indicated that its interactions with FgfR1 (IIIb) and FgfR2 were functional. However, it is not clear at present why the mitogenic potential of Fgf3 on BaF3 cells expressing the IIIb isoforms of FgfR1 or FgfR2 is lower than that of Fgf1 (and Fgf7 in the latter case), because these factors have a similar affinity for these receptors (data not shown and (13Chellaiah A. McEwen D. Werner S. Xu J. Ornitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Furthermore, on a mammary epithelial cell line that naturally expresses the same receptors, Fgf3 is a more efficient mitogen than Fgf1 or Fgf7, suggesting that factors other than receptor binding affinity influence the activity of Fgfs (see below).Figure 4:Fgf3 induction of DNA synthesis in Fgf receptor expressing BaF3 cells. BaF3 cells expressing the indicated isoforms of FgfR1 and FgfR2 were used to compare the mitogenic activity of Fgf1 (open squares), Fgf3 (filled circles), and Fgf7 (open circles) in the presence of 2 μg/ml heparin.

However, because of its involvement in breast cancer, we were particularly interested to assess the activity of Fgf3 on mammary epithelial cells. Fgf3 was indeed found to be mitogenic for the two mouse mammary cell lines, C57MG and HC11 (Fig. 5top panels). On HC11 cells, Fgf3 was a potent inducer of DNA synthesis with an ED50 (concentration eliciting 50% of the maximum response) of ~0.1 nM, whereas on the C57MG cell line the ED50 was above 1 nM. Interestingly, heparin, a glycosaminoglycan that can mimic the Fgf low affinity receptors (see introduction) enhanced by more than 10-fold the potency of Fgf3 on HC11 cells (Fig. 5right panels) while diminishing significantly the response of C57MG cells to this factor at concentrations above 2 μg/ml (Fig. 5left panels). We also found that heparin differentially modulated the mitogenic effect of various Fgfs on the same cell line (Fig. 5lower panels). On HC11, for instance, heparin enhanced the response to Fgf3 at all the doses tested but with a maximum effect at around 2 μg/ml. Higher concentrations of heparin were needed to increase the mitogenic activity of Fgf1, with a 3-fold enhancement at 100 μg/ml. In contrast, the response to Fgf7 was progressively inhibited at concentrations of heparin exceeding 0.5 μg/ml.Figure 5:Effect of heparin on the induction of DNA synthesis by Fgfs. In the top panels (C57MG and HC11 as indicated), quiescent cell cultures were treated with different concentrations of Fgf3 in the absence (open circles) or presence (filled circles) of 2 μg/ml heparin and [3H]thymidine incorporation measured as described. In the lower left panel, quiescent C57MG cells were treated or not (filled triangles) with 0.1 nM Fgf1 (open squares) or 1 nM Fgf3 (filled circles) in the absence or presence of increasing heparin concentrations as indicated. In the lower right panel, quiescent HC11 cells were treated or not (filled triangles) with 0.1 nM Fgf1 (open squares), Fgf3 (filled circles), or Fgf7 (open circles) in the absence or presence of increasing heparin concentrations as indicated.

https://openalex.org/W1970929783,"Adenosine deaminase (ADA, EC 3.5.4.4) is an essential enzyme of purine metabolism that is expressed at very high levels in the murine placenta where it accounts for over 95% of the ADA present at the fetal gestation site. We have recently shown that ADA-deficient fetuses, which also lack ADA in their adjoining placentas, die during late fetal development in association with profound purine metabolic disturbances and hepatocellular impairment. We have now investigated the potential importance of placental ADA by genetically restoring the enzyme to placentas of ADA-deficient fetuses. This genetic engineering strategy corrected most of the purine metabolic disturbances, prevented serious fetal liver damage, and rescued the fetuses from perinatal lethality. Our findings suggest that placental ADA is important for murine fetal development and illustrate a general strategy for the tissue specific correction of phenotypes associated with null mutations in mice."

When co-cultured with glutaraldehyde-fixed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the 32D-flg cells remained in suspension in the absence of FGF-2 but attached to the CHO monolayer in the presence of 10 ng/ml FGF-2. In contrast, 32D cells transfected with the vector alone did not attach to the CHO monolayer in the presence of FGF-2. FGF-2-dependent attachment of 32D-flg cells was prevented by inclusion of 10 μg/ml heparin in the incubation medium and was diminished when CHO mutants in glycosaminoglycan synthesis or wild-type CHO cells treated with heparinase were used, indicating that the attachment occurred through FGF-2 interactions with heparan sulfates on the CHO cells. Attachment of 32D-flg cells to wild-type CHO cells was half-maximal at 0.4 ng/ml FGF-2 and was also observed with FGF-1 but not FGF-4. 32D-flg cells also attached to living CHO cells in a FGF-2-dependent manner, but attachment was transient at 37°C. Induction of new proteins was not required for FGF-2-dependent attachment, since attachment occurred when the co-cultures were incubated at 4°C and when the 32D-flg cells were preincubated with cycloheximide. FGF-2-dependent attachment of 32D-flg cells was also observed with Balb/C 3T3, NIH 3T3, and bovine capillary endothelial cells. We conclude that attachment is due to FGF-2 binding simultaneously to receptors on the 32D-flg cells and heparan sulfates on the CHO monolayers; thus, the FGF-2 acts as a bridge between receptorexpressing cells and heparan sulfate-bearing cells. In addition, induction of DNA synthesis in 32D-flg cells in response to FGF-2 was potentiated by the CHO-associated heparan sulfates to the same extent as by soluble heparin, indicating that this interaction has functional significance.

https://openalex.org/W2012871985,"The phosphorylation of the P protein of vesicular stomatitis virus by cellular casein kinase II (CKII) is essential for its activity in viral transcription. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that CKII converts the inactive unphosphorylated form of P (P0) to an active phosphorylated form P1, after phosphorylation at two serine residues, Ser-59 and Ser-61. To gain insight into the role of CKII-mediated phosphorylation in the structure and function of the P protein, we have carried out circular dichroism (CD) and biochemical analyses of both P0 and P1. The results of CD analyses reveal that phosphorylation of P0 to P1 significantly increases the predicted α-helical structure of the P1 protein from 27 to 48%. The phosphorylation defective double serine mutant (P59/61), which is transcriptionally inactive, possesses a secondary structure similar to that of P0. P1, at a protein concentration of 50 μg/ml, elutes from a gel filtration column apparently as a dimer, whereas both P0 and the double serine mutant elute as a monomer at the same concentration. Interestingly, unlike wild-type P1 protein, the P mutants in which either Ser-59 or Ser-61 is altered to alanine required a high concentration of CKII for optimal phosphorylation. We demonstrate here that phosphorylation of either Ser-59 or Ser-61 is necessary and sufficient to transactivate L polymerase although alteration of one serine residue significantly decreases its affinity for CKII. We have also shown that P1 binds to the N-RNA template more efficiently than P0 and the formation of P1 is a prerequisite for the subsequent phosphorylation by L protein-associated kinase.

Together, these proteins are needed to transcribe the linear, single-stranded viral RNA genome of negative polarity, which is tightly wrapped with the nucleocapsid N protein (N-RNA template)(1Banerjee A.K.

Genetic and biochemical studies have suggested that the L protein encodes all the basic transcription activities, whereas the P protein appears to be an RNA virus transcription factor (1Banerjee A.K.

Banerjee A.K. New Biol. 1991; 3: 581-591PubMed Google Scholar). The P protein contains α-helical coiled structure and is highly acidic, with Asp and Glu residues constituting one-third of the first 100 amino acid residues in the N-terminal half (domain I) of the polypeptide(17Gill D.S. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 60-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Takacs A.M. Barik S. Das T. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5842-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The acidic domain is also phosphorylated by cellular protein kinase(14Bell J.C. Prevec L. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 697-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hsu C.H. Kingsbury D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8990-8995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possible contribution of the N-terminal acidic domain I in the function of P protein seems to transactivate the L protein for transcription similar to those observed for eucaryotic acidic transactivators(30Ptashne M.

Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7977-7981Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The C-terminal end, on the other hand, serves as the binding site for the L protein (domain II) and the N-RNA template (domain III)(8Gill D.S. Chattopadhyay D.J. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8873-8877Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Paul P.R. Chattopadhyay D.J. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1988; 166: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Initial studies of P protein isolated from virions or infected cell extract indicated that it exists in a variety of phosphorylated states and that this phosphorylation event was important for the transcriptional activity of L(10Hsu C.H. Morgan E.M. Kingsbury D.W. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 104-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kingsford L. Emerson S.U. J. Virol. 1980; 33: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Masters P.S. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1986; 154: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently we have shown that cellular protein kinase, casein kinase II (CKII), is directly involved in phosphorylating the P protein at serine residues 59 and 61 in domain I(6Barik S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6570-6574Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); activation of P protein occurs following this initial phosphorylation event. Two additional sites at the C-terminal domain (domain II) are also phosphorylated by an L protein-associated kinase at serine residues 236 and 242, as determined previously by mutational analyses of recombinant P protein(16Chattopadhyay D.J. Banerjee A.K. Cell. 1987; 49: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). vesicular stomatitis virus casein kinase II dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis respiratory syncytial virus human parainfluenza virus. The role of cellular CKII in the phosphorylation of P protein was demonstrated in vitro primarily by using the unphosphorylated form of P protein obtained by expression of the P gene in Escherichia coli(4Barik S. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1719-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two forms of P protein (NJ serotype) were shown to be involved in the activation process: a partially phosphorylated intermediate (P1) and a fully phosphorylated form (P2). Cellular CKII phosphorylated bacterially expressed P0 and converted it into P1, but not to P2, demonstrating that P1 is the end product of cell kinase-mediated phosphorylation. A highly purified L protein preparation failed to phosphorylate P0 but phosphorylated P1 to produce P2. Thus, a cascade phosphorylation pathway was proposed in which a sequential phosphorylation step occurred as P0 → P1 → P2, leading to the activation of the P protein(5Barik S. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Barik S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6570-6574Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that phosphorylation of the P protein by CKII is the first biosynthetic event in the infected cell that possibly leads to a conformational change in the P protein such that domain II becomes accessible to L-kinase. However, the precise role of CKII-mediated phosphorylation in the structure and function of the P protein remains unclear. In an attempt to understand the phophorylation pathway and the role of phosphorylation in P function, we have carried out structure-function analyses of the P protein in more detail using various P mutants. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation by cellular CKII induces a profound increase in the predicted α-helical structure and in the apparent dimerization of the P protein as determined by gel filtration analysis. In addition, phosphorylation facilitates the binding of P to the N-RNA template as well as subsequent phosphorylation by L-associated kinase. We have characterized two P phosphorylation mutants which require higher concentration of CKII for their optimal phosphorylation leading to activation and concomitant alteration of structure of the P protein. All enzymes and biochemicals were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim and Sigma. Tissue culture reagents and media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. VSV New Jersey serotype, Ogden strain was purified as described previously (4Barik S. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1719-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Banerjee A.K. Moyer S.A. Rhodes D.P.

BHK cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential media supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum. Various recombinant P mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified essentially as described previously(4Barik S. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1719-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After purification by phosphocellulose and DE52 column chromatography, the P proteins were more than 90% pure. CD spectra of various P mutant proteins were measured at 25°C on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter interfaced to a computer for data collection and manipulation. The instrument was calibrated with d-10 camphorsulfonic acid(25Chen G.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Lett. 1977; 10: 1195-1207Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded between 180 and 260 nm using a 0.01-mm quartz cell. All spectra, averages of at least 10 scans, are correlated for the spectral contributions of the buffer. The measurements were performed at varying protein concentrations in a solution containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl. The protein concentration was determined according to Beaven and Holiday(28Beaven G.H. Holiday E.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1952; 7: 320-386Google Scholar). The mean residue mass was calculated from the amino acid composition(26Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The spectra were analyzed to estimate the distribution of secondary structural elements by the variable selection method developed by Manavalan and Johnson(27Manavalan P.S. Johnson W.C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed, purified P protein at various concentrations was chromatographed through a Sephadex G-100 gel filtration column. An 18-ml bed volume column was first equilibrated with VSV transcription buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT) and subsequently calibrated with standard proteins of known molecular size. We used bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) (purchased from Sigma) as known protein standards. P protein (5 μg) in a 100-μl VSV transcription buffer was fractionated, and the alternate fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining and autoradiography where applicable. For unphosphorylated and P59/61 mutant P proteins, the fractions were analyzed either by silver stain or by autoradiography of 35S-labeled proteins. On the other hand, for phosphorylated P proteins, bacterially expressed P0 and P4+61 mutant proteins were first phosphorylated with recombinant CKII and [g-32P]ATP in vitro in a VSV transcription buffer and chromatographed through Sephadex G-100 in the same way as described above. The P protein band in the SDS gel was identified by its characteristic mobility (molecular mass ~46 kDa) as well as by Western blot analyses with specific antibody. In the standard protein kinase assay, a varying amount (0.1-1 μg) of the desired form of P protein (P0, P1, or mutant P proteins) was incubated in the presence of CKII (0.01 milliunits), or 1 μg of L, or 0.5 μg of CsCl-banded N-RNA template as the source of protein kinases in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing VSV transcription buffer and 100 μM ATP in the presence of 10 μCi of [g-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 1-2 h at 30°C and either immediately stopped by adding Laemmli buffer or subjected to chromatography on DE52 to resolve and purify the product as described earlier(5Barik S. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-RNA (2 μg) was incubated with increasing amount of P proteins in a reaction volume of 50 μl containing VSV transcription buffer for 1 h at 30°C. In the case of P0 and P59/61 mutant, we used [35S]methionine-labeled proteins, whereas in the case of P1 and phosphorylated mutant proteins, we labeled the proteins with [g-32P]ATP in the presence of CKII. Reactions were placed on ice and layered onto 600 μl of same buffer containing 30% glycerol and centrifuged for 3 h at 45 K in the SW50.1 rotor in 0.7-ml centrifuge tubes. The glycerol was gently removed with a long tip micropipette, and the sides of the tubes were dried using tissue paper. The N-RNA pellet and any associated P proteins were resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. Binding of the P proteins to the N-RNA template was quantified by desitometric scanning of the P band in the autoradiogram. We also performed control experiments where P proteins were pelleted without the N-RNA template, and this background count was subtracted from each experiment. Each binding assay was performed independently, in duplicate, and the results presented are the average of these experiments. The isolation and purification of N-RNA template and L protein was performed essentially as described (23De B.P. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 628-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a number of modifications. 10 mg of purified VSV was initially disrupted in a buffer containing 0.4 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5% glycerol, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, by incubation on ice for 90 min with continuous gentle rocking. The viral ribonucleoprotein (i.e. the genomic RNA associated with N, P, and L proteins) was then purified by centrifugation onto a 100% glycerol cushion through 30% glycerol containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT for 2 h at 45 K in an SW60 rotor at 4°C. Ribonucleoprotein was collected from the top of a 100% glycerol cushion in 2 ml of Tris-EDTA and was disrupted again as described above, but in buffer containing 1 M NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100 to dissociate the L and the P proteins from the N-RNA template. The N-RNA was purified by centrifugation through 30% glycerol onto a 100% glycerol cushion in the same manner as described above. The high salt supernatant containing L and P proteins was stored at −80°C until further use. N-RNA was further purified by an additional high salt wash, centrifuged through 15% Renografin onto a 76% Renografin cushion(23De B.P. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 628-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by two serial recoveries from CsCl gradients (0.35 mg of CsCl/ml of Tris-EDTA final concentration) by centrifugation at 45 K for 16 h in an SW60 rotor at 20°C. N-RNA was finally dialyzed against Tris-EDTA. The purity of the N-RNA template was determined initially by silver staining of gels after SDS-PAGE and finally by reconstitution of transcription in vitro with recombinant (29Sleat D.E. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1334-1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or viral L protein and bacterially expressed P protein(4Barik S. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1719-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high salt fraction containing L and P was dialyzed against phosphocellulose buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT) and loaded onto a 2.0-ml phosphocellulose column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with phosphocellulose buffer, and the bound L protein was eluted with a 0-1.0 M NaCl gradient (12 ml) in the same buffer. Fractions in which L was completely free of P protein (as identified by silver staining) and devoid of cellular kinase (as checked by phosphorylation of bacterially expressed VSV P protein as substrate) were pooled. If necessary, the L protein was further rechromatographed onto a second phosphocellulose column to remove any contaminating viral P protein and cellular kinase. VSV transcription in vitro was carried out essentially as described earlier (23De B.P. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 628-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that E. coli expressed, recombinant P proteins were used instead of viral P protein. 500 ng of N-RNA, approximately 50 ng of L, and 100 ng of P were used in a 25-μl reaction mixture which also contained VSV transcription buffer, 0.5 mM each of ATP, CTP, GTP, 100 μM UTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP and 1 unit/μl RNasin. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 30°C, and poly(A) tails were removed from the viral messages by treating with 100 ng of oligo(dT) and 1 unit of RNase H at 37°C for 15 min. Reactions were terminated by extraction with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 5 μg of carrier tRNA. Viral RNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea as described earlier(23De B.P. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 628-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative silver staining of polyacrylamide gels was done by using Bio-Rad reagents and protocols. Radioactivity of labeled protein fractions was measured in a model LS 1701 Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Where needed, densitometric scanning of stained protein bands or autoradiograms were performed in a model 620 Bio-Rad video densitometer. The cascade phosphorylation pathway proposed by Barik and Banerjee (5Barik S. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) strongly suggests that the phosphorylation of P0 to P1 must initiate a conformational change in the protein which presumably imparts its transactivation property. Since the prediction of the secondary structure for globular proteins from circular dichroism spectroscopic data is a well established method in recent years(27Manavalan P.S. Johnson W.C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), we were interested in comparing the secondary structures of P0 and P1 proteins using far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, CD analysis of P0 predicts a secondary structure distribution of 27%α-helix and 23%β-structure. Interestingly, a dramatic change from β-structure to α-helical structure is predicted when the P protein is phosphorylated by CKII. The predicted secondary structure of P1 consists of 48%α-helix and only 7%β-structure (Table 1), i.e. an increase of approximately 2-fold in helical content over unphosphorylated P0. We have shown previously that Ser-59 and Ser-61 residues of the P protein are phosphorylated by CKII, and when both serine residues are altered to alanine (Fig. 3, P59/61), the mutant P protein became inactive in transcription(18Takacs A.M. Barik S. Das T. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5842-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the structure of the P mutant was analyzed by CD, the mutant protein showed similar overall secondary structure as that of P0 protein (Fig. 1, Table 1). These results strongly suggest that there is a significant difference in the secondary structures between P0 and P1 proteins. The conformation of P1 is more α-helical in nature similar to many well studied eucaryotic transcription factors.Table 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 3:Schematic representation of VSV(NJ) P protein. The entire P protein containing all the domains is shown. The solid dots in domain I and II represent phosphorylation sites in these regions. An enlargement of a part of domain I shows the locations of serine residues 59 and 61 that are phosphorylated by CKII. The different mutant P proteins are also shown. In the case of P59/61, both Ser-59 and Ser-61 are mutated as indicated by asterisks, whereas in the case of single mutants, either Ser-59 or Ser-61 is unaltered, but four other possible sites are mutated(18Takacs A.M.

Virol. 1992; 66: 5842-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the activities of many transcription factors have also been shown to depend on their ability to form homodimers(24Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar), we were interested to examine whether phosphorylated P protein (P1) can oligomerize in vitro. To do so, we expressed various P mutants in bacteria and used the purified proteins for such studies. The P0 at a concentration of 50 μg/ml was subjected to chromatography in Sephadex G-100 gel filtration column along with standard proteins of known molecular size as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the P protein band was identified by its characteristic mobility (Mr~46,000) after silver staining or autoradiography (in the case of 35S-labeled protein). A densitometric scan of a representative fraction (Fig. 2, top panel) shows that essentially all of the P protein eluted at a position consistent with a 29-kDa monomeric polypeptide, suggesting that in the unphosphorylated form, P protein exists as a monomer at 50 μg/ml concentration. However, at a high protein concentration, i.e. 200 μg/ml, P0 eluted at a position higher than the 66-kDa marker, indicating that the unphosphorylated P protein has a natural propensity to form oligomer at high concentration (data not shown). Next, the P0 protein was phosphorylated by CKII to form P1 in the presence of [g-32P]ATP in vitro and tested its size estimated in the same manner as described above. Interestingly, P1 eluted at a position consistent with its being a dimer at the same protein concentration, i.e. 50 μg/ml, at which P0 fractionated as a monomer (Fig. 2, middle panel). A small amount of remaining unphosphorylated P0 was fractionated as a monomer. When phosphorylation-defective P59/61 double mutant was subjected to a similar gel filtration analysis, as expected, it fractionated as a monomer at the same protein concentration as P0 (Fig. 2, lower panel). These results strongly suggest that CKII-mediated phosphorylation brings about changes in the secondary structure of the P protein and perhaps facilitates apparent dimerization of P monomer. We were especially interested in two P mutants (Fig. 3), e.g. P4+59 (where Ser-59 is unaltered but four other possible phosphorylation sites are mutated to alanine) or P4+61 (where Ser-61 is unaltered and four other sites are mutated to alanine), which when expressed in COS cells, were phosphorylated to the same extent as that of wild-type P protein(18Takacs A.M. Barik S. Das T. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5842-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these mutants were transcriptionally inactive in vitro, when transcription-reconstitution was performed using wheat germ-translated proteins(18Takacs A.M. Barik S. Das T. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5842-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To resolve the discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro data, we expressed these single serine mutant P proteins in E. coli and examined their elution profile in Sephadex G-100 column chromatography as described above. Unexpectedly, when these mutant proteins were phosphorylated by CKII in vitro and subjected to gel filtration analysis, they eluted in the same manner as that of wild-type P1 (Fig. 4, top panel), suggesting that they form apparent dimers at low protein concentration (50 μg/ml). We reasoned that the inability of P4+61 and P4+59 to transactivate L protein as observed before may be due to incomplete phosphorylation of the single serine residues by CKII present in wheat germ extract during their translation in vitro due possibly to their low affinity for CKII(18Takacs A.M. Barik S. Das T. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5842-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas, when these mutant proteins were completely phosphorylated by recombinant CKII in vitro, they were able to form dimers, thus, transcriptionally active. To test this possibility, we used bacterially expressed P mutant proteins and repeated our previous experiments. Purified CsCl-banded N-RNA template and kinase-free L protein from purified virions were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and used in transcription reconstitution reaction using bacterially expressed wild-type as well as P4+59 and P4+61 mutant proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, both P4+61 and P4+59 mutant proteins were unable to support viral transcription in the presence of N-RNA and L protein. The P0 (denoted Pwt, Fig. 5), on the other hand, showed the expected transcriptional activity under the same experimental conditions. As noted earlier, the trace quantity of CKII present in the purified N-RNA template efficiently activated P0 (Pwt) but failed to do so for the single serine mutants. However, when similar transcription reactions were performed in the presence of excess recombinant CKII, both the mutant proteins were transcriptionally active almost to the same extent as P0 (Pwt) (Fig. 6). These results indicate that P4+61 and P4+59 potentially need increased concentrations of CKII for their activation. Mutation in a single Ser residue has increased its requirement for CKII for phosphorylation leading to activation. To confirm whether CKII present in the N-RNA template was indeed unable to phosphorylate P4+61 and P4+59, we performed an in vitro phosphorylation reaction using the same amount of N-RNA template (0.5 μg in 25 μl) as the source of CKII and 100 ng each of the P proteins as substrate in the transcription reaction. The results shown in Fig. 7 indicate that the amount of CKII present in the N-RNA template was indeed unable to phosphorylate P4+61 and p4+59. In contrast, when excess recombinant CKII was added to the reaction mixture, both mutant proteins were phosphorylated completely. These results strongly suggest that P4+59 and P4+61 have lower affinity for CKII, but once phosphorylated by excess CKII can support VSV transcription. Thus, we conclude that phosphorylation of either Ser-59 or Ser-61 is necessary and sufficient to transactivate L-polymerase, although alteration of one serine residue significantly decreases its affinity for CKII. To further demonstrate that complete phosphorylation of P4+59 or P4+61 by CKII brings about similar conformational change as observed for P1, we carried out CD analyses of the mutant proteins. As shown in Fig. 8 and Table 2, phosphorylated P4+61, as expected, exhibited similar increases in α-helical structure as the wild-type P1.Figure 6:Transcription reconstitution with the P proteins in the presence of CKII.

In several respects, the PSII reaction center shares features similar to those of the purple photosynthetic bacteria(3Michel H. Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1-7Crossref Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In the bacterial reaction center, the cofactors that catalyze charge separation are bound to a heterodimer consisting of the L and M subunits. Determination of the structure of the reaction center of Rhodopseudomonas viridis gave information at the level of atomic resolution of the organization of the cofactors and the polypeptide chains of the L and M subunits(4Deisenhofer J.P.

Telfer A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 67-73Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar), it is quite clear that the D1 protein is analogous to the L-subunit of the bacterial system. Nevertheless, D1 protein shows the unusual characteristic of rapid turnover that is greater than in any other PSII protein and indeed faster than most other proteins in the photosynthetic membrane(11Mattoo A.K. Pick U. Hoffman-Falk H. Edelman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1572-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In contrast, the L-subunit does not turn over rapidly. The phenomenon of rapid turnover of D1 protein is even more amazing since, like the L-subunit, it forms the active branch of the PSII reaction center, being involved in both donor and acceptor side redox reactions. There is good reason to believe that the rapid turnover of D1 protein is a consequence of the vulnerability of PSII to photodamage and that this effect is the basis of the physiological phenomenon of photoinhibition(12Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 13Prásil O. Adir N. Ohad I. Barber J. Topics in Photosynthesis. Vol. 11.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2865-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) concluded that the degradation involved a cleavage that yielded a 23.5-kDa fragment containing the N terminus of the protein. A similar photoinduced fragment has also been generated using in vitro systems(15Salter A.H. Virgin I. Hagman A. Andersson B.

Shipton C.A. Ponticos M. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6944-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, recombination occurs between the radical pair state consisting of the oxidized primary electron donor (P680+) and reduced primary electron acceptor pheophytin a (pheo-). This recombination forms a triplet state of P680(18Durrant J.R. Giorgi L.B. Barber J. Klug D.R. Porter G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 167-175Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar), which is able to generate singlet oxygen(19Telfer A. Bishop S.M. Phillips D. Barber J. J. Biol.

The damage itself does not seem to be directly involved in the cleavage process but triggers the D1 protein for degradation (21Aro E.-M. Hundal T. Carlberg I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 269-275Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar) possibly via a conformational change(22He W.-Z. Newell W.R. Haris P.I. Chapman D. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4552-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because this isolated complex consists only of the D1 and D2 proteins, the α- and β-subunits of cytochrome b559 (Cyt b559), and the product of the psbI gene(9Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 259-262Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it has been concluded that the mechanism of cleavage is contained within the reaction center and that no external proteases are involved. For this reason, we have undertaken a study to elucidate the nature of the autocatalytic cleavage, which generates the 23-kDa N-terminal fragments. Previous studies have indicated that the cleavage occurs on the C-terminal side of residue 238 in the D1 sequence(14Greenberg B.M. Gaba V. Mattoo A.-K. Edelman M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2865-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 24Shipton C.A. Marder J.B. Barber J. Z. Naturforsch. 1990; 45: 765-771Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As emphasized by Greenberg et al.(14Greenberg B.M. Gaba V. Mattoo A.-K. Edelman M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2865-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), this cleavage site is located in the loop joining putative transmembrane segments IV and V, which is in the vicinity of the QB binding region (6Trebst A. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 742-750Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The investigation that we report here was stimulated by the observation that in addition to the appearance of the light-induced 23-kDa N-terminal fragment, a band was induced at about 41 kDa when isolated reaction centers were exposed to strong illumination. This band was reported by Shipton and Barber (25Shipton C.A. Barber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6691-6695Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and subsequently shown, by immunological blotting, to consist of D1 protein and the α-subunit of Cyt b559(26Barbato R. Friso G. Rigoni F. Frizzo A. Giacometti G.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, we further characterize the properties of this D1 protein/α-subunit Cyt b559 adduct and consider how the formation of a covalent linkage between these two reaction center subunits could be involved in events leading to D1 protein cleavage and the generation of the 23-kDa N-terminal fragment. Photosystem II reaction center (RCII) complexes were isolated from pea and wheat chloroplast membranes as described by Nanba and Satoh (9Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications described by Chapman et al.(27Chapman D.J. Gounaris K. Barber J. Rogers L.J. Methods in Plant Biochemistry. Vol. 5. Academic Press, London1991: 171-193Google Scholar). Irradiation of RCII complexes was performed, if not otherwise stated, in a thermostatic cuvette at 4°C at a chlorophyll concentration of 50 μg ml-1, using a Flexilux 650 lamp able to give fluence rates up to 2000 μmol m-2 s-1. Irradiation was carried out in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mMn-dodecyl β-D-maltoside. For pH-dependence experiments, Bis-Tris propane, MES, and Tris were used as buffer systems. SDS-PAGE in the presence of 6 M urea was carried out as described by Barbato et al.(28Barbato R. Shipton C.A. Giacometti G.M. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using a 12-18% linear acrylamide gradient. The stacking gel did not contain urea. Gels were stained with acid-free Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.5% in 40% methanol) and destained in 3 mM Na2CO3, 10 mM NaHCO3 containing 20% methanol. For proteolysis, the method of Cleveland et al. (29Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. The stained bands were cut out from the gel and loaded onto the stacker of a second identical gel and overlaid with the desired amount of protease (dissolved in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, and trace amounts of bromphenol blue). When the tracking dye was near to the bottom of the stacking gel, the current was switched off for 3 h to allow proteolysis to proceed, and then electrophoresis was carried out. Proteins separated on SDS-PAGE intended for immunoblotting were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (sartorius, 0.45 μm) using the transfer buffer described by Dunn(30Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Filters were stained with 0.2% Red Ponceau S in 3% trichloroacetic acid and destained in Tris-buffered saline. For immunodetection, filters were incubated in rabbit primary antibody and then with goat-anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG and streptavidine alkaline phosphatase-conjugate (Sigma). Visualization of immunocomplexes was obtained by adding suitable chromogenic substrates. For N-terminal sequencing, proteins separated on gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ProBlot, Applied Biosystems) according to Matsuidara(31Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 10 mM CAPS, pH 11. Gel solutions were stirred overnight on Amberlite MB1, and 1 mM 2-dimethylamino-ethanethiol hydrochloride was added to all buffers. To locate bands, filters were stained with 0.4% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 40% methanol and 1% acetic acid and destained in 40% methanol. N-terminal sequencing was performed by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems protein/peptide sequencer (model 477A). Properties of polyclonal antisera used in this study have been previously described. Anti-D1N was raised to the N-terminal fragment produced by Lys-C digestion of wheat D1 protein(32Barbato R. Friso G. Giardi M.T. Rigoni F. Giacometti G.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10220-10226Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); anti-D1C was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 19 C-terminal residue of the spinach protein and was a kind gift from Dr. Peter Nixon; anti-Cyta was raised against the α-subunit of Cyt b559 isolated by preparative SDS-PAGE(26Barbato R. Friso G. Rigoni F. Frizzo A. Giacometti G.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentration was measured according to Arnon(33Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric analyses of immunostained gels were performed using a Hirchmann densitometer. Fig. 1 shows a Western blot using an anti-D1N antibody of isolated PSII reaction center proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. Lane0 is the dark control, while the subsequent lanes show the effect of preilluminating the isolated PSII reaction centers with 2000 μmol quanta m-2 s-1 of white light at pH 6.5 for the periods of time indicated. As a consequence of this treatment, a breakdown fragment of the D1 protein is detected at about 23 kDa, and a band appears at 41 kDa. It has been previously shown, and is confirmed here, that the 23-kDa fragment contains the N terminus part of D1 protein and therefore results from a cleavage in the loop joining the putative transmembrane segments IV and V(17De Las Rivas J. Shipton C.A. Ponticos M. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6944-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 41-kDa fragment has been shown to be an adduct of the D1 protein and the α-subunit of Cyt b559(26Barbato R. Friso G. Rigoni F. Frizzo A. Giacometti G.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Friso G. Giacometti G.M. Barber J. Barbato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 265-270Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To obtain more information about the nature of this adduct, proteolytic mapping was conducted. The 41-kDa adduct was isolated from PSII reaction centers prepared from wheat using SDS-PAGE after illumination (Fig. 2). Wheat reaction centers were used because in this species the D1 protein contains a single lysine residue at position 238, and the α-subunit of Cyt b559 contains no lysine residues(35Webber A.N. Hird S.M. Packman L. Dyer T.A. Gray J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 12: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given this situation, we were able to use the endoprotease Lys-C to specifically cut the D1 protein at residue 238. PanelA of Fig. 2 shows an immunoblot with anti-D1N antiserum of the 41-kDa adduct (lanes1 and 3) and isolated D1 protein (lanes2 and 4), either undigested (lanes1 and 2) or digested (lanes3 and 4) with Lys-C protease. As can be seen in lane4, a 19-kDa fragment of the D1 protein is detected by anti-D1N, which corresponds to the 2-238 segment of this protein(32Barbato R. Friso G. Giardi M.T. Rigoni F. Giacometti G.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10220-10226Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Marder J.B. Telfer A. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 932: 362-365Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The same 19-kDa fragment was observed when the 41-kDa band was partially digested by Lys-C (arrow on lane3A). When an identical blot was probed with an antiserum to the C-terminal region of the D1 protein (anti-D1C), the results presented in panelB were obtained. In this case, a 10-kDa fragment of the D1 protein was detected (arrow on lane4B), which is the 239-344 C-terminal segment. Indeed, N-terminal sequencing confirmed that the first 10 residues of this fragment corresponded to residues 239-248 (see Table 1). This 10-kDa C-terminal fragment, however, was not detected as a consequence of partial digestion of the 41-kDa adduct; instead, the anti-D1C detected a 21-kDa band (arrow on lane3B), which is thought to contain the 10-kDa C-terminal portion of the D1 protein and the α-subunit of Cyt b559. Indeed, this was confirmed by blotting with anti-Cyta antiserum (arrow on lane3 of panelC in Fig. 2).Table 1 Open table in a new tab As the α-subunit of Cyt b559 does not contain any lysine residues(35Webber A.N. Hird S.M. Packman L. Dyer T.A. Gray J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 12: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), Lys-C proteolysis had no effect on this isolated subunit (compare lanes2C and 4C in Fig. 2). Therefore, the above experiments show unequivocally that the site for light-induced cross-linkage is located at an amino acid residue lying on the C-terminal side of lysine-238 of the D1 protein. A second series of experiments were conducted using Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. Fig. 3 shows the effect of treatment of the α-subunit of Cyt b559 with two concentrations of this enzyme. In both cases, a main digestion band (SaCyta) was detected, by either Coomassie staining (panelA) or immunoblotting with anti-Cyta (panelB), which had a molecular mass of about 1 kDa lower than the native band. N-terminal sequencing of both bands (see Table 1) gave the same sequence, indicating that the V8-induced proteolytic cleavage had occurred toward the C-terminal end of the α-subunit. The effect of V8 proteolysis of the isolated D1 protein and the 41-kDa adduct was also investigated, as shown in Fig. 4. Immunoblotting with anti-D1C antiserum (panelA) showed that the digestion of D1 with V8 (lane2) resulted in the appearance of two or, more often, three bands in the range of 8-10 kDa. These bands probably correspond to Sa8 and Sa10 doublet described by Marder et al. (37Marder J.B. Goloubinoff P. Edelman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3900-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Greenberg et al.(14Greenberg B.M. Gaba V. Mattoo A.-K. Edelman M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2865-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As these bands were recognized by the C-terminal specific antibody (raised to the last 19 amino acid residues of the protein), they must contain the C terminus of D1. In particular, it was found by N-terminal sequencing (see Table 1) that the Sa8 fragment is derived from a cleavage at glutamate 244, as suggested previously by Marder et al.(37Marder J.B. Goloubinoff P. Edelman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3900-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of V8 proteolysis of the 41-kDa adduct (lane4 of panelA), the anti-D1C antibody recognizes three fragments in the range of 15-20 kDa and a 8-kDa fragment. As this last fragment has the same electrophoretic mobility and immunological reactivity as the Sa8 fragment from D1, it is reasonable to assume that they are the same proteolytic fragment (i.e. from 245 to the C terminus of the D1 protein (see Fig. 9)).Figure 9:Representation of the proposed cross-linkage site between the D1 protein and the cytochrome b559α-subunit, resulting in the generation of the 41-kDa light-induced band. The N-terminal serine residue of the cytochrome b559α-subunit seems to cross-link with the FGQEEE motif on the D1 protein (shaded).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When anti-Cyta was used to probe V8 proteolytic digestion products of the 41-kDa adduct (panelB, lane1), a number of bands were detected in the 15-20-kDa range. Of note is that two of them are the same as those detected by the anti-D1C antibody (marked by circles in lane4 of panelA and lane1 of panelB). Since the Sa8 fragment was detected after treatment of the 41-kDa adduct with V8, it seems likely that cross-linking of the α-subunit and the D1 protein occurs on the N-terminal side of residue 244. This conclusion, taken together with the result derived from the Lys-C experiments (Fig. 2), suggests that the linkage takes place between 239 and 244 of D1 protein, i.e. in the FGQEEE motif. Detection of the V8-induced doublet of the 41-kDa band by both anti-D1C and anti-Cyta indicates that these contain the branched peptide formed by the α-subunit (possibly minus a small 1-kDa C-terminal region) of cytochrome b559 and the C terminus of the D1 protein. It is note worthy that, when the polyclonal specific for the N terminus of D1 is employed to probe V8 digests (panelC of Fig. 4) of D1 (lane2) and the 41-kDa adduct (lane4), essentially the same pattern is observed, confirming that the α-subunit is not linked with D1 on the N-terminal side of residue 238. The effect of different light intensities on the time course of the level of the 41-kDa adduct is shown in Fig. 5, A and B. In Fig. 5A, it can be seen that the initial increase in the level of the D1/Cyt b559a adduct depends on the light intensity being enhanced at higher intensities. However, at higher fluence rates, the final level after 30 min of illumination is lower than observed when the light intensities are more moderate. This finding suggests that the actual level of the 41-kDa band depends on the relative rates of its formation and degradation. In Fig. 5B, an immunoblot with anti-Cyta antiserum is shown after irradiating isolated PSII RC complexes with 400 μmol quanta m-2 s-1 for different periods of time. As can be seen, the level of the 41-kDa adduct increases with time, with the parallel appearance of a new weak band at about 20 kDa. When irradiation was performed in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors, no effect on the 41-kDa band was observed, neither on its appearance nor disappearance (data not shown). Similarly, as Fig. 6 shows, formation of the 41-kDa adduct was independent of temperature over the range 4-20°C. In further experiments, the effect on the presence/absence of oxygen and pH were investigated. Very low levels of oxygen (less than 1 μM) were obtained by flushing the RCII suspension with oxygen-free nitrogen and by including a chemical trap consisting of 10 mM glucose, 0.1 mg ml-1 catalase, and 0.1 mg ml-1 glucose oxidase. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 7, where it can be seen that only those RCII samples illuminated under aerobic conditions (lanes6-8) produced the 41-kDa band due to cross-linking of D1 protein and the α-subunit of Cyt b559. For studying the pH sensitivity, the RCII preparation was suspended in buffers ranging in pH from 5.5 to 9.5. As Fig. 8 shows, irradiation at pH 5.5 does not result in the appearance of the 41-kDa adduct. At pH 9.5, the formation of the adduct is also severely inhibited. In contrast, the light-induced 41-kDa band is readily detected at pH values 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5. When a sample that had been irradiated at pH 7.5 (i.e. containing the 41-kDa band) was incubated in the dark at pH 5.5 or 9.5, no effect on the level of the adduct was noted, an observation that rules out the possibility that the band is not observed in Fig. 7 because of its instability toward pH 5.5 or 9.5.Figure 8:The effect of different pH levels on the formation of the 41-kDa adduct. RCII complexes were diluted to 20 μg of chlorophyll/ml in 0.1 M Bis-Tris propane at the indicated pH value. 2 mMn-dodecyl β-D-maltoside was also added. Irradiation was carried out at 4°C with 600 μmol quanta m-2 s-1 for the indicated period of time. Each gel lane contained 0.2 μg of chlorophyll. LaneM contains prestained molecular markers. The blot was probed with anti-cytoa antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The immunological blotting data presented above are consistent with the previous conclusion that the 41-kDa band generated by illuminating isolated PSII RCs is a cross-linked adduct of the D1 protein and the α-subunit of Cyt b559. Treatment of this adduct, isolated from illuminated RCIIs of wheat with Lys-C, generated a 21-kDa fragment that consisted of the C-terminal portion of the D1 protein and the α-subunit of Cyt b559. Thus, the cross-linking occurs on the C-terminal side of residue 238 of the D1 protein. The C-terminal portion of the D1 protein (from 239 to 344) was found to have an apparent molecular mass of about 10 kDa, while the α-subunit of Cyt b559 has about the same mass, thus accounting for the observed 21-kDa value for the Lys-C-induced fragment of the adduct. Experiments using S. aureus V8 protease further suggest that the cross-linking site is on the N-terminal side of the tyrosine residue 245 of the D1 protein. This conclusion is based on the fact that the Sa8 fragment formed due to V8 cleavage at glutamate 244 on the D1 protein is also generated when the 41-kDa adduct is digested with this enzyme (e.g.Fig. 3, laneA4). Thus, these results lead to the overall conclusion that the adduct is formed by a cross-linking of the α-subunit of Cyt b559 with a residue in the 239-244 motif FGQEEE (see Fig. 9). The N terminus of the α-subunit of Cyt b559 is not blocked and can be sequenced by Edman degradation as indicated in Table 1. In contrast, the N terminus of the D1 protein is blocked and cannot be readily sequenced by the Edman procedure. We have also found that the 41-kDa adduct is not amenable to N-terminal sequencing using Edman degradation. The reason for this is unclear, but it could be that the N terminus of the α-subunit is not available in the adduct as it is in the free protein. This therefore suggests that the cross-linking to the FGQEEE motif involves the N-terminal residue of the α-subunit, which is a serine. The action of V8 on the 41-kDa adduct is also consistent with this since the products of this proteolysis did not indicate an attachment of the C-terminal end of the α-subunit to the D1 protein where the Cyt subunit has a V8 cleavage site (e.g.Fig. 4C) The identified cross-linking site on the D1 protein has the unusual feature of having three glutamic acid residues adjacent to each other. Such a motif is not typical and occurs in only a few proteins(24Shipton C.A. Marder J.B. Barber J. Z. Naturforsch. 1990; 45: 765-771Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The pKa value for a single glutamic acid residue is 4.3 and thus at neutral pH would be unprotonated. However, the existence of three adjacent carboxyl groups of glutamic acid would be expected to significantly shift the pKa to a higher value so that protonation would occur at neutral pH. This shift of pKa could aid a condensation reaction with the N-terminal serine of the α-subunit, thus forming a peptide linkage. Such a reaction is endothermic and would not be expected to happen spontaneously. Indeed, the cross-linking is induced by illumination. The mechanism involved does not seem to be enzymic (lack of effect of protease inhibitors and temperature) but involves a physically induced reaction driven by the absorption of light energy. Moreover, we have also shown that oxygen needs to be present for the adduct to appear. It is difficult to perceive how the proposed condensation reaction is driven. Under anaerobic conditions the heme of Cyt b559 becomes photoreduced, but no such reaction occurs when oxygen is present(38Barber J. De Las Rivas J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10942-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the formation of the adduct is dependent on the redox state of the heme, which affects the conformation of the α-subunit. Alternatively, light-induced oxidation processes could aid the cross-linking. Although the precise mechanism for the formation of this adduct is not clear, the identification of the linkage site has at least two important implications. The first is that the N terminus of the α-subunit must be exposed on the stromal side of PSII, as suggested by Tae et al.(39Tae G.-S. Black M.T. Cramer W.A. Vallon O. Bogorad L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9075-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and Vallon et al.(40Vallon O. Tae G.-S. Cramer W.A. Simpson D. Hoyer-Hansen G. Bogorad L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, our data indicate that Cyt b559 may be more closely located at the D1 rather than the D2 protein and that the N terminus of the α-subunit is positioned near to the QB site. This conclusion would mean that the heme, which is probably ligated to the histidine residues 22 and 17 on the α- and β-subunit, respectively(39Tae G.-S. Black M.T. Cramer W.A. Vallon O. Bogorad L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9075-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), is more intimate with QB than QA. No cross-linking product was observed with the β-subunit, which, like the psbI gene product, is blocked at its N terminus(23Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 259-262Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The second important implication is related to our finding that the formation of a D1 protein/Cyt b559α-subunit adduct occurs via cross-linking in the 239-244 motif of the D1 protein. Studies of D1 protein degradation in both in vivo and in vitro systems identify the 239-244 region as the primary site of cleavage when acceptor side photoinhibition occurs, generating a 23-kDa N-terminal and a 10-kDa C-terminal fragment of the D1 protein. Studies with isolated reaction centers have shown that the 41-kDa adduct is formed prior to the appearance of the 23-kDa N-terminal D1 cleavage product (e.g. see Fig. 1 and (17De Las Rivas J. Shipton C.A. Ponticos M. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6944-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)). It is possible, therefore, that the cross-linking of the α-subunit to the D1 protein is the first step in the sequence of events leading to the primary cleavage of this protein. The formation, for example, of a branch peptide linkage could possibly aid a hydrolysis reaction, resulting in cleavage of the D1 protein in the FGQEEE motif without causing any degradation of the α-subunit itself in line with other observations(41Chapman D.J. Gounaris K. Barber J. Photosynthetica. 1989; 23: 411-426Google Scholar). However, further experiments are required to give credibility to this idea. Among the experiments to be carried out will be those that identify whether the linkage and cleavage processes involve the same specific residues. We thank Ian Blench for conducting the N-terminal sequencing."

We have used this approach to isolate an antibody fragment against chicken very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor. It binds to the receptor with good affinity (Kaff = 2 × 108M−1) as measured by plasmon surface resonance, and competes for binding of natural ligands (vitellogenin, VLDL, and receptor-associated protein). The antibody also binds to other members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family including rat LDL receptor and human and rat low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP/α2MR), and it competes for binding of receptor-associated protein to LRP/α2MR. Moreover, the antibody fragment inhibits infection of human fibroblasts deficient in LDL-R but expressing LRP/α2MR by human rhinovirus. Binding of the antibody is abolished upon reduction of the receptors and is strictly Ca2+ dependent. The phage antibody thus recognizes the ligand binding site(s) of several members of the LDL receptor family, in contrast to antibodies produced by hybridoma technology.

It binds to the receptor with good affinity (Kaff = 2 × 108M−1) as measured by plasmon surface resonance, and competes for binding of natural ligands (vitellogenin, VLDL, and receptor-associated protein). The antibody also binds to other members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family including rat LDL receptor and human and rat low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP/α2MR), and it competes for binding of receptor-associated protein to LRP/α2MR. Moreover, the antibody fragment inhibits infection of human fibroblasts deficient in LDL-R but expressing LRP/α2MR by human rhinovirus. Binding of the antibody is abolished upon reduction of the receptors and is strictly Ca2+ dependent. The phage antibody thus recognizes the ligand binding site(s) of several members of the LDL receptor family, in contrast to antibodies produced by hybridoma technology.

Members of the LDL receptor family have several structural modules in common; (i) “binding repeats,” complement-type domains consisting of ∼40 residues displaying a triple disulfide bond-stabilized negatively charged surface (head-to-tail combinations of these repeats are believed to specify ligand interaction); (ii) epidermal growth factor precursor-type repeats, also containing six cysteines each; (iii) modules of ∼50 residues with a consensus tetrapeptide, Tyr-Trp-Thr-Asp (YWTD); and (iv), in the cytoplasmic region, signals for receptor internalization via coated pits, containing the consensus tetrapeptide Asn-Pro-Xaa-Tyr (NPXY).The LDL receptor family includes at least 4 proteins; the LDL receptor (LDL-R), the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (also termed LRP/α2MR), gp330 (also termed megalin), and the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor. The LDL receptor (LDL-R) has a cluster of 7 binding repeats and binds to apolipoprotein B (apoB) and apolipoprotein E (apoE)(1Schneider W.J. Beisiegel U. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Whereas the majority of the ligands bound by LRP/α2MR fail to be recognized by LDL-R, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) of the minor receptor group type attach to either of these proteins(8Hofer F.

Recently, it was shown that RAP also binds to LDL-R but with much lower affinity than to LRP/α2MR(17Medh J.D. Fry G.L. Bowen S.L. Pladet M.W. Strickland D.K. Chappell D.A. J. Biol.

Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5557-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), is closely related to LRP/α2MR in structure(19Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and binds to many of the same ligands (except for α2M-proteinase complexes)(20). The VLDL receptor (VLDL-R) is characterized by a cluster of 8 binding repeats, and binds VLDL and other apoE containing lipoproteins(21Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The binding specificity and sequence of OVR indicate that it is the chicken homologue of VLDL-R(26Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Although polypeptides of the LDL receptor family are highly related, and most of the known receptors bind to apoE, it has proved difficult to map the ligand binding sites with respect to different ligands. The sites are thought to comprise the cysteine-rich binding repeats, and to involve carboxylate residues on the receptor and lysine and arginine residues on the ligands(2Schneider W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); in apoE most of the positive charges are clustered to one side of the protein(27Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H.

Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Nykjaer A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup J.L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Willnow T.E. Orth K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but OVR and LDL-R contain only one cluster of binding repeats, and more subtle differences must therefore dictate their ligand binding properties.Mapping of the ligand binding sites has been hampered by the difficulty of raising blocking antibodies by immunization. Recently the display of repertoires of antibody fragments on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, and the selection of antigen-binding phage(31McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. Chiswell D.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar), has provided a means of making antibodies without immunization(32Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Antibody repertoires can be derived from the rearranged V-genes of populations of lymphocytes (32Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. J. Mol.

Antibodies with many different specificities have been isolated from the same repertoire, including some directed against self-antigens (33Griffiths A.D. Malmqvist M. Marks J.D. Bye J.M. Embleton M.J. McCafferty J. Baier M. Holliger K.P. Gorick B.D. Hughes J.N. Winter G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and highly conserved proteins (36Nissim A.

Although the binding affinities of the antibody fragments were often moderate, it has been possible to obtain antibodies with good binding affinities (Kaff = 108−109M−1) from very large repertoires(34Griffiths A.D. Williams S.C. Hartley O. Tomlinson I.M. Waterhouse P. Crosby W.L. Kontermann R.E. Jones P.T. Low N.M. Allison T.J. Prospero T.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Nissim A. Cox J.P.L. Harrison J. Zaccolo M.

Here we used a large phage antibody repertoire to isolate antibody fragments against OVR.LDL-R and LRP/α2MR both serve as receptors for one group (minor group) of HRVs(8Hofer F. Gruenberger M.

Due to the large number of different serotypes, vaccination is not possible; therefore, other means of preventing or curing the common cold are being thought of, including inhibition of virus-specific enzymes(37Skern T.

Molecular sizes of proteins were estimated with Bio-Rad markers (6-200 kDa). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M glycine buffer, pH 8.4, for 90 min at 200 mA.

https://openalex.org/W1978886586,"The fourth conserved domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope, the C4 region of glycoprotein 120 (gp120), is an amphipathic stretch of amino acids that, based on mutational analyses, constitutes a major component of the CD4 binding region in gp120. In the absence of crystallographic and NMR data on C4 in intact gp120, we sought to gain insight into C4's conformation and accessibility in gp120 by taking an immunochemical approach. In this study, a peptomer composed of a repeat peptide of C4 amino acids 419-436 from gp120 of HIV-1<sub>MN</sub> was synthesized for use as a conformationally constrained immunogen. Circular dichroism studies disclosed that the polymerized peptide, peptomer-(419-436), in 0.01 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> buffer, pH 7.4, at 25°C contained a dominant α-helical structure (53 ± 1%) compared with 2 ± 4%α-helical content for the monomeric peptide-(419-436). The peptomer in Ribi's adjuvant induced the production of rabbit antibodies that recognized recombinant and native gp120 but, consistent with the literature, the C4 peptide having no conformational constraints did not. The experimental results show that only those antibodies formed against a helical immunogen from C4 will recognize recombinant and native gp120, and, therefore, the results support the notion that C4 is an α-helix in gp120."

We have examined RNase H cleavages that define the maximal 3′ and 5′ ends of Moloney murine leukemia virus minus strand DNA prior to the second template jump. In both the endogenous reaction and on model substrates in vitro, RNase H cleaves the genomic RNA template between the second and third ribonucleotides 5′ of the U5/PBS junction, but other minor cleavages between 1 and 10 nucleotides 5′ of this junction are also observed. Similar experiments examining the specificity of RNase H for tRNA primer removal revealed that cleavage generally leaves a ribo A residue at the 5′ end of minus strand DNA. These observations suggest that three bases are typically duplicated on the ends of the minus strands, leading to an intermediate following the second jump which contains unpaired nucleotides.

The second role of RNase H is to cleave the viral template at the polypurine tract (PPT), a purine-rich region immediately upstream of U3, to generate the primer for plus strand DNA synthesis. Unlike genome degradation, the PPT cleavage is sequence-specific and highly precise(22Finston W.I. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 26-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Resnick R. Omer C.A.

Third, RNase H removes the RNA primers used to initiate plus and minus strand DNA synthesis. Removal of the plus strand PPT primer uniformly occurs at the junction between the RNA primer and the first deoxynucleotide of plus strand DNA (25Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2843-2851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10565-10573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, removal of the tRNA primer from minus strand DNA appears to depend on the type of virus examined. For avian myeloblastosis virus, the primer is cleaved precisely between the last ribonucleotide of the tRNA and the first deoxynucleotide of the minus strand(27Omer C.A. Faras A.J. Cell. 1982; 30: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Champoux J.J. Gilboa E. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 686-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the tRNA primer of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is cleaved between the last and the penultimate ribonucleotides to leave a ribo A residue at the 5′ end of the minus strand DNA(18Furfine E.S. Reardon J.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7041-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Pullen K.A. Ishimoto L.K. Champoux J.J. J.

The model of reverse transcription predicts that RNase H activity is necessary for both the first and second template jumps to occur (3Gilboa E. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). After minus strand synthesis has extended the tRNA primer to the end of the genome (minus strong stop DNA; stage i), RNase H facilitates the first jump by degrading some portion of R at the 5′ end of the viral RNA. This frees minus strand R‘ for transfer to R at the 3′ end of the genome and continuation of synthesis (stage ii). Consistent with this model, RNase H cleaves the template RNA up to 14-24 nucleotides from its 5′ end in DNA-RNA hybrids, including those which contain R(20Oyama F. Kikuchi R. Crouch R.J. Uchida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18808-18817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fu T.-B. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4271-4278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Luo G. Taylor J. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16465-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While some in vitro studies using model substrates and RNase H-deficient RT have found that RNase H activity is necessary for a template switch(15Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 34Garcés J. Wittek R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1991; 243: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), others have reported that RNase H activity is not required(32Luo G. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Buiser R.G. DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13103-13109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, viral mutants lacking RNase H activity do not complete reverse transcription in vivo and only synthesize minus strong stop DNA in endogenous reactions (36). For the second jump, cleavages by RNase H are important for three different stages of reverse transcription (see Fig. 1). The first cleavage occurs on the genome 5′ of the PBS after minus strand synthesis has begun (designated “region I,” stage i). The 3′-most cleavage in this region determines the maximum point to which the minus strand DNA can be extended prior to the second jump (stage iv). Whether this RNase H cleavage is random or highly specific has not been previously addressed. The second RNase H cleavage removes the tRNA primer after plus strand synthesis has extended from the PPT primer through to the end of PBS (designated “region II,” stage iii). This cleavage determines the 5′ end of the minus strand and presumably frees the 3′ end of plus strand DNA for the second jump (stage iv). Finally, the PBS‘ sequence of the extended minus strand DNA is exposed by RNase H degradation of the genomic template (stage iv). Together, these RNase H cleavages permit the PBS sequence of the plus strand to pair with the PBS‘ sequence of the minus strand for the second jump (stage v). The specificity of RNase H for the first two cleavages is an intriguing issue, as any duplication in sequence between the 3′ and 5′ ends of minus strand DNA could generate a problematic branched intermediate subsequent to the second jump (stage v). Using Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) as a model system, we have examined the specificities of RNase H that define the two termini of minus strand DNA prior to the second jump. These results allow us to predict the predominant structure that would result from the second jump according to the current model of reverse transcription. To generate single-stranded DNAs containing the R-U5-PBS region in both the plus and minus sense orientations, the 280-bp SfaNI-XmaIII fragment (positions 66-346 in the M-MuLV genome(37Shinnick T.M.

Clone pGMPBS was constructed by introducing the 1529-bp KpnI-XhoI fragment (positions 32-1560 in the M-MuLV genome) into the pGEM vector (Promega Corp.). Clone pGMPBSR was created by inserting the 165-bp PvuII-SfaNI fragment of pGMPBS into the SphI site of pGMPBS, digesting with PstI to release the 176- and 821-bp fragments in the M-MuLV sequence, and religating the DNA. A 738-bp region of the M-MuLV genome containing the entire LTR region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pBluescript II KS(+) at the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites to generate a phagemid that produced single-stranded DNA corresponding to the plus sense LTR (pBSMOLTR+). The various recombinant M13 phages and DNAs and the M13 phagemid DNA were isolated by established procedures(38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Recombinant wild-type M-MuLV RT, T7 RNA polymerase, and Sequenase version 2.0 were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp., RNase H- RTs (Superscript and Superscript II) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and M-MuLV virion RT was purified as described previously(22Finston W.I. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 26-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant heterodimeric HIV-1 RT was kindly provided by Lawrence Loeb (University of Washington). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from both U. S. Biochemical Corp. and Life Technologies, Inc. DNA oligo 1 (5′-TGGCCAGCTTACCTCCCGG-3′) was purchased from Oligos Etc. DNA oligo 2 is represented by two oligonucleotides sharing the same 3′ end but differing at the 5′ end; oligo 2A (5′-TGGTCTCGCTGTTCCTTGGG-3′) was synthesized with a Biosearch model 8600 DNA synthesizer, and oligo 2B (5′-TGTGGTCTCGCTGTTCCTTGGG-3′) as well as the other DNA oligonucleotides described below were purchased from DNA Express. Results were identical using oligo 2A or oligo 2B. RNA oligo Mol15R (5′-CCGGACGAGCCCCCA-3′), which matches the 15 3′-most nucleotides of the tRNAPro primer, was kindly provided by Brian Reid (University of Washington). The first 30 bases of DNA oligo U5mis (5′-AAATGAAAGACCCCCGCTGACGGGTAGTCAGAGTG-3′) are complementary to the M-MuLV sequence from positions 146 to 117 with the five 3′-most nucleotides deliberately chosen to prevent base pairing with the genomic sequence. DNA oligo PB (5′-ATCCCGGACGAGCCCCC-3′) is complementary to the M-MuLV sequence from positions 163 to 147, which corresponds to the PBS without the 3′-terminal A residue. Oligo PBA is identical to oligo PB with the addition of three A residues on the 3′ end. Oligonucleotides were 5′ end-labeled in a 15-μl reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 50 μCi of [g-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN), 17 pmol of oligonucleotide, and 2-30 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 60 min and stopped with 10-50 mM EDTA. In most cases, the labeled oligonucleotides were separated from labeled ATP using a spin column containing Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.)(38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). M-MuLV virions were isolated as described previously (25Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2843-2851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (final concentration 2 μg/ml of protein) and were incubated in a 250-μl reaction containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) at 40°C for the times indicated. After termination with 15 mM EDTA, SDS and proteinase K were added to final concentrations of 0.25% and 100 μg/ml, respectively, and the reactions were incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Samples were extracted twice with phenol and twice with chloroform and precipitated with 20 μg/ml of glycogen (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of 0.3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) with two volumes of ethanol. After resuspension in 20 μl of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA), 1-4 μl of each sample was treated with 0.3 M NaOH at 65°C for 20 min, neutralized with acetic acid, and ethanol precipitated prior to analysis by primer extension. For the zero time control, the sample was prepared identically except that virions were added to a 250-μl reaction that lacked any dNTPs, and the sample was directly purified without incubation. To prepare RNA containing plus sense R-U5-PBS sequences, 2.5 μg of HindIII-linearized pGMPBSR was transcribed in a 100-μl reaction containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 50 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 0.4 mM ribonucleoside triphosphates, 100 units of RNasin (Promega), and 40 units of T7 RNA polymerase at 37°C for 90 min, and the DNA template was digested with 2.5 units of DNase I (Promega) at 37°C for 15 min. The reaction was brought to a final volume of 200 μl with TE containing 0.1% SDS, and extracted once with phenol and twice with chloroform. The RNA was precipitated in the presence of 2.5 M ammonium acetate with 2.5 volumes of ethanol and resuspended in 15 μl of TE. A 50-μl reaction containing 120 ng of RNA oligo Mol15R and 2 μg of RNA template in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 40 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT was heated at 65°C for 3 min and cooled at room temperature for 3 min. dNTPs were added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM each followed by 200 units of RNase H- RT (Superscript II). The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of EDTA to 10 mM. In addition to the desired extension of the RNA oligonucleotide, some snap-back self-priming resulted in the formation of an RNA-DNA hybrid region 3′ of the PBS(39Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This led to some cleavage of the RNA in this region and reduced the overall signal in the primer extension assay but otherwise had no affect on the results. Hybrids were ethanol precipitated twice in the presence of 2.5 M ammonium acetate and resuspended in 10 μl of TE. Substrates in which the RNA primer was not extended were prepared by annealing the RNA primer to the RNA template followed by direct precipitation. 1.5 μl of the hybrids prepared above were treated with 250 units of recombinant M-MuLV RT in a 10-μl reaction containing 1 × RT buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.8 mM DTT) at 37°C for 15 min and terminated by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM. Sodium acetate was added to 0.3 M and the samples were ethanol precipitated. The pellet was resuspended in 7.5 μl of TE and analyzed by primer extension using oligo 1 (see Fig. 2A). The 322-base insert of M13mp7/PBS+ was released from the single-stranded recombinant using EcoRI as described previously(22Finston W.I. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 26-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting mixture of single-stranded insert and vector DNA is referred to as “EcoRI-cut M13mp7/PBS+ DNA.” 490 ng of RNA oligo Mol15R was annealed to 3.5 μg of EcoRI-cut M13mp7/PBS+ DNA, and the RNA was extended with Sequenase essentially as described previously(29Pullen K.A. Ishimoto L.K. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 367-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One-fourth of the substrates prepared above were treated with 100-250 units of recombinant RT or 40 units of purified virion RT in a 10-μl reaction containing 1 × RT buffer at 37°C for the indicated times. After termination with 10 mM EDTA, one-half of each reaction was treated with alkali as described above, brought to a final volume of 20 μl, and ethanol precipitated. The remaining half of each reaction was diluted to 20 μl with TE and ethanol precipitated in the presence of 0.3 M sodium acetate. All precipitates were resuspended in 7.5 μl of TE and analyzed by primer extension using oligo 2A or 2B as indicated in the figure legends (see Fig. 2B). One-half of each RT-treated sample and 0.4 pmol of the specified 5′ end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide were used in primer extension reactions with RNase H- RT (Superscript) essentially as described (29Pullen K.A. Ishimoto L.K. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 367-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with 1 unit of T4 DNA polymerase in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM dNTPs and analyzed in an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea. 25 ng of 5′ end-labeled RNA oligo Mol15R was annealed to 21 μg of EcoRI-cut M13mp7/PBS+ DNA in 1 × Sequenase buffer and extended with Sequenase as described above. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 5 × DNA sample buffer (25% Ficoll, 100 mM EDTA, 5% xylene cyanole, 5% bromphenol blue) and subjected to electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel in a Tris borate/EDTA buffer(38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). The extended products were eluted from a gel slice in 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.9) for a total of 16 h, precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol, and then reprecipitated in the presence of 0.3 M sodium acetate with two volumes of ethanol. The products were resuspended in a small volume of TE, heated at 60°C for 5 min, and purified a second time by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, reactions containing the extended products were terminated by adding an equal volume of formamide stop buffer and heating at 85°C for 3 min, and the single-stranded extension products were isolated from a 5% polyacrylamide gel as described above. The recovered extension products were annealed to 2.4 μg of cut M13mp7/PBS+ DNA in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA at 65°C for 10 min, cooled to room temperature for 20 min, and precipitated with ethanol. To generate substrates in which the RNA primer was not extended, RNA oligo Mol15R was annealed to EcoRI-cut M13mp7/PBS+ DNA and isolated directly from a 5% polyacrylamide gel as described above. In all cases the products were resuspended in TE after precipitation. One-fourth to one-half of the purified substrates was treated with 10 units of recombinant M-MuLV or HIV-1 RT in a 10-μl reaction containing 1 × RT buffer at 37°C for the indicated times. Samples were mixed with an equal volume of formamide stop buffer, denatured at 90°C for 5 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea. Sequencing ladders were prepared using a Sequenase kit essentially as described by the manufacturer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The plus sense ladder was generated using oligo 2A or 2B and M13mp7/PBS+ DNA, while the minus sense ladder was generated using oligo 1 and M13mp7/PBS- DNA. A size ladder of the labeled RNA oligo Mol15R was produced by partial digestion with 0.2 μg/ml of nuclease P1 (P-L Biochemicals) in a 10-μl reaction containing 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) at 37°C for 30 min. 5′ end-labeled oligo U5mis (2 pmol) was annealed to 2.7 pmol of pBSMOLTR+ single-stranded circular template DNA in 30 μl of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 100 mM KCl, and 12 mM MgCl2. Control experiments showed that the five mismatched nucleotides at the 3′ end of oligo U5 mis were sufficient to prevent its usage as a primer and that no displacement by RT occurred in the absence of added upstream primer (data not shown). The annealing reaction was divided in half and annealed with 1 pmol of unlabeled oligo U5mis and 7.5 pmol of oligo PB or PBA in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 100 mM KCl, and 12 mM MgCl2 (final volume 20 μl). To minimize the potential for resolution of the unpaired oligo PBA 3′-terminus by branch migration, the second annealing step was carried out for only 5 min at 37°C. The subsequent extension reactions (20 μl final volume) contained 9 μl of the annealed mixture in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM dNTPs. A sample was removed for analysis as the zero time point, synthesis was initiated with 120 units of recombinant RT, and 3.9-μl aliquots were terminated at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 s time points by the addition to a final concentration of 13% Ficoll, 20 mM EDTA, and 0.05% SDS. The products were treated with 40 μg/μl of proteinase K for 30 min at 37°C before electrophoresis in a 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Quantitation of the reaction products was carried out after exposure of the wet gel to a PhosphorImager screen at 4°C. The amounts of free (displaced) and total oligo U5mis were determined by the area integration function of ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). To define the template that determines the 3′ end of minus strand DNA prior to the second jump (Fig. 1), we examined RNase H specificity using a model substrate in vitro. Mol15R, a 15-mer RNA oligonucleotide that corresponds to the last 15 bases of the tRNA primer for M-MuLV, was annealed to RNA containing plus sense R-U5-PBS sequences and extended using RNase H- RT (Superscript II) (Fig. 2A). The resulting RNA-DNA hybrids were incubated with recombinant wild-type RT alongside controls in which the RNA primer had not been extended. To identify RNase H cleavage sites that occurred 5′ of the PBS sequences on the plus strand RNA (Fig. 1, stage i, region I), the products were denatured, and a labeled DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the template RNA was used in a primer extension assay (Fig. 2A, oligo 1). As expected in control reactions without RT, a major primer extension product corresponding to the 5′ end of the plus strand RNA template was observed (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 3, arrow a). Products slightly smaller than full-length were also apparent; these species likely resulted from premature termination during extension on the full-length RNA. Treatment of the hybrid substrates with RT resulted in the loss of all full-length and near full-length products, indicating that most RNA molecules had been cleaved somewhere along their length (Fig. 3, lane 2). These cleavages did not result from nonspecific ribonuclease activity associated with the recombinant RT, as no degradation was observed when template RNA was treated with RT in the absence of RNA primer Mol15R (data not shown). A major primer extension product was detected (Fig. 3, lane 2, arrow b) corresponding to RNase H cleavage between the second and third ribonucleotides immediately 5′ of the PBS. Cleavages one base upstream and both one and two bases downstream of this primary cleavage site were less abundant but clearly detectable (Fig. 3, lane 2). Longer exposures revealed minor products corresponding to cleavages at every position up to 10 nucleotides 5′ of the PBS (data not shown). As expected, no cleavages were detected upstream of the U5/PBS boundary when the control substrate containing unextended RNA primer was examined (Fig. 3, lane 4). However, some cleavages were observed within the RNA-RNA duplex region at the PBS site (Fig. 3. compare lanes 3 and 4, arrow c). Since cleavage of RNA-RNA duplexes has been reported for RNase H(40Blain S.W. Goff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23585-23592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these species might result from a low level of RNase H∗ activity. We next examined the RNase H cleavage pattern on genomic RNA upstream of the PBS in endogenous reactions. Detergent-disrupted M-MuLV virions were incubated with dNTPs, and products synthesized over time were analyzed by prim"
https://openalex.org/W2034920141,"Abstract We have studied the effect of blockade of mitochondrial respiration on the binding of human I-TNFα to L929 cell receptors. Specific TNFα binding was decreased to about 20-40% of controls by blocking mitochondrial respiration. This effect was dose- and time-related and was observed independently of the level at which the respiration was blocked (respiratory chain, proton backflow, ATPase, anaerobiosis). This blockade had no effect on the half-life of the specific TNFα binding, the internalization or degradation of TNFα-receptor complexes, or the number of TNFα-binding sites. Scatchard analysis of TNFα binding data indicated a 2-4-fold decrease in the affinity of these binding sites. These effects did not appear to be related to the protein kinase C activity or to reactive oxygen radicals, since they were not antagonized by pretreatment of cells with oxygen radical scavengers, deferoxamine, or inhibitors of protein kinase C. Decrease in TNFα binding capacity correlated significantly with cellular ATP content (r = 0.94; p < 0.01) and with the cytocidal activity of TNFα against L929 cells. These findings suggest that blockade of mitochondrial respiration down-regulates the binding of TNFα to cells, most likely by changing the affinity of receptors for this cytokine. This down-regulation may increase the resistance of cells to TNFα cytotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W1541601941,"Circulating antibodies from human and murine chagasic sera are able to interact with myocardium, activating neurotransmitter receptors. Here, we studied the effects of a monoclonal antibody (MAb CAK20.12), which recognizes a 150 kilodalton antigen of Trypanosoma cruzi and reacts with normal human and murine striated muscles and with cardiac tissue. The MAb CAK20.12 binds to purified cardiac membranes and interferes with the binding of beta-adrenergic receptor radioligand ([125I]CYP) and muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAChR) radioligand ([3H]QNB) in a noncompetitive way. As a consequence of this interaction, beta-adrenergic receptor and mAChR were activated, leading to increased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP as a result of beta-adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase triggering. When its sympathetic action was abrogated, it also induced an mAChR-mediated increase in cyclic GMP. Furthermore, cardiac physiology was modified by MAb CAK20.12, as it was able to increase cardiac contractility through beta-adrenoceptor activation and to decrease atrial frequency as a result of mAChR activation. The fact that this MAb modulates and modifies the mechanical and biochemical activity of normal murine heart established an important basis for future research and understanding of how the host's humoral immune response acts on the course and development of the chronic chagasic myocardiopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2043054344,"GM2 Activator is a low molecular weight protein cofactor that stimulates the enzymatic conversion of GM2 into GM3 by human β-hexosaminidase A and also the conversion of GM2 into GA2 by clostridial sialidase (Wu, Y.-Y., Lockyer, J.

Among the five known activator proteins for the enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids, only GM2 activator is effective in stimulating the hydrolysis of GM2. However, the mechanism of action of GM2 activator is still not well understood. Using a unique disialosylganglioside, GalNAc-GD1a, as the substrate, we were able to show that in the presence of GM2 activator, GalNAc-GD1a was specifically converted into GalNAc-GM1a by clostridial sialidase, while in the presence of saposin B, a nonspecific activator protein, GalNAc-GD1a was converted into both GalNAc-GM1a and GalNAc-GM1b. Individual products generated from GalNAc-GD1a by clostridial sialidase were identified by thin layer chromatography, negative secondary ion mass spectrometry, and immunostaining with a monoclonal IgM that recognizes the GM2 epitope. Our results clearly show that GM2 activator recognizes the GM2 epitope in GalNAc-GD1a. Thus, GM2 activator may interact with the trisaccharide structure of the GM2 epitope and render the GalNAc and NeuAc residues accessible to β-hexosaminidase A and sialidase, respectively.

Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1982; 16: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicate the physiological importance of this activator protein in vivo for the degradation of GM2. It has been postulated that GM2 activator extracts a single molecule of GM2 from the micelles and presents the monomeric form of GM2 to β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A(17Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the GalNAc residue in GM2 should be degradable by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A without the assistance of GM2 activator; however, in biological membranes, the carbohydrate head group of GM2 is shielded from the enzyme cleavage by the head groups of other adjacent glycosphingolipids. For β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A to reach the GalNAc residue in GM2, it requires GM2 activator to lift the GM2 molecule a few angstroms out of the membrane surface(2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have shown that the effectiveness of GM2 activator in stimulating the hydrolysis of GM2 may be due to its ability to recognize and interact with the specific trisaccharide structure of the GM2 epitope, GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcα2→3)-Gal, and make the GalNAc residue in GM2 accessible to β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A(18Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y-T. Li S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We further found that the specificity of GM2 activator is not limited in stimulating the hydrolysis of GM2 as previously reported(1Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. Dingle J.T. Dean R.T. Sly W. Lysosomes in Biology and Pathology. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984: 99-117Google Scholar, 2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This activator also stimulates the hydrolysis of NeuAc from GM2 to produce GA2 and works synergistically with saposin B for the hydrolysis of GalNAc from GM2 by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A(18Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y-T. Li S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we have shown that saposin B stimulates the hydrolysis of GM1 by human hepatic β-galactosidase and that GM2 activator stimulates the hydrolysis of GM2 by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A(19Li S.-C. Nakamura T. Ogama A. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10592-10595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanisms of action of these two activator proteins are still not well understood. Among the GM2-related gangliosides, GalNAc-GD1a is structurally similar to GM2 by having an additional GM2 epitope linked to the C-4 position of the GalNAc in GM2(20Svennerholm L. Månsson J.-E. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 740-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been widely known that the external NeuAc of GD1a is readily hydrolyzed by clostridial sialidase without the assistance of an activator protein(21Corfield A.P. Michalski J-C. Schauer R. Tettamanti G. Durand P. Donato S.D. Perspectives in Inherited Metabolic Diseases. Vol. 4. Edi Ermes, Milan, Italy1981: 3-70Google Scholar). However, we found that the same NeuAc in GalNAc-GD1a cannot be hydrolyzed by clostridial sialidase without the assistance of GM2 activator. This suggests that the addition of a GalNAc residue onto GD1a alters the susceptibility of the NeuAc to clostridial sialidase. We hypothesized that GM2 activator and saposin B might act differently toward the enzymatic hydrolysis of the two NeuAc residues in GalNAc-GD1a. We, herewith, present evidence to show that GM2 activator clearly recognizes the specific branched trisaccharide structure in the GM2 epitope of GalNAc-GD1a, while the stimulatory activity of saposin B does not require a specific sugar chain structure. GalNAc-GD1a was isolated from the total ganglioside mixture of bovine brain(22Acquotti D. Cantu L. Ragg E. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).

Cantu L. Ragg E. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). GM2 was isolated from the brain of a Tay-Sachs patient(23Svennerholm L. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1972; 6: 464-474Google Scholar). Asialo-GM2 (GA2) was prepared from GM2 by mild acid hydrolysis(20Svennerholm L. Månsson J.-E. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 740-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The native saposin B, also called nonspecific activator protein (specific activity, 3 × 105 units/mg)(24Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1159-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the native GM2 activator (specific activity, 2 × 107 units/mg) (25Li S.-C. Hirabayashi Y. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6234-6240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were isolated from human liver. The recombinant saposin B was produced in Escherichia coli from a cDNA construct as described below. The recombinant GM2 activator was also produced in E. coli as previously described(18Wu Y.-Y.

The monoclonal IgM that recognizes the branched terminal trisaccharide in both GM2 and GalNAc-GD1a was obtained from a patient with neuropathy associated with gammopathy (26Ilyas A.A. Quarles R.H.

The following chemicals and reagents of the highest grade were purchased from commercial sources: NeuAc, clostridial sialidase type X, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, ampicillin, and 4-chloro-1-naphthol, Sigma; yeast extract and tryptone, DIFCO; restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase, Life Technologies, Inc.; Taq DNA polymerase, Promega; T7 sequencing kit version 2.0, U.

GalNAc-GD1a, 5 μg (2.5 nmol) in micellar form, was incubated with 6 units (as defined by the manufacturer) of clostridial sialidase and 5 μg (0.27 nmol) of the recombinant GM2 activator or 20 μg (1.84 nmol) of the recombinant saposin B in 100 μl of 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 37°C for 18 h. Since the molecular mass of GM2 activator (18,588 Da) is about twice that of saposin B (10,871 Da), under the above conditions, the concentration of saposin B was about 6.8 times that of GM2 activator. To ensure the observed results were independent of the activator concentrations, we also performed experiments using two levels of the same molar concentration of GM2 activator and saposin B (2.7 and 10.7 μM). After incubation, the reactions were stopped by heating the tubes in a bath of boiling water for 3 min, and then 10 μl of 1 M KCl and 50 μl of a slurry of Nucleosil C18 (C18 beads settled by gravity in 0.1 M KCl solution) were added to each tube. The mixture was vortexed and left for 5 min to allow the glycosphingolipids to be adsorbed on the C18 beads. After centrifugation at 2,000 rpm using a Beckman TJ-6 centrifuge, the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of water, and the glycosphingolipids were then extracted from the C18 beads by the method of Williams and McCluer (27Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) using 0.5 ml of methanol followed by 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1 (v/v)). The extracts were combined, dried, and analyzed by TLC using a precoated Silica Gel G-60 plate. The plate was developed with methyl acetate/propanol/chloroform/methanol/0.25% KCl (25:20:20:20:17 (v/v)). To reveal glycosphingolipids, the plate was sprayed with diphenylamine reagent (28Harris G. MacWilliams I.C. Chem. Ind. (Lond.). 1954; : 249Google Scholar) and heated at 110°C for 15-20 min. The terminal branched trisaccharides of GalNAc-GD1a and GalNAc-GM1b, one of the products from the action of sialidase, were identified on TLC using the monoclonal IgM(26Ilyas A.A. Quarles R.H. Dalakas M.C. Brady R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6697-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which recognizes the GM2 epitopes in GM2, GalNAc-GD1a, and GalNAc-GM1b. The TLC overlay procedure was essentially the same as that described by Magnani et al.(29Magnani J.L. Nilsson B. Brockhaus M. Zopf D. Steplewski Z. Koprowski H. Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14365-14369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the binding of the ganglioside with the antibodies (1:100 dilution) was detected by a second antiserum, which was the peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgM (μ chain specific). The antibody binding was revealed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol, a substrate for peroxidase. Human saposin B cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using human liver lgt11 cDNA library as template. The upstream primer was 5′-TAATGGATCCGGGGACGTTTGCCAGGA-3′ and the downstream primer was 5′-GCTCAAGCTTCTCTTTCACCTCATCACAGAACC-3′, as designed from the reported nucleotide sequence of prosaposin between nucleotides 591 and 845 for saposin B(6Nakano T. Sandhoff K. Stümper J. Christomanou H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This cDNA fragment was verified for its sequence and then subcloned into pQE-30, QIA expression vector, at BamHI and HindIII sites. This construct was designated as pQE-SB. The recombinant human saposin B protein was overexpressed using M15(pREP)/pQE-SB according to the protocol provided for QIA expression system. The overexpressed protein was first purified by a Ni-NTA-agarose column under denaturing conditions and then refolded using a previously described method(18Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y-T. Li S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The refolded recombinant saposin B was further purified through a Sephadex G-50 column (2.5 × 85 cm). The recombinant saposin B was found to be as active as the native human hepatic saposin B (24Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1159-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in stimulating the hydrolysis of GM1. The glycosphingolipid products generated from GalNAc-GD1a by clostridial sialidase in the presence of GM2 activator or saposin B were first resolved on a HPTLC plate and then transferred to a PVDF membrane by TLC blotting. The transferred glycosphingolipids on the PVDF membrane were subsequently subjected to direct mass spectrometric analysis (30Taki T. Ishikawa D. Handa S. Kasama T. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as described briefly below. The incubation mixtures for this analysis were prepared as described above except using 10 μg of GM2 activator or 20 μg of saposin B and a second addition of the sialidase (6 units) after the first 8 h of incubation to enhance the hydrolysis. After a total of 18 h of incubation, each reaction mixture was dried and spotted on a precoated Silica Gel G-60 HPTLC plate. The plate was developed with methyl acetate/propanol/chloroform/methanol/0.25% KCl (25:20:20:20:17 (v/v)). The glycosphingolipids on the TLC plate were transferred to a PVDF membrane with a hot iron (180°C) for 30 s as described by Taki et al.(31Taki T. Handa S. Ishikawa D Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Taki T. Kasama T. Handa S. Ishikawa D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each glycosphingolipid area was cut out a 2-mm-diameter circle to fit the SIMS target tip of the probe for the mass spectrometer. After dipping the PVDF membrane in 1 μl of triethanolamine and placing the membrane on the tip, the glycosphingolipid on the membrane was directly analyzed with a Finnigan TSQ 70 mass spectrometer. The negative SIMS spectra were obtained under the conditions where the membrane was bombarded with a Cs+ beam accelerated at 20 kV, the electron multiplier at 1.5 kV, and conversion dynode at 20 kV. Fig. 1 shows that GD1a was readily converted to GM1 by clostridial sialidase, while GalNAc-GD1a was resistant to this sialidase. This indicates that the external NeuAc residue in GD1a is easily hydrolyzed by clostridial sialidase, while the same NeuAc residue in GalNAc-GD1a is resistant to the enzyme. Thus, the attachment of a GalNAc to GD1a converts the sialidase-sensitive NeuAc to become sialidase resistant. Acquotti et al.(22Acquotti D. Cantu L. Ragg E. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) reported that the external NeuAc residue in GD1a has a higher flexibility than the same NeuAc residue in GalNAc-GD1a, as the GalNAc-(NeuAc)-Gal trisaccharide is a compact unit. This may explain the differences in the susceptibility of the external NeuAc residue in GD1a and GalNAc-GD1a to clostridial sialidase in the absence of an activator protein. GM2 activator and saposin B have been postulated to function as biodetergents to solubilize glycosphingolipid molecules from their micellar forms in aqueous media(10Li S.-C. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6588-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the detergent-like mechanism cannot satisfactorily explain why GM2 activator has such a stringent specificity toward the substrate, GM2. Recently, we found that GM2 activator could stimulate not only the hydrolysis of the GalNAc residue from GM2 by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A but also the NeuAc residue from GM2 by clostridial sialidase (18Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y-T. Li S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have also reported that saposin B was able to stimulate the conversion of GM2 to GA2 by clostridial sialidase(10Li S.-C. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6588-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led us to use one enzyme (clostridial sialidase) under one condition to examine the hydrolysis of the two NeuAc residues from a unique disialosylganglioside, GalNAc-GD1a, in the presence of GM2 activator or saposin B. Our rationale is that the external NeuAc residue in GalNAc-GD1a is part of the trisaccharide with GM2-like structure (GM2 epitope), while this is not the case for the internal NeuAc. Therefore, the two NeuAc residues in GalNAc-GD1a may behave differently toward the hydrolysis by clostridial sialidase in the presence of GM2 activator or saposin B. When clostridial sialidase removes the NeuAc associated with the GM2 epitope from GalNAc-GD1a, the product will be GalNAc-GM1a, which no longer carries the GM2 epitope. When the sialidase removes the internal NeuAc from GalNAc-GD1a, the product will be GalNAc-GM1b, which still retains the GM2 epitope. If the sialidase removes both NeuAc residues from GalNAc-GD1a, then the product will be a neutral glycosphingolipid, GalNAc-GA1. Fig. SI illustrates the cleavage of one or two NeuAc residues from GalNAc-GD1a. Thus, using GalNAc-GD1a, it should be possible to differentiate the actions of GM2 activator and saposin B. Fig. 2A shows that in the presence of GM2 activator (lane3), GalNAc-GD1a was converted into one major band and one very minor fast moving band, whereas in the presence of saposin B (lane4), GalNAcG-D1a was converted into two major and one minor products. The monoclonal IgM that recognizes the GM2 epitope (26Ilyas A.A. Quarles R.H. Dalakas M.C. Brady R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6697-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was used for the initial identification of these products as shown in Fig. 2B. All lanes in Fig. 2B correspond to that in Fig. 2A. The monoclonal IgM stained the residual GalNAc-GD1a as shown in lanes3′, while in lane4′, a band moving faster than GalNAc-GD1a was also stained. This band corresponds to the second fast moving band in Fig. 2A, lane4. This indicates that, in the presence of saposin B, clostridial sialidase removed the internal NeuAc residue from GalNAc-GD1a and that the product retained the GM2 epitope. The detailed structural identification of each product in lanes3 and 4 is presented below. The amounts of GM2 activator (5 μg) and saposin B (20 μg) used in Fig. 2A, lanes3 and 4, were based on our prior experiences in using them for the hydrolysis of other glycosphingolipids. Since these amounts represent two different activator concentrations, we further compared the effect of these two activator proteins at two levels of concentrations: 2.7 μM (5 μg of GM2 activator or 2.5 μg of saposin B) for the low activator concentration and 10.7 μM (20 μg of GM2 activator or 10 μg of saposin B) for the high activator concentration. As shown in Fig. 2A, only in the presence of saposin B did clostridial sialidase produce the second fast moving band from GalNAc-GD1a (Fig. 2A, lanes4 and 8). When saposin B was in a low concentration (2.7 μM), very little hydrolysis of GalNAc-GD1a was observed (Fig. 2A, lane6). Again, the second fast moving band was stained by the monoclonal IgM that recognizes the GM2 epitope (Fig. 2B, lanes4′ and 8′). In contrast, this ganglioside was practically not produced from GalNAc-GD1a in the presence of GM2 activator (Fig. 2B, lanes3′, 5′, and 7′). The fastest moving band in Fig. 2A, lane4 or 8, was not stained by the monoclonal IgM, indicating the absence of the GM2 epitope in this product. Furthermore, this band was not stained by the resorcinol reagent (34Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) indicating the absence of NeuAc in this product and was identified to be GalNAc-GA1 by mass spectrometry. Identical results as shown in Fig. 2 were obtained by using the native human hepatic GM2 activator (25Li S.-C. Hirabayashi Y. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6234-6240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and saposin B (24Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1159-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in place of the recombinant activator proteins (results not shown). Two parallel plates were made for the analysis of the products. One plate (Fig. 3A) was sprayed with the diphenylamine reagent to reveal the glycosphingolipids. The glycosphingolipids produced from GalNAc-GD1a in the presence of saposin B (P1) were resolved into 4 bands, designated as P1-a, P1-m, P1-b, and P1-c (Fig. 3A, lane4). Among them, P1-a and P1-m were the major products. The glycosphingolipids produced from GalNAc-GD1a in the presence of GM2 activator (P2) were resolved into 3 bands, designated as P2-a, P2-b, and P2-c (Fig. 3A, lane5). Among them, P2-a and P2-b were the major products. With the exception of P1-m, all other products were detected in both incubation mixtures. The products on the parallel plate were blotted on a PVDF membrane as described by Taki et al.(31Taki T. Handa S. Ishikawa D Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Taki T. Kasama T. Handa S. Ishikawa D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each band on the PVDF membrane was excised as shown in Fig. 3B and analyzed by negative SIMS, and the results are presented below. Pl-a and P2-a were identified to be GalNAc-GA1. The deprotonated molecule and fragmentation patterns of these two glycosphingolipids corresponded to that of GalNAc-GA1 as shown in Fig. 4, A and B. P1-m, one of the major products in the presence of saposin B, was identified to be GalNAc-GM1b (Fig. 5). The deprotonated molecule and the fragmentation profile of P1-m indicated that the NeuAc residue came off first, and then the other fragment ions were identical to that of GalNAc-GA1. This band was not produced in the presence of GM2 activator (P2). P1-b and P2-b were identified to be GalNAc-GM1a. Both mass spectra of P1-b (Fig. 6A) and P2-b (Fig. 6B) corresponded to GalNAc-GM1a but different from that of GalNAc-GM1b, as the characteristic fragment ions corresponding to that from GM3, GM2, and GM1 were detected. Pl-s and P2-s were identified to be the residual parent GalNAc-GD1a. The TLC mobilities of P1-s and P2-s (Fig. 3A) and their mass spectra (Fig. 7, A and B) were identical to that of the substrate GalNAc-GD1a. Also, the mass spectrum of GalNAc-GD1a shows that the major molecular species of the ceramide moieties were long chain base 18:1, fatty acid 18:0 (m/z 564) and long chain base 20:1, fatty acid 18:0 (m/z 592). These results agree well with the previous data on the lipid composition of GalNAc-GD1a(22Acquotti D. Cantu L. Ragg E. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). P1-c and P2-c were the very minor products and their exact structures were not identified. Both showed the deprotonated molecule of m/z 1886 and the fragment ion of m/z 603, which is characteristic of the ion [NeuAc-NeuAc + Na - H2O - H]-. As this ion was not detected in the parent GalNAc-GD1a, P1-c and P2-c might be the products of the glycosyltransferring action of clostridial sialidase (the hydrolysis of the external NeuAc residue from GalNAc-GD1a and transferring of the NeuAc to the internal NeuAc to form NeuAc-NeuAc-containing ganglioside). Quantitative estimation of the above products was accomplished by scanning the TLC plate using a Schimadzu CS-930 TLC scanner(35Ando S. Chang N.-C Yu R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 89: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In the presence of saposin B and 6 units of clostridial sialidase (Fig. 2A, lane4), the production of GalNAc-GM1a, GalNAc-GM1b, and GalNAc-GA1 was in a ratio of 1.5:5.6:2.9, whereas in the presence of the double amounts of the sialidase (Fig. 3A, laneP1), the ratio was 1:1.56:1.86. These results indicate that saposin B stimulated, without discrimination, the cleavage of the external and the internal NeuAc residues of GalNAc-GD1a, and the higher sialidase concentration promoted the production of GalNAc-GA1. In contrast, in the presence of GM2 activator and 6 units of the sialidase (Fig. 2A, lane5), the ratio of GalNAc-GMla and GalNAc-GA1 was 8.8:1, whereas in the presence of the double amounts of the enzyme (Fig. 3A, laneP2), the ratio of these two products was 7:3. This indicates that GM2 activator specifically stimulated the hydrolysis of the external NeuAc, which is associated with the GM2 epitope, and virtually did not stimulate the hydrolysis of the internal NeuAc from GalNAc-GD1a to produce GalNAc-GM1b (only a trace of GalNAc-GM1b was detected by immunostaining as shown in Fig. 2B, lane5′). After the removal of the external NeuAc residue, some GalNAc-GM1a was converted into GalNAc-GA1. The differential hydrolysis of the external and the internal NeuAc residues in GalNAc-GD1a by one sialidase in the presence of GM2 activator or saposin B may indicate that these two NeuAc residues are distinct within their microenvironments, even though in the same molecule. Recently, Acquotti et al.(22Acquotti D. Cantu L. Ragg E. Sonnino S. Eur. J.

They concluded from the H6-C6-C7-H7 and H7-C7-C8-H8 dihedral angles that the two NeuAc conformations for both GalNAc-GD1a and GD1a were very similar to GM1(36Acquotti D. Poppe L.

Lipids. 1991; 59: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, the chemical shifts of the external and the internal Gal, GalNAc, and NeuAc residues were completely superimposed, and no distinction could be made between the two sets of trisaccharide structures in GalNAc-GD1a. Therefore, the physico-chemical determinations of GalNAc-GD1a could not distinguish the external and the internal NeuAc residues. These results, however, do not corroborate with the results that saposin B and GM2 activator can discriminate the two NeuAc residues. The difference may be due to the fact that the physico-chemical studies were performed in (CD3)2SO or dodecyl phosphocholine micelles in which the behavior of GalNAc-GD1a molecule might be different from that found in the aqueous system used for the in vitro enzymatic hydrolysis. The different specificities expressed by GM2 activator and saposin B toward the two NeuAc residues in GalNAc-GD1a clearly show the distinct functions of these two activator proteins. The unique structural feature of GalNAc-GD1a is the presence of two GM2 epitopes, the branched trisaccharide GalNAc-(NeuAc)-Gal, linked in tandem. This ganglioside provided us with an excellent model to show for the first time the distinct mode of action of saposin B and GM2 activator. Our results strongly suggest that GM2 activator can recognize the external NeuAc residue in GalNAc-GD1a, while saposin B does not exhibit this specificity. Since GM2 activator can stimulate the hydrolysis of only one NeuAc residue between the two supposedly identical NeuAc residues in GalNAc-GD1a, it is reasonable to consider that the two trisaccharide units (GM2 epitopes) in GalNAc-GD1a are not completely identical and they are distinguishable by GM2 activator protein. Whether this difference is the result of intra-saccharide interaction or the influence by the hydrophobic ceramide is still not clear. We have used ceramide glycanase (33Zhou B. Li S.-C. Laine R.A. Huang R.T.C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12272-12277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to prepare the lipid-free oligosaccharide from GalNAc-GD1a and found that the two NeuAc residues in this oligosaccharide became resistant to clostridial sialidase in the presence or absence of GM2 activator or saposin B. This indicates that the ceramide moiety has a profound effect on the activator-assisted hydrolysis of sialic acids from GalNAc-GD1a."

Naturally occurring mutations of p53 are mainly located within a region containing residues 100-300 and are predominantly of missense type, resulting in loss of the protein's DNA binding activity. Here we show that this type of mutation also represses the p53 N-terminal activation domain. The repression activity is localized in the central region of mutant p53 containing residues 101-318. Interestingly, the central region of a temperature-sensitive mutant p53N247I possesses a movable and regulable inactivation function. It represses other activities present on the same polypeptide chain without strict regard to the configuration of that polypeptide only at the nonpermissive temperature (37 degrees C) and not at the permissive temperature (30 degrees C). Furthermore, this mutant p53 region exhibits no other activity, and its function is independent of endogenous p53 status."
