https://openalex.org/W2799968645,"Coral bleaching continues to be one of the most devastating and immediate impacts of climate change on coral reef ecosystems worldwide. In 2015, a major bleaching event was declared as the “3rd global coral bleaching event” by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, impacting a large number of reefs in every major ocean. The Red Sea was no exception, and we present herein in situ observations of the status of coral reefs in the central Saudi Arabian Red Sea from September 2015, following extended periods of high temperatures reaching upwards of 32.5°C in our study area. We examined eleven reefs using line-intercept transects at three different depths, including all reefs that were surveyed during a previous bleaching event in 2010. Bleaching was most prevalent on inshore reefs (55.6% ± 14.6% of live coral cover exhibited bleaching) and on shallower transects (41% ± 10.2% of live corals surveyed at 5m depth) within reefs. Similar taxonomic groups (e.g., Agariciidae) were affected in 2015 and in 2010. Most interestingly, Acropora and Porites had similar bleaching rates (~30% each) and similar relative coral cover (~7% each) across all reefs in 2015. Coral genera with the highest levels of bleaching (>60%) were also among the rarest (<1% of coral cover) in 2015. While this bodes well for the relative retention of coral cover, it may ultimately lead to decreased species richness, often considered an important component of a healthy coral reef. The resultant long-term changes in these coral reef communities remain to be seen."

Therefore we investigated invasive tumor patterns predicting nodal involvement and survival in patients with clinically node-negative T1 and T2 oral squamous cell carcinoma (cT1,2N0M0 OSCC). Ninety-one cases of cT1,2N0M0 OSCC treated with transoral resection of the primary tumor were assessed based on 3 types of invasive tumor patterns on histopathologic and pancytokeratin-stained immunohistological sections: the mode of invasion, worst pattern of invasion (WPOI), and tumor budding. The correlations among invasive tumor patterns, regional metastasis, and disease-free survival were analyzed. Of the 91 cases, 22 (24%) had pathologically proven regional metastasis. The mode of invasion (p<0.01) and tumor budding (p<0.01) were associated with regional metastasis as well as lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.04) in univariate analysis. In logistic regression analysis, however, tumor budding was the only independent predictor of regional metastasis (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.29-5.30, p<0.01). All three invasive patterns, the mode of invasion, WPOI, and tumor budding, were found to be significant predictors of 5-year disease-free survival (p<0.01, p = 0.03, and p<0.01, respectively) as well as lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.02) and perineural invasion (p = 0.02). A final model for Cox multivariate analysis identified the prognostic advantage of the intensity of tumor budding (HR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.51-3.18, p<0.01) compared with the mode of invasion and WPOI in disease-free survival. Our results indicate that the intensity of tumor budding may be a novel diagnostic biomarker, as well as a therapeutic tool, for regional metastasis in patients with cT1,2N0M0 OSCC. If the pancytokeratin-based immunohistochemical features of more than five buds, and a grade 4C or 4D mode of invasion are identified, careful wait-and-see follow-up in a short period with the use of imaging modalities is desirable. If there are more than ten buds, a grade 4D mode of invasion, or WPOI-5 in the same section, wide resection of the primary tumor with elective neck dissection should be recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2799386208,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) promotes an inflammatory process, leading to the progressive loss of the functional capacity of the immune system. The HIV infection induces alterations in several tissues, but mainly in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). However, the degree of GALT deterioration varies among infected individuals. In fact, it has been shown that HIV-controllers, who spontaneously control viral replication, exhibit a lower inflammatory response, and a relative normal frequency and function of most of the immune cells. Inflammasomes are molecular complexes involved in the inflammatory response, being NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2 and Pyrin inflammasomes, the best characterized so far. These complexes regulate the maturation of cytokines of the IL-1 family, including IL-1β and IL-18. These cytokines have been associated with immune activation and expansion of HIV target cells, promoting viral replication. Interesting, some reports indicate that HIV induces the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, but the role of this, and other inflammasomes during HIV infection, especially in GALT, remains unclear.To compare the relative expression of inflammasome components and the proinflammatory response related to their activity, between HIV-progressors and HIV-controllers.GALT biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 15 HIV-controllers and 15 HIV-progressors were obtained. The relative expression of the following inflammasome components were evaluated by RT-PCR: NLRP3, NLRC4, NLRP1, AIM2, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18. In addition, plasma concentration of IL-18 was evaluated as an indicator of baseline proinflammatory status. Finally, in supernatants of PBMCs in vitro stimulated with inflammasome agonists, the concentrations of IL-1β and IL-18 were quantified by ELISA.HIV-progressors exhibited higher expression of IL-1β, IL-18 and caspase-1 genes in GALT and PBMCs compared with HIV-controllers. In addition, HIV-progressors had also increased expression of ASC in PBMCs. When plasma levels were evaluated, IL-18 was increased in HIV-progressors. Interesting, these patients also showed an increased production of IL-1β in supernatants of PBMCs stimulated in vitro with the agonists of AIM2, NLRP1 and NLRC4 inflammasomes. Finally, the expression of caspase-1, NLRP1, IL-1β and IL-18 in GALT or peripheral blood was correlated with CD4+ T-cell count and viral load.Our results suggest that during HIV-infection, the required signals to induce the expression of different components of the inflammasomes are produced, both in GALT and in periphery. The activation of these molecular complexes could increase the number of target cells, favoring HIV replication and cell death, promoting the disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2801133958,"Objectives To determine the effect of applied power settings, coil wetness conditions, and e-liquid compositions on the coil heating temperature for e-cigarettes with a “top-coil” clearomizer, and to make associations of coil conditions with emission of toxic carbonyl compounds by combining results herein with the literature. Methods The coil temperature of a second generation e-cigarette was measured at various applied power levels, coil conditions, and e-liquid compositions, including (1) measurements by thermocouple at three e-liquid fill levels (dry, wet-through-wick, and full-wet), three coil resistances (low, standard, and high), and four voltage settings (3–6 V) for multiple coils using propylene glycol (PG) as a test liquid; (2) measurements by thermocouple at additional degrees of coil wetness for a high resistance coil using PG; and (3) measurements by both thermocouple and infrared (IR) camera for high resistance coils using PG alone and a 1:1 (wt/wt) mixture of PG and glycerol (PG/GL). Results For single point thermocouple measurements with PG, coil temperatures ranged from 322 ‒ 1008°C, 145 ‒ 334°C, and 110 ‒ 185°C under dry, wet-through-wick, and full-wet conditions, respectively, for the total of 13 replaceable coil heads. For conditions measured with both a thermocouple and an IR camera, all thermocouple measurements were between the minimum and maximum across-coil IR camera measurements and equal to 74% ‒ 115% of the across-coil mean, depending on test conditions. The IR camera showed details of the non-uniform temperature distribution across heating coils. The large temperature variations under wet-through-wick conditions may explain the large variations in formaldehyde formation rate reported in the literature for such “top-coil” clearomizers. Conclusions This study established a simple and straight-forward protocol to systematically measure e-cigarette coil heating temperature under dry, wet-through-wick, and full-wet conditions. In addition to applied power, the composition of e-liquid, and the devices’ ability to efficiently deliver e-liquid to the heating coil are important product design factors effecting coil operating temperature. Precautionary temperature checks on e-cigarettes under manufacturer-recommended normal use conditions may help to reduce the health risks from exposure to toxic carbonyl emissions associated with coil overheating."
https://openalex.org/W2799816474,"Most falls occur after a loss of balance following an unexpected perturbation such as a slip or a trip. Greater understanding of how humans control and maintain stability during perturbed walking may help to develop appropriate fall prevention programs. The aim of this study was to examine changes in spatiotemporal gait and stability parameters in response to sudden mechanical perturbations in medio-lateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) direction during treadmill walking. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate which parameters are most representative to quantify postural recovery responses. Ten healthy adults (mean = 26.4, SD = 4.1 years) walked on a treadmill that provided unexpected discrete ML and AP surface horizontal perturbations. Participants walked under no perturbation (normal walking), and under left, right, forward, and backward sudden mechanical perturbation conditions. Gait parameters were computed including stride length (SL), step width (SW), and cadence, as well as dynamic stability in AP- (MoS-AP) and ML- (MoS-ML) directions. Gait and stability parameters were quantified by means, variability, and extreme values. Overall, participants walked with a shorter stride length, a wider step width, and a higher cadence during perturbed walking, but despite this, the effect of perturbations on means of SW and MoS-ML was not statistically significant. These effects were found to be significantly greater when the perturbations were applied toward the ML-direction. Variabilities, as well as extremes of gait-related parameters, showed strong responses to the perturbations. The higher variability as a response to perturbations might be an indicator of instability and fall risk, on the same note, an adaptation strategy and beneficial to recover balance. Parameters identified in this study may represent useful indicators of locomotor adaptation to successfully compensate sudden mechanical perturbation during walking. The potential association of the extracted parameters with fall risk needs to be determined in fall-prone populations."
https://openalex.org/W2801767397,"The use of online-communication applications including messengers (e.g. WhatsApp) or social networking services (e.g. Facebook) on the smartphone has turned into daily practice for billions of people, for example during waiting times. An increasing number of individuals show diminished control over their usage of these applications despite negative consequences in everyday life. This can be referred to as Internet-communication disorder (ICD). The current study investigated the effect of boredom proneness on symptoms of an ICD. It further examined the mediating role of cognitive and affective mechanisms, namely expectancies to avoid negative feelings online and cue-induced craving. The results of a structural equation model (N = 148) illustrate that boredom proneness is a risk factor for the development and maintenance of an ICD as it had a significant direct effect on ICD symptoms. Furthermore, boredom proneness predicted avoidance expectancies as well as cue-induced craving. Both in turn enhanced the risk of developing ICD tendencies. Moreover, both variables mediated the effect of boredom proneness on ICD and interacted among each other. In summary, the results demonstrate that people who have a higher susceptibility to experience boredom show higher expectancies to avoid negative emotions online, which promotes higher craving reactions when being confronted with specific cues (e.g. an incoming message), and could result in ICD tendencies."
https://openalex.org/W2801058461,"Immune checkpoint regulators, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death protein-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) have emerged as promising new targets for cancer therapeutics. While tumor expression of PD-L1 has been shown to have objective responses to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies, the clinical implications of CTLA-4 expression in tumor cells or immune cells in the tumor microenvironment is still controversial. We investigated the expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in human breast tumors and provided a scoring system for the systematic evaluation of CTLA-4 staining.Immunohistochemical staining for PD-L1 and CTLA-4 expression was performed on a tissue microarray of 102 cores, which included normal and neoplastic breast tissues. Neoplastic cores were divided into four groups: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and invasive tubular carcinoma (ITC). PD-L1 and CTLA-4 expressions were scored based on a system which accounted for the percentage and intensity of positivity and results provided in conjunction with available clinical and demographic data.Overall, CTLA-4 was over-expressed in 49 of 93 (52.7%) breast tumors. Subcategorically, CTLA-4 was positive in 3 of 8 (37.5%) ductal carcinoma in situ, 40 of 73 (55%) of invasive ductal carcinomas, 4 of 10 (40%) of invasive lobular carcinomas and 2 of 2 (100%) of invasive tubular carcinomas. All 6 normal breast tissues were interpreted as negative for CTLA-4 staining. Only 4.1% of the invasive ductal carcinomas were positive for PD-L1 reactivity and the remaining carcinomas stained negative.This study shows a significant overexpression of CTLA-4 in >50% of breast carcinomas with no such overexpression of CTLA-4 in benign breast tissues. PDL-1 staining is seen in only a small number of invasive ductal carcinomas (4.1%). These findings suggest the need for further investigation of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies and their efficacy in the treatment of breast carcinomas with overexpression of these immune modulators. In addition, the proposed scoring system will facilitate a more systematic correlation between tumor reactivity and clinical outcome which can be applied to all intracytoplasmic tumor markers."
https://openalex.org/W2799645368,"Transient or constant impaired immunity is often associated with neoplastic disease or oncological treatment. Among the most common pathogens found in patients with HIV or patients undergoing chemotherapy are protozoans of the Cryptosporidium genus, which cause diarrhea in humans and animals. The present study determined the frequency of Cryptosporidium spp. infections in patients with colorectal cancer (N = 108; 42 women; 66 men; median age, 65 years), before beginning oncological treatment, compared to a control group (N = 125; 56 women, 69 men; median age, 63 years) without colorectal cancer or a history of oncological disease. We also assessed whether Cryptosporidium spp. infections were associated with age, gender, cancer stage (based on Astler-Coller or TNM classification), histological grade, or cancer location. Patients were treated at the Pomeranian Medical University, in 2009-2014. The presence of Cryptosporidium spp. antigen was determined in stool samples, analyzed with a commercial immunoenzymatic test. Cryptosporidium spp. infections occurred significantly more often (p = 0.015) in patients (13%) compared to controls (4%). The patient group showed no significant relationship between Cryptosporidium spp. infection and sex, age, tumor location, cancer grade, or stage. A multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and sex that included all subjects (patient + control groups, n = 233) showed that the odds of a Cryptosporidium spp. infection were more than three-fold higher in patients than in controls, and more than six-fold higher among men than among women.1) Cryptosporidium spp. infections occurred significantly more frequently in patients with colorectal cancer (before oncological treatment) compared to controls, independent of age and sex. 2) Cryptosporidium spp. infections were not associated with the colorectal cancer stage, grade, or location or with patient age. 3) Male gender was significantly related to the frequency of Cryptosporidium spp. infections, independent of age and the presence of colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2800519733,"Amaranthus palmeri (Amaranthaceae) is a noxious weed in several agroecosystems and in some cases seriously threatens the sustainability of crop production in North America. Glyphosate-resistant Amaranthus species are widespread, prompting the use of alternatives to glyphosate such as glufosinate, in conjunction with glufosinate-resistant crop cultivars, to help control glyphosate-resistant weeds. An experiment was conducted to analyze the transcriptome of A. palmeri plants that survived exposure to 0.55 kg ha-1 glufosinate. Since there was no record of glufosinate use at the collection site, survival of plants within the population are likely due to genetic expression that pre-dates selection; in the formal parlance of weed science this is described as natural tolerance. Leaf tissues from glufosinate-treated and non-treated seedlings were harvested 24 h after treatment (HAT) for RNA-Seq analysis. Global gene expression was measured using Illumina DNA sequence reads from non-treated and treated surviving (presumably tolerant, T) and susceptible (S) plants. The same plants were used to determine the mechanisms conferring differential tolerance to glufosinate. The S plants accumulated twice as much ammonia as did the T plants, 24 HAT. The relative copy number of the glufosinate target gene GS2 did not differ between T and S plants, with 1 to 3 GS2 copies in both biotypes. A reference cDNA transcriptome consisting of 72,780 contigs was assembled, with 65,282 sequences putatively annotated. Sequences of GS2 from the transcriptome assembly did not have polymorphisms unique to the tolerant plants. Five hundred sixty-seven genes were differentially expressed between treated T and S plants. Of the upregulated genes in treated T plants, 210 were more highly induced than were the upregulated genes in the treated S plants. Glufosinate-tolerant plants had greater induction of ABC transporter, glutathione S-transferase (GST), NAC transcription factor, nitronate monooxygenase (NMO), chitin elicitor receptor kinase (CERK1), heat shock protein 83, ethylene transcription factor, heat stress transcription factor, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, ABA 8’-hydroxylase, and cytochrome P450 genes (CYP72A, CYP94A1). Seven candidate genes were selected for validation using quantitative real time-PCR. While GST was upregulated in treated tolerant plants in at least one population, CYP72A219 was consistently highly expressed in all treated tolerant biotypes. These genes are candidates for contributing tolerance to glufosinate. Taken together, these results show that differential induction of stress-protection genes in a population can enable some individuals to survive herbicide application. Elevated expression of detoxification-related genes can get fixed in a population with sustained selection pressure, leading to evolution of resistance. Alternatively, sustained selection pressure could select for mutation(s) in the GS2 gene with the same consequence."
https://openalex.org/W2801129626,"Spoken Language Identification (LID) is the process of determining and classifying natural language from a given content and dataset. Typically, data must be processed to extract useful features to perform LID. The extracting features for LID, based on literature, is a mature process where the standard features for LID have already been developed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Shifted Delta Cepstral (SDC), the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and ending with the i-vector based framework. However, the process of learning based on extract features remains to be improved (i.e. optimised) to capture all embedded knowledge on the extracted features. The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an effective learning model used to perform classification and regression analysis and is extremely useful to train a single hidden layer neural network. Nevertheless, the learning process of this model is not entirely effective (i.e. optimised) due to the random selection of weights within the input hidden layer. In this study, the ELM is selected as a learning model for LID based on standard feature extraction. One of the optimisation approaches of ELM, the Self-Adjusting Extreme Learning Machine (SA-ELM) is selected as the benchmark and improved by altering the selection phase of the optimisation process. The selection process is performed incorporating both the Split-Ratio and K-Tournament methods, the improved SA-ELM is named Enhanced Self-Adjusting Extreme Learning Machine (ESA-ELM). The results are generated based on LID with the datasets created from eight different languages. The results of the study showed excellent superiority relating to the performance of the Enhanced Self-Adjusting Extreme Learning Machine LID (ESA-ELM LID) compared with the SA-ELM LID, with ESA-ELM LID achieving an accuracy of 96.25%, as compared to the accuracy of SA-ELM LID of only 95.00%."
https://openalex.org/W2799652029,"Men have two practical choices for contraception; the condom which has a high typical use failure rate or vasectomy. New male hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptives are under development that target either the production of sperm (spermatogenesis) or the delivery of sperm. One particular target is the sperm protein EPPIN, which is present on the surface of human spermatozoa. EP055 is a small organic compound that targets EPPIN on the surface of sperm and inhibits motility. EP055 was tested in cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) males to determine its plasma half-life after intravenous (i.v.) infusion of a single dose and for binding to its target tissues. Our initial study demonstrated a plasma half-life for EP055 of 10.6 minutes. In a second study examination of macaque testis, epididymis, and plasma after i.v. infusion of a single dose of compound EP055 (63.25 mg/kg) demonstrated that EP055 was detected in testis and epididymis two hours and six hours post-infusion. We initiated a trial in rhesus (Macaca mulatta) males to assess the availability of EP055 in semen and its effect on sperm motility as a measure of the drug's efficacy. Four macaques were infused with a low dose (75–80 mg/kg) followed by a recovery period and a subsequent high dose (125–130 mg/kg) of EP055. After high dose administration, sperm motility fell to approximately 20% of pretreatment levels within 6 hours post-infusion; no normal motility was observed at 30 hours post-infusion. Recovery of sperm motility was obvious by 78 hours post-infusion; with full recovery in all animals by 18 days post-infusion. EP055 has the potential to be a male contraceptive that would provide a reversible, short-lived pharmacological alternative."
https://openalex.org/W2801922717,"Mycobacterium abscessus, a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium, are increasingly present in soft tissue infections and chronic lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, and infections are characterized by growth in neutrophil-rich environments. M. abscessus is observed as two distinct smooth and rough morphotypes. The environmental smooth morphotype initiates infection and has a relatively limited ability to activate neutrophils. The rough morphotype has increased virulence and immunogenicity. However, the neutrophil response to the rough morphotype has not been explored. Killing of the smooth and rough strains, including cystic fibrosis clinical isolates, was equivalent. Neutrophil uptake of M. abscessus was similar between morphotypes. Mechanistically, both rough and smooth morphotypes enhanced neutrophil reactive oxygen species generation but inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity did not affect M. abscessus viability. However, inhibition of phagocytosis and extracellular traps reduced killing of the smooth morphotype with lesser effects against the rough morphotype. Neutrophils treated with M. abscessus released a heat-labile mycobactericidal activity against the rough morphotype, but the activity was heat-tolerant against the smooth morphotype. Overall, M. abscessus stimulates ineffective neutrophil reactive oxygen species generation, and key mechanisms differ in killing of the smooth (phagocytosis-dependent, extracellular traps, and heat-tolerant secreted factor) and rough (extracellular traps and a heat-labile secreted factor) morphotypes. These studies represent an essential advancement in understanding the host response to M. abscessus, and help explain the recalcitrance of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2801948640,"This study focuses on the possible uses of physics engines, and more specifically the Bullet physics library, to simulate granular systems. Physics engines are employed extensively in the video gaming, animation and movie industries to create physically plausible scenes. They are designed to deliver a fast, stable, and optimal simulation of certain systems such as rigid bodies, soft bodies and fluids. This study focuses exclusively on simulating granular media in the context of rigid body dynamics with the Bullet physics library. The first step was to validate the results of the simulations of direct shear testing on uniform-sized metal beads on the basis of laboratory experiments. The difference in the average angle of mobilized frictions was found to be only 1.0°. In addition, a very close match was found between dilatancy in the laboratory samples and in the simulations. A comprehensive study was then conducted to determine the failure and post-failure mechanism. We conclude with the presentation of a simulation of a direct shear test on real soil which demonstrated that Bullet has all the capabilities needed to be used as software for simulating granular systems."
https://openalex.org/W2801806320,"While measurement of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) is an important screening tool for prostate cancer, new biomarkers are necessary for better discrimination between presence and absence of disease. The MIL-38 monoclonal antibody is specific for the membrane glycoprotein glypican 1 (GPC-1) and binds to prostate cancer tissue. Urine is known to be a source of cellular material. Thus, we hypothesized that detection of GPC-1 in urine cellular material may identify individuals with prostate cancer. Urine samples from patients with prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or normal controls were collected and cell sediments prepared. GPC-1-positive cells were detected using a MIL-38 immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and samples were classed positive or negative for GPC-1 expressing cells. Assay sensitivity and specificity, stratified by PSA, was reported. A total of 125 patient samples were analyzed (N = 41 prostate cancer; N = 37 BPH; N = 47 normal controls). The use of MIL-38 to detect GPC-1 by IFA discriminated between prostate cancer and BPH urine specimens with a sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 76%, respectively. Assay specificity increased with increasing PSA, with the highest specificity (89%) for patients with PSA ≥4 ng/ml. At lower PSA (<2 ng/ml) specificity decreased, as evidenced by a greater number of false positives in this concentration range. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for GPC-1-positive cells in patients with prostate cancer, adjusted for PSA, was greatest at the lowest serum PSA (<2 ng/ml; OR = 13.4; 95% CI: 4.0-44.7) compared with no adjustment for PSA (OR = 6.4; 95% CI: 2.8-14.9). The use of MIL-38 for detection of GPC-1 may be a useful tool for detection of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2802364975,"Background Hypercholesterolemia is a well-established risk factor for coronary heart disease, but the association between cholesterol level change and mortality is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the association of 2 year (2002–2003 to 2004–2005) change in cholesterol with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort study. Methods and findings The study population consisted of 269,391 participants aged more than 40 years who were free of myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer using the Korean National Health Insurance Service—National Health Screening Cohort. Cholesterol levels were classified into 1st, 2nd and 3rd tertiles during each of the first and second health examinations, respectively. The participants were followed-up for all-cause and cause-specific mortality from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013. Compared to participants who stayed within the 2nd tertile group for cholesterol during both the first and second examinations, participants who became or maintained cholesterol levels to the 1st tertile during the second examination had increased risk of all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.28 (1.18–1.38) in 1st/1st, 1.16 (1.07–1.26) in 2nd/1st and 1.47 (1.32–1.64) in 3rd/1st tertile levels, respectively]. In addition, increased or persistent high cholesterol levels to the 3rd tertile was associated with elevated risk for all-cause mortality [aHR (95% CI) = 1.10 (1.01–1.20) in 1st/2nd, 1.16(1.03–1.31) in 1st/3rd and 1.15(1.05–1.25) in 3rd/3rd tertile levels]. Conclusions Changes in cholesterol levels in either direction to low cholesterol or persistently low cholesterol levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Particularly, spontaneous decline in cholesterol levels may be a marker for worsening health conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2800135497,"The analysis of traffic collisions is essential for urban safety and the sustainable development of the urban environment. Reducing the road traffic injuries and the financial losses caused by collisions is the most important goal of traffic management. In addition, traffic collisions are a major cause of traffic congestion, which is a serious issue that affects everyone in the society. Therefore, traffic collision analysis is essential for all parties, including drivers, pedestrians, and traffic officers, to understand the road risks at a finer spatio-temporal scale. However, traffic collisions in the urban context are dynamic and complex. Thus, it is important to detect how the collision hotspots evolve over time through spatio-temporal clustering analysis. In addition, traffic collisions are not isolated events in space. The characteristics of the traffic collisions and their surrounding locations also present an influence of the clusters. This work tries to explore the spatio-temporal clustering patterns of traffic collisions by combining a set of network-constrained methods. These methods were tested using the traffic collision data in Jianghan District of Wuhan, China. The results demonstrated that these methods offer different perspectives of the spatio-temporal clustering patterns. The weighted network kernel density estimation provides an intuitive way to incorporate attribute information. The network cross K-function shows that there are varying clustering tendencies between traffic collisions and different types of POIs. The proposed network differential Local Moran's I and network local indicators of mobility association provide straightforward and quantitative measures of the hotspot changes. This case study shows that these methods could help researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers to better understand the spatio-temporal clustering patterns of traffic collisions."
https://openalex.org/W2801761909,"Background To review long QT syndrome molecular autopsy results in sudden unexplained death in young (SUDY) between 2006 and 2013 in New Zealand. Methods Audit of the LQTS molecular autopsy results, cardiac investigations and family screening data from gene-positive families. Results During the study period, 365 SUDY cases were referred for molecular autopsy. 128 cases (35%) underwent LQTS genetic testing. 31 likely pathogenic variants were identified in 27 cases (21%); SCN5A (14/31, 45%), KCNH2 (7/31, 22%), KCNQ1 (4/31, 13%), KCNE2 (3/31, 10%), KCNE1 (2/31, 7%), KCNJ2 (1/31, 3%). Thirteen variants (13/128, 10%) were ultimately classified as pathogenic. Most deaths (63%) occurred during sleep. Gene variant carriage was more likely with a positive medical history (mostly seizures, 63% vs 36%, p = 0.01), amongst females (36% vs 12%, p = 0.001) and whites more than Maori (31% vs 0, p = 0.0009). Children 1–12 years were more likely to be gene-positive (33% vs 14%, p = 0.02). Family screening identified 42 gene-positive relatives, 18 with definitive phenotypic expression of LQTS/Brugada. 76% of the variants were maternally inherited (p = 0.007). Further family investigations and research now support pathogenicity of the variant in 13/27 (48%) of gene-positive cases. Conclusion In New Zealand, variants in SCN5A and KCNH2, with maternal inheritance, predominate. A rare variant in LQTS genes is more likely in whites rather than Maori, females, children 1–12 years and those with a positive personal and family history of seizures, syncope or SUDY. Family screening supported the diagnosis in a third of the cases. The changing classification of variants creates a significant challenge."

This collection of patterns will thus constitute a valuable resource for developmental biologists to picture the dynamics of Wnt activity during development."
https://openalex.org/W2800352219,"Objectives The effectiveness and costs associated with addition of pharmacist-led group medical visits to standard care for patients with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is unknown. Methods Randomized-controlled-trial in three US Veteran Health Administration (VHA) Hospitals, where 250 patients with T2DM, HbA1c >7% and either hypertension, active smoking or hyperlipidemia were randomized to either (1) addition of pharmacist-led group-medical-visits or (2) standard care alone for 13 months. Group (4–6 patients) visits consisted of 2-hour, education and comprehensive medication management sessions once weekly for 4 weeks, followed by quarterly visits. Change from baseline in cardiovascular risk estimated by the UKPDS-risk-score, health-related quality-of-life (SF36v) and institutional healthcare costs were compared between study arms. Results After 13 months, both groups had similar and significant improvements from baseline in UKPDS-risk-score (-0.02 ±0.09 and -0.04 ±0.09, group visit and standard care respectively, adjusted p<0.05 for both); however, there was no significant difference between the study arms (adjusted p = 0.45). There were no significant differences on improvement from baseline in A1c, systolic-blood-pressure, and LDL as well as health-related quality-of-life measures between the study arms. Compared to 13 months prior, the increase in per-person outpatient expenditure from baseline was significantly lower in the group visit versus the standard care arm, both during the study intervention period and at 13-months after study interventions. The overall VHA healthcare costs/person were comparable between the study arms during the study period (p = 0.15); then decreased by 6% for the group visit but increased by 13% for the standard care arm 13 months post-study (p<0.01). Conclusions Addition of pharmacist-led group medical visits in T2DM achieved similar improvements from baseline in cardiovascular risk factors than usual care, but with reduction in the healthcare costs in the group visit arm 13 months after completion compared to the steady rise in cost for the usual care arm.

https://openalex.org/W2802927435,"Objective To analyse the morphological features and diagnostic ability of eight macular retinal layers using a new segmentation software Heidelberg's Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) in healthy, ocular hypertensive and primary open angle glaucoma patients. Methods Single-center, cross-sectional, non-interventional study. 193 eyes from 193 consecutive patients (56 controls, 63 ocular hypertensives, 32 early primary open glaucoma patients and 42 moderate-advanced primary open glaucoma patients). Those patients presenting any retinal disease were excluded. Macular segmentation of the retinal layers was automatically performed using the new segmentation Heidelberg's Spectralis OCT software providing measurements for eight retinal layers. The software provides thickness maps divided into nine subfields. Results Statistically significant differences in inner layers’ thickness was found between all 4 four groups. Superior and inferior sectors of macular retinal nerve fiber layer; nasal, temporal, superior and inferior sectors of ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer were significantly different when comparing ocular hypertensive patients and early glaucoma patients. Areas under the ROC curves for early glaucoma diagnosis were 0.781±0.052 for macular retinal nerve fiber layer outer inferior sector, 0.760±0.050 for ganglion cell layer outer temporal sector, 0.767±0.049 for the inner plexiform layer outer temporal sector and 0.807±0.048 for the combination of all three. No differences were found between groups when considering outer retinal layers. Conclusions The automated segmentation software from Heidelberg's Spectralis OCT provides a new diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of ocular hypertensive and glaucoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2802213954,"A large body of evidence suggests that the 11+ warm-up programme is effective in preventing football-related musculoskeletal injuries. However, despite considerable efforts to promote and disseminate the programme, it is unclear as to whether team head coaches are familiar with the 11+ and how they rate its feasibility. The present study aimed to gather information on awareness and usage among German amateur level football coaches. A questionnaire was administered to 7893 individuals who were in charge of youth and adult non-professional teams. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the obtained data. A total of 1223 coaches (16%) returned the questionnaire. There was no risk of a non-response bias (p>.05). At the time of the survey, nearly half of the participants (42.6%) knew the 11+. Among the coaches who were familiar with the programme, three of four reported applying it regularly (at least once per week). Holding a license (φ = .28, p < .0001), high competitive level (Cramer-V = .13, p = .007), and coaching a youth team (φ = .1, p = .001) were associated with usage of 11+. Feasibility and suitability of the 11+ were rated similarly by aware and unaware coaches. Although a substantial share of German amateur level coaches is familiar with the 11+, more than half of the surveyed participants did not know the programme. As the non-usage does not appear to stem from a lack of rated feasibility and suitability, existing communication strategies might need to be revised."
https://openalex.org/W2800818652,"Ecological communities are complex entities that can be maintained and structured by niche-based processes such as environmental conditions, and spatial processes such as dispersal. Thus, diversity patterns may be shaped simultaneously at different spatial scales by very distinct processes. Herein we assess whether and how functional, taxonomic, and phylogenetic beta diversities of frog tadpoles are explained by environmental and/or spatial predictors. We implemented a distance–based redundancy analysis to explore variation in components of beta diversity explained by pure environmental and pure spatial predictors, as well as their interactions, at both fine and broad spatial scales. Our results indicated important but complex roles of spatial and environmental predictors in structuring phylogenetic, taxonomic and functional beta diversities. The pure fine-scales spatial fraction was more important in structuring all beta diversity components, especially to functional and taxonomical spatial turnover. Environmental variables such as canopy cover and vegetation structure were important predictors of all components, but especially to functional and taxonomic beta diversity. We emphasize that distinct factors related to environment and space are affecting distinct components of beta diversity in different ways. Although weaker, phylogenetic beta diversity, which is structured more on biogeographical scales, and thus can be represented by spatially structured processes, was more related to broad spatial processes than other components. However, selected fine-scale spatial predictors denoted negative autocorrelation, which may be revealing the existence of differences in unmeasured habitat variables among samples. Although overall important, local environmental-based processes explained better functional and taxonomic beta diversity, as these diversity components carry an important ecological value. We highlight the importance of assessing different components of diversity patterns at different scales by spatially explicit models in order to improve our understanding of community structure and help to unravel the complex nature of biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2801380723,"Background Although increased serum IgG4 level and tissue infiltration of IgG4-positive cells are key events in IgG4-related disease (IgG4RD), and nearly half of IgG4RD patients show hypocomplementemia, the role of IgG4 in the pathogenesis of IgG4RD remains unclear. Many reports show that altered IgG glycosylation, especially IgG with agalactosylated N-linked glycan (G0 N-glycan), have proinflammatory roles including complement activation, implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. This study determined the concentration of N-linked glycans (N-glycan) released from serum IgG4 in IgG4RD patients and compared the difference of glycosylation changes to those in healthy controls. We also compared the concentration of each IgG4 glycoform between patients with and without hypocomplementemia and individual organ involvement (kidney, pancreas, lymph node) in IgG4RD. Methods We collected sera from 12 IgG4RD patients and 8 healthy controls. IgG4 was isolated from sera via Melon™ Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit followed by Capture Select IgG4 (Hu) Affinity Matrix. IgG4 N-glycans were analyzed by S-BIO GlycanMap® Xpress methodology. Results Significant increases of IgG4 G0 N-glycan and IgG4 fucosylated N-glycan (F1 N-glycan) concentrations were observed in IgG4RD compared with healthy controls. Although we observed decreased levels of IgG4 F0 glycan in IgG4RD with hypocomplementemia, there were no significant differences in the galactosylation and sialyation of IgG4 N-glycans. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the glycosylation of IgG4 N-glycans between patients with and without individual organ involvement of IgG4RD. Conclusions Although IgG4 has anti-inflammatory properties, IgG4 G0 and F1 glycans were increased in patients with IgG4RD. Our results suggest that decreased galactosylation of IgG4 is not related to complement activation and the differences of individual organ involvement in IgG4RD. IgG4 fucosylation change may be related to complement activation in IgG4RD. Further investigation is needed to clarify the role of IgG4 in IgG4RD."
https://openalex.org/W2800617133,"Introduction Product packaging has long been used by the tobacco industry to target consumers and manipulate product perceptions. This study examines the extent to which cigarillo packaging influences perceptions of product flavor, taste, smell, and appeal. Methods A web-based experiment was conducted among young adults. Participants viewed three randomly selected cigarillo packs, varying on pack flavor descriptor, color, type, branding, and warning—totaling 180 pack images. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effect of pack elements on product perceptions. Results A total of 2,664 current, ever, and never little cigar and cigarillo users participated. Cigarillo packs with a flavor descriptor were perceived as having a more favorable taste (β = 0.21, p < .001) and smell (β = 0.14, p < .001) compared to packs with no flavor descriptor. Compared to packs with no color, pink and purple packs were more likely to be perceived as containing a flavor (β = 0.11, p < .001), and were rated more favorably on taste (β = 0.17, p < .001), smell (β = 0.15, p < .001), and appeal (β = 0.16, p < .001). While warnings on packs decreased favorable perceptions of product taste (pictorial: β = -0.07, p = .03) and smell (text-only: β = -0.08, p = .01; pictorial: β = -0.09, p = .007), warnings did not moderate the effects of flavor descriptor or color. Conclusions To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantitative evidence that cigarillo packaging alters consumers’ cognitive responses, and warnings on packs do not suffice to overcome the effects of product packaging. The findings support efforts at federal, state, and local levels to prohibit flavor descriptors and their associated product flavoring in non-cigarette products such as cigarillos, along with new data that supports restrictions on flavor cues and colors."
https://openalex.org/W2780310278,"Maintaining situational awareness of what is happening within a computer network is challenging, not only because the behaviour happens within machines, but also because data traffic speeds and volumes are beyond human ability to process. Visualisation techniques are widely used to present information about network traffic dynamics. Although they provide operators with an overall view and specific information about particular traffic or attacks on the network, they often still fail to represent the events in an understandable way. Also, because they require visual attention they are not well suited to continuous monitoring scenarios in which network administrators must carry out other tasks. Here we present SoNSTAR (Sonification of Networks for SiTuational AwaReness), a real-time sonification system for monitoring computer networks to support network administrators’ situational awareness. SoNSTAR provides an auditory representation of all the TCP/IP traffic within a network based on the different traffic flows between between network hosts. A user study showed that SoNSTAR raises situational awareness levels by enabling operators to understand network behaviour and with the benefit of lower workload demands (as measured by the NASA TLX method) than visual techniques. SoNSTAR identifies network traffic features by inspecting the status flags of TCP/IP packet headers. Combinations of these features define particular traffic events which are mapped to recorded sounds to generate a soundscape that represents the real-time status of the network traffic environment. The sequence, timing, and loudness of the different sounds allow the network to be monitored and anomalous behaviour to be detected without the need to continuously watch a monitor screen."
https://openalex.org/W2799692018,"Expertise in music has been investigated for decades and the results have been applied not only in composition, performance and music education, but also in understanding brain plasticity in a larger context. Several studies have revealed a strong connection between auditory and motor processes and listening to and performing music, and music imagination. Recently, as a logical next step in music and movement, the cognitive and affective neurosciences have been directed towards expertise in dance. To understand the versatile and overlapping processes during artistic stimuli, such as music and dance, it is necessary to study them with continuous naturalistic stimuli. Thus, we used long excerpts from the contemporary dance piece Carmen presented with and without music to professional dancers, musicians, and laymen in an EEG laboratory. We were interested in the cortical phase synchrony within each participant group over several frequency bands during uni- and multimodal processing. Dancers had strengthened theta and gamma synchrony during music relative to silence and silent dance, whereas the presence of music decreased systematically the alpha and beta synchrony in musicians. Laymen were the only group of participants with significant results related to dance. Future studies are required to understand whether these results are related to some other factor (such as familiarity to the stimuli), or if our results reveal a new point of view to dance observation and expertise."
https://openalex.org/W2801837099,"Introduction To develop high-quality and safe healthcare, a good safety culture is an important feature of healthcare-providing structures. The objective of this study was to analyze the qualitative data of the comments section of a Hospital Survey on Patient Safety (HSOPS) questionnaire to clarify the answers given to the closed questions. Method Using the original data from a cross-sectional survey of 5,064 employees at a single university hospital in France, we conducted a qualitative study by analyzing the comments of a HSOPS survey and conducting in-depth interviews with 19 healthcare providers. We submitted the comments and the interviews to a thematic analysis. Results A total of 3,978 questionnaires were returned, with 247 comments collected. The qualitative analysis identified several structural failures. The main categories of the open comments were concordant with the lowest dimension scores found in the quantitative analysis. The most frequently reported failures were related to the staffing and hospital management support dimensions. The healthcare professionals perceived the lack of resources, including understaffing, as the major barrier to the development of a patient safety culture. Concrete organizational issues related to hospital handoffs and risk coordination were identified, such as transfers from the emergency departments and the lack of feedback following self-reporting of incidents. Conclusion The analysis of the open comments complemented the HSOPS scores, increasing the level of detail in the description of the hospital’s patient safety culture. Combined with a classical quantitative approach used in HSOPS-based surveys, the qualitative analysis of open comments is useful to identify organizational weaknesses within the hospital."
https://openalex.org/W2802570083,"Mutations in the dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) gene cause dentinogenesis imperfecta. After synthesis, DSPP is proteolytically processed into NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments. The NH2-terminal fragment of DSPP is highly glycosylated but not phosphorylated, whereas the COOH-terminal fragment (named ""dentin phosphoprotein"" or ""DPP"") is highly phosphorylated but not glycosylated. These two fragments are believed to perform distinct roles in dentin formation. To analyze the functions of DPP in dentinogenesis, we created ""Dspp-/-;DPP Tg mice"", which expressed transgenic DPP driven by a Type I collagen promoter but lacked the endogenous Dspp gene. We characterized the dentin of the Dspp-/-;DPP Tg mice using X-ray radiography, histology, scanning electron microscopy, double fluorochrome labeling, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Micro-computed tomography analyses revealed that at postnatal 6 months, the transgenic expression of DPP increased the dentin thickness of the Dspp-null mice by 97.1% and restored the dentin material density by 29.5%. Histological analyses showed that the Dspp-null mice manifested an abnormal widening of the predentin while the predentin in Dspp-/-;DPP Tg mice was narrower than in the Dspp-null mice. Scanning electron microscopy analyses showed that the dentinal tubules in the Dspp-/-;DPP Tg mice were better organized than in the Dspp-null mice. The double fluorochrome labeling analyses demonstrated that the dentin mineral deposition rate in the Dspp-/-;DPP Tg mice was significantly improved compared to that in the Dspp-null mice. These findings indicate that the transgenic expression of DPP partially rescued the dentin defects of the DSPP-null mice, suggesting that DPP may promote dentin formation and that the coordinated actions between DPP and the NH2-terminal fragment of DSPP may be necessary for dentinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2799572793,"Background Both under- and over-nutrition may occur among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and impact on the course of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and its management due to the close interaction between immunity and nutrition. We investigated occurrence of undernutrition, excess weight and lipid abnormalities among antiretroviral naïve HIV-infected adults in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study on 594 antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve HIV-infected adults was conducted in four hospitals in Addis Ababa from February to September 2013. Hematological parameters (CD4+ T cell count and hemoglobin concentration), fasting serum glucose, total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were determined. Information on socio-demographic, anthropometric and World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stages was collected from patient clinical records, and triangulated by structured questionnaire. Height and weight measurements were taken and body mass index (BMI), undernutrition (BMI <18.5 kg/m2) and excess weight (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) determined. Statistical comparisons were made to identify significant factors associated with nutritional status and lipid profiles. Results The prevalence of undernutrition was 15.1%, and the prevalence of excess weight was 22.1%, including 5.4% who were obese. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia was 16.6% and it was higher in women (18.9%) than in men (11.0%) (p<0.05). However, the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia was 29.8%. There was significant positive Spearman correlation between CD4+ T cell count and serum TC (r = 0.210, p<0.001), but no correlation was observed between CD4+ T cell count and TG (r = -0.007, p>0.05). Age categories 30–39 and 40–79, and WHO clinical stages III/IV for undernutrition; age categories 30–39 and 40–79, WHO clinical stages III/IV and TC ≥200 mg/dL for excess weight; and being female, age categories 30–39 and 40–79, and hypertriglyceridemia for hypercholesterolemia were found to be independent predictors by binomial logistic regression analysis. Conclusion Undernutrition, excess weight, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia were variably prevalent in ART naïve HIV-infected populations. This emphasizes the need for targeted nutritional programs as an integral part of HIV/AIDS care. Lipid levels need to be monitored regularly in patients whether on or off ART. In addition, improvement on household income and positive change in lifestyle and/or nutritional treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality are necessary interventions in HIV/AIDs patient management."
https://openalex.org/W2800733493,"Background Meningococcal infection starts with colonisation of the upper respiratory tract. Mucosal immunity is important for protection against acquisition and subsequent meningococcal carriage. In this study, we assessed salivary antibody levels against meningococcal serogroup A (MenA), W (MenW) and Y (MenY) after vaccination with a quadrivalent MenACWY conjugated vaccine. We also compared salivary meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) antibody levels after monovalent MenC and quadrivalent MenACWY conjugated vaccination. Methods Healthy participants, who had received MenC conjugate vaccine between 14 months and 3 years of age, received a (booster) MenC or MenACWY vaccination at age 10–15 years. MenA-, MenC-, MenW- and MenY-polysaccharide (PS) specific IgG and IgA levels in saliva and serum and PS specific secretory component levels in saliva were measured using the fluorescent-bead-based multiplex immunoassay. Results MenACYW vaccination increased salivary PS-specific IgA (2-fold) and IgG levels(>10-fold) for MenA, MenY, and MenW. After one year, salivary IgA levels had returned to baseline levels. Both vaccines induced an increase in salivary MenC-PS specific IgA (>3-fold) and IgG (>100-fold), with higher levels after MenC as compared to MenACWY vaccination. The antibody decay rate of MenC in saliva between one month and one year was similar for both vaccines. The overall correlation between serum and saliva IgA levels was low (R = 0.39, R = 0.58, R = 0.31, and R = 0.36 for MenA, MenC, MenW and MenY, respectively). Serogroup-PS specific IgG levels between serum and saliva correlated better (R ranged from 0.51 to 0.88). Conclusions Both primary (MenA, MenY, and MenW) and booster (MenC) parenteral meningococcal conjugate vaccination induced high salivary antibody levels. The strong correlation for MenC, MenW and MenY between saliva and serum IgG levels indicates that saliva might be used as a reliable tool to measure vaccine responses after both primary and booster meningococcal vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2802395967,"Anger is considered a unique high-arousal and approach-related negative emotion. The influence of individual differences in trait anger on the processing of visual stimuli is relevant to questions about emotional processing and remains to be explored. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we explored the neural responses to standardized images, selected based on valence and arousal ratings in a group of men with high trait anger compared to those with normative to low anger scores (controls). Results show increased activation in the left-lateralized ventral fronto-parietal attention network to unpleasant images by individuals with high trait anger. There was also a group by arousal interaction in the left thalamus/pulvinar such that individuals with high trait anger had increased pulvinar activation to the high-arousal (versus low arousal) unpleasant images as compared to controls. Thus, individual differences in trait anger in men are associated with brain regions subserving executive attentional and sensory integration during the processing of unpleasant emotional stimuli, particularly to high arousal images."
https://openalex.org/W2800516277,"An increasing number of monoclonal antibodies and derivatives such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are of the IgG1 and IgG4 isotype with distinct structural and functional properties. In cases where antibody-mediated cytotoxicity is not desired, IgG4 is often used, as its Fc region is relatively poor at inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. IgG4 ADCs with highly cytotoxic drugs against proliferating target cells but which lack or have diminished antibody effector functions against quiescent cells may have a favorable safety profile compared to IgG1. Another unique property of the IgG4 subclass is the capability to exchange half antibodies in vivo creating randomly bispecific antibodies. To investigate the functional properties of process-derived antibody species, and determine the influence of shuffling on the therapeutic efficacy, several model antibodies on the basis of the anti-CD138 antibody-drug conjugate BT062 (Indatuximab ravtansine) were generated: (I) A wild type nBT062, (II) a stable nBT062 comprising mutations to prevent half-antibody exchange, (III) a half nBT062 lacking covalent binding between two heavy chains and (IV) a stabilized, bispecific nBT062-natalizumab antibody with a second, monovalent specificity against CD49d. All nBT062 model variants were capable of CD138-specific binding and antigen-mediated internalization into cells. Furthermore, all nBT062 models inhibited tumor growth in vitro after conjugation with the maytansinoid DM4. The in vivo effects of the different molecular variants were assessed in the MAXF1322 xenograft model. The bispecific nBT062-natalizumab-DM4 demonstrated the least efficacy and was only moderately active even without the co-administration of a human IgG preparation. Wild type, stable and half nBT062-DM4 models demonstrated great anti-tumor activities. The efficacy of wild type and half nBT062-DM4 was reduced in the presence of IgG, while stable nBT062-DM4 was only marginally influenced. These pre-clinical data demonstrate the advantage of introducing half-antibody exchange-preventing mutations into therapeutic IgG4-based antibody drug-conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W2800939740,"Cell-substrate adhesions are essential for various physiological processes, including embryonic development and maintenance of organ functions. Hemidesmosomes (HDs) are multiprotein complexes that attach epithelial cells to the basement membrane. Formation and remodeling of HDs are dependent on the surrounding mechanical environment; however, the upstream signaling mechanisms are not well understood. We recently reported that Solo (also known as ARHGEF40), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor targeting RhoA, binds to keratin8/18 (K8/K18) intermediate filaments, and that their interaction is important for force-induced actin and keratin cytoskeletal reorganization. In this study, we show that Solo co-precipitates with an HD protein, β4-integrin. Co-precipitation assays revealed that the central region (amino acids 330–1057) of Solo binds to the C-terminal region (1451–1752) of β4-integrin. Knockdown of Solo significantly suppressed HD formation in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells. Similarly, knockdown of K18 or treatment with Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), suppressed HD formation. As Solo knockdown or Y-27632 treatment is known to disorganize K8/K18 filaments, these results suggest that Solo is involved in HD formation by regulating K8/K18 filament organization via the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway. We also showed that knockdown of Solo impairs acinar formation in MCF10A cells cultured in 3D Matrigel. In addition, Solo accumulated at the site of traction force generation in 2D-cultured MCF10A cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Solo plays a crucial role in HD formation and acinar development in epithelial cells by regulating mechanical force-induced RhoA activation and keratin filament organization."
https://openalex.org/W2801389153,"Background Water level management has been suggested as a potential tool to reduce malaria around large reservoirs. However, no field-based test has been conducted to assess the effect of water level management on mosquito larval abundance in African settings. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of water level drawdown rates on mosquito larval abundance. Methods Twelve experimental dams were constructed on the foreshore of the Koka Dam in Ethiopia. These were grouped into four daily water drawdown treatments, each with three replicates: no water-level drawdown (Group 1; Control), 10 mm.d-1 (Group 2), 15 mm.d-1 (Group 3) and 20 mm.d-1 (Group 4). Larval sampling was conducted weekly for a period of 6 weeks each in the main malaria transmission season (October to November 2013) and subsequent dry season (February to March 2014). Larval densities were compared among treatments over time using repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Results A total of 284 Anopheles mosquito larvae were collected from the experimental dams during the study period. Most (63.4%; n = 180) were collected during the main malaria transmission season while the remaining (36.6%; n = 104) were collected during the dry season. Larvae comprised four Anopheles species, dominated by Anopheles arabiensis (48.1% of total larval samples; n = 136) and An. pharoensis (33.2%; n = 94). Mean larval density was highest in control treatment dams with stable water levels throughout the study, and decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing water drawdown rates in both seasons. During the main transmission season, anopheline larval density was generally lower by 30%, 70% and 84% in Groups 2, Group 3 and Group 4, respectively, compared with the control dams (Group 1). In the dry season, larval density was reduced by 45%, 70% and 84% in Groups 2, Group 3 and Group 4, respectively, when compared to the control dams. Conclusion Increased water drawdown rates were associated with lower mosquito larval abundance. Water level management could thus serve as a potential control measure for malaria vectors around reservoirs by regulating the persistence of shallow shoreline breeding habitats. Dam operators and water resource managers should consider incorporating water level management as a malaria control mechanism into routine dam operations to manage the risk of malaria transmission to human populations around reservoirs."
https://openalex.org/W2800328458,"Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is a long-form member of the pentraxin family of proteins that has been studied in inflammatory diseases and in various organs. We found that PTX3 protects kidney cells during ischemia and proinflammatory acute kidney injury. The aim of this study was to develop an in vitro experimental model of acute kidney injury and to analyze the protective mechanism of exogenous recombinant PTX3. In this study, cells of the HK-2 renal tubular cell line were treated with a calcium ionophore (A23187), which induced injury by increasing intracellular calcium concentrations and inducing calpain activity and the generation of reactive oxygen species. Exposure of cells to PTX3 significantly attenuated these effects. In addition, the activity of caspase-3 and PARP-1 were decreased in ischemic cells exposed to exogenous recombinant PTX3. PTX3 stabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential and suppressed apoptosis, resulting in the protection of renal tubular cells from ischemic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2801079395,"The transfer of seaweeds from subtidal bottoms to nearby intertidal rocky shores is a common but often overlooked phenomenon. Freshly detached seaweeds often represent critical trophic subsidies for herbivores living in upper-shore rocky intertidal areas, such as the marine snail Diloma nigerrima. This species relies on three species of seaweeds for food and displays feeding strategies to deal with a resource that is scarce and at times unpredictable. This study focused on the nutritional quality of freshly detached algae (Durvillaea antarctica, Lessonia spicata and Lessonia trabeculata) and measured Diloma nigerrima’s algal consumption rates in trials with and without choice. Absorption efficiency and growth of individual snails fed on each alga were also measured. Durvillaea antarctica had the highest nutritional quality and was the most consumed algae in both single and multiple-choice trials. Absorption efficiency was also highest for D. antarctica but growth rates of snails fed with this species were similar to those fed with the other algae. Combined, these results suggest that D. nigerrima has the ability to discriminate among seaweeds based on their nutritional quality. A potential increase in oxygen uptake when D. nigerrima is consuming the preferred food item is also proposed as a plausible hypothesis to explain the mismatch between snails’ preference and growth rate. These results aim to guide further studies on trophic subsidies and their role in coastal systems."
https://openalex.org/W2800163904,"Practice-changing culturing techniques of hepatocytes are highly required to increase their differentiation. Previously, we found that human liver cell lines HepaRG and C3A acquire higher functionality and increased mitochondrial biogenesis when cultured in the AMC-Bioartificial liver (BAL). Dynamic medium flow (DMF) is one of the major contributors to this stimulatory effect. Recently, we found that DMF-culturing by shaking of HepaRG monolayers resulted in higher mitochondrial biogenesis. Here we further investigated the effect of DMF-culturing on energy metabolism and hepatic functionality of HepaRG and C3A monolayers. HepaRG and C3A DMF-monolayers were incubated with orbital shaking at 60 rpm during the differentiation phase, while control monolayers were maintained statically. Subsequently, energy metabolism and hepatic functionality were compared between static and DMF-cultures. DMF-culturing of HepaRG cells substantially increased hepatic differentiation; transcript levels of hepatic structural genes and hepatic transcription regulators were increased up to 15-fold (Cytochrome P450 3A4) and nuclear translocation of hepatic transcription factor CEBPα was stimulated. Accordingly, hepatic functions were positively affected, including ammonia elimination, urea production, bile acid production, and CYP3A4 activity. DMF-culturing shifted energy metabolism from aerobic glycolysis towards oxidative phosphorylation, as indicated by a decline in lactate production and glucose consumption, and an increase in oxygen consumption. Similarly, DMF-culturing increased mitochondrial energy metabolism and hepatic functionality of C3A cells. In conclusion, simple shaking of monolayer cultures substantially improves mitochondrial energy metabolism and hepatic differentiation of human liver cell lines. This practice-changing culture method may prove to prolong the in-vitro maintenance of primary hepatocytes and increase hepatic differentiation of stem cells."

Given this precarious situation, it is essential to identify factors, such as stress preconditioning, that interfere with the efficacy of phosphine fumigation. We used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to test the effect of pre-exposure to heat and cold shock, UV and gamma irradiation on phosphine potency. Heat shock significantly increased tolerance to phosphine by 3-fold in wild-type nematodes, a process that was dependent on the master regulator of the heat shock response, HSF-1. Heat shock did not, however, increase the resistance of a strain carrying the phosphine resistance mutation, dld-1(wr4), and cold shock did not alter the response to phosphine of either strain. Pretreatment with the LD50 of UV (18 J cm-2) did not alter phosphine tolerance in wild-type nematodes, but the LD50 (33 J cm-2) of the phosphine resistant strain (dld-1(wr4)) doubled the level of resistance. In addition, exposure to a mild dose of gamma radiation (200 Gy) elevated the phosphine tolerance by ~2-fold in both strains."
https://openalex.org/W2800144478,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most commonly used euthanasia agents for mice, yet it is highly aversive and nociceptive. Inert gases are a possible alternative, however there are qualitative reports of seizures resulting from exposure. Here we evaluate epileptiform activity caused by inert gases (N2, He, Ar and Xe) and CO2 in mice chronically instrumented for EEG/EMG undergoing single-gas euthanasia. We found that N2, He and Ar caused epileptiform activity in all animals, CO2 in half of animals and no epileptiform activity produced by Xe. Atmospheric O2 concentrations at epileptiform activity onset were significantly higher for CO2 than for all other gases and occurred soon after loss of motion, whereas N2 and Ar epileptiform activity occurred at cessation of neocortical activity. Helium caused the longest epileptiform activity and these commenced significantly before isoelectric EEG. We did not detect any epileptiform activity during active behaviour. Taken together, these results demonstrate that whilst epileptiform activity from inert gases and particularly Ar and N2 are more prevalent than for CO2, their occurrence at the onset of an isoelectric EEG is unlikely to impact on the welfare of the animal. Epileptiform activity from these gases should not preclude them from further investigation as euthanasia agents. The genesis of epileptiform activity from CO2 is unlikely to result from hypoxia as with the inert gases. Helium caused epileptiform activity before cessation of neocortical activity and for a longer duration and is therefore less suitable as an alternative to CO2."
https://openalex.org/W2800613428,"The Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT) is the most widely used measure of overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM). The AMT appears to have good psychometric properties, but more research is needed on the influence and applicability of individual cue words in different languages and populations. To date, no studies have evaluated its usefulness as a measure of OMG in Spanish or older populations. This work aims to analyze the applicability of the AMT in young and older Spanish samples. We administered a Spanish version of the AMT to samples of young (N = 520) and older adults (N = 155). We conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), item response theory-based analysis (IRT) and differential item functioning (DIF). Results confirm the one-factor structure for the AMT. IRT analysis suggests that both groups find the AMT easy given that they generally perform well, and that it is more precise in individuals who score low on memory specificity. DIF analysis finds three items differ in their functioning depending on age group. This differential functioning of these items affects the overall AMT scores and, thus, they should be excluded from the AMT in studies comparing young and older samples. We discuss the possible implications of the samples and cue words used."
https://openalex.org/W2802017227,"Objective In previous work we have developed a fast sequence that focusses on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) based on the long T2 of CSF. By processing the data obtained with this CSF MRI sequence, brain parenchymal volume (BPV) and intracranial volume (ICV) can be automatically obtained. The aim of this study was to assess the precision of the BPV and ICV measurements of the CSF MRI sequence and to validate the CSF MRI sequence by comparison with 3D T1-based brain segmentation methods. Materials and methods Ten healthy volunteers (2 females; median age 28 years) were scanned (3T MRI) twice with repositioning in between. The scan protocol consisted of a low resolution (LR) CSF sequence (0:57min), a high resolution (HR) CSF sequence (3:21min) and a 3D T1-weighted sequence (6:47min). Data of the HR 3D-T1-weighted images were downsampled to obtain LR T1-weighted images (reconstructed imaging time: 1:59 min). Data of the CSF MRI sequences was automatically segmented using in-house software. The 3D T1-weighted images were segmented using FSL (5.0), SPM12 and FreeSurfer (5.3.0). Results The mean absolute differences for BPV and ICV between the first and second scan for CSF LR (BPV/ICV: 12±9/7±4cc) and CSF HR (5±5/4±2cc) were comparable to FSL HR (9±11/19±23cc), FSL LR (7±4, 6±5cc), FreeSurfer HR (5±3/14±8cc), FreeSurfer LR (9±8, 12±10cc), and SPM HR (5±3/4±7cc), and SPM LR (5±4, 5±3cc). The correlation between the measured volumes of the CSF sequences and that measured by FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM HR and LR was very good (all Pearson’s correlation coefficients >0.83, R2 .67–.97). The results from the downsampled data and the high-resolution data were similar. Conclusion Both CSF MRI sequences have a precision comparable to, and a very good correlation with established 3D T1-based automated segmentations methods for the segmentation of BPV and ICV. However, the short imaging time of the fast CSF MRI sequence is superior to the 3D T1 sequence on which segmentation with established methods is performed."
https://openalex.org/W2802277908,"This article presents and investigates performance of a series of robust multivariate nonparametric tests for detection of location shift between two multivariate samples in randomized controlled trials. The tests are built upon robust estimators of distribution locations (medians, Hodges-Lehmann estimators, and an extended U statistic) with both unscaled and scaled versions. The nonparametric tests are robust to outliers and do not assume that the two samples are drawn from multivariate normal distributions. Bootstrap and permutation approaches are introduced for determining the p-values of the proposed test statistics. Simulation studies are conducted and numerical results are reported to examine performance of the proposed statistical tests. The numerical results demonstrate that the robust multivariate nonparametric tests constructed from the Hodges-Lehmann estimators are more efficient than those based on medians and the extended U statistic. The permutation approach can provide a more stringent control of Type I error and is generally more powerful than the bootstrap procedure. The proposed robust nonparametric tests are applied to detect multivariate distributional difference between the intervention and control groups in the Thai Healthy Choices study and examine the intervention effect of a four-session motivational interviewing-based intervention developed in the study to reduce risk behaviors among youth living with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2799617511,"Objective We explored the factors associated with disclosure of men who have with sex with men (MSM) behaviors and HIV-positive status among HIV-positive MSM in Nanjing, China. Methods Social network analysis and epidemiological methods were combined in this pilot study. Information about participants’ (egos’) characteristics and behaviors and their social network members (alters) were collected through interview-administered questionnaires. General estimating equation logistic regression analysis was applied in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Results Eighty-seven HIV-positive MSM participated. Their mean age was 35.9 ±13.81years. They were more likely to disclose their MSM behavior to their friends [adjust Odds Ratio (AOR) = 6.43, 95% confidence interval (CI):3.08–13.42] or to the social network members who were not heterosexual [AOR = 4.40, 95%CI: 2.17–8.91]. Being participants’ friends [AOR = 5.16, 95%CI: 2.03–13.10] or family members [AOR = 6.22, 95%CI: 2.52–15.33] was significantly associated with HIV-positive status disclosure. Conclusion HIV-positive MSM tended to disclose their MSM behaviors and HIV positive status to close friends, family members or other individuals who were HIV-positive, engaging in MSM behavior, or both. Consequently, it will be an effective way to implement HIV prevention and intervention strategies in both MSM population and their trusted social networks."
https://openalex.org/W2800683352,"Pyridoxamine (PM) is a promising drug candidate for treating various chronic conditions/diseases in which oxidative stress and carbonyl compounds are important factors affecting pathogenicity. These abilities of PM are mainly attributed to its inhibition of advanced glycation and lipoxidation end product formation, by scavenging reactive carbonyl species. PM might therefore prevent protein damage from lipid hydroperoxide-derived aldehydes such as 4-oxo-2(E)-nonenal (ONE) and 4-hydroxy-2(E)-nonenal (HNE) by trapping them. It was previously reported that PM reacts with ONE to produce pyrrolo-1,3-oxazine (PO8) through the formation of pyrido-1,3-oxazine (PO1/PO2). In this study, we found that ONE and HNE yield an identical product containing a pyrrole ring (PO7, PH2) upon reaction with PM. The structure of PO7/PH2 was shown by LC-MS and NMR analyses to be 1-(2-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-3-methylpyridin-4-ylmethyl)-2-pentylpyrrole. PO1, PO7/PH2, and PO8 were the main stable PM-ONE/HNE adducts. In the incubation of human serum albumin (HSA) with ONE or HNE, Lys residues provided the most favorable modification sites for both aldehydes, and the number of HNE-modified sites was higher than that of ONE-modified sites. When HSA was allowed to react with a linoleic acid hydroperoxide in the presence of ascorbic acid, ONE modified more residues (10 Lys, 3 His, 2 Arg) than did HNE (8 His, 2 Lys), indicating the relative reactivity of aldehydes towards amino acid residues. Upon treatment with increasing concentrations of PM, the concentrations of ONE-modified HSA peptides, but not of HNE-modified peptides, were reduced significantly and dose-dependently. Concomitantly, the formation of PM-ONE adducts increased in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition effect of PM was also confirmed in the cell system subjected to oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that PM can inhibit lipid hydroperoxide-derived damage to proteins by trapping ONE preferentially, and the resulting PM-ONE adducts can be used as a dosimeter for ONE production to determine the levels of lipid peroxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2799631129,"Faces are among the most relevant social stimuli revealing an encounter's identity and actual emotional state. Deficits in facial recognition may be an early sign of cognitive decline leading to social deficits. The main objective of the present study is to investigate if individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment show recognition deficits in facial identity. Thirty-seven individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, multiple-domain (15 female; age: 75±8 yrs.) and forty-one healthy volunteers (24 female; age 71±6 yrs.) participated. All participants completed a human portrait memory test presenting unfamiliar faces with happy and angry emotional expressions. Five and thirty minutes later, old and new neutral faces were presented, and discrimination sensitivity (d') and response bias (C) were assessed as signal detection parameters of cued facial identity recognition. Memory performance was lower in amnestic mild cognitive impairment as compared to control subjects, mainly because of an altered response bias towards an increased false alarm rate (favoring false OLD ascription of NEW items). In both groups, memory performance declined between the early and later testing session, and was always better for acquired happy than angry faces. Facial identity memory is impaired in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Liberalization of the response bias may reflect a socially motivated compensatory mechanism maintaining an almost identical recognition hit rate of OLD faces in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2800553837,"Background Initial administration of ≥60% nitrous oxide (N2O) to rats evokes hypothermia, but after repeated administrations the gas instead evokes hyperthermia. This sign reversal is driven mainly by increased heat production. To determine whether rats will behaviorally oppose or assist the development of hyperthermia, we previously performed thermal gradient testing. Inhalation of N2O at ≥60% causes rats to select cooler ambient temperatures both during initial administrations and during subsequent administrations in which the hyperthermic state exists. Thus, an available behavioral response opposes (but does not completely prevent) the acquired hyperthermia that develops over repeated high-concentration N2O administrations. However, recreational and clinical uses of N2O span a wide range of concentrations. Therefore, we sought to determine the thermoregulatory adaptations to chronic N2O administration over a wide range of concentrations. Methods This study had two phases. In the first phase we adapted rats to twelve 3-h N2O administrations at either 0%, 15%, 30%, 45%, 60% or 75% N2O (n = 12 per group); outcomes were core temperature (via telemetry) and heat production (via respirometry). In the second phase, we used a thermal gradient (range 8°C—38°C) to assess each adapted group’s thermal preference, core temperature and locomotion on a single occasion during N2O inhalation at the assigned concentration. Results In phase 1, repeated N2O administrations led to dose related hyperthermic and hypermetabolic states during inhalation of ≥45% N2O compared to controls (≥ 30% N2O compared to baseline). In phase 2, rats in these groups selected cooler ambient temperatures during N2O inhalation but still developed some hyperthermia. However, a concentration-related increase of locomotion was evident in the gradient, and theoretical calculations and regression analyses both suggest that locomotion contributed to the residual hyperthermia. Conclusions Acquired N2O hyperthermia in rats is remarkably robust, and occurs even despite the availability of ambient temperatures that might fully counter the hyperthermia. Increased locomotion in the gradient may contribute to hyperthermia. Our data are consistent with an allostatic dis-coordination of autonomic and behavioral thermoregulatory mechanisms during drug administration. Our results have implications for research on N2O abuse as well as research on the role of allostasis in drug addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2800952576,"External inputs to agricultural systems can overcome latent soil and climate constraints on production, while contributing to greenhouse gas emissions from fertilizer and water management inefficiencies. Proper crop selection for a given region can lessen the need for irrigation and timing of N fertilizer application with crop N demand can potentially reduce N2O emissions and increase N use efficiency while reducing residual soil N and N leaching. However, increased variability in precipitation is an expectation of climate change and makes predicting biomass and gas flux responses to management more challenging. We used the DayCent model to test hypotheses about input intensity controls on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) productivity and greenhouse gas emissions in the southwestern United States under future climate. Sorghum had been previously parameterized for DayCent, but an inverse-modeling via parameter estimation method significantly improved model validation to field data. Aboveground production and N2O flux were more responsive to N additions than irrigation, but simulations with future climate produced lower values for sorghum than current climate. We found positive interactions between irrigation at increased N application for N2O and CO2 fluxes. Extremes in sorghum production under future climate were a function of biomass accumulation trajectories related to daily soil water and mineral N. Root C inputs correlated with soil organic C pools, but overall soil C declined at the decadal scale under current weather while modest gains were simulated under future weather. Scaling biomass and N2O fluxes by unit N and water input revealed that sorghum can be productive without irrigation, and the effect of irrigating crops is difficult to forecast when precipitation is variable within the growing season. These simulation results demonstrate the importance of understanding sorghum production and greenhouse gas emissions at daily scales when assessing annual and decadal-scale management decisions' effects on aspects of arid and semiarid agroecosystem biogeochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2801138683,"This study aimed to examine the incidence of the oculocardiac reflex during a non-invasive intracranial pressure measurement when gradual external pressure was applied to the orbital tissues and eye.Patients (n = 101) and healthy volunteers (n = 56) aged 20-75 years who underwent a non-invasive intracranial pressure measurement were included in this retrospective oculocardiac reflex analysis. Prespecified thresholds greater than a 10% or 20% decrease in the heart rate from baseline were used to determine the incidence of the oculocardiac reflex.None of the subjects had a greater than 20% decrease in heart rate from baseline. Four subjects had a greater than 10% decrease in heart rate from baseline, representing 0.9% of the total pressure steps. Three of these subjects were healthy volunteers, and one was a glaucoma patient.The incidence of the oculocardiac reflex during a non-invasive intracranial pressure measurement procedure was very low and not associated with any clinically relevant effects."
https://openalex.org/W2800736521,"Uganda is working to increase voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) to prevent HIV infection. To support VMMC quality improvement, this study compared three methods of disseminating information to facilities on how to improve VMMC quality: M-providing a written manual; MH-providing the manual plus a handover meeting in which clinicians shared advice on implementing key changes and participated in group discussion; and MHC-manual, handover meeting, and three site visits to the facility in which a coach provided individualized guidance and mentoring on improvement. We determined the different effects these had on compliance with indicators of quality of care.This controlled pre-post intervention study randomized health facility groups to receive M, MH, or MHC. Observations of VMMCs performance determined compliance with quality indicators. Intervention costs per patient receiving VMMC were used in a decision-tree cost-effectiveness model to calculate the incremental cost per additional patient treated to compliance with indicators of informed consent, history taking, anesthesia administration, and post-operative instructions.The most intensive method (MHC) cost $28.83 per patient and produced the biggest gains in history taking (35% improvement), anesthesia administration (20% improvement), and post-operative instructions (37% improvement). The least intensive method (M; $1.13 per patient) was most efficient because it produced small gains for a very low cost. The handover meeting (MH) was the most expensive among the three interventions but did not have a corresponding positive effect on quality.Health workers in facilities that received the VMMC improvement manual and participated in the handover meeting and coaching visits showed more improvement in VMMC quality indicators than those in the other two intervention groups. Providing the manual alone cost the least but was also the least effective in achieving improvements. The MHC intervention is recommended for broader implementation to improve VMMC quality in Uganda."
https://openalex.org/W2802817956,"We aimed to assess whether patients colonized with certain organisms in the genitourinary tract would have greater urinary tract infection (UTI) risk during the post-transplantation period, and whether information on the perioperatively colonized organisms may help identify the causal organisms during early UTI.We retrospectively reviewed the culture results of preoperative urine, preoperative urethral swab, and postoperative urinary catheter tip specimens of 420 renal transplant recipients. The colonization status was compared to the culture results during the first UTI episode within 6 months after transplantation.Twenty six (6.2%) patients developed early UTI, and the presence of common uropathogens in the perioperative genitourinary specimen was positively associated with a higher early UTI risk odds ratio [OR], 3.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44 to 7.24; P = 0.003). However, the actual causal organism during UTI was observed perioperatively only in 15 patients (40.5%). Neither perioperative colonization nor early UTI was associated with subsequent acute cellular rejection or graft failure.Renal transplantation patients who were colonized with common uropathogens were more likely to develop early UTI. However, the usefulness of the culture results of perioperative colonizers in predicting the causal organism during early UTI seems limited due to the low concordance rate."
