Somatic gene editing by sequence-specific nucleases offers new options for restoring the DMD reading frame, resulting in expression of a shortened but largely functional dystrophin protein. Here, we validated this approach in a pig model of DMD lacking exon 52 of DMD (DMDΔ52), as well as in a corresponding patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell model. In DMDΔ52 pigs1, intramuscular injection of adeno-associated viral vectors of serotype 9 carrying an intein-split Cas9 (ref. 2) and a pair of guide RNAs targeting sequences flanking exon 51 (AAV9-Cas9-gE51) induced expression of a shortened dystrophin (DMDΔ51-52) and improved skeletal muscle function. Moreover, systemic application of AAV9-Cas9-gE51 led to widespread dystrophin expression in muscle, including diaphragm and heart, prolonging survival and reducing arrhythmogenic vulnerability. Similarly, in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myoblasts and cardiomyocytes of a patient lacking DMDΔ52, AAV6-Cas9-g51-mediated excision of exon 51 restored dystrophin expression and amelioreate skeletal myotube formation as well as abnormal cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling and arrhythmogenic susceptibility. The ability of Cas9-mediated exon excision to improve DMD pathology in these translational models paves the way for new treatment approaches in patients with this devastating disease."
https://openalex.org/W3002719183,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited disorder of phagocytic cells1,2. We report the initial results of nine severely affected X-linked CGD (X-CGD) patients who received ex vivo autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-based lentiviral gene therapy following myeloablative conditioning in first-in-human studies (trial registry nos. NCT02234934 and NCT01855685). The primary objectives were to assess the safety and evaluate the efficacy and stability of biochemical and functional reconstitution in the progeny of engrafted cells at 12 months. The secondary objectives included the evaluation of augmented immunity against bacterial and fungal infection, as well as assessment of hematopoietic stem cell transduction and engraftment. Two enrolled patients died within 3 months of treatment from pre-existing comorbidities. At 12 months, six of the seven surviving patients demonstrated stable vector copy numbers (0.4–1.8 copies per neutrophil) and the persistence of 16–46% oxidase-positive neutrophils. There was no molecular evidence of either clonal dysregulation or transgene silencing. Surviving patients have had no new CGD-related infections, and six have been able to discontinue CGD-related antibiotic prophylaxis. The primary objective was met in six of the nine patients at 12 months follow-up, suggesting that autologous gene therapy is a promising approach for CGD patients. Initial results from phase I/II lentiviral gene therapy trials provide early evidence supporting its safety and efficacy in treating patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease."
https://openalex.org/W3003879696,"Previously, we demonstrated a strong correlation between the amplitude of human speech and the emission rate of micron-scale expiratory aerosol particles, which are believed to play a role in respiratory disease transmission. To further those findings, here we systematically investigate the effect of different 'phones' (the basic sound units of speech) on the emission of particles from the human respiratory tract during speech. We measured the respiratory particle emission rates of 56 healthy human volunteers voicing specific phones, both in isolation and in the context of a standard spoken text. We found that certain phones are associated with significantly higher particle production; for example, the vowel /i/ (need, sea) produces more particles than /ɑ/ (saw, hot) or /u/ (blue, mood), while disyllabic words including voiced plosive consonants (e.g., /d/, /b/, /g/) yield more particles than words with voiceless fricatives (e.g., /s/, /h/, /f/). These trends for discrete phones and words were corroborated by the time-resolved particle emission rates as volunteers read aloud from a standard text passage that incorporates a broad range of the phones present in spoken English. Our measurements showed that particle emission rates were positively correlated with the vowel content of a phrase; conversely, particle emission decreased during phrases with a high fraction of voiceless fricatives. Our particle emission data is broadly consistent with prior measurements of the egressive airflow rate associated with the vocalization of various phones that differ in voicing and articulation. These results suggest that airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens via speech aerosol particles could be modulated by specific phonetic characteristics of the language spoken by a given human population, along with other, more frequently considered epidemiological variables."
https://openalex.org/W3003958110,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts that constitute the major components of tumor microenvironment (TME) and play crucial roles in tumor development and metastasis. Here, we generated fibroblast-specific inducible focal adhesion kinase (FAK) knockout (cKO) mice in a breast cancer model to study potential role and mechanisms of FAK signaling in CAF to promote breast cancer metastasis in vivo. While not affecting primary tumor development and growth, FAK deletion significantly suppressed breast cancer metastasis in vivo. Analyses of CAFs derived from cKO mice as well as human CAFs showed that FAK is required for their activity to promote mammary tumor cell migration. We further showed that FAK ablation in CAFs decreased exosome functions to promote tumor cell migration and other activities, which could contribute to the reduced metastasis observed in cKO mice. Lastly, profiling of miRs from CAF exosomes showed alterations of several exosomal miRs in FAK-null CAFs, and further analysis suggested that miR-16 and miR-148a enriched in exosomes from FAK-null CAFs contribute to the reduced tumor cell activities and metastasis. Together, these results identify a new role for FAK signaling in CAFs that regulate their intercellular communication with tumor cells to promote breast cancer metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W3001913123,"Endosomal transport is essential for cellular organization and compartmentalization and cell-cell communication. Sorting endosomes provide a crossroads for various trafficking pathways and determine recycling, secretion or degradation of proteins. The organization of these processes requires membrane-tethering factors to coordinate Rab GTPase function with membrane fusion. Here, we report a conserved tethering platform that acts in the Rab11 recycling pathways at sorting endosomes, which we name factors for endosome recycling and Rab interactions (FERARI). The Rab-binding module of FERARI consists of Rab11FIP5 and rabenosyn-5/RABS-5, while the SNARE-interacting module comprises VPS45 and VIPAS39. Unexpectedly, the membrane fission protein EHD1 is also a FERARI component. Thus, FERARI appears to combine fusion activity through the SM protein VPS45 with pinching activity through EHD1 on SNX-1-positive endosomal membranes. We propose that coordination of fusion and pinching through a kiss-and-run mechanism drives cargo at endosomes into recycling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W3001070358,"Onion skin is a waste produced during onion bulb processing. Recent studies have reported that it contains large amounts of bioaccessible and bioavailable compounds thus it can be used to design of novel food products. The objective of the study was an attempt to substitute semolina with onion skin (OS) powder in pasta at 2.5, 5 and 7.5 g/100 g levels. The effects on the chemical composition, antioxidant potential, technological and sensory properties of the fortified pasta samples were evaluated compared with a control sample. Fortification with OS resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) improvement in nutritional properties, which was demonstrated by an increase in the content of dietary fibre, ash, total phenolic compounds, flavonoids content and antioxidant activity (FRAP and DPPH). Cooking loss increased with increasing levels of OS, however, all pasta samples were in the acceptable range (8 g/100 g). Onion skin incorporation decreased optimal cooking time, water solubility index and increase redness (a*), compared to the control sample. Results of sensory evaluation suggest that pasta, in which 2.5% of the flour was replaced by this plant component, showed the highest value of the ""overall quality"". Our study indicates that onion skin powder can be a potential alternative for the food industry to provide nutritional enriched pasta."
https://openalex.org/W3003882591,"Climate change is likely to increase the frequency of drought and more extreme precipitation events. The objectives of this study were i) to assess the impact of extended drought followed by heavy precipitation events on yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) under historical and future climate, and ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies (no-tillage and new cultivars) in mitigating impacts of increased frequencies of extreme events and warming. We used the validated SALUS crop model to simulate long-term maize and wheat yield and SOC changes of maize-soybean-wheat rotation cropping systems in the northern Midwest USA under conventional tillage and no-till for three climate change scenarios (one historical and two projected climates under the Representative Concentration Path (RCP) 4.5 and RCP6) and two precipitation changes (extreme precipitation occurring early or late season). Extended drought events caused additional yield reduction when they occurred later in the season (10–22% for maize and 5–13% for wheat) rather than in early season (5–17% for maize and 2–18% for wheat). We found maize grain yield declined under the projected climates, whereas wheat grain yield increased. No-tillage is able to reduce yield loss compared to conventional tillage and increased SOC levels (1.4–2.0 t/ha under the three climates), but could not reverse the adverse impact of climate change, unless early and new improved maize cultivars are introduced to increase yield and SOC under climate change. This study demonstrated the need to consider extreme weather events, particularly drought and extreme precipitation events, in climate impact assessment on crop yield and adaptation through no-tillage and new genetics reduces yield losses."
https://openalex.org/W3002084169,"Vitiligo is a T-cell mediated skin disorder characterized by progressive loss of skin color. In individuals genetically predisposed to the disease, various triggers contribute to the initiation of vitiligo. Precipitating factors can stress the skin, leading to T-cell activation and recruitment. Though hereditary factors are implicated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo, it is unknown whether precipitating, stressful events play a role in vitiligo. To understand this, we utilized a validated perceived stress scale (PSS) to measure this parameter in vitiligo patients compared to persons without vitiligo. Additionally, we probed a clinical database, using a knowledge linking software called ROCKET, to gauge stress-related conditions in the vitiligo patient population. From a pool of patients in an existing database, a hundred individuals with vitiligo and twenty-five age- and sex-matched comparison group of individuals without vitiligo completed an online survey to quantify their levels of perceived stress. In parallel, patients described specifics of their disease condition, including the affected body sites, the extent, duration and activity of their vitiligo. Perceived stress was significantly higher among vitiligo individuals compared to those without vitiligo. ROCKET analyses suggested signs of metabolic-related disease (i.e., ‘stress’) preceding vitiligo development. No correlation was found between perceived stress and the stage or the extent of disease, suggesting that elevated stress may not be a consequence of pigment loss alone. The data provide further support for stress as a precipitating factor in vitiligo development."

https://openalex.org/W3001837669,"Prefabricated construction (PC) has attracted wide spread attention as a model of sustainable development for the construction industry of the future. Although the PC has many advantages, it is still at an initial stage in China. Based on the current conditions in China, this study focuses on the interrelationships of factors affecting PC promotion. Firstly, through a comprehensive review of relevant literatures and expert recommendations, 5 factors were identified: policy factor, technical factor, management factor, market factor and cost factor. Next, the data were collected through a questionnaire survey, and the questionnaire data were processed using SPSS 24.0 and AMOS 22.0. The overall relationships of each factor were quantitatively analyzed with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results show that the policy factor plays a dominant role, while the management factor and market factors are also significant. This study also provides decision makers with relevant information about the factors involved, which will be helpful in devising appropriate strategies for the wider adoption of PC."
https://openalex.org/W3002847654,"In Ethiopia, most women do not make the minimum number of antenatal care (ANC) visits recommended by WHO. This study modeled predisposing, enabling, need, and external environmental factors in the utilization of decentralized health facilities for ANC services in rural western Ethiopian communities.A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in Gida Ayana Woreda (District) among 454 women. Data were collected through structured questionnaires. Multinomial logistic regression was used to model the association between the explanatory variables and the use of recommended and fewer than recommended visits for ANC with reference to the base model, no ANC visits.Only 15.2% of women made the recommended minimum number of ANC visits. Women with fewer than 2 children (AOR 10.7; 95% CI 3.0-8.4) were 10.7 times more likely received ANC service as recommended. Women with a delivery of 2 or more (AOR 9.7; 95% CI 3.7-5.2) home visits by health extension workers (HEWS) were 9.7 times more likely receiving minimum ANC services. Involvement in gainful activities had 4 times higher log odds of seeking recommended ANC (AOR 4.0; 95% CI 1.4-11.7). Women who experienced high fever were more likely to obtain the recommended ANC services (AOR 7.1; 95% CI 2.9-7.5). Residents of Ayana Kebele decentralization entity were 60% more likely to make the recommended number of visits to ANC (AOR 24.6; 95% CI 4.8-15.2).Number of children, home visits, gainful activities, monthly income, high fever, and decentralized administrative kebele were strongly linked with recommended ANC schedule. The need for a program intervention aimed at meeting WHO recommendations for ANC visits include economizing birth size and spacing; improving home attendance by HEWs, knowledge of pregnancy complications and benefits of minimum ANC visits, local socio-economic development measures targeting poor women/households; further decentralization of health system improving proximity to ANC in rural western Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3004037465,"Glucocorticoids are potent endogenous anti-inflammatory molecules, and their cognate receptor, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), is expressed in nearly all immune cells. Macrophages are heterogeneous immune cells having a central role in both tissue homeostasis and inflammation and also play a role in the pathogenesis of some inflammatory diseases. Paradoxically, glucocorticoids have only a limited efficacy in controlling the resolution of these macrophage-related diseases. Here, we report that the transcriptomes of monocyte-like THP-1 cells and macrophage-like THP-1 cells (THP1-MΦ) have largely conserved gene expression patterns. In contrast, the differentiation to THP1-MΦ significantly altered the sensitivity of gene transcription to glucocorticoids. Among glucocorticoid-regulated genes, we identified the exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) as a critical glucocorticoid-responsive gene in THP1-MΦ. We found that GR directly induces DPP4 gene expression by binding to two glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GREs) within the DPP4 promoter. Additionally, we show that glucocorticoid-induced DPP4 expression is blocked by the GR antagonist RU-486 and by GR siRNA transfection and that DPP4 enzyme activity is reduced by DPP4 inhibitors. Of note, glucocorticoids highly stimulated macrophage mobility; unexpectedly, DPP4 mediated the glucocorticoid-induced macrophage migration, and siRNA-mediated knockdowns of GR and DPP4 blocked dexamethasone-induced THP1-MΦ migration. Moreover, glucocorticoid-induced DPP4 activation was also observed in proinflammatory M1-polarized murine macrophages, as well as peritoneal macrophages, and was associated with increased macrophage migration. Our results indicate that glucocorticoids directly up-regulate DPP4 expression and thereby induce migration in macrophages, potentially explaining why glucocorticoid therapy is less effective in controlling macrophage-dominated inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3002336103,"Animals excel at adapting their intentions, attention, and actions to the environment, making them remarkably efficient at interacting with a rich, unpredictable and ever-changing external world, a property that intelligent machines currently lack. Such an adaptation property relies heavily on cellular neuromodulation, the biological mechanism that dynamically controls intrinsic properties of neurons and their response to external stimuli in a context-dependent manner. In this paper, we take inspiration from cellular neuromodulation to construct a new deep neural network architecture that is specifically designed to learn adaptive behaviours. The network adaptation capabilities are tested on navigation benchmarks in a meta-reinforcement learning context and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that neuromodulation is capable of adapting an agent to different tasks and that neuromodulation-based approaches provide a promising way of improving adaptation of artificial systems."
https://openalex.org/W3003606371,"Exomic studies have demonstrated that innate immune genes exhibit an even higher degree of variation than the majority of other gene families. However, the phenotypic implications of this genetic variation are not well understood, with effects ranging from hypomorphic to silent to hyperfunctioning. In this work, we study the functional consequences of this variation by investigating polymorphisms in gasdermin D, the key pyroptotic effector protein. We find that, although SNPs affecting potential posttranslational modifications did not affect gasdermin D function or pyroptosis, polymorphisms disrupting sites predicted to be structurally important dramatically alter gasdermin D function. The manner in which these polymorphisms alter function varies from conserving normal pyroptotic function to inhibiting caspase cleavage to disrupting oligomerization and pore formation. Further, downstream of inflammasome activation, polymorphisms that cause loss of gasdermin D function convert inflammatory pyroptotic cell death into immunologically silent apoptotic cell death. These findings suggest that human genetic variation can alter mechanisms of cell death in inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3003263529,"All cells require sustained intracellular energy flux, which is driven by redox chemistry at the subcellular level. NAD+, its phosphorylated variant NAD(P)+, and its reduced forms NAD(P)/NAD(P)H are all redox cofactors with key roles in energy metabolism and are substrates for several NAD-consuming enzymes (e.g. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, sirtuins, and others). The nicotinamide salvage pathway, constituted by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), mainly replenishes NAD+ in eukaryotes. However, unlike NMNAT1, NAMPT is not known to be a nuclear protein, prompting the question of how the nuclear NAD+ pool is maintained and how it is replenished upon NAD+ consumption. In the present work, using human and murine cells; immunoprecipitation, pulldown, and surface plasmon resonance assays; and immunofluorescence, small-angle X-ray scattering, and MS-based analyses, we report that GAPDH and NAMPT form a stable complex that is essential for nuclear translocation of NAMPT. This translocation furnishes NMN to replenish NAD+ to compensate for the activation of NAD-consuming enzymes by stressful stimuli induced by exposure to H2O2 or S-nitrosoglutathione and DNA damage inducers. These results indicate that by forming a complex with GAPDH, NAMPT can translocate to the nucleus and thereby sustain the stress-induced NMN/NAD+ salvage pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3003849327,"Albinism is the most common color variation described in fish and is characterized by a white or yellow phenotype according to the species. In rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, aside from yellow-albino phenotypes, cobalt blue variants with autosomal, recessive inheritance have also been reported. In this study, we investigated the inheritance pattern and chromatophores distribution/abundance of cobalt blue trouts obtained from a local fish farm. Based on crosses with wild-type and dominant yellow-albino lines, we could infer that cobalt blue are dominant over wild-type and co-dominant in relation to yellow-albino phenotype, resulting in a fourth phenotype: the white-albino. Analysis of chromatophores revealed that cobalt blue trouts present melanophores, as the wild-type, and a reduced number of xanthophores. As regards to the white-albino phenotype, they were not only devoid of melanophores but also presented a reduced number of xanthophores. Cobalt blue and white-albino trouts also presented reduced body weight and a smaller pituitary gland compared to wild-type and yellow-albino phenotypes. The transcription levels of tshb and trh were up regulated in cobalt blue compared to wild type, suggesting the involvement of thyroid hormone in the expression of blue color. These phenotypes represent useful models for research on body pigmentation in salmonids and on the mechanisms behind endocrine control of color patterning."
https://openalex.org/W3000785328,"Estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancers often contain subpopulations of cells that express the intermediate filament protein cytokeratin 5 (CK5). CK5+ cells are enriched in cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, can be induced by progestins, and predict poor prognosis in ER+ breast cancer. We established through CK5 knockout and overexpression in ER+ breast cancer cell lines that CK5 is important for tumorsphere formation, prompting us to speculate that CK5 has regulatory activity in CSCs. To interrogate CK5 interacting proteins that may be functionally cooperative, we performed immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry for CK5 in ER+ breast cancer cells. Focusing on proteins with signaling activity, we identified β-catenin, a key transcription factor of the Wnt signaling pathway and cell adhesion molecule, as a CK5 interactor, which we confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in several breast cancer models. We interrogated the dual functions of β-catenin in relation to CK5. Knockout or knockdown of CK5 ablated β-catenin transcriptional activity in response to progestins and Wnt stimuli. Conversely, CK5 induced by progestins or overexpression was sufficient to promote the loss of β-catenin at the cell membrane and total E-cadherin loss. A breast cancer patient-derived xenograft showed similar loss of membrane β-catenin and E-cadherin in CK5+ but not intratumoral CK5− cells and single-cell RNA sequencing found the top enriched pathways in the CK5+ cell cluster were cell junction remodeling and signaling. This report highlights that CK5 actively remodels cell morphology and that blockade of CK5-β-catenin interaction may reverse the detrimental properties of CK5+ breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3004000605,"Microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1 (MAGP-1) is a component of vertebrate extracellular matrix (ECM) microfibrils that, together with the fibrillins, contributes to microfibril function. Many of the phenotypes associated with MAGP-1 gene inactivation are consistent with dysregulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling system. We have previously shown that full-length MAGP-1 binds active TGFβ-1 and some BMPs. The work presented here further defines the growth factor–binding domain of MAGP-1. Using recombinant domains and synthetic peptides, along with surface plasmon resonance analysis to measure the kinetics of the MAGP-1–TGFβ-1 interaction, we localized the TGFβ- and BMP-binding site in MAGP-1 to a 19-amino acid–long, highly acidic sequence near the N terminus. This domain was specific for binding active, but not latent, TGFβ-1. Growth factor activity experiments revealed that TGFβ-1 retains signaling activity when complexed with MAGP-1. Furthermore, when bound to fibrillin, MAGP-1 retained the ability to interact with TGFβ-1, and active TGFβ-1 did not bind fibrillin in the absence of MAGP-1. The absence of MAGP was sufficient to raise the amount of total TGFβ stored in the ECM of cultured cells, suggesting that the MAGPs compete with the TGFβ large latent complex for binding to microfibrils. Together, these results indicate that MAGP-1 plays an active role in TGFβ signaling in the ECM.

In this study, we elucidate a novel nuclear function for PACS-1 in maintaining chromosomal integrity. PACS-1 progressively accumulates in the nucleus during cell cycle progression, where it interacts with class I histone deacetylases 2 and 3 (HDAC2 and HDAC3) to regulate chromatin dynamics by maintaining the acetylation status of histones. PACS-1 knockdown results in the proteasome-mediated degradation of HDAC2 and HDAC3, compromised chromatin maturation, as indicated by elevated levels of histones H3K9 and H4K16 acetylation, and, consequently, increased replication stress-induced DNA damage and genomic instability."
https://openalex.org/W3001694842,"Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive intrinsic brain tumour in adults. Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of glioblastoma initiating cells (GIC) in a mouse model uncovered a novel epigenetic regulation of EfnA5. In this model, Bmi1 enhances H3K27me3 at the EfnA5 locus and reinforces repression of selected target genes in a cellular context-dependent fashion. EfnA5 mediates Bmi1-dependent proliferation and invasion in vitro and tumour formation in an allograft model. Importantly, we show that this novel Polycomb feed-forward loop is also active in human GIC and we provide pre-clinical evidence of druggability of the EFNA5 signalling pathway in GBM xenografts overexpressing Bmi1."
https://openalex.org/W3002142374,"Pseudomonas brassicacearum GS20 is an antagonistic strain of bacteria recently isolated from the rhizosphere of Codonopsis pilosula. No validated reference gene has been indentified from P. brassicacearum to use in the normalization of real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR data. Therefore, in this study, nine candidate reference genes (recA, gyrA, rpoD, proC, gmk, rho, 16S, ftsz, and secA) were assessed at different growth phases and under various growth conditions. The expression stability of these candidate genes was evaluated using BestKeeper, NormFinder and GeNorm. In general, the results showed rho, rpoD and gyrA were the most suitable reference genes for P. brassicacearum GS20. The relative expression of iron-regulated gene (fhu) was normalized to verify the reliability of the proposed reference genes under iron-replete and iron-limited conditions. The trend in relative expression was consistent with the change in siderophore production under different iron conditions. This study presents reliable reference genes for transcriptional studies in P. brassicacearum GS20 under the chosen experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3002950140,"Climate change is posing severe challenges in Africa, where resilient crops are urgently needed to withstand drought periods and unreliable rainfall. Multi-purpose legume species, such as lablab (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet), have been under-utilized yet have the potential to overcome climate challenges. While lablab is native to Africa, there are few characterized varieties and it is under-utilized by smallholder farmers due to a lack of information and access to varieties. Knowledge is especially lacking on the performance of this crop by genotype, management, and environment. We conducted a two-year field study at two sites to evaluate 29 lablab cultivars under sole and maize intercrop management, with 14 cultivars selected for in-depth study. Cultivars were evaluated on vegetative biomass and grain yield production, with N fixation assessed for one site year. Biomass and grain production differed across environments and cultivars, with only biomass affected by intercropping. Average grain yield was substantially reduced to only 37 kg ha-1 in environments with maximum temperatures greater than 33°C, but biomass production yielded comparable amounts across high temperatures and in dry (<500 mm rainfall) environments. Tradeoffs were found between biomass and grain yield across high yielding cultivars, with the top three grain accessions averaging 612 kg ha-1 of grain and 1.97 Mg ha-1 biomass whereas the top three biomass accessions produced 327 kg ha-1 grain and 2.52 Mg ha-1 biomass across all environments. In a comparison of production and N fixation measurements, cultivars were identified which may have high performance in both. Suitability of lablab for grain and biomass production were visualized across Tanzania in a map comparing max temperature thresholds for grain and biomass against average regional livestock populations. This provides a way forward for identifying potential areas for lablab cultivation as a novel means to enhance fodder and pulse production with smallholder farmers."
https://openalex.org/W3004054040,"Ammonium transporters (AMT), methylamine permeases (Mep), and the more distantly related rhesus factors (Rh) are trimeric membrane proteins present in all domains of life. AMT/Mep/Rhs are highly selective membrane proteins required for ammonium uptake or release, and they efficiently exclude the similarly sized K+ ion. Previously reported crystal structures have revealed that each transporter subunit contains a unique hydrophobic but occluded central pore, but it is unclear whether the base (NH3) or NH3 coupled with an H+ are transported. Here, using expression of two plant AMTs (AtAMT1;2 and AMT2) in budding yeast, we found that systematic replacements in the conserved twin-histidine motif, a hallmark of most AMT/Mep/Rh, alter substrate recognition, transport capacities, N isotope selection, and selectivity against K+. AMT-specific differences were found for histidine variants. Variants that completely lost ammonium N isotope selection, a feature likely associated with NH4+ deprotonation during passage, substantially transported K+ in addition to NH4+. Of note, the twin-histidine motif was not essential for ammonium transport. However, it conferred key AMT features, such as high substrate affinity and selectivity against alkali cations via an NH4+ deprotonation mechanism. Our findings indicate that the twin-His motif is the core structure responsible for substrate deprotonation and isotopic preferences in AMT pores and that decreased deprotonation capacity is associated with reduced selectivity against K+. We conclude that optimization for ammonium transport in plant AMT represents a compromise between substrate deprotonation for optimal selectivity and high substrate affinity and transport rates."
https://openalex.org/W3003152116,"In response to microbial invasion, the animal immune system generates hypochlorous acid (HOCl) that kills microorganisms in the oxidative burst. HOCl toxicity is amplified in the phagosome through import of the copper cation (Cu2+). In Escherichia coli and Salmonella, the transcriptional regulator RclR senses HOCl stress and induces expression of the RclA, -B, and -C proteins involved in bacterial defenses against oxidative stress. However, the structures and biochemical roles of the Rcl proteins remain to be elucidated. In this study, we first examined the role of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase (FDR) RclA in the survival of Salmonella in macrophage phagosomes, finding that RclA promotes Salmonella survival in macrophage vacuoles containing sublethal HOCl levels. To clarify the molecular mechanism, we determined the crystal structure of RclA from E. coli at 2.9 Å resolution. This analysis revealed that the structure of homodimeric RclA is similar to those of typical FDRs, exhibiting two conserved cysteine residues near the flavin ring of the cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Of note, we observed that Cu2+ accelerated RclA-mediated oxidation of NADH, leading to a lowering of oxygen levels in vitro. Compared with the RclA WT enzyme, substitution of the conserved cysteine residues lowered the specificity to Cu2+ or substantially increased the production of superoxide anion in the absence of Cu2+. We conclude that RclA-mediated lowering of oxygen levels could contribute to the inhibition of oxidative bursts in phagosomes. Our study sheds light on the molecular basis for how bacteria can survive HOCl stress in macrophages. In response to microbial invasion, the animal immune system generates hypochlorous acid (HOCl) that kills microorganisms in the oxidative burst. HOCl toxicity is amplified in the phagosome through import of the copper cation (Cu2+). In Escherichia coli and Salmonella, the transcriptional regulator RclR senses HOCl stress and induces expression of the RclA, -B, and -C proteins involved in bacterial defenses against oxidative stress. However, the structures and biochemical roles of the Rcl proteins remain to be elucidated. In this study, we first examined the role of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase (FDR) RclA in the survival of Salmonella in macrophage phagosomes, finding that RclA promotes Salmonella survival in macrophage vacuoles containing sublethal HOCl levels. To clarify the molecular mechanism, we determined the crystal structure of RclA from E. coli at 2.9 Å resolution. This analysis revealed that the structure of homodimeric RclA is similar to those of typical FDRs, exhibiting two conserved cysteine residues near the flavin ring of the cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Of note, we observed that Cu2+ accelerated RclA-mediated oxidation of NADH, leading to a lowering of oxygen levels in vitro. Compared with the RclA WT enzyme, substitution of the conserved cysteine residues lowered the specificity to Cu2+ or substantially increased the production of superoxide anion in the absence of Cu2+. We conclude that RclA-mediated lowering of oxygen levels could contribute to the inhibition of oxidative bursts in phagosomes. Our study sheds light on the molecular basis for how bacteria can survive HOCl stress in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W3003251559,"Introduction Over the years, technological and process innovations enabled active case finding (ACF) programs to expand their capacities and scope to have evolved to close gaps in missing TB patients globally. However, with increased ACF program’s operational complexity and a need for significant resource commitments, a comprehensive, transparent, and standardized approach in evaluating costs of ACF programs is needed to properly determine costs and value of ACF programs. Methods Based on reviews of program activity and financial reports, multiple interviews with program managers of two TB REACH funded ACF programs deployed in Cambodia and Tajikistan, we first identified common program components, which formed the basis of the cost data collection, analysis, reporting framework. Within each program component and sub-activity group, cost data were collected and organized by relevant resource types (human resource, capital, recurrent, and overhead costs). Total shared, indirect and overhead costs were apportioned into each activity category based on direct human resource contribution (e.g. a number of staff and their relative level of effort dedicated to each program component). Capital assets were assessed specific to program components and were annualized based on their expected useful life and a 3% discount rate. All costs were assessed based on the service provider perspective and expressed in 2015 USD. Results Over the two program years (April 2013 to December 2015), the Cambodia and Tajikistan ACF programs cumulated a total cost of $336,951 and $771,429 to screen 68,846 and 1,980,516 target population, bacteriologically test 4,589 and 19,764 presumptive TB, diagnose 731 and 2,246 TB patients in the respective programs. Recurrent costs were the largest cost components (54% and 34%) of the total costs for the respective programs and Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) testing incurred largest program component/activity cost for both programs. Cost per screening was $0.63 and $0.10 and cost per Xpert test was $25 and $18; Cost per TB case detected (Xpert) was $373 and $343 in Cambodia and Tajikistan. Conclusions Results from two contextually and programmatically different multi-component ACF programs demonstrate that our tool is fully capable of comprehensively and transparently evaluating and comparing costs of various ACF programs."
https://openalex.org/W3003602103,"Stargardt disease (STGD1), known as inherited retinal dystrophy, is caused by ABCA4 mutations. The pigmented Abca4-/- mouse strain only reflects the early stage of STGD1 since it is devoid of retinal degeneration. This blue light-illuminated pigmented Abca4-/- mouse model presented retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor degeneration which was similar to the advanced STGD1 phenotype. In contrast, wild-type mice showed no RPE degeneration after blue light illumination. In Abca4-/- mice, the acute blue light diminished the mean autofluorescence (AF) intensity in both fundus short-wavelength autofluorescence (SW-AF) and near-infrared autofluorescence (NIR-AF) modalities correlating with reduced levels of bisretinoid-fluorophores. Blue light-induced RPE cellular damage preceded the photoreceptors loss. In late-stage STGD1-like patient and blue light-illuminated Abca4-/- mice, lipofuscin and melanolipofuscin granules were found to contribute to NIR-AF, indicated by the colocalization of lipofuscin-AF and NIR-AF under the fluorescence microscope. In this mouse model, the correlation between in vivo and ex vivo assessments revealed histological characteristics of fundus AF abnormalities. The flecks which are hyper AF in both SW-AF and NIR-AF corresponded to the subretinal macrophages fully packed with pigment granules (lipofuscin, melanin, and melanolipofuscin). This mouse model, which has the phenotype of advanced STGD1, is important to understand the histopathology of Stargardt disease."
https://openalex.org/W3001993760,"Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is a remodeling process mediated by several growth factors and cytokines. This process has been extensively studied in vitro and with pathologic specimens obtained during surgery for scoliosis or back pain. However, the occurrence and temporal evolution of these molecules during normal aging, particularly in the cervical segment, is not known. Our objective was to study and compare the presence of putative mediators in the IVD of young (<35 years, G1) and elderly (>65 years, G2) presumably asymptomatic individuals. Thirty C4-5 and C5-6 discs and thirty L4-5 and L5-S1 discs per group were collected during the autopsy of individuals whose family members denied a history of neck or back pain. Discs were divided into anterior, central (lumbar only) and posterior sectors for analysis. Immunohistochemistry for TNF-α, IL-1β, VEGF, NGF-β, BDNF, TIMP-1, MMP-1, -2 and -3 was performed and reactivity compared between groups and sectors. All of these molecules were detected in every disc sector of both G1 and G2. Most statistical comparisons (25/45, 55.6%) revealed an increase in mediator expression in G2 in relation to G1. Regional differences in the expression of remodeling enzymes were rare; NGF-β and BDNF had slightly higher expression in the cervical segment of elderly individuals. A senescent profile with elevated VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-3 was observed across most G2 disc regions and were generally elevated from G1. In conclusion, the mere presence of any of the studied molecules inside the IVD cannot be considered pathologic. Expression of remodeling enzymes and inflammatory mediators is relatively similar across different vertebral segments and disc regions leading to a common degenerated pattern, while neurotrophins have slightly higher expression in cervical discs. These findings support the concept that disc remodeling in different segments follows a similar pathway that can be potentially mediated to avoid structural failure."
https://openalex.org/W3003385798,"Biodiversity is thought to prevent decline in community function in response to changing environmental conditions through replacement of organisms with similar functional capacity but different optimal growth characteristics. We examined how this concept translates to the within-gene level by exploring seasonal dynamics of within-gene diversity for genes involved in nitrogen cycling in hyporheic zone communities. Nitrification genes displayed low richness—defined as the number of unique within-gene phylotypes—across seasons. Conversely, denitrification genes varied in both richness and the degree to which phylotypes were recruited or lost. These results demonstrate that there is not a universal mechanism for maintaining community functional potential for nitrogen cycling activities, even across seasonal environmental shifts to which communities would be expected to be well adapted. As such, extreme environmental changes could have very different effects on the stability of the different nitrogen cycle activities. These outcomes suggest a need to modify existing conceptual models that link biodiversity to microbiome function to incorporate within-gene diversity. Specifically, we suggest an expanded conceptualization that 1) recognizes component steps (genes) with low diversity as potential bottlenecks influencing pathway-level function, and 2) includes variation in both the number of entities (e.g. species, phylotypes) that can contribute to a given process and the turnover of those entities in response to shifting conditions. Building these concepts into process-based ecosystem models represents an exciting opportunity to connect within-gene-scale ecological dynamics to ecosystem-scale services."
https://openalex.org/W3002137325,"Cognitive models emphasise the importance of attentional bias in addiction. However, many attentional bias tasks have been criticised for questionable psychometric properties and inability to differentiate between engagement and disengagement processes. This study therefore examined the suitability of two alternative tasks for assessing attentional bias within the context of alcohol use. Participants were undergraduate students (N = 169) who completed the Visual Search Task and Odd-One-Out Task, the latter of which is designed to differentiate between engagement and disengagement processes of attention, at baseline and one week later. Participants also completed baseline measures of alcohol consumption, craving, and alcohol use problems. Internal consistency was adequate for the Visual Search Task index, and weak for the Odd-One-Out Task indices. Test-retest reliability was weak for both tasks. The Visual Search Task index and the disengagement (but not the engagement) index of the Odd-One-Out Task showed a positive association with alcohol consumption. This study was restricted to a non-clinical student sample. The relatively high error rate of the Odd-One-Out Task might have reduced its sensitivity as an index of attentional bias. Both tasks showed some merit as attentional bias measures, and results suggested that attentional disengagement might be particularly related to alcohol use. However, the reliability of the current measures was inadequate. One potential explanation for the low reliability is that non-clinical samples may have weak and unstable attentional biases to alcohol. Future efforts should be made to improve the psychometric qualities of both tasks and to administer them in a clinical sample."
https://openalex.org/W2970509767,"Several recent studies have reported enhanced memory when retrieval is preceded by repetitive horizontal eye movements, relative to vertical or no eye movements. The reported memory boost has been referred to as the Saccade-Induced Retrieval Enhancement (SIRE) effect. Across two experiments, memory performance was compared following repetitive horizontal or vertical eye movements, as well as following a control condition of no eye movements. In Experiment 1, we conceptually replicated Christman and colleagues’ seminal study, finding a statistically significant SIRE effect, albeit with weak Bayesian evidence. We therefore sought to conduct another close extension. In Experiment 2, horizontal and vertical eye movement conditions were manipulated separately, and sample size was increased. No evidence of a SIRE effect was found: Bayesian statistical analyses demonstrated significant evidence for a null effect. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the SIRE effect is inconsistent. The current experiments call into question the generalizability of the SIRE effect and suggest that its presence is very sensitive to experimental design. Future work should further assess the robustness of the effect before exploring related theories or underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3003875599,"Lipases comprise a large class of hydrolytic enzymes which catalyze the cleavage of the ester bonds in triacylglycerols and find numerous biotechnological applications. Previously, we have cloned the gene coding for a novel esterase PMGL2 from a Siberian permafrost metagenomic DNA library. We have determined the 3D structure of PMGL2 which belongs to the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) family and contains a new variant of the active site motif, GCSAG. Similar to many other HSLs, PMGL2 forms dimers in solution and in the crystal. Our results demonstrated that PMGL2 and structurally characterized members of the GTSAG motif subfamily possess a common dimerization interface that significantly differs from that of members of the GDSAG subfamily of known structure. Moreover, PMGL2 had a unique organization of the active site cavity with significantly different topology compared to the other lipolytic enzymes from the HSL family with known structure including the distinct orientation of the active site entrances within the dimer and about four times larger size of the active site cavity. To study the role of the cysteine residue in GCSAG motif of PMGL2, the catalytic properties and structure of its double C173T/C202S mutant were examined and found to be very similar to the wild type protein. The presence of the bound PEG molecule in the active site of the mutant form allowed for precise mapping of the amino acid residues forming the substrate cavity."
https://openalex.org/W3003658184,"The expression of the extracellular sulfatase SULF2 has been associated with increased hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth and poor patient survival. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying SULF2-associated tumor growth remain unclear. To address this gap, here we developed a transgenic mouse overexpressing Sulf2 in hepatocytes under the control of the transthyretin promoter. In this model, Sulf2 overexpression potentiated diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC. Further analysis indicated that the transcription factor GLI family zinc finger 1 (GLI1) mediates Sulf2 expression during HCC development. A cross of the Sulf2-overexpressing with Gli1-knockout mice revealed that Gli1 inactivation impairs SULF2-induced HCC. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Sulf2 overexpression is associated with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-specific gene signatures. Interestingly, the Gli1 knockout abrogated SULF2-mediated induction of several STAT3 target genes, including suppressor of cytokine signaling 2/3 (Socs2/3); Pim-1 proto-oncogene, Ser/Thr kinase (Pim1); and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (Flt4). Human orthologs were similarly regulated by SULF2, dependent on intact GLI1 and STAT3 functions in HCC cells. SULF2 overexpression promoted a GLI1-STAT3 interaction and increased GLI1 and STAT3 enrichment at the promoters of their target genes. Interestingly, the SULF2 overexpression resulted in GLI1 enrichment at select STAT3 consensus sites, and vice versa. siRNA-mediated STAT3 or GLI1 knockdown reduced promoter binding of GLI1 and STAT3, respectively. Finally, chromatin-capture PCR confirmed long-range co-regulation of SOCS2 and FLT3 through changes in promoter conformation. These findings define a mechanism whereby SULF2 drives HCC by stimulating formation of a GLI1-STAT3 transcriptional complex."
https://openalex.org/W3004003808,"Background Unlike developed countries, higher socioeconomic status (SES-education, and wealth) is associated with hypertension in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with limited evidence. We examined the associations between SES and hypertension in Nepal and the extent to which these associations vary by sex and urbanity. The body mass index (BMI) was examined as a secondary outcome and assessed as a potential mediator. Materials and methods We analyzed the latest Nepal Demographic and Health Survey data (N = 13,436) collected between June 2016 and January 2017, using a multistage stratified sampling technique. Participants aged 15 years or older from selected households were interviewed with an overall response rate of 97%. Primary outcomes were hypertension and normal blood pressure defined by the widely used Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC7) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2017. Results The prevalence of hypertension was higher in Nepalese men than women. The likelihood of being hypertensive was significantly higher in the higher education group compared with the lowest or no education group for men (OR 1.89 95% CI: 1.36, 2.61) and for women (OR 1.20 95% CI: 0.79, 1.83). People in the richest group were more likely to be hypertensive compared with people in the poorest group for men (OR 1.66 95% CI: 1.26, 2.19) and for women (OR 1.60 95% CI: 1.20, 2.12). The associations between SES (education) and hypertension were partially modified by sex and fully modified by urbanity. BMI mediated these associations. Conclusions The higher SES was positively associated with the higher likelihood of having hypertension in Nepal according to both JNC7 and ACC/AHA 2017 guidelines. These associations were mediated by BMI, which may help to explain broader socioeconomic differentials in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related risk factors, particularly in terms of education and wealth. Our study suggests that the mediating factor of BMI should be tackled to diminish the risk of CVD in people with higher SES in LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W3004278970,"The breeding of agriculturally useful genes from wild crop relatives must take into account recent and future climate change. In Japan, the development of early heading wheat cultivars without the use of any major gene controlling the heading date is desired to avoid overlap of the harvesting time before the rainy season. Here, we backcrossed two early heading lines of a synthetic hexaploid wheat, derived from a crossing between durum wheat and the wild wheat progenitor Aegilops tauschii, with four Japanese elite cultivars to develop early heading lines of bread wheat. In total, nine early heading lines that showed a heading date two to eight days earlier than their parental cultivars in field conditions were selected and established from the selfed progenies of the two- or three-times backcrossed populations. The whole appearance and spike shape of the selected early heading lines looked like their parental wheat cultivars. The mature grains of the selected lines had the parental cultivars' characteristics, although the grains exhibited longer and narrower shapes. RNA sequencing-based genotyping was performed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms between the selected lines and their parental wheat cultivars, which revealed the chromosomal regions transmitted from the parental synthetic wheat to the selected lines. The introgression regions could shorten wheat heading date, and their chromosomal positions were dependent on the backcrossed wheat cultivars. Therefore, early heading synthetic hexaploid wheat is useful for fine-tuning of the heading date through introgression of Ae. tauschii chromosomal regions."
https://openalex.org/W3001412529,"Background Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality in developing countries. Identifying its risk factors is essential for early diagnosis and management. However, there has been a paucity of information on predictors of preeclampsia among nulliparous women in a resource limited setting. This study bridges the gap in this regard by examining the association of cohabitation duration, obstetric, behavioral and nutrition factors with preeclampsia among nulliparous women in West Amhara Zones of Ethiopia. Methods Age matched case-control study design was employed among 110 preeclamptic and 220 non-preeclamptic women who came for delivery services at Felege Hiwot, Addis Alem, and Debre Tabor hospitals. Double population proportion formula with an assumption of 95% confidence interval, 80% power and a 2:1 control to case ratio was used to calculate sample size. Epi data 3.1 and SPSS 20 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Magnitudes of cohabitation duration, obstetric, behavioral and nutritional factors among nulliparous women with preeclampsia and their controls were calculated and the differences were tested with a Chi-square test. Conditional bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were fitted to identify predictors of preeclampsia. Odds ratio along with their 95% confidence interval were used to identify the strength, direction and significance of association. Ethical clearance was secured from the research ethics committee of the School of Public Health in Addis Ababa University. Results A total of 107 cases and 214 controls completed the interview giving a response rate of 97.27% for both cases and controls. Short cohabitation duration (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI (1.10, 4.1)), unplanned pregnancy (AOR = 2.35, 95% CI (1.01, 5.52)), and high body weight (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI (1.10, 3.63)) were found to be significant risk factors for preeclampsia. Whereas, antenatal advice about nutrition (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI (0.29, 0.96)), vegetable intake (AOR = 0.42, 95% CI (0.22, 0.82)) and fruit intake during pregnancy (AOR = 0.45, 95% CI (0.24, 0.87)) were protective factors for preeclampsia. Conclusion Special attention should be given to nulliparous women with short cohabitation duration, unplanned pregnancy, and high body weight to minimize the effect of preeclampsia. Nutritional counseling shall be stressed during antenatal care follow ups."

A common failure was simulated in triplicate cycles, using a standardized cycle configuration, and then compared to triplicate cycles of a common cycle configuration. Tests procedures were conducted according to B&D manufacturer test standard and results were compared to standardized endpoint specifications.We found that B&D type tests are only capable of detecting the presence of non-condensable gases if the sterilization equipment is adjusted to meet all the cycle requirements of the test. False positive results were obtained with come-up ramp time of 3 min. Correct results were only obtained with come-up ramp of 1.7-1.9 min.Until the ISO 17665 and AAMI ST-79 standards are revised, equipment qualification experts should observe come-up time duration criterion for B&D type test cycles according to ISO 11140-4. Sterile Processing Department professionals must add the come-up ramp criterion to cycle evaluation before clearing the equipment for routine use.

https://openalex.org/W3003491006,"Sleep inertia is a potentially dangerous reduction in human alertness and occurs 0-4 hours after waking. The type of sound people set as their alarm for waking has been shown to reduce the effects of sleep inertia, however, the elemental musical factors that underpin these waking sounds and their relationships remain unclear. The goal of this research is to understand how a particular sound or music chosen to assist waking may counteract sleep inertia, and more specifically, what elements of these sounds may contribute to its reduction. Through an anonymous, self-report online questionnaire, fifty participants (N = 50) reported attributes of their preferred waking sound, their feeling towards the waking sound, and perceived sleep inertia after waking. This data enabled the analysis and comparison between these responses to identify statistically significant relationships. Our results did not return any significant association between sleep inertia and the reported waking sound type, nor the subject's feeling towards their sound. However, the analysis did reveal that a sound which is ranked as melodic by participants shows a significant relationship to reports of reductions in perceived sleep inertia, and in contrast, sound rated as neutral (neither unmelodic nor melodic) returns a significant relationship to the reports of increases in perceived sleep inertia. Additionally, our secondary analysis revealed that a sound rated as melodic is considered to be more rhythmic than a melodically neutral interpretation. Together these findings raise questions regarding the impact melody and rhythm may hold with respect to sleep inertia intensity. Considering that the implementation of auditory assisted awakening is a common occurrence, the musical elements of a chosen waking sound may be an area to further interrogate with respect to counteracting sleep inertia."
https://openalex.org/W3003887048,"Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is heterogeneous. As an indication of the heterogeneity of ARDS, there are patients whose syndrome improves rapidly (i.e., within 24 hours), others whose hypoxemia improves gradually and still others whose severe hypoxemia persists for several days. The latter group of patients with persistent severe ARDS poses challenges to clinicians. We attempted to assess the baseline characteristics and outcomes of persistent severe ARDS and to identify which variables are useful to predict it. Methods A secondary analysis of patient-level data from the ALTA, EDEN and SAILS ARDSNet clinical trials was conducted. We defined persistent severe ARDS as a partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2:FiO2) of equal to or less than 100 mmHg on the second study day following enrollment. Regularized logistic regression with an L1 penalty [Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)] techniques were used to identify predictive variables of persistent severe ARDS. Results Of the 1531 individuals with ARDS alive on the second study day after enrollment, 232 (15%) had persistent severe ARDS. Of the latter, 100 (43%) individuals had mild or moderate hypoxemia at baseline. Usage of vasopressors was greater [144/232 (62%) versus 623/1299 (48%); p<0.001] and baseline severity of illness was higher in patients with versus without persistent severe ARDS. Mortality at 60 days [95/232 (41%) versus 233/1299 (18%); p<0.001] was higher, and ventilator-free (p<0.001), intensive care unit-free [0 (0–14) versus 19 (7–23); p<0.001] and non-pulmonary organ failure-free [3 (0–21) versus 20 (1–26); p<0.001] days were fewer in patients with versus without persistent severe ARDS. PaO2:FiO2, FiO2, hepatic failure and positive end-expiratory pressure at enrollment were useful predictive variables. Conclusions Patients with persistent severe ARDS have distinct baseline characteristics and poor prognosis. Identifying such patients at enrollment may be useful for the prognostic enrichment of trials."
https://openalex.org/W3004074176,"Potentially malignant lesions, commonly referred to as dysplasia, are associated with malignant transformation by mechanisms that remain unclear. We recently reported that increased Wnt secretion promotes the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and expression of target genes in oral dysplasia. However, the mechanisms accounting for nuclear re-localization of β-catenin in oral dysplasia remain unclear. In this study, we show that endosomal sequestration of the β-catenin destruction complex allows nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in oral dysplasia, and that these events depended on the endocytic protein Rab5. Tissue immunofluorescence analysis showed aberrant accumulation of enlarged early endosomes in oral dysplasia biopsies, when compared with healthy oral mucosa. These observations were confirmed in cell culture models, by comparing dysplastic oral keratinocytes (DOK) and non-dysplastic oral keratinocytes (OKF6). Intriguingly, DOK depicted higher levels of active Rab5, a critical regulator of early endosomes, when compared with OKF6. Increased Rab5 activity in DOK was necessary for nuclear localization of β-catenin and Tcf/Lef-dependent transcription, as shown by expression of dominant negative and constitutively active mutants of Rab5, along with immunofluorescence, subcellular fractionation, transcription, and protease protection assays. Mechanistically, elevated Rab5 activity in DOK accounted for endosomal sequestration of components of the destruction complex, including GSK3β, Axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), as observed in Rab5 dominant negative experiments. In agreement with these in vitro observations, tissue immunofluorescence analysis showed increased co-localization of GSK3β, APC, and Axin, with early endosome antigen 1- and Rab5-positive early endosomes in clinical samples of oral dysplasia. Collectively, these data indicate that increased Rab5 activity and endosomal sequestration of the β-catenin destruction complex leads to stabilization and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in oral dysplasia."
https://openalex.org/W3002314101,"The introduction of “Treat All” (TA) has been promoted to increase the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS treatment by having patients initiate antiretroviral therapy at an earlier stage of their illness. The impact of introducing TA on the unit cost of treatment has been less clear. The following study evaluated how costs changed after Namibia’s introduction of TA in April 2017. A two-year analysis assessed the costs of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the 12 months before TA (Phase I–April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017) and the 12 months following (Phase II–April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018). The analysis involved interviewing staff at ten facilities throughout Namibia, collecting data on resources utilized in the treatment of ART patients and analyzing how costs changed before and after the introduction of TA. An analysis of treatment costs indicated that the unit cost of treatment declined from USD360 per patient per year in Phase I to USD301 per patient per year in Phase II, a reduction of 16%. This decline in unit costs was driven by 3 factors: 1) shifts in antiretroviral (ARV) regimens that resulted in lower costs for drugs and consumables, 2) negotiated reductions in the cost of viral load tests and 3) declines in personnel costs. It is unlikely that the first two of these factors were significantly influenced by the introduction of TA. It is unclear if TA might have had an influence on personnel costs. The reduction in personnel costs may have either represented a positive development (fewer personnel costs associated with increased numbers of healthier patients and fewer visits required) or alternatively may reflect constraints in Namibia’s staffing. Prior to this study, it was expected that the introduction of TA would lead to a significant increase in the number of ART patients. However, there was less than a 4% increase in the number of adult patients at the 10 studied facilities. From a financial point of view, TA did not significantly increase the resources required in the ten sampled facilities, either by raising unit costs or significantly increasing the number of ART patients."
https://openalex.org/W3002936210,"Background and aims Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD) have a major impact on quality of life and medical costs. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence, incidence and clinical phenotypes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) cases in Mexico and Colombia. Methods We analyzed official administrative and health databases, used mathematical modelling to estimate the incidence and complete prevalence, and performed a case-series of IBD patients at a referral center both in Mexico and Colombia. Results The age-adjusted complete prevalence of UC per 100,000 inhabitants for 2015/2016 ranged from 15.65 to 71.19 in Mexico and from 27.40 to 69.97 in Colombia depending on the model considered. The prevalence of CD per 100,000 inhabitants in Mexico ranged from 15.45 to 18.08 and from 16.75 to 18.43 in Colombia. In Mexico, the age-adjusted incidence of UC per 100,000 inhabitants per year ranged from 0.90 to 2.30, and from 0.55 to 2.33 in Colombia. The incidence for CD in Mexico ranged from 0.35 to 0.66 whereas in Colombia, the age-adjusted incidence of CD ranged from 0.30 to 0.57. The case-series included 200 IBD patients from Mexico and 204 patients from Colombia. The UC/CD prevalence ratio in Mexico and Colombia was 1.50:1 and 4.5:1 respectively. In Mexico, the female/male prevalence ratio for UC was 1.50:1 and 1.28:1 for CD, while in Colombia this ratio was 0.68:1 for UC and 0.8:1 for CD. In Mexico the relapse rate for UC was 63.3% and 72.5% for CD, while those rates in Colombia were 58.2% for UC and 58.3% for CD. Conclusions The estimated burden of disease of IBD in Mexico and Colombia is not negligible. Although these findings need to be confirmed by population-based studies, they are useful for decision-makers, practitioners and patients with this condition."
https://openalex.org/W3004190628,"Myeloid progenitor cells have generally been considered the predominant source of myeloid cells under steady-state conditions. Here we show that NK cells contributed to a myeloid cell lineage pool in naive and tumor-bearing mice. Using fate tracing of NKp46+ cells, we found that myeloid cells could be derived from NK cells. Notably, among mature CD11b+ CD27+ NK cells, c-Kit+ CD24+ NK cells were capable of differentiating into a range of myeloid lineages in vitro and produced neutrophils and monocytes in vivo. The differentiation was completely inhibited by NK-stimulating cytokines. In addition to the potential for differentiation into myeloid cells, c-Kit+ CD24+ NK cells retained NK cell phenotypes and effector functions. Mechanistically, GATA-2 was necessary for the differentiation of c-Kit+ CD24+ NK cells. Therefore, we discovered that GATA-2-dependent differentiation of c-Kit+ CD24+ NK cells contributes to myeloid cell development and identified a novel pathway for myeloid lineage commitment under physiological conditions."

Twenty compounds 1-3, 6-14, 16, 19, 22-24, and 27-29 showed potent to weak TP inhibitory activities with IC50 values in the range of 6.8 to 229.5 μM, in comparison to the standards i.e. tipiracil (IC50 = 0.014 ± 0.002 μM) and 7-deazaxanthine (IC50 = 41.0 ± 1.63 μM). Kinetic studies on selected inhibitors 3, 9, 14, 22, 27, and 29 revealed uncompetitive and non-competitive modes of inhibition. Molecular docking studies of these inhibitors indicated that they were able to interact with the amino acid residues present in allosteric site of TP, including Asp391, Arg388, and Leu389. Antiproliferative (cytotoxic) activities of active compounds were also evaluated against mouse fibroblast (3T3) and prostate cancer (PC3) cell lines. Compounds 1, 2, 19, and 22-24 exhibited anti-proliferative activities against PC3 cells with IC50 values between 6.5 to 10.5 μM, while they were largely non-cytotoxic to 3T3 (mouse fibroblast) cells proliferation. Present study thus identifies a new class of dual inhibitors of TP and cancer cell proliferation, which deserves to be further investigated for anti-cancer drug development."
https://openalex.org/W3003255157,"Objective Selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (celecoxib) can minimize the gastrointestinal complications related to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. NAXOZOL is a new combination formulation designed to provide sequential delivery of a non-enteric-coated, immediate-release esomeprazole strontium tetrahydrate 20 mg mantle followed by an enteric-coated naproxen 500 mg core. However, there have been no studies comparing NAXOZOL to celecoxib with respect to gastrointestinal tract protection and pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis. This study was undertaken to compare the effects of NAXOZOL and celecoxib with respect to gastrointestinal tract protection and pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis. Methods The randomized enrolled patients were divided into two treatment groups: a NAXOZOL group and a celecoxib group. All participants received treatments (NAXOZOL, 500/20 mg (naproxen 500 mg, esomeprazole strontium tetrahydrate 20 mg) twice per day versus celecoxib, 200 mg daily) on a 1:1 allocation basis for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (LDQ) score used for non-inferiority testing. Secondary outcome measures included the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) score, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, European Quality of Life-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) scale and the EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS). Other outcome measures included the use of supplementary or rescue drugs, and the incidence of adverse events. Results The baseline-adjusted LDQ scores immediately after 12 weeks of treatment in NAXOZOL group were not inferior to those in celecoxib group. The overall change in the baseline-adjusted GSRS score, VAS score, EQ-5D, and EQ VAS was not different between the two groups. The usage of supplementary drugs and the drug-related incidence of adverse events were not different. However, the days to use rescue drug were longer in celecoxib group than in NAXOZOL group. Conclusion NAXOZOL was not inferior to celecoxib in protecting the gastrointestinal tract and providing pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis."
