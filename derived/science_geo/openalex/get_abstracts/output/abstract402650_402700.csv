https://openalex.org/W2025567662,"The protein deacetylase, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), is a proposed master regulator of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle, primarily via its ability to deacetylate and activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). To investigate regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by SIRT1 in vivo, we generated mice lacking SIRT1 deacetylase activity in skeletal muscle (mKO). We hypothesized that deacetylation of PGC-1α and mitochondrial biogenesis in sedentary mice and after endurance exercise would be impaired in mKO mice. Skeletal muscle contractile characteristics were determined in extensor digitorum longus muscle ex vivo. Mitochondrial biogenesis was assessed after 20 days of voluntary wheel running by measuring electron transport chain protein content, enzyme activity, and mitochondrial DNA expression. PGC-1α expression, nuclear localization, acetylation, and interacting protein association were determined following an acute bout of treadmill exercise (AEX) using co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Contrary to our hypothesis, skeletal muscle endurance, electron transport chain activity, and voluntary wheel running-induced mitochondrial biogenesis were not impaired in mKO versus wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, PGC-1α expression, nuclear translocation, activity, and deacetylation after AEX were similar in mKO versus WT mice. Alternatively, we made the novel observation that deacetylation of PGC-1α after AEX occurs in parallel with reduced nuclear abundance of the acetyltransferase, general control of amino-acid synthesis 5 (GCN5), as well as reduced association between GCN5 and nuclear PGC-1α. These findings demonstrate that SIRT1 deacetylase activity is not required for exercise-induced deacetylation of PGC-1α or mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle and suggest that changes in GCN5 acetyltransferase activity may be an important regulator of PGC-1α activity after exercise.

Once active, PGC-1α targets an array of transcription factors and nuclear receptors to coordinate gene expression of nuclear and mitochondrial-encoded genes (13Kelly D.P. Scarpulla R.C.

In recent years, lysine acetylation has emerged as a key regulatory process controlling enzyme activity and gene transcription (15Wang Q. Zhang Y. Yang C. Xiong H. Lin Y. Yao J. Li H. Xie L. Zhao W.

To this end, the class III NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), has been proposed as a central regulator of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle due to its sensitivity to perturbations in NAD+ and its ability to regulate PGC-1α activity (10Cantó C.

Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Wu Z. Puigserver P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Indeed, deacetylation of PGC-1α by SIRT1 is thought to be pivotal for regulating the activation of numerous genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as oxidative capacity (19Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16456-16460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 20Gerhart-Hines Z. Rodgers J.T. Bare O. Lerin C. Kim S.H.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) Consistent with this, SIRT1 gene expression and protein content and activity are increased in skeletal muscle by endurance exercise training in association with mitochondrial biogenesis (21Gurd B.J.

Metabolism. 2008; 57: 986-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of SIRT1 in PC12 cells leads to PGC-1α deacetylation and significantly increases oxygen consumption, which is indicative of increased mitochondrial biogenesis (19Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16456-16460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Whether SIRT1 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis in vivo is less clear. For example, mice with whole body knock-out of SIRT1 do not display decrements in muscle respiratory capacity (25Boily G. Seifert E.L. Bevilacqua L. He X.H. Sabourin G. Estey C. Moffat C. Crawford S. Saliba S. Jardine K. Xuan J. Evans M. Harper M.E. McBurney M.W. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), whereas transient overexpression of SIRT1 in rodent skeletal muscle reduces oxidative capacity and PGC-1α protein abundance (26Gurd B.J. Yoshida Y. Lally J. Holloway G.P. Bonen A. J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, total SIRT1 activity and protein content show a limited correlation with skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (27Chabi B. Adhihetty P.J. O'Leary M.F. Menzies K.J. Hood D.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2009; 107: 1730-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that nuclear SIRT1 activity regulates mitochondrial biogenesis; although without loss of function studies this hypothesis has yet to be addressed directly (22Gurd B.J. Yoshida Y. McFarlan J.T. Holloway G.P. Moyes C.D. Heigenhauser G.J. Spriet L. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2011; 301: R67-R75Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, to better understand the precise role of SIRT1 deacetylase activity in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle, we studied mice with knock-out of SIRT1 deacetylase activity in skeletal muscle (referred to as mKO), in sedentary (SED) or exercise conditions. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle endurance and exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis would be impaired in mKO skeletal muscle, primarily due to lack of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of PGC-1α. All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. To generate the mKO mouse, floxed mice harboring loxP sites flanking exon 4 of the SIRT1 gene (28Cheng H.L. Mostoslavsky R. Saito S. Manis J.P. Gu Y. Patel P. Bronson R. Appella E. Alt F.W. Chua K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10794-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar) (SIRT1FLX-exon4), which encodes the deacetylase domain of SIRT1, were crossed with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the muscle creatine kinase promoter. In these mice, a truncated SIRT1 protein is present, but the protein lacks deacetylase activity (28Cheng H.L. Mostoslavsky R. Saito S. Manis J.P. Gu Y. Patel P. Bronson R. Appella E. Alt F.W. Chua K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10794-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). For simplicity, the SIRT1FLX-exon4 mice used to generate mKO are referred to as wild-type (WT) mice. Mice were housed on a 12:12-h light:dark cycle, and only male mice were studied. Mice were studied at 13 weeks of age. All experiments were approved by and were conducted in accordance with the Animal Care Program at the University of California, San Diego. 10-week-old mice were given access to a running wheel for 20 days with time run per day recorded via a digital recorder. On day 22 (36 h following removal of the running wheel) mice were anesthetized, and the gastrocnemius muscle was removed, cleaned of visible fat, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis. 13-week-old mice were habituated to a motorized treadmill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) on two occasions (10 min at 10 m/min and 10° grade) in the 2 days prior to the experimental exercise bout. After a 3-h fast mice completed 60 min of running exercise (10° grade) at repetitions of variable exercise intensity (5–25 m/min). Following exercise, mice were returned to their cages without food, but with access to water, until muscle collection. Muscle was collected either immediately (0h) or 3 h (3h) after AEX. A sedentary (SED) control group was used as a comparison. SED mice were fasted for the same period of time, and muscle was collected at the same time of day as the experimental group (i.e. after a 4-h or 7-h fast). Tissue was prepared as described previously (29Hamilton D.L. Philp A. MacKenzie M.G. Baar K. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e11624Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, muscle was powdered under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and Polytron-homogenized in 10-fold mass of ice-cold sucrose lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4 Na2(PO4)2, and 0.1% DTT). The homogenate was briefly vortexed and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 8000× g to remove insoluble material. Protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were isolated from SED and AEX gastrocnemius muscle using a commercially available kit (78835: NE-PER; Thermo Scientific) with the addition of the COMPLETE protease inhibitor mixture (11697498001; Roche Applied Science). Integrity of nuclear fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting for the cytosolic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, L7016; Sigma) and the nuclear protein, histone H2B (ab9408; AbCam). Nuclear extracts from gastrocnemius muscle were used for IP experiments. For IP of acetylated lysine and acetylation measurements of p53 and PGC-1α, nuclear fractions were isolated with the addition of 1 μm trichostatin A and 10 mm nicotinamide. For IP of acetylated lysine, 150 μg of protein was precleared with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads (16-156; Millipore), whereas for IP of p53, PGC-1α and general control of amino-acid synthesis 5 (GCN5), 150 μg of protein was precleared with 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads and 25 μl of protein G-agarose beads (16-266; Millipore) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein was then rotated for 2 h (4 °C) with anti-acetylated lysine (9441; Cell Signaling), anti-PGC-1α (AB3242; Millipore), anti-p53 (sc-6243; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-GCN5 (607201; Biolegend), and then protein A-agarose (50 μl) or protein A/G beads (25 μl of each) were added and the samples and rotated overnight (4 °C). The following morning, agarose beads were washed three times with sucrose lysis buffer and three times in TAE before antigens were eluted from bead complexes with 1× Laemmli SDS buffer (30 μl). Samples were boiled for 10 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 8000× g (4 °C) prior to SDS-PAGE (20 μl) separation. Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were boiled for 5 min in 1 × Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 7.5–10% gels by SDS-PAGE as described previously (30Philp A. Perez-Schindler J. Green C. Hamilton D.L. Baar K. Am. J. Physiol. 2010; 299: C240-C250Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence horseradish peroxidase (HRP) substrate detection kit (Millipore). Imaging and band quantification were carried out using a Chemi Genius Bioimaging Gel Doc System (Syngene). All primary antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution in buffers according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Mitoprofile total OXPHOS antibody mixture (MS604) was from Mitosciences, Acetyl-lysine (9441), phospho-AMPKThr172 (2535), phospho-ACC-βSer79 (3661), HDAC5 (2082), phospho-p38 MAPKThr180/Tyr182 (9215), p38 MAPK (9212), phospho-ATF2Thr71 (9221), phospho-CaMKIIThr286 (3361), and CaMKII (3362) were from Cell Signaling Technology. PGC-1α (AB3242) was from Millipore. p53 (sc-6243) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-HDAC5Ser259 (ab47283) was from AbCam. Phospho-CREBSer133 (600-401-270) and CREB (100-401-195) were from Rockland. AMPKα1, AMPKα2, and ACC-β antibodies were kindly provided by Professor Grahame Hardie, University of Dundee. RNA was extracted from gastrocnemius muscle using the phenol/chloroform method, and cDNA was synthesized as described previously (30Philp A. Perez-Schindler J. Green C. Hamilton D.L. Baar K. Am. J. Physiol. 2010; 299: C240-C250Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using an Eppendorf Light Cycler PCR machine, SYBR Green PCR plus reagents (Sigma Aldrich), and custom-designed primers. 10-μl PCRs were assayed in triplicate on a 96-well heat-sealed PCR plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each reaction contained 5 μl of SYBR Green Taq, 1 μl of forward and reverse primers, and 3 μl of cDNA (1:10 dilution). The target gene expression was calculated relative to values from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and expressed normalized to pretreatment values. Absolute CT for GAPDH was unchanged by any of the treatments (data not shown). Primers for quantitative PCR were designed to span exon-exon boundaries to avoid amplification of genomic DNA. The following primer sequences were used: SIRT1 forward, 5′-GGC TAC CGA GAC AAC CTC CTG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGT CCA GTC ACT AGA GCT GGC-3′; SIRT1-Exon3 forward, 5′-GAT GCT GTG AAG TTA CTG CAG GAG TG-3′ and reverse SIRT1-Exon5, 5′-AAT TTG TGA CAC AGA GAC GGC TGG-3′.

Mice were anesthetized (sodium pentobarbital 60 mg/kg), and the fifth toe muscle of the extensor digitorum longus and the tendon insertion were isolated and mounted in a specialized muscle chamber containing Ringer solution (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 24 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose containing 10 mg/liter curare) at room temperature. The muscle origin was tied with 6-0 silk suture to a rigid post, and the insertion was secured to the arm of a dual-mode ergometer (model 300B; Aurora Scientific, ON, Canada) that could impose precise length changes. Muscle activation was provided by an electrical stimulator (model S88; Astro-Med, West Warwick, RI) via parallel platinum plate electrodes that extended the length of the muscle. Optimal muscle length was determined as the length at which supramaximal stimulation produced maximal isometric tetanic force. Isometric tetanic contractions were elicited with 300-ms train duration and 0.2-ms pulse duration at 70 Hz with variable rest intervals. Rest intervals were decreased every 1 min in a progressive manner (from a contraction every 8 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 s). The test was terminated when the developed force had fallen to ∼40% of the initial maximal developed force. Time to fatigue was measured at the time it took each muscle to reach 60% of the maximal developed force. Specific force was calculated by normalizing muscle force to muscle physiological cross-sectional area calculated using standard equations (31Sacks R.D. Roy R.R. J. Morphol. 1982; 173: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The maximal isometric tetanic force was expressed as newtons/cm2. To isolate mitochondria, 40 mg of powdered gastrocnemius was homogenized in 2 ml of buffer A (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% BSA, 5 mm HEPES, 10 μg/ml subtilisin, pH 7.2). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000× g for 10 min (4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was transferred to a separate microtube and recentrifuged at 10,000× g for 20 min (4 °C). Following aspiration, the remaining pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer B (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) and frozen at −80 °C. Complex II–IV and citrate synthase (CS) enzyme activity assays were performed using standard methods as previously described (32Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with each experiment repeated in triplicate. 20 mg of powdered gastrocnemius muscle was suspended in 150 μl of digestion buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 m NaCl, 10% SDS, + 4 μl of proteinase K) and incubated overnight at 60 °C. The following day, samples were centrifuged at 14,000× g for 10 min, the pellet was washed twice with 500 μl of 70% ethanol and then allowed to air dry at room temperature for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of TE (1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m EDTA, ddH2O) and incubated at 60 °C for 2 h before being stored overnight at 4 °C. RT-PCR was performed against primers specific to a mitochondrial (cytochrome b forward, 5′-TTC GCA GTC ATA GCC ACA G-3′ and reverse 5′-AGA TGA AGT GGA AAG CGA AG-3′) and nuclear (β-globulin forward, 5′-TGC CAT CCC ATC ACA ACA AG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCC AAT ACA CAG GTC ACA GAG-3′) encoded gene using an Eppendorf Light Cycler PCR machine. A Student's t test or two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (SigmaPlot® 11.2, Systat Software, Inc. San Jose CA) was used to determine differences between groups and experimental conditions, and Tukey post hoc test was used where appropriate. Values are displayed as mean ± S.E., with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Exon4 was efficiently excised in various skeletal muscles in mKO versus WT (i.e. SIRT1FLX-exon4; Fig. 1A) mice, but this deletion did not occur in adipose tissue or liver (data not shown). Despite deletion of exon4, SIRT1 gene expression was similar in mKO versus WT mice (Fig. 1B). To verify that SIRT1 deacetylase activity was disrupted in mKO muscle, we measured the acetylation of the SIRT1 target, p53, in nuclear pellets from skeletal muscle collected immediately (0h) after AEX. The acetylation of p53 (Ac-p53) was significantly reduced in WT mice 0 h after AEX, but this reduction was completely abrogated in mKO mice (Fig. 1C), confirming that SIRT1 deacetylase activity was diminished in mKO skeletal muscle. Nuclear p53 abundance was significantly (p < 0.05) increased after AEX only in WT mice and not in mKO mice (WT-SED, 1.00 ± 0.09; KO-SED, 1.12 ± 0.15; WT-AEX, 2.41 ± 0.18; KO-AEX, 1.17 ± 0.31). Maximal tetanic force and time to fatigue of isolated extensor digitorum longus muscles were not different between mKO versus WT mice (Fig. 1, D and E), demonstrating that loss of SIRT1 deacetylase activity does not impair skeletal muscle function or endurance capacity. Next, we studied adaptations to exercise training using a 20-day VWR model. Despite loss of SIRT1 deacetylase activity, time spent running was similar between mKO and WT mice, suggesting no impairments in running ability (Fig. 2A). Training-induced increases in the skeletal muscle protein abundance of PGC-1α and the electron transport chain subunit complexes I–IV (∼40–80%; Fig. 2B), the activity of complexes II–IV and citrate synthase (∼40–125%, Fig. 2C), and the mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA ratio (∼3.5-fold; mtDNA:nDNA, Fig. 2D) were also comparable between mKO versus WT mice. Thus, loss of SIRT1 deacetylase activity in skeletal muscle did not impair basal muscle function, endurance, or oxidative capacity, nor did it compromise induction of mitochondrial biogenesis in response to VWR. Considering that mitochondrial biogenesis and induction of PGC-1α were not impaired in mKO mice following VWR, we studied other signaling pathways that could potentially compensate for the loss of SIRT1 deacetylase activity in mKO mice and thus explain the normal adaptation to VWR. Immediately after exercise (i.e. 0h), phosphorylation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKThr172) and the AMPK substrates, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC-βSer79) and histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5Ser498) were similarly increased ∼2–2.5-fold above SED values in mKO and WT mice (Fig. 3, A–C). We also observed similar increases 0 h after exercise in the phosphorylation of activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2Thr71), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREBSer133; Fig. 3D), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIThr286) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPKTyr180/182; Fig. 3E) in AEX mKO and WT mice compared with SED mice. Therefore, altered activation of these pathways does not appear to explain the ability of mKO to adapt to VWR and AEX. PGC-1α gene transcription is well known to be induced by exercise (7Baar K.

However, we found that skeletal muscle PGC-1α expression was significantly increased 3 h after AEX in both WT and mKO mice compared with SED mice, and in fact, the increase in mKO mice 3 h after AEX was ∼2-fold greater than that of WT mice (Fig. 4A). In parallel with increased PGC-1α expression 3 h after AEX, the activation of proposed PGC-1α target genes, mitofusin-2, cytochrome c, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 were similarly increased by AEX in mKO and WT mice (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4mKO mice display normal activation of PGC-1α and exercise-responsive genes following AEX.

IFN signaling is tightly controlled to ensure appropriate immune responses as imbalance could result in uncontrolled inflammation or inadequate responses to infection. It is therefore important to understand how type I IFN signaling is regulated. Here we have investigated the mechanism by which suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) inhibits type I IFN signaling. We have found that SOCS1 inhibits type I IFN signaling not via a direct interaction with the IFN α receptor 1 (IFNAR1) receptor component but through an interaction with the IFNAR1-associated kinase Tyk2. We have characterized the residues/regions involved in the interaction between SOCS1 and Tyk2 and found that SOCS1 associates via its SH2 domain with conserved phosphotyrosines 1054 and 1055 of Tyk2. The kinase inhibitory region of SOCS1 is also essential for its interaction with Tyk2 and inhibition of IFN signaling. We also found that Tyk2 is preferentially Lys-63 polyubiquitinated and that this activation reaction is inhibited by SOCS1. The consequent effect of SOCS1 inhibition of Tyk2 not only results in a reduced IFN response because of inhibition of Tyk2 kinase-mediated STAT signaling but also negatively impacts IFNAR1 surface expression, which is stabilized by Tyk2.

Interferons are a family of cytokines that elicit multifaceted effects during the host innate and adaptive immune response. The type I IFN family consists of multiple IFNα subtypes, IFNβ and others, that are produced in response to host viral and bacterial infection and act in an endocrine or autocrine fashion to stimulate cell antiviral responses (1Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar).

The primary signaling events activated by the type I IFNs are mediated by the activation of receptor-associated JAK kinases and the recruitment of STATs to the intracellular domains of the receptor (reviewed in Ref. 3Platanias L.C.

The kinases Tyk2 and JAK1 are associated with the intracellular domains of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, respectively (4Colamonici O.R. Uyttendaele H. Domanski P. Yan H. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol.

The JAK kinases consist of a C-terminal kinase domain, an adjacent pseudo-kinase domain, and N-terminal JH3–7 regions. The kinase domain of Tyk2 contains three conserved and functionally important residues: Tyr-1054 and Tyr-1055, which must be phosphorylated for activity, and a critical Lys-930, which is important for kinase activity (6Gauzzi M.C.

Regulation of type I IFN signaling is critical in maintaining homeostasis and for the generation of an appropriate immune response to viral and bacterial infections. SOCS1 is a potent negative regulator of both type I and type II IFN signaling (12Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R.

SOCS1−/− mice are hyperresponsive to type I IFN and have a significantly greater ability than wild-type mice to resolve viral infection independently of IFNγ (13Fenner J.E. Starr R. Cornish A.L. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Schreiber R.D. Sheehan K. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Hertzog P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). SOCS1−/− mice also have a severe inflammatory phenotype because of deregulated type I and II IFN signaling. The SOCS1 protein consists of a central SH2 domain, a C-terminal SOCS box, and an N-terminal region that contains the kinase inhibitory region (KIR). The SOCS box is involved in targeted degradation, whereas the SH2 and KIR domain are involved in protein binding and inhibition of kinase activity, respectively (14Narazaki M. Fujimoto M. Matsumoto T. Morita Y. Saito H. Kajita T. Yoshizaki K. Naka T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13130-13134Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 15Babon J.J. Sabo J.K.

SOCS1 expression is induced by the type I IFNs and then acts in a negative feedback loop to inhibit type I IFN signaling. Crosses of SOCS1−/− mice to IFNAR1−/− mice rescue the inflammatory phenotype, whereas crosses to IFNAR2−/− mice do not suggest that SOCS1 inhibits type I IFN signaling exclusively via IFNAR1 (13Fenner J.E. Starr R. Cornish A.L. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Schreiber R.D. Sheehan K. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Hertzog P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Indeed, coimmunoprecipitation studies in our laboratory demonstrate that SOCS1 is associated with IFNAR1 (13Fenner J.E. Starr R. Cornish A.L. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Schreiber R.D. Sheehan K. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Hertzog P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In other cytokine systems, SOCS proteins have been shown to inhibit signaling either by a direct interaction with intracellular receptors via their phosphotyrosines or indirectly via an interaction with associated JAK kinases. For example, SOCS3 binds directly to phosphotyrosine 757 on gp130 to inhibit signaling via this receptor (16Nicholson S.E. De Souza D. Fabri L.J. Corbin J. Willson T.A. Zhang J.G. Silva A. Asimakis M. Farley A. Nash A.D. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6493-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have demonstrated that this interaction is critical to maintaining the appropriate balance of STAT signaling that otherwise lead to spontaneous diseases that include gastritis and tumors, inflammatory disease of the lungs and hemopoietic abnormalities (17Jenkins B.J. Grail D. Nheu T. Najdovska M. Wang B. Waring P. Inglese M. McLoughlin R.M. Jones S.A. Topley N. Baumann H. Judd L.M. Giraud A.S. Boussioutas A. Zhu H.J. Ernst M. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SOCS1 has been demonstrated to inhibit IFNγ signaling via a direct interaction with phosphotyrosine 441 on IFNGR1 (18Qing Y. Costa-Pereira A.P. Watling D. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1849-1853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Evidence of indirect inhibition via interaction with JAK kinases has also been shown in vitro where the SH2 domain of SOCS1 binds to a phosphotyrosine residue within the Jak2 kinase domain, whereas modeling studies indicated that the KIR stabilizes this association through an interaction with the JAK catalytic pocket (19Giordanetto F.

SOCS1 has also previously been shown to bind and inhibit phosphorylated Tyk2 through an interaction with its SH2 and KIR domains (14Narazaki M. Fujimoto M. Matsumoto T. Morita Y. Saito H. Kajita T. Yoshizaki K. Naka T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13130-13134Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because the SOCS proteins, including SOCS1, have the capacity to bind either to a receptor phosphotyrosine or to a JAK family member, we have undertaken to investigate the mechanism whereby SOCS1 regulates type I IFN signaling. Our results demonstrate that rather than a direct interaction with IFNAR1, SOCS1 inhibits IFNAR signaling through an interaction with Tyk2 via its SH2 and KIR domains. Furthermore, we have discovered a novel role of SOCS1 in the inhibition of an activating Lys-63 polyubiquitination of Tyk2. IFNAR1−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Mice used include SOCS1−/−IFNγ−/− and SOCS1+/+IFNγ−/− on a C57BL/6 background as well as wild-type C57BL/6 mice and were housed in specific pathogen free conditions at Monash Medical Centre Animal Facility. Whole thymus from SOCS1−/−IFNγ−/−, SOCS1+/+IFNγ−/−, and wild-type mice were harvested and filtered through 70-μm nylon cell strainers in 1% FCS DMEM to create a single cell suspension. Red blood cells were lysed in Tris-buffered NH4Cl solution for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice, counted (Sysmex cell counter), plated at 1 × 107 cells/ml in 1% FCS DMEM, and allowed to rest for 2 h prior to stimulations. pEF-BOS-SOCS1-FLAG constructs are as described in (22Nicholson S.E.

Plasmids pEF-ubiquitin, pEF-Ub-K48-HA and pEF-Ub-K63-HA were a kind gift from Neal Silverman (University of Massachusetts). pEF-Ub-K63-HA contains all lysines mutated to arginine except Lys-63 and thus forms only Lys-63 ubiquitin linkages. pEF-Ub-K48-HA contains all lysines mutated to arginine except Lys-48 and thus forms only Lys-48 ubiquitin linkages. Tyk2-HIS and Tyk2KD-GST were cloned into pEF-BOS. The Tyk2 Y1054F/Y1055F mutations were achieved by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.

Thymocytes were stimulated with 10,000 IU of IFNα for 0, 30, and 60 min.

Lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, 5× β-ME sample buffer was added, and the lysates were boiled. Protein lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE analyses and Western blotting. Blotting was performed with appropriate antibodies for the detection of Tyk2 (anti-Tyk2, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP) or β-tubulin (anti-β-tubulin (Abcam), rabbit anti-mouse IgG-HRP).

Cells were then washed twice and resuspended in 100 μl of Alexa Fluour 488 (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:200 in wash buffer) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Following an additional two washes, cells were resuspended in 400 μl of wash buffer containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide. Fluorescent staining on the cells was analyzed on a BD FACS CANTO II (BD Biosciences). To determine the critical regions of SOCS1 involved in the interaction with IFNAR1, we generated a series of SOCS1 mutants and tested their effect on IFN signaling using an ISRE luciferase assay (Fig. 1). IFNAR1−/− MEFs were transiently cotransfected with an ISRE luciferase reporter, a TK-Renilla reporter, IFNAR1, and either FLAG-tagged SOCS1 or SOCS1 mutants. We compared the ability of SOCS1 and the SOCS1 mutant proteins to inhibit IFNα-induced luciferase activity. A mutation in a critical region of SOCS1 would abolish its ability to inhibit interferon signaling and thus luciferase activity. In the absence of SOCS1, IFNα-induced luciferase activity was robustly and reproducibly induced approximately 4-fold in this system, and the induced level is normalized to 100%. The addition of SOCS1 significantly reduced luciferase activity to approximately uninduced levels (around 30%). Deletion of the SOCS box plus SH2 domain (S1Δ82–212) was inactive, indicating the importance of these two domains for activity. Furthermore, deletion of the SOCS box alone (S1Δ170–212) retained activity, indicating the importance of the SH2 domain. This was reinforced by the lack of activity of the S1R105K mutant, which contains a mutation within the critical residue of the SOCS1 SH2 domain. The remaining constructs (S1Δ1–76, S1F59A, and S1D64R) demonstrate that deletion or mutation of critical residues in the KIR domain are also important for SOCS activity. Given the importance of the SH2 domain and its characteristic of binding phosphotyrosine residues in the target proteins, we next sought to determine the interacting partner of SOCS1 in the type I IFN signaling complex. Previous genetic studies involving IFNAR1−/−SOCS1−/− and IFNAR2−/−SOCS1−/− mice indicated that SOCS1 specifically regulates the type I IFN receptor via an interaction with IFNAR1 and not IFNAR2 (13Fenner J.E. Starr R. Cornish A.L. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Schreiber R.D. Sheehan K. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Hertzog P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Because SH2 domains are known to associate with phosphotyrosine residues and because our results above showed that the SH2 domain is critical for SOCS1-mediated inhibition of type I IFN signaling, we investigated whether SOCS1 inhibits activity by binding to a phosphotyrosine within the intracellular domain of IFNAR1, as shown for the type II IFN receptor, IFNGR1 (18Qing Y. Costa-Pereira A.P. Watling D. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1849-1853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was tested by a luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 2A) and coimmunoprecipitation studies (B). A series of constructs containing single and multiple tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutations in residues in the intracellular domain of IFNAR1 were utilized to first test the ability of SOCS1 to inhibit signaling in an ISRE luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 2A). IFNAR1−/− MEFs were transiently cotransfected with an ISRE luciferase reporter, a TK-Renilla reporter, IFNAR1, or IFNAR1 tyrosine mutants (as specified) with and without SOCS1-FLAG. The luciferase activity induced by wild-type IFNAR1 in the absence of SOCS1 (again approximately 4-fold in these experiments) is normalized to 100%. All IFNAR1 tyrosine mutant proteins were able to induce luciferase activity to similar levels as wild-type IFNAR1 (in the absence of SOCS1), indicating that the tyrosine residues within the intracellular region of IFNAR1 are not essential for activation of ISRE signaling in this system. Also unexpectedly, in the presence of SOCS1, the luciferase activity induced by IFN stimulation of all IFNAR1 tyrosine mutant proteins was comparable with the inhibition seen with wild-type IFNAR1, including the 4F mutant whereby all four intracellular tyrosine residues of IFNAR1 are mutated to phenylalanine (approximately 30–40%). These results demonstrate that SOCS1 does not interact directly with IFNAR1 phosphotyrosine residues in its intracellular domain but rather uses an alternative mechanism for interaction. Thus, we next generated truncated forms of IFNAR1, terminating at amino acid 471 or 511, that flank the Tyk2 binding site of IFNAR1. The truncation mutant, IFNAR1Δ471, was unable to induce ISRE activity in response to IFN stimulation, consistent with the critical nature of Tyk2 for this activity. Thus, inhibition by SOCS1 could not be determined. The truncation mutant IFNAR1Δ511 was still able to signal at levels comparable with wild-type IFNAR1, with signaling still able to be inhibited by the addition of SOCS1. This suggests that SOCS1 inhibits signaling by binding to a region of IFNAR1 proximal to this truncation site. The putative association of IFNAR1 with SOCS1 was further tested by coimmunoprecipitation studies to confirm the data above (Fig. 2B). We found that SOCS1-FLAG was coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type IFNAR1, IFNAR1(4F), and IFNAR1Δ511 but not IFNAR1Δ471. As SOCS1 was coimmunoprecipitated with IFNAR1(4F), it confirms the above conclusion that SOCS1 does not bind tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain of IFNAR1. Because SOCS1 coimmunoprecipitated with IFNAR1Δ511 but not IFNAR1Δ471, our results suggest that SOCS1 interacts with IFNAR1 either directly or indirectly within this region, likely via Tyk2. To demonstrate that SOCS1 interacted with Tyk2 and to characterize this interaction, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with SOCS1-FLAG and either Tyk2KD-GST or Tyk2KD(2F)-GST in which the tyrosines at residues 1054 and 1055 were mutated to phenylalanines. The latter were included because the SOCS1 SH2 domain dependence of the IFN signal suppression would imply SOCS1-bound phosphotyrosines on Tyk2. Importantly, SOCS1-FLAG is indeed coimmunoprecipitated with Tyk2KD-GST. By contrast, Tyk2KD(2F)-GST interaction is almost completely inhibited (Fig. 3A). These results are consistent with these tyrosine residues being important for SOCS1 docking onto Tyk2. Because our results above demonstrated the importance of the KIR domain in inhibition of signaling, we investigated SOCS1 KIR mutants (SOCS1F59A and SOCS1D64R) for their binding to Tyk2 in a coimmunoprecipitation experiment. Where wild-type SOCS1 bound to Tyk2KD, these mutants failed to interact with wild-type Tyk2KD or Tyk2KD(2F), suggesting that the KIR of SOCS1 is essential for Tyk2 binding and thus inhibition of signaling. Because SOCS1 binding can target proteins for degradation and thus impact the levels of these critical signaling molecules, we investigated the effect of SOCS1 on cellular levels of Tyk2. Firstly, Tyk2-HIS was transfected into HEK293T cells in the presence and absence of SOCS1-FLAG. In the presence of SOCS1, Tyk2 expression was reduced (Fig. 3B). Next we analyzed the effect of SOCS1 on the endogenous levels of Tyk2. Analysis of thymocytes from SOCS1−/−IFNγ−/− and SOCS1+/+IFNγ−/− mice demonstrated that SOCS1 modified the Tyk2 expression levels (Fig. 3C). In the SOCS1+/+ thymocytes, Tyk2 levels were significantly reduced by 60 min after stimulation with IFNα. In contrast, in the SOCS1−/− thymocytes, not only was the (SOCS1-mediated) reduction in Tyk2 levels lost, but Tyk2 levels increased with IFN stimulation. Together with our overexpression data it is evident SOCS1 has an important regulatory role in type I IFN signaling through its interaction with Tyk2 and the reduction of its levels in the cell. One method of SOCS1-induced degradation of binding partners is via the SOCS box recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases (26Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 27Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G.

Thus, we investigated the ability of Tyk2 to be ubiquitinated in the presence and absence of SOCS1. Firstly, Tyk2-HIS was overexpressed with or without ubiquitin-HA, ubiquitin-(K63)-HA, or ubiquitin-(K48)-HA and/or SOCS1-FLAG or SOCS1Δ170–212-FLAG (Fig. 4A, first through fourth lanes). Following immunoprecipitation of Tyk2 and detection of total ubiquitination using ubiquitin-HA, we found that Tyk2 is indeed spontaneously ubiquitinated in this system and that coexpression with SOCS1 surprisingly inhibited this ubiquitination. We then investigated the type of ubiquitination using mutant ubiquitin constructs, which form Lys-63- or Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains. These different ubiquitin linkages result in different conformations and activation of alternate pathways (28Tenno T. Fujiwara K. Tochio H. Iwai K. Morita E.H. Hayashi H. Murata S. Hiroaki H. Sato M. Tanaka K. Shirakawa M. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Lys-48 linkages are primarily used for targeting the protein for degradation via the proteasome. In contrast, Lys-63 linkages have been implicated in numerous other functions, including activation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (29Jin X. Jin H.R. Jung H.S. Lee S.J. Lee J.H. Lee J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 30539-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A (fifth through ninth lanes), our data demonstrates that Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination of Tyk2 was not detected, whereas Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination was observed. In addition, the use of ubiquitin-(Lys-63)-HA resulted in increased ubiquitination of Tyk2 compared with wild-type ubiquitin-HA and may be explained either by the greater specificity of this reagent or by the mutation of lysine residues involved in negative regulation. Importantly, SOCS1 coexpression suppressed Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of Tyk2. The expression of SOCS1Δ170–212 (lacking the SOCS box) also inhibited Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of Tyk2, although to a lesser extent. We next investigated the impact of whether the phosphotyrosine residues of Tyk2 that were involved in binding SOCS1 were involved in ubiquitination. Our results show that the Tyk2 kinase domain was polyubiquitinated (Fig. 4B). Tyk2KD(2F) was also Lys-63 polyubiquitinated. As Tyk2 requires phosphorylation of these mutated tyrosine residues for its function our results suggest that Lys-63 ubiquitination of the Tyk2 kinase domain is not dependent on Tyk2 phosphorylation and activation. Tyk2 has been reported to be involved in stabilization of IFNAR1 at the plasma membrane (30Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because SOCS1 binds Tyk2 and modulates both its degradation and its activating ubiquitination, it is possible that the interaction of SOCS1 with IFNAR1 via its associated Tyk2 modifies cell surface expression levels. Flow cytometry was used to measure the surface expression of IFNAR1 in primary thymocytes from SOCS1−/−IFNγ−/−, SOCS1+/+IFNγ−/−, and wild-type mice (Fig. 5). After IFN stimulation, IFNAR1 surface levels are reduced in all three genotypes. However, in SOCS1−/−IFNγ−/− thymocytes, IFNAR1 surface expression was reduced to a lesser extent than that in thymocytes from SOCS1+/+IFNγ−/− and wild-type mice one and two h after IFN stimulation (Fig. 5A). Thus, SOCS1 either accelerated the internalization or degradation of the receptor or increased recycling/resynthesis. Cycloheximide (CHX) was used, where shown, to block de novo protein synthesis in thymocytes from all three genotypes, thereby allowing us to measure the real rate of internalization in the absence of de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 5B). In the presence of cycloheximide there was again significantly more IFNAR1 present on the surface of SOCS1−/− cells compared with control cells at the 1-h time point. Our results therefore demonstrate that the surface levels of IFNAR1 during a response are modulated by SOCS1, likely through its interaction with Tyk2. SOCS1 regulation of type I IFN signaling is critical in maintaining an appropriate immune response and to survival. The data presented here complement our previous in vivo data, which demonstrate that SOCS1 regulates signaling through the IFNAR1 component of the receptor. We now add mechanistic data showing how this occurs. Indeed, SOCS1 regulation of type I IFN signaling is mediated via an interaction with the IFNAR1-associated kinase Tyk2 and not by direct interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases. This distinguishes the mechanism of SOCS1 regulation of type I IFN signaling from how it modulates type II IFNγ signaling. This study suggests that in the type I IFN system none of the intracellular tyrosine residues within IFNAR1 are important for the negative regulation of type I IFN signaling via SOCS1. Indeed, they are not required for driving ISRE (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9)-dependent signaling nor for STAT3 signaling as shown recently and thus not for gamma-interferon activated sequence (GAS) element activation (23Zhao W.

It would be interesting to investigate the impact of these residues in the receptors and of SOCS1 on other type I IFN signaling pathways. Consequently, these results demonstrate that for the type I IFN signaling complex the interaction of SOCS1 is mediated indirectly via an adaptor molecule. Within the type I IFN system, SOCS1 requires its KIR and SH2 domains for its inhibitory function, indicating a requirement for SOCS1 interaction with the kinase and phosphotyrosine residues. Our coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the Tyk2 binding region of IFNAR1 was required for the interaction with SOCS1. Previous studies have found a direct interaction between Tyk2 and SOCS1 and a requirement of the Tyk2 SH2 domain and SOCS1 KIR domain (14Narazaki M. Fujimoto M. Matsumoto T. Morita Y. Saito H. Kajita T. Yoshizaki K. Naka T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13130-13134Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), but these studies were not performed in the context of the type I IFN receptor signaling complex as described herein. Here we show that SOCS1 binds conserved tyrosine residues within the Tyk2 catalytic region (Tyr-1054 and Tyr-1055), which are phosphorylated in response to IFNα and are required for Tyk2 activation (6Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L. McKendry R. Mogensen K.E. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20494-20500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mutation of these residues from tyrosine to phenylalanine resulted in almost complete inhibition of the interaction between Tyk2 and SOCS1. Our results therefore suggest that the SOCS1 interaction with Tyk2 is limited to the activated, phosphorylated kinase behaving in a negative feedback manner. In addition to a requirement of the SH2 domain, we also found that the KIR domain of SOCS1 is important for binding to Tyk2 and for its inhibitory action of IFN signaling. Modeling studies have proposed that the KIR domain of SOCS1 mimics the activation loop of Jak2 and obstructs its catalytic groove (19Giordanetto F. Kroemer R.T. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This region is highly conserved across JAK family members, and thus it is probable that the KIR domain of SOCS1 can also interact with and inhibit Tyk2 catalytic function. The SOCS box has been implicated previously in the recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases and the consequent ubiquitination and destruction of target proteins (26Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 27Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G. Kile B.J. Kent S.B. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of SOCS1 on Tyk2 ubiquitination and, quite interestingly, found that SOCS1 expression inhibited rather than facilitated the ubiquitination of Tyk2. Analysis of the type of ubiquitination of Tyk2 found that it was Lys-63- linked and not Lys-48-linked ubiquitination. In other signaling systems, Lys-63-linked ubiquitination is associated with activation of target proteins. For example, Lys-63 ubiquitination of the NF-κB-inducing kinase by zinc finger protein 91 contributes to stabilization and tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase (29Jin X. Jin H.R. Jung H.S. Lee S.J. Lee J.H. Lee J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 30539-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, SOCS1 may exert its negative effects on Tyk2 in part via inhibiting an activating or stabilizing Lys-63 ubiquitination. A mutant SOCS1 protein lacking the SOCS box was also able to inhibit the Lys-63 ubiquitination of Tyk2 and, thus, the SOCS box does not appear to be essential for this function. The mechanism of SOCS1 inhibition of ubiquitination may be via blocking the ubiquitination site of Tyk2, which we found was located within the Tyk2 kinase domain, the same region of Tyk2 to which SOCS1 binds. As SOCS1 coexpression with Tyk2 resulted in reduced Tyk2 levels, it is probable that inhibition of this ubiquitination by SOCS1 destabilizes Tyk2. As SOCS1 did not enhance ubiquitination, as might have been expected, the SOCS1 SOCS box appears to not have a critical role in the regulation of Tyk2. Our luciferase assay supports this conclusion because SOCS1 lacking the SOCS box still enabled significant inhibition of type I IFN signaling. The affinity of the SOCS1 SOCS box for E3 ubiquitin ligases is significantly weaker than that of the other SOCS family members (15Babon J.J. Sabo J.K. Zhang J.G. Nicola N.A. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 162-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Deletion of the SOCS1 SOCS box in mice, however, resulted in reduced function of SOCS1 in response to IFNγ (32Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Rakar S. Asimakis M. Greenhalgh C.J. Willson T.A. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Carter W. Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13261-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This may be attributed to the SOCS box stabilizing SOCS1 through recruitment of other proteins. In our overexpression assays we saw slight, although not statistically significant, differences between wild-type SOCS1 and the SOCS box mutant. Perhaps in vivo a more significant role of the SOCS box in type I IFN signaling would be seen. The Lys-63 linked ubiquitination of Tyk2 is also a novel finding and warrants further investigation. A candidate residue for ubiquitination is lysine 930, located within the Tyk2 kinase domain. A mutation of this residue destabilizes Tyk2 and reduces kinase activity (6Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L. McKendry R. Mogensen K.E. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20494-20500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition to facilitating IFN signal transduction by activation of STAT interactions with the receptor, Tyk2 is required for the stabilization of IFNAR1 at the plasma membrane. We postulated that the SOCS1 interaction with Tyk2 may therefore result in the destabilization of Tyk2 and the dissociation of Tyk2 from IFNAR1, leading to reduced surface levels of the receptor. In human cells lacking Tyk2, IFNAR1 is only weakly expressed at the cell surface and is instead found localized in perinuclear endosomal compartments, constituting early and recycling endosomes (30Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). An internalization motif of human IFNAR1, located within the Tyk2 binding site, is polyubiquitinated and targeted for degradation (33Kumar K.G. Barriere H. Carbone C.J. Liu J. Swaminathan G. Xu P. Li Y. Baker D.P. Peng J. Lukacs G.L. Fuchs S.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 935-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Increased expression of Tyk2 results in increased localization of IFNAR1 to the cell surface and reduced degradation of IFNAR1 due in part to reduced endocytosis (30Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In our overexpression experiments we found that SOCS1 reduced Tyk2 expression and that in primary thymocytes the absence of SOCS1 resulted in increased endogenous Tyk2 expression 1 h after IFN stimulation. Analysis of IFNAR1 internalization in thymocytes demonstrated a role for SOCS1 in controlling IFNAR1 surface expression following IFNα stimulation. Although not significantly different basally, IFNAR1 internalization/recycling is reduced in cells lacking SOCS1 following 1-h IFNα stimulation and correlates with increased endogenous expression of Tyk2. SOCS1 therefore has a role in effecting the surface expression of IFNAR1 during an interferon response. SOCS1 association of Tyk2 following its phosphorylation and activation may result in destabilization of Tyk2 and exposure of the IFNAR1 internalization motif with subsequent IFNAR1 internalization and reduced IFN signaling. Together these studies demonstrate the mechanism of SOCS1 inhibition of type I IFN signaling. An understanding of this mechanism may lead to novel approaches to manipulate the type I IFN response and thus contribute to better therapeutic treatments of IFN-mediated diseases or enhancement of the beneficial therapeutic effects of IFN."

We hypothesized that the existence of multiple modified sialic acid structures has biological importance related to their interaction with proteins or microorganisms. To further explore the recognition and function of modified sialic acid residues, we exploited the development of new chemoenzymatic methods to synthesize modified sialic acids (5Chen X. Varki A.

The resultant microarray consists of 77 sialylated glycans incorporating 16 modified sialic acids in α2–3 and α2–6 linkages to different underlying structures. This novel sialylated glycan microarray is useful for rapidly screening glycan-binding proteins and viruses for their interactions with a wide variety of modified sialic acids and represents a new glycomic technology to explore glycan function and recognition. Free reducing glycans lactose, lacto-N-tetraose (Galβ1-3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc; LNT), and lacto-N-neotetraose (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc; LNnT) and all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Asialo, biantennary N-glycan (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manβ1–6(Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manβ1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc; NA2) was prepared from a chicken egg yolk glycopeptide (26Seko A. Koketsu M. Nishizono M.

The bifunctional linker, 2-amino(N-aminoethyl) benzamide (AEAB), was prepared as described previously (27Song X. Xia B. Stowell S.R. Lasanajak Y. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 36-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). HPLC solvents were purchased from Fisher. An Ultraflex-II TOF/TOF system from Bruker Daltonics was used for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of glycan conjugates. Biotinylated ConA, Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA-I), Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), and Maackia amurensis lectin (MAL-I) were from Vector Laboratories; Cy5- and Alexa488-labeled streptavidin were from Invitrogen; and Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase was from Sigma. Free reducing glycans were conjugated with AEAB as described previously (27Song X. Xia B. Stowell S.R. Lasanajak Y. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 36-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–10 mg of glycan was mixed with 50–250 μl of AEAB hydrochloride salt solution freshly prepared at 0.35 m in DMSO/AcOH (7:3, v/v) followed by an equal volume of sodium cyanoborohydride solution freshly prepared in the same solvent. The mixture was vortexed briefly and incubated at 65 °C for 2 h. The mixture was chilled, and the products were precipitated upon the addition of 10 volumes of acetonitrile. After bringing the suspension to −20 °C and maintaining that temperature for 30 min, the products were separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min. The pellet was redissolved in 200–500 μl of water and purified by HPLC. AEAB derivatives of LNnT, LNT, and the biantennary N-glycan, NA2, were prepared as precursors for presentation of modified sialic acids. Sialyl glycans containing various natural modifications of sialic acid linked α2–3 or α2–6 to the three different fluorescent glycans described above were synthesized using a highly efficient one-pot three-enzyme system similar to that reported previously (19Yu H.

The fluorescent glycan-AEAB conjugates (GAEABs) of LNT, LNnT, or NA2 (130–200 μg) were incubated with three enzymes, including Escherichia coli sialic acid aldolase (28Yu H. Yu H. Karpel R. Chen X.

The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h (for preparing α2–3-sialylated glycans using PmST1) or 24 h (for preparing α2–6-sialylated glycans using P. damselae α2–6-sialyltransferase). A Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, was used for substrates containing a base sensitive functional group (e.g. acetyl or lactyl group). The following were added to this mixture: (a) sialic acid precursors (20Yu H. Huang S. Chokhawala H. Sun M. Zheng H. Chen X. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C. Product formation was monitored by TLC in EtOAc/MeOH/H2O/HOAc (4:2:1:0.1) and visualized by a UV lamp to follow modification of the fluorescent sialic acid acceptor. When the product formation reached a maximum, the reaction mixtures were frozen. The reaction mixtures were then mixed with 2 volumes of ethanol to precipitate enzymes and cooled at −20 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min, the supernatant containing the products and excess reactants was purified by porous graphitized carbon (PGC)-HPLC. The collected peaks were dried in a SpeedVac, reconstituted in 100 μl of water, and purified again by PGC-HPLC when necessary. The purified major product of each reaction was reprofiled using ion exchange HPLC to confirm homogeneity and charge state and to quantify each glycan based on fluorescence and UV. They were also characterized by MALDI-TOF to confirm the generation of the anticipated product of the sialyltransferase from starting N-acetylhexosamine, hexosamine, hexose, or appropriately modified derivative, pyruvate, and CTP. A Shimadzu HPLC CBM-20A system, coupled with a UV detector SPD-20A and a fluorescence detector RF-10Axl, was used for HPLC analysis and separation of GAEABs. The column effluent was monitored by UV absorption at 330 nm and/or fluorescence at 330 nm excitation and 420 nm emission. Both UV absorption and fluorescence intensity were used for the quantification of the AEAB derivatives using lacto-N-fucopentaose (LNFPIII)-AEAB as a standard. For reverse phase HPLC with a PGC column (150 × 4.6 mm), the mobile phase was acetonitrile and water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). For the glycan analysis and purification, the concentration of acetonitrile increased from 15 to 45% in 30 or 15 min. For ion exchange HPLC using a Varian IonoSpher HPLC column (250 × 4.6 mm), an isocratic program with 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5, was used. NHS-activated slides were purchased from Schott (Louisville, KY). Non-contact printing was performed using a Piezorray printer from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The printing, binding assay, and scanning conditions were essentially the same as described previously (21Bohnsack R.N. Song X. Olson L.J. Kudo M. Gotschall R.R. Canfield W.M. Cummings R.D.

Briefly, all samples were printed at 100 μm in phosphate buffer (300 mm sodium phosphates, pH 8.5) in replicates of four. Before the assay, the slides were rehydrated for 5 min in TSM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm sodium chloride (NaCl), 2 mm calcium chloride (CaCl2), and 2 mm magnesium chloride (MgCl2). Samples are applied to the rehydrated slide in TSM buffer containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in a final volume of 70–100 μl under a coverslip that covers the printed area on the slide, and the slides are incubated in a humidified chamber at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, the coverslip is gently removed, and excess sample is washed away by gently dipping the slides in buffer contained in Coplin jars. Biotinylated lectins binding to glycans on the array were detected by a secondary incubation with cyanine 5- or Alexa488-streptavidin, whereas labeled viruses were assayed immediately after washing. The slides were scanned with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ProScanarray microarray scanner equipped with four lasers covering an excitation range from 488 to 637 nm. For cyanine 5 fluorescence, 649 nm (excitation) and 670 nm (emission) were used. For Alexa488 fluorescence, 495 nm (excitation) and 510 nm (emission) were used. All images obtained from the scanner are in grayscale and colored for easy discrimination. The scanned images were analyzed with the ScanArray Express software, which provided raw values in relative fluorescence units (RFU) from each spot in an Excel spreadsheet. The data from the scanner were processed in the Excel workbook to average and determine the S.D. of the four replicates. The %CV (coefficient of variation expressed in percent) is calculated as 100 × S.D./mean. For any value with a %CV of >30, the data are evaluated to determine the presence of an unacceptable value. The range of the acceptance for the raw RFU is the value of one S.D. below and above average. Thus, if a raw RFU value of the four replicates is outside the range, it is discarded, and only the raw RFU in the range is used to calculate the final value of average, S.D., and %CV. Human parainfluenza and influenza A viruses were grown in LLC-MK2 cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, respectively, in infection medium as described previously (30Liu C. Eichelberger M.C. Compans R.W. Air G.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1099-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virus was purified through a sucrose gradient at 10–60% (human parainfluenza virus; hPIV) or 10–40% (influenza), harvested by ultracentrifugation, resuspended in calcium-magnesium saline, and labeled directly with AlexaFluor 488 (Molecular Probes) as described previously (31Kumari K. Gulati S. Smith D.F. Gulati U. Cummings R.D. Air G.M. Virol. J. 2007; 4: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We chose a synthetic strategy that combined two earlier developments, the bifunctional fluorescent tag AEAB (27Song X. Xia B. Stowell S.R. Lasanajak Y. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 36-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and the one-pot three-enzyme sialylation reaction (19Yu H. Chokhawala H. Karpel R. Yu H. Wu B. Zhang J.

GAEABs are fluorescent and enable us to isolate and process glycans on a microscale. In addition, they have a primary amino group for immobilization onto activated glass surfaces to generate glycan microarrays. Using GAEABs with terminal galactose residues as acceptors for sialyltransferases, we explored a one-pot three-enzyme sialylation system to synthesize terminally sialylated glycans with various sialic acid modifications. The GAEAB acceptors included lactose, LNnT, LNT, and NA2, which were prepared from natural glycans as described previously (27Song X. Xia B. Stowell S.R. Lasanajak Y. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 36-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and purified prior to the multienzyme sialylation. Aliquots (50 μg to 1 mg) of the GAEABs were subjected to one-pot three-enzyme enzymatic sialylation in a combinatorial fashion (16Chokhawala H.A. Huang S. Lau K. Yu H. Cheng J. Thon V. Hurtado-Ziola N. Guerrero J.A. Varki A. Chen X. ACS Chem. Biol. 2008; 3: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The application of N-acetylmannosamine, N-glycolylmannosamine, Man, or their derivatives in the enzymatic reactions containing a sialic acid aldolase, a CMP-sialic acid synthetase, CTP, and a sialyltransferase allows formation of corresponding sialosides containing terminal Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galactonononic acid (Kdn), or their derivatives, respectively, as summarized in supplemental Table 1. Because the enzymatic sialylation efficiency varied dramatically among different reactions, the products were purified by HPLC. Profiles of four of the 77 reaction mixtures are shown as examples in Fig. 2, and the structures and homogeneity of each purified sialylated glycan were confirmed by MALDI-TOF and HPLC analysis shown for each sialyl glycan in supplemental Fig. 1. Because the sialylated glycan products are fluorescent, even small amounts of the isolated products (∼1 nmol) are accurately quantified for printing on NHS-activated glass slides. As shown in Table 1 and supplemental Table 2, we generated 77 α2–3- or α2–6-sialylated structures incorporating 16 different terminal sialic acids (Fig. 3a) on four different underlying glycan structures (Fig. 3b) that were tagged with a functional fluorescent linker (Fig. 3c). Each glycan was quantified based on its fluorescence and printed in replicates of n = 4 on NHS-activated glass slides as described previously (27Song X. Xia B. Stowell S.R. Lasanajak Y. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 36-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) to provide a sialylated glycan microarray (SGM). The selection of this set of sialic acid structures is based on structures of known importance, natural occurrence, and higher abundance, along with current chemical accessibility. Of the 16 sialic acid structures selected for synthesis, four (Neu5Ac, Neu5,9Ac2, Neu5Ac9Lt, and Kdn) are known to occur in humans, and only three (Neu5Ac9Me, Kdn9Me, and Kdn7Me) are not known to occur or are yet to be discovered in nature. The large diversity of sialic acid structures on common acceptors printed as a glycan microarray facilitates defining the specific interactions of different binding proteins and microorganisms.FIGURE 2HPLC profiles of LNnT-AEAB and several sialylated products, including Neu5Acα2–6-LNnT-AEAB, Neu5Gcα2–6-LNnT-AEAB, Neu5Acα2-3-LNnT-AEAB, and Neu5Gcα2–3-LNnT-AEAB (from bottom to top).

https://openalex.org/W2041262524,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) α4 and β2 subunits assemble in two alternate stoichiometries to produce (α4β2)(2)α4 and (α4β2)(2)β2, which display different agonist sensitivities. Functionally relevant agonist binding sites are thought to be located at α4(+)/β2(-) subunit interfaces, but because these interfaces are present in both receptor isoforms, it is unlikely that they account for differences in agonist sensitivities. In contrast, incorporation of either α4 or β2 as auxiliary subunits produces isoform-specific α4(+)/α4(-) or β2(+)/β2(-) interfaces. Using fully concatenated (α4β2)(2)α4 nAChRs in conjunction with structural modeling, chimeric receptors, and functional mutagenesis, we have identified an additional site at the α4(+)/α4(-) interface that accounts for isoform-specific agonist sensitivity of the (α4β2)(2)α4 nAChR. The additional site resides in a region that also contains a potentiating Zn(2+) site but is engaged by agonists to contribute to receptor activation. By engineering α4 subunits to provide a free cysteine in loop C at the α4(+)α4(-) interface, we demonstrated that the acetylcholine responses of the mutated receptors are attenuated or enhanced, respectively, following treatment with the sulfhydryl reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate or aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate. The findings suggest that agonist occupation of the site at the α4(+)/(α4(-) interface leads to channel gating through a coupling mechanism involving loop C. Overall, we propose that the additional agonist site at the α4(+)/α4(-) interface, when occupied by agonist, contributes to receptor activation and that this additional contribution underlies the agonist sensitivity signature of (α4β2)(2)α4 nAChRs."

Here, we show that overexpression of a group 2 σ factor, SigE, enhances the expressions of sugar catabolic genes in the unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes for the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and glycogen catabolism are induced by overproduction of SigE. Immunoblotting showed that protein levels of sugar catabolic enzymes, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glycogen phosphorylase, and isoamylase, are increased. Glycogen levels are reduced in the SigE-overexpressing strain grown under light. Metabolome analysis revealed that metabolite levels of the TCA cycle and acetyl-CoA are significantly altered by SigE overexpression. The SigE-overexpressing strain also exhibited defective growth under mixotrophic or dark conditions. Thus, SigE overexpression changes sugar catabolism at the transcript to phenotype levels, suggesting a σ factor-based engineering method for modifying carbon metabolism in photosynthetic bacteria.

IntroductionCarbon metabolism in photosynthetic organisms has received considerable attention because increasing carbon emission is thought to be the cause of global warming. Primary production is governed not only by land plants but also by ocean-dwelling phytoplanktons, including cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are widely distributed in diverse ecological niches, and the unicellular cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803) is one of the most widely used species for the study of photosynthetic bacteria. The genome of Synechocystis 6803 was first determined in 1996 (1Kaneko T.

Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 2109-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).The engineering of carbon metabolism leads to modified production of various metabolites; however, the robust control of primary metabolism often obstructs such modification. For example, overexpression of the genes of eight enzymes in yeast cells did not increase ethanol formation or key metabolite levels (5Schaaff I. Heinisch J. Zimmermann F.K. Yeast. 1989; 5: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Several researchers have modified genes encoding transcriptional regulators instead of metabolic enzymes. Yanagisawa et al. (6Yanagisawa S. Akiyama A. Kisaka H. Uchimiya H. Miwa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7833-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) generated transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing increased levels of the Dof1 transcription factor, which is an activator of gene expression associated with organic acid metabolism, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Overexpression of Dof1 resulted in increased enzymatic activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate kinase, increased metabolite levels, such as amino acids (asparagine, glutamine, and glutamate), and better growth under low nitrogen conditions (6Yanagisawa S. Akiyama A. Kisaka H. Uchimiya H. Miwa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7833-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These results indicate that modification of transcriptional regulator(s) is practical for metabolic engineering.Primary carbon metabolism is divided into anabolic reactions, such as the Calvin cycle and gluconeogenesis, and catabolic reactions, such as glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) 2The abbreviations used are: OPPoxidative pentose phosphateCE/MScapillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometryGlc-6-PDglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenaseGTglucose-tolerant6PGD6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenaseDIGdigoxigenin. pathway (7Osanai T. Azuma M. Tanaka K. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2007; 6: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Glycogen, the carbon sink of most cyanobacteria, provides carbon sources and reducing power under heterotrophic conditions. Glycogen degradation is catalyzed by glycogen catabolic enzymes, such as glycogen phosphorylase (encoded by glgP) and isoamylase (encoded by glgX). The genome of Synechocystis 6803 contains two glgP (sll1356 and slr1367) and two glgX (slr0237 and slr1857) genes (8Fu J. Xu X. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 260: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A metabolomic study showed that glucose produced from glycogen is degraded mainly through the OPP pathway under heterotrophic conditions (9Yang C. Hua Q. Shimizu K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 58: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glc-6-PD, encoded by zwf) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD, encoded by gnd) are key enzymes of the OPP pathway, producing NADPH and pentose phosphate for nucleotide biosynthesis. Cyanobacterial Glc-6-PD is up-regulated by OpcA through protein-protein interaction, and opcA is essential for NADPH production during nighttime (10Hagen K.D. Meeks J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11477-11486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Min H. Golden S.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6214-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The transcript levels of genes of the OPP pathway are altered by light-dark transition, circadian cycle, or nitrogen status (12Osanai T. Kanesaki Y. Nakano T. Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M.

DNA Res. 2006; 13: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, sugar catabolic enzymes, including Glc-6-PD and 6PGD, are regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels in cyanobacteria.σ factors, subunits of the bacterial RNA polymerase, are divided into four groups, and cyanobacteria are characterized by possessing multiple group 2 σ factors, whose promoter recognition is similar to group 1 σ factor (15Tanaka K.

Plant. 2008; 133: 490-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transcriptome analysis revealed that the disruption of sigE, one of four group 2 σ factors in Synechocystis, results in decreased transcript levels of three glycolytic genes (pfkA, encoding phosphofructokinase; gap1, encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; and pyk, encoding pyruvate kinase), four OPP pathway genes (zwf, opcA, gnd, and tal (encoding transaldolase)), and two glycogen catabolic genes (glgP (sll1356) and glgX (slr0237)) (12Osanai T. Kanesaki Y. Nakano T. Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M. Kanehisa M. Suzuki I. Murata N. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30653-30659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). SigE protein levels and activities are controlled in response to light signals (17Osanai T. Imashimizu M. Seki A. Sato S. Tabata S. Imamura S. Asayama M. Ikeuchi M. Tanaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6860-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Phenotypic analysis showed that the disruption of sigE results in decreased level of glycogen and reduced viability under dark conditions (12Osanai T. Kanesaki Y. Nakano T. Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M. Kanehisa M. Suzuki I. Murata N. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30653-30659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, transcriptome and phenotypic analyses indicate that SigE is a positive regulator of sugar catabolism, although proteomic and metabolomic analyses have not been performed.In this study, we generated a SigE-overexpressing strain and measured the transcript, protein, and metabolite levels and the phenotypes associated with sugar catabolism. We revealed that SigE overexpression activates the expressions of sugar catabolic enzymes and modifies the amounts of glycogen, acetyl-CoA, and metabolites of the TCA cycle.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we generated a strain overexpressing SigE, and the data showed that sugar catabolism is widely regulated by SigE at the transcript, protein, metabolite, and phenotype levels. The results indicate that RNA polymerase σ factor SigE plays pivotal roles in the transcriptional control of genes involved in primary carbon metabolism in this unicellular cyanobacterium.The transcriptome analysis showed that expressions of genes for four of the OPP pathway enzymes and two glycogen catabolism enzymes were increased by SigE overexpression; however, the expressions of three glycolytic genes (pfkA (sll1196), gap1, and pyk1) did not change (Fig. 8 and supplemental Table S2). These results demonstrate the complex regulation of the expressions of glycolytic genes. Recent studies showed that disruption of a histidine kinase, Hik8, or a response regulator, Rre37, resulted in decreased transcript levels of glycolytic genes (24Singh A.K. Sherman L.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2368-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Tabei Y. Okada K. Tsuzuki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Azuma M. Osanai T. Hirai M.Y. Tanaka K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2011; 52: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), indicating that multiple transcriptional regulators control expressions of glycolytic genes. In contrast to enzymes of the OPP pathway and glycogen catabolism, FbaII was reduced by SigE overexpression (supplemental Fig. S3). Considering the metabolic flux, the down-regulation of FbaII may be favorable for activation of sugar catabolism, especially glucose degradation, through the OPP pathway (Fig. 8). It is noteworthy that Rre37 is a positive regulator for the upper half of glycolysis, including FbaII (25Tabei Y. Okada K. Tsuzuki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Azuma M. Osanai T. Hirai M.Y. Tanaka K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2011; 52: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the ratio of glucose degradation through glycolysis or the OPP pathway may be determined by a balance between Rre37 and SigE. Summerfield and Sherman (27Summerfield T.C. Sherman L.A. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7829-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) also revealed that other group 2 σ factors, SigB and SigD, regulate the expressions of sugar catabolic genes, including fbaII and gnd, in response to light/dark transition. Further analysis is required to unravel the coordinated regulation of sugar catabolic genes and metabolic flux by various transcriptional regulators.In addition to transcriptional control, post-translational regulation of SigE and enzymes regulated by SigE were controlled by light status. SigE is repressed by ChlH, an H-subunit of magnesium chelatase, by protein-protein interaction under light conditions and is transiently activated under dark conditions (17Osanai T. Imashimizu M. Seki A. Sato S. Tabata S. Imamura S. Asayama M. Ikeuchi M. Tanaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6860-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Glc-6-PD is up-regulated by OpcA through protein-protein interaction (10Hagen K.D. Meeks J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11477-11486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although there have been no reports concerning post-translational control of 6PGD in cyanobacteria. Although the transcript levels of zwf and gnd in the GT strain diminished 1 day after light-to-dark transition, the proteins remained under prolonged dark conditions (Fig. 4), revealing no correlation between the mRNA and protein levels. Our results showing that Glc-6-PD enzymatic activity is increased by light-to-dark transition but that 6PGD activity is not may reflect the difference between their post-translational regulations. OpcA promotes oligomerization of Glc-6-PD (28Sundaram S. Karakaya H. Scanlan D.J. Mann N.H. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); thus, the ratio of the oligomeric form of Glc-6-PD may be increased by light-to-dark conditions or by SigE overexpression. Proteomic studies also revealed that glycogen phosphorylase and FbaII of Synechocystis 6803 are targets of thioredoxin, a small protein involved in disulfide/dithiol reactions (29Perez-Perez M.E. Florencio F.J. Lindahl M. Proteomics. 2006; 1: 186-195Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Pérez-Pérez M.E. Martín-Figueroa E. Florencio F.J. Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 270-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Disruption of thioredoxin systems in Synechocystis results in defects in adaptation to light and redox changes (30Pérez-Pérez M.E. Martín-Figueroa E. Florencio F.J. Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 270-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, integrative analysis of transcriptional to post-translational regulation of sugar catabolic enzymes indicates their significance for light adaptation in cyanobacteria. SigE also has some roles under high salt or heat shock conditions, in concert with other group 2 σ factors (31Singh A.K. Summerfield T.C. Li H. Sherman L.A. Arch. Microbiol. 2006; 186: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Pollari M. Gunnelius L. Tuominen I. Ruotsalainen V. Tyystjärvi E. Salminen T. Tyystjärvi T. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of σ networks to survival during various environmental conditions.CE/MS analysis revealed that metabolite levels upstream of sugar catabolism were not significantly affected, whereas those downstream of sugar catabolism, the TCA cycle and acetyl-CoA, were changed by SigE overexpression (Fig. 6 and supplemental Table S3). These results suggest that metabolites downstream of sugar catabolism have flexibility in their pool sizes, compared with upstream metabolites. Escherichia coli cells show tolerance to drastic changes in metabolic flux and energy production, because of the considerable elasticity in permitted pool sizes for pyruvate and acetyl-CoA (33Causey T.B. Shanmugam K.T. Yomano L.P. Ingram L.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, elevated sugar phosphates lead to growth inhibition and loss of viability of E. coli cells (34Kadner R.J. Murphy G.P. Stephens C.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2007-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, metabolite levels of sugar phosphates in cyanobacteria might also be robustly controlled because of their toxicity, similarly to enteric bacteria. A glucose-sensitive mutant lacking pmgA (sll1968), a gene named from its defect in survival under photomixotrophic growth conditions and encoding a functionally unknown protein, showed increased levels of isocitrate under both photoautotrophic and photomixotrophic conditions (2Takahashi H. Uchimiya H. Hihara Y. J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Takahashi et al. (2Takahashi H. Uchimiya H. Hihara Y. J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) also found that levels of malate, succinate, and 2-oxoglutarate were increased by pmgA knock-out under photoautotrophic conditions. Combined with our data, these results suggest that an aberrant TCA cycle might cause the defect in glucose resistance observed in Synechocystis 6803 cells, suggesting that the integrity of TCA cycle is significant for mixotrophic growth of unicellular cyanobacteria. In consequence, expansion of cyanobacterial metabolomics will be vital for revealing the causes of phenotypes, providing deeper understanding of the physiology of cyanobacteria. IntroductionCarbon metabolism in photosynthetic organisms has received considerable attention because increasing carbon emission is thought to be the cause of global warming. Primary production is governed not only by land plants but also by ocean-dwelling phytoplanktons, including cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are widely distributed in diverse ecological niches, and the unicellular cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803) is one of the most widely used species for the study of photosynthetic bacteria. The genome of Synechocystis 6803 was first determined in 1996 (1Kaneko T.

Thus, sugar catabolic enzymes, including Glc-6-PD and 6PGD, are regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels in cyanobacteria. oxidative pentose phosphate capillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometry glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glucose-tolerant 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase digoxigenin. σ factors, subunits of the bacterial RNA polymerase, are divided into four groups, and cyanobacteria are characterized by possessing multiple group 2 σ factors, whose promoter recognition is similar to group 1 σ factor (15Tanaka K.

Transcriptome analysis revealed that the disruption of sigE, one of four group 2 σ factors in Synechocystis, results in decreased transcript levels of three glycolytic genes (pfkA, encoding phosphofructokinase; gap1, encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; and pyk, encoding pyruvate kinase), four OPP pathway genes (zwf, opcA, gnd, and tal (encoding transaldolase)), and two glycogen catabolic genes (glgP (sll1356) and glgX (slr0237)) (12Osanai T. Kanesaki Y. Nakano T. Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M. Kanehisa M. Suzuki I. Murata N. Tanaka K. J. Biol.

Imashimizu M. Seki A. Sato S. Tabata S. Imamura S. Asayama M. Ikeuchi M. Tanaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6860-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Phenotypic analysis showed that the disruption of sigE results in decreased level of glycogen and reduced viability under dark conditions (12Osanai T. Kanesaki Y. Nakano T. Takahashi H. Asayama M.

Thus, transcriptome and phenotypic analyses indicate that SigE is a positive regulator of sugar catabolism, although proteomic and metabolomic analyses have not been performed. In this study, we generated a SigE-overexpressing strain and measured the transcript, protein, and metabolite levels and the phenotypes associated with sugar catabolism. We revealed that SigE overexpression activates the expressions of sugar catabolic enzymes and modifies the amounts of glycogen, acetyl-CoA, and metabolites of the TCA cycle. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we generated a strain overexpressing SigE, and the data showed that sugar catabolism is widely regulated by SigE at the transcript, protein, metabolite, and phenotype levels. The results indicate that RNA polymerase σ factor SigE plays pivotal roles in the transcriptional control of genes involved in primary carbon metabolism in this unicellular cyanobacterium.The transcriptome analysis showed that expressions of genes for four of the OPP pathway enzymes and two glycogen catabolism enzymes were increased by SigE overexpression; however, the expressions of three glycolytic genes (pfkA (sll1196), gap1, and pyk1) did not change (Fig. 8 and supplemental Table S2). These results demonstrate the complex regulation of the expressions of glycolytic genes. Recent studies showed that disruption of a histidine kinase, Hik8, or a response regulator, Rre37, resulted in decreased transcript levels of glycolytic genes (24Singh A.K. Sherman L.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2368-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Tabei Y. Okada K. Tsuzuki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2011; 52: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), indicating that multiple transcriptional regulators control expressions of glycolytic genes. In contrast to enzymes of the OPP pathway and glycogen catabolism, FbaII was reduced by SigE overexpression (supplemental Fig. S3). Considering the metabolic flux, the down-regulation of FbaII may be favorable for activation of sugar catabolism, especially glucose degradation, through the OPP pathway (Fig. 8). It is noteworthy that Rre37 is a positive regulator for the upper half of glycolysis, including FbaII (25Tabei Y. Okada K. Tsuzuki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Azuma M. Osanai T. Hirai M.Y. Tanaka K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2011; 52: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the ratio of glucose degradation through glycolysis or the OPP pathway may be determined by a balance between Rre37 and SigE. Summerfield and Sherman (27Summerfield T.C. Sherman L.A. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7829-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) also revealed that other group 2 σ factors, SigB and SigD, regulate the expressions of sugar catabolic genes, including fbaII and gnd, in response to light/dark transition. Further analysis is required to unravel the coordinated regulation of sugar catabolic genes and metabolic flux by various transcriptional regulators.In addition to transcriptional control, post-translational regulation of SigE and enzymes regulated by SigE were controlled by light status. SigE is repressed by ChlH, an H-subunit of magnesium chelatase, by protein-protein interaction under light conditions and is transiently activated under dark conditions (17Osanai T. Imashimizu M. Seki A. Sato S. Tabata S. Imamura S. Asayama M. Ikeuchi M. Tanaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6860-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Glc-6-PD is up-regulated by OpcA through protein-protein interaction (10Hagen K.D. Meeks J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11477-11486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although there have been no reports concerning post-translational control of 6PGD in cyanobacteria. Although the transcript levels of zwf and gnd in the GT strain diminished 1 day after light-to-dark transition, the proteins remained under prolonged dark conditions (Fig. 4), revealing no correlation between the mRNA and protein levels. Our results showing that Glc-6-PD enzymatic activity is increased by light-to-dark transition but that 6PGD activity is not may reflect the difference between their post-translational regulations. OpcA promotes oligomerization of Glc-6-PD (28Sundaram S. Karakaya H. Scanlan D.J. Mann N.H. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); thus, the ratio of the oligomeric form of Glc-6-PD may be increased by light-to-dark conditions or by SigE overexpression. Proteomic studies also revealed that glycogen phosphorylase and FbaII of Synechocystis 6803 are targets of thioredoxin, a small protein involved in disulfide/dithiol reactions (29Perez-Perez M.E. Florencio F.J. Lindahl M. Proteomics. 2006; 1: 186-195Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Pérez-Pérez M.E. Martín-Figueroa E. Florencio F.J. Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 270-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Disruption of thioredoxin systems in Synechocystis results in defects in adaptation to light and redox changes (30Pérez-Pérez M.E. Martín-Figueroa E. Florencio F.J. Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 270-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, integrative analysis of transcriptional to post-translational regulation of sugar catabolic enzymes indicates their significance for light adaptation in cyanobacteria. SigE also has some roles under high salt or heat shock conditions, in concert with other group 2 σ factors (31Singh A.K. Summerfield T.C. Li H. Sherman L.A. Arch. Microbiol. 2006; 186: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Pollari M. Gunnelius L. Tuominen I. Ruotsalainen V. Tyystjärvi E. Salminen T. Tyystjärvi T. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of σ networks to survival during various environmental conditions.CE/MS analysis revealed that metabolite levels upstream of sugar catabolism were not significantly affected, whereas those downstream of sugar catabolism, the TCA cycle and acetyl-CoA, were changed by SigE overexpression (Fig. 6 and supplemental Table S3). These results suggest that metabolites downstream of sugar catabolism have flexibility in their pool sizes, compared with upstream metabolites. Escherichia coli cells show tolerance to drastic changes in metabolic flux and energy production, because of the considerable elasticity in permitted pool sizes for pyruvate and acetyl-CoA (33Causey T.B. Shanmugam K.T. Yomano L.P. Ingram L.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, elevated sugar phosphates lead to growth inhibition and loss of viability of E. coli cells (34Kadner R.J. Murphy G.P. Stephens C.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2007-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, metabolite levels of sugar phosphates in cyanobacteria might also be robustly controlled because of their toxicity, similarly to enteric bacteria. A glucose-sensitive mutant lacking pmgA (sll1968), a gene named from its defect in survival under photomixotrophic growth conditions and encoding a functionally unknown protein, showed increased levels of isocitrate under both photoautotrophic and photomixotrophic conditions (2Takahashi H. Uchimiya H. Hihara Y. J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Takahashi et al. (2Takahashi H. Uchimiya H. Hihara Y. J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) also found that levels of malate, succinate, and 2-oxoglutarate were increased by pmgA knock-out under photoautotrophic conditions. Combined with our data, these results suggest that an aberrant TCA cycle might cause the defect in glucose resistance observed in Synechocystis 6803 cells, suggesting that the integrity of TCA cycle is significant for mixotrophic growth of unicellular cyanobacteria. In consequence, expansion of cyanobacterial metabolomics will be vital for revealing the causes of phenotypes, providing deeper understanding of the physiology of cyanobacteria.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a macrophage secretory product that is abundantly expressed in atherosclerotic plaques but whose precise role in atherogenesis is unclear. The capacity of macrophages to clear apoptotic cells, through the efferocytosis mechanism, as well as to reduce cellular cholesterol accumulation contributes to prevent plaque progression and instability. By virtue of its capacity to promote cellular cholesterol efflux from phagocyte-macrophages, ABCA1 was reported to reduce atherosclerosis. We demonstrated that lipid loading in human macrophages was accompanied by a strong increase of IL-6 secretion. Interestingly, IL-6 markedly induced ABCA1 expression and enhanced ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from human macrophages to apoAI. Stimulation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux by IL-6 was, however, abolished by selective inhibition of the Jak-2/Stat3 signaling pathway. In addition, we observed that the expression of molecules described to promote efferocytosis, i.e. c-mer proto-oncogene-tyrosine kinase, thrombospondin-1, and transglutaminase 2, was significantly induced in human macrophages upon treatment with IL-6. Consistent with these findings, IL-6 enhanced the capacity of human macrophages to phagocytose apoptotic cells; moreover, we observed that IL-6 stimulates the ABCA1-mediated efflux of cholesterol derived from the ingestion of free cholesterol-loaded apoptotic macrophages. Finally, the treatment of human macrophages with IL-6 led to the establishment of an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile, characterized by an increased secretion of IL-4 and IL-10 together with a decrease of that of IL-1β. Taken together, our results indicate that IL-6 favors the elimination of excess cholesterol in human macrophages and phagocytes by stimulation of ABCA1-mediated cellular free cholesterol efflux and attenuates the macrophage proinflammatory phenotype. Thus, high amounts of IL-6 secreted by lipid laden human macrophages may constitute a protective response from macrophages to prevent accumulation of cytotoxic-free cholesterol. Such a cellular recycling of free cholesterol may contribute to reduce both foam cell formation and the accumulation of apoptotic bodies as well as intraplaque inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions.

Such a cellular recycling of free cholesterol may contribute to reduce both foam cell formation and the accumulation of apoptotic bodies as well as intraplaque inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions. The retention and accumulation of modified LDL and apoptotic cells in the arterial intima represent critical steps in the formation of cholesterol-rich vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques; such plaques feature an immunoinflammatory process in which monocyte-derived macrophages play a central role (1Weber C. Zernecke A. Libby P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 802-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 2Daugherty A. Webb N.R. Rateri D.L. King V.L. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1812-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, intimal macrophages endocytose modified LDL via scavenger receptors (SR-A, CD36), thereby favoring intracellular lipid accumulation with foam cell formation. Cholesterol-laden macrophages may equally result from phagocytosis of apoptotic cells via the process of efferocytosis (3Thorp E. Tabas I. J. Leukoc Biol. 2009; 86: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); however, such a massive influx of cholesterol may prove cytotoxic if cholesterol recycling is disrupted in macrophage phagocyte (4Schrijvers D.M. De Meyer G.R. Herman A.G. Martinet W. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 73: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) 3The abbreviations used are: ABCA1ATP binding cassette A1HMDMhuman monocyte-derived macrophageacLDLacetylated LDLCtrlcontrolTHBS1thrombospondin-1TG2transglutaminase 2PPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorLXRliver X receptor. transporter plays a central role in maintaining macrophage cholesterol homeostasis by preventing cellular lipid accumulation as a result of its capacity to efflux cellular free cholesterol to apoAI (5Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1343-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Thus, ABCA1 may promote elimination of cholesterol derived from ingestion of either modified lipoproteins or apoptotic cells (6Kiss R.S. Elliott M.R. Ma Z. Marcel Y.L. Ravichandran K.S. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2252-2258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent studies clearly highlight the close link between inflammation and cholesterol homeostasis in macrophages through mechanisms in which ABCA1 appears to be a major actor (7Fitzgerald M.L. Mujawar Z. Tamehiro N. Atherosclerosis. 2010; 211: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, increased intracellular free cholesterol concentration in ABCA1 KO macrophages is accompanied by enhanced proinflammatory response upon LPS induction (8Francone O.L. Royer L. Boucher G.

Moreover, the enhanced Toll-like receptors signaling observed in ABCA1/ABCG1 double KO macrophages is associated with free cholesterol accumulation and up-regulated expression of proinflammatory genes (11Yvan-Charvet L.

Reciprocally, activation of Toll-like receptors 3 and 4 inhibits the induction of LXR target genes, such as ABCA1, in macrophages and strongly reduces cholesterol efflux (12Castrillo A. Joseph S.B.

Although those studies suggest that the inflammatory property of ABCA1 results from its ability to modulate free cholesterol levels and distribution in plasma membrane, recent studies propose that macrophage ABCA1 may act as an anti-inflammatory receptor through activation of Jak2/Stat3 pathway after apoAI binding (13Tang C.

Schwabe R.F. DeVries-Seimon T. Yao P.M. Gerbod-Giannone M.C. Tall A.R. Davis R.J. Flavell R. Brenner D.A. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21763-21772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Importantly, interleukin-6 has been identified as an independent risk factor for premature coronary artery disease (16Woods A. Brull D.J. Humphries S.E. Montgomery H.E. Eur. Heart J. 2000; 21: 1574-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and moreover, elevated levels of IL-6 are associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction in healthy men (17Ridker P.M. Rifai N. Stampfer M.J. Hennekens C.H. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). The Offspring Cohort of the Framingham Heart Study indicated that IL-6 levels were associated with internal carotid artery intima-media thickness and stenosis (18Thakore A.H. Guo C.Y. Larson M.G. Corey D. Wang T.J. Vasan R.S. D'Agostino Sr., R.B. Lipinska I. Keaney Jr., J.F. Benjamin E.J. O'Donnell C.J. Am. J. Cardiol. 2007; 99: 1598-1602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of IL-6 as a causative factor, as a consequence, or as a marker of atherosclerosis is unclear. Indeed, experimental evidence in genetically modified mouse models susceptible to atherosclerosis highlight opposite functions of IL-6 (19Kleemann R. Zadelaar S. Kooistra T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 79: 360-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of mice with recombinant mouse IL-6 increased lesion size in both C57BL/6 and apoE−/− mice fed a high fat/cholate diet (20Huber S.A. Sakkinen P. Conze D. Hardin N. Tracy R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2364-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, IL6−/− mice developed larger fatty streak lesions than control mice when fed an atherogenic diet for 15 weeks (21Van Lenten B.J. Wagner A.C. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1923-1929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Similar studies in IL-6/LDL receptor double KO mice failed to detect a significant effect of IL-6 deficiency on lesion size (22Song L. Schindler C. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 177: 43-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Finally, a potential atheroprotective role for IL-6 was described in IL-6/apoE double KO mice maintained for 1 year on a chow diet (23Elhage R. Clamens S. Besnard S. Mallat Z. Tedgui A. Arnal J. Maret A. Bayard F. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 156: 315-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Schieffer B. Selle T. Hilfiker A. Hilfiker-Kleiner D. Grote K. Tietge U.J.

Taken together, these findings suggest that IL-6 may exert opposing actions in the inflammatory dimension of the atherosclerosis process. To evaluate this question further, we explored the impact of IL-6 on the capacity of human macrophages to regulate cholesterol homeostasis in the lipido-inflammatory context of atherosclerosis. We presently report that disruption of cellular lipid homeostasis leading to cholesterol accumulation in human macrophages was accompanied by an increased secretion of IL-6. Moreover, IL-6 reduced macrophage lipid accumulation derived from ingestion of either modified lipoproteins or apoptotic cells by stimulating ABCA1-mediated free cholesterol efflux through activation of the Jak-2/Stat3 signaling pathway. In addition, IL-6 enhanced the capacity of human macrophages to ingest apoptotic cells and attenuated the proinflammatory phenotype of human cholesterol-loaded human macrophages. Our findings, therefore, suggest that the autocrine action of macrophage-secreted-IL-6 may contribute to reduce the formation of inflammatory foam cells and apoptotic macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions. Monocytes were isolated from the blood of individual healthy normolipidemic donors (Etablissement Français du Sang) on Ficoll gradients (Ficoll-Paque PLUS, GE Healthcare) and subsequently differentiated into human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) on plastic Primaria plates (Falcon) over a period of 10 days of culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated human serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 ng/ml human macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The human THP-1 monocytic cell line was obtained from American Type Culture collection (ATCC) and maintained in culture in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in RPMI medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 80 units/ml penicillin, 80 μg/ml streptomycin. THP-1 monocytes were seeded onto 24- or 6-well plates at density 1 × 106 or 4 × 106 cell/well, respectively, in the presence of 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 3 days to induce differentiation into macrophage-like cells. Human macrophages (THP-1 and HMDM) were cholesterol-loaded with 50 μg/ml acetylated LDL (acLDL) labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 24 h in the presence or in the absence of 50 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 (R&D Systems) in an RPMI medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 50 mm glucose, and 0.2% BSA (RGGB). All cell culture reagents were certified as endotoxin-free by the manufacturers. As described in our previous studies (25Dentan C. Lesnik P. Chapman M.J. Ninio E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Petit L. Lesnik P. Dachet C. Moreau M. Chapman M.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), pyrogen-free commercial plastic was used at all critical steps during LDL isolation to prevent endotoxin contamination. Under these conditions, endotoxin content was <1 pg/μg LDL protein as monitored by the Limulus amebocyte lysate chromogenic assay (Biogenic) (26Petit L. Lesnik P. Dachet C. Moreau M. Chapman M.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After the acetylation procedure, the endotoxin content of acLDL was <0.5 pg/μg of acLDL protein (25Dentan C. Lesnik P. Chapman M.J. Ninio E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), such endotoxin levels being not able to induce a detectable change in cytokine secretion, including that of IL-6 (27Zhong W.W. Burke P.A. Hand A.T. Walsh M.J. Hughes L.A. Forse R.A. Arch. Surg. 1993; 128: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Human macrophages were then equilibrated in RGGB in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 and 1 μm TO901317 (Sigma) for an additional 24-h period. Cellular cholesterol efflux to 5 μg/ml lipid-free apoA-I (Biodesign) or HDL (density = 1.063–1.21 g/ml; 15 μg/ml PL) isolated from normolipidemic plasma by preparative ultracentrifugation (28Chapman M.J. Goldstein S. Lagrange D. Laplaud P.M. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 339-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was assayed in serum-free medium for a 4-h chase period in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 and 1 μm TO901317. Finally, culture media were harvested and cleared of cellular debris by brief centrifugation. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by extraction in hexane-isopropanol (3:2), evaporation of the solvent, and liquid scintillation counting (Wallac Trilux 1450 Microbeta). The percentage of cholesterol efflux was calculated as 100 × (medium cpm)/(medium cpm + cell cpm). ApoA-I-specific cholesterol efflux was determined by subtracting nonspecific cholesterol efflux occurring in apoA-I-free medium. When required, a cell-permeable Stat3 inhibitor peptide (100 μm Stat3-I, Calbiochem) or a selective inhibitor of either the Jak-2 protein-tyrosine kinase (25 μm AG490, Sigma) or the Jak-3 protein-tyrosine kinase (10 μm ZM39923, Sigma) or the Jak-2/Stat3 signaling pathway (2 μm cucurbitacin I, Sigma) was added together with IL-6. The masses of esterified and free cholesterol in human macrophages was quantified using the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Molecular Probes) as previously described (29Le Goff W. Settle M. Greene D.J. Morton R.E. Smith J.D. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 51-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cell protein extracts from human THP-1 macrophages were prepared from 6-well plates pretreated or not with 50 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 in the presence or the absence of 1 μm TO901317 for 24 h in RGGB medium. Total cell protein was extracted in M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo) containing 10% protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were loaded onto a 3–8% Tris acetate polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using iBlot technology (Invitrogen). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk (in PBS, 0.1% Tween) for 2 h, and ABCA1 was detected by incubation overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit anti-human ABCA1 (Novus) at 1:500 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat ant-rabbit secondary antibody at 1:5000. The signal was revealed with an enhanced chemiluminescence Immobilon Western substrate (Millipore). Quantification of Western blots was performed using a Kodak Image Station 440 CF with Kodak 1D Image Analysis software. Quantification of ABCA1 protein levels was normalized to matching annexin1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) levels. Free cholesterol-induced apoptotic THP-1 macrophages were produced by incubation with 100 μg/ml acLDL and 10 μg/ml concentrations of an acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor (S58035, Sigma) for 24 h in serum-free medium as previously described (30Cui D. Thorp E. Li Y. Wang N. Yvan-Charvet L. Tall A.R. Tabas I. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 82: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). UV-induced apoptotic human Jurkat cells were generated by UV exposition (312 nm, 6 × 15 Watts) for 15 min followed by a 4-h incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Apoptosis was quantified by both annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining (Beckman Coulter) using flow cytometry (Beckman FC500). The degrees of apoptosis in Jurkat apoptotic cells were ∼74% in early apoptosis (annexin V-positive only), <7% in late apoptosis (annexin V + PI-positive), and <2% in necrosis (PI-positive only). Apoptotic Jurkat cells were labeled with 5 μm calcein-AM (Invitrogen) and added to THP-1 macrophage phagocyte cells (Ratio 3:1) previously treated in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 ± 1 μm TO901317. After 30 min of contact, which has been reported to be a sufficient period to completely engage and internalize the apoptotic cells (6Kiss R.S. Elliott M.R. Ma Z. Marcel Y.L. Ravichandran K.S. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2252-2258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), non-ingested apoptotic cells were removed by extensive washing with PBS. Subsequently, THP-1 phagocytes were detached from the plates and then subjected to flow cytometry (Beckman FC500) to quantify positive fluorescent phagocytic cells that had ingested calcein-AM-labeled apoptotic Jurkat cells. Positive fluorescent phagocytic cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy to ensure that the detected fluorescence was localized within the phagocytes. Data are expressed as a phagocytic index corresponding to the mean fluorescence in positive phagocytes. As originally described by Cui et al. (30Cui D. Thorp E. Li Y. Wang N. Yvan-Charvet L. Tall A.R. Tabas I. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 82: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) in mouse peritoneal macrophages, monolayers of [3H]cholesterol-labeled apoptotic THP-1 macrophages were extensively washed with PBS, detached from 100-mm bacterial dishes, and added to THP-1 phagocytes (Ratio 5:1) for 30 min at 37 °C in medium containing 10 μg/ml S58035. Non-ingested apoptotic cells were removed by extensive washing with PBS, and efflux of [3H]cholesterol from THP-1 phagocytes, derived from the ingestion of [3H]cholesterol-labeled apoptotic cells, was assayed in the presence of lipid-free apoAI for 4 h in a medium containing 10 μg/ml S58035 as described above. Silencing of ABCA1 expression was performed by application of siRNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon) targeted to the cDNA sequence of the human ABCA1 gene (GenBankTM #NM_005502). THP-1 macrophages were grown in 24-well plates and transfected with 50 nm control siRNA (Dharmacon) or siRNA targeting human ABCA1 using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human THP-1 macrophages were incubated with or without 50 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 in the presence or the absence of 1 μm TO901317 for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS, and total RNA was extracted using a NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, 1500 ng of RNA was reverse-transcribed with 75 ng of random hexamer using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. An initial denaturation step for 5 min at 68 °C was followed by an elongation phase of 1 h at 42 °C; the reaction was completed by a 5-min incubation at 68 °C. Real time quantitative PCR was performed using a LightCycler LC480 (Roche Applied Science). The reaction contained 2.5 ng of reverse transcribed total RNA, 150 pmol of forward and reverse primers, and 5 μl of Master Mix SYBR Green in a final volume of 10 μl. Samples underwent the standard PCR protocol. Crossing point values for genes of interest were normalized to housekeeping genes (human δ-aminolevulinate synthase and human α-tubulin). Expression data were based on the crossing points calculated with the software for LightCycler data analysis and corrected for PCR efficiencies of the target and the reference gene. Data were expressed as a -fold change in mRNA expression relative to control values. Human THP-1 macrophages were incubated in serum-free media with 50 ng/ml human recombinant IL-6 for 24 h, and secreted cytokines in the culture media were quantified using a semiautomated Biochip Array Technology analyzer (Evidence Investigator, Randox). Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and values correspond to the mean from at least three independent experiments. Comparisons of two groups were performed by a two-tailed Student's t test, and comparisons of three or more groups were performed by analysis of variance with the Newman-Keuls post-test. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism software from GraphPad (San Diego, CA). Analysis of secreted IL-6 levels by human macrophages (Fig. 1) revealed that the secretion of IL-6 by cholesterol-loaded human THP-1 macrophages (16.9 ± 0.3 versus 12.9 ± 0.4 μg of cholesterol/mg of protein in cholesterol-loaded and control cells, respectively, p < 0.005) was ∼10-fold (p < 0.01) more elevated than that observed in non-loaded macrophages, thereby suggesting that foam cells contribute to a major degree to the determination of IL-6 amounts produced in human atherosclerotic plaques. Interestingly, disruption of lipid homeostasis in cholesterol-loaded macrophages through silencing of ABCA1 expression using RNA interference (ABCA1 KD) (supplemental Fig. 1) led to an exacerbated secretion of IL-6 (8.4-fold, p < 0.001) as compared with control cholesterol-loaded cells (Ctrl). Taken together, those results indicate that the lipid accumulation in human macrophages is accompanied by a marked elevation of secreted IL-6 amounts. To determine whether this increased IL-6 production may constitute a compensatory response from human macrophages to cholesterol loading, we next examined the effect of IL-6 on the capacity of human macrophages to eliminate the excess of cholesterol resulting from either the uptake of modified LDL or the ingestion of apoptotic cells. To determine whether IL-6 may modulate cellular free cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded human macrophages after incubation with modified LDL (acLDL), we analyzed the impact of IL-6 on cholesterol efflux from HMDM and from THP-1 macrophages to both lipid-poor apoAI and to HDL particles. As shown in Fig. 2, ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoAI from THP-1 (Fig. 2A) and HMDM (Fig. 2B) was stimulated upon incubation with IL-6 (2.2- and 2.8-fold, respectively, p < 0.05). When human macrophages were stimulated with a synthetic LXR agonist (TO901317), which markedly induced ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoAI subsequent to marked up-regulation of ABCA1 mRNA expression (31Rowe A.H. Argmann C.A. Edwards J.Y. Sawyez C.G. Morand O.H. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), elevation in rates of cholesterol efflux to apoAI in response to IL-6 was also observed (THP-1, +38%; HMDM, +42%, p < 0.05). However, IL-6 did not affect cellular cholesterol efflux to HDL from both THP-1 macrophages and HMDM treated in the presence or in the absence of LXR agonists (Fig. 2, C and D), thereby indicating that the effect of IL-6 on cellular cholesterol efflux mechanisms is specific to ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Consistent with the induction of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoAI, cellular cholesterol mass was significantly reduced (−14%, p < 0.001) in cholesterol-loaded human macrophages when incubated with IL-6 (Fig. 2E). We next determined whether activation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux by IL-6 may result from stimulation of ABCA1 gene expression in human macrophages. As shown in Fig. 3A, IL-6 significantly up-regulated ABCA1 mRNA levels in THP-1 macrophages when acting alone (+84%, p < 0.01) or in combination with the synthetic LXR agonist TO901317 (+94%, p < 0.001); such induction of ABCA1 by IL-6 was confirmed at the protein level (Fig. 3B). By contrast, mRNA levels of other genes known to modulate cellular cholesterol efflux mechanisms (ABCG1, ABCA7, Cla-1, apoE, LXRα, Retinoid X Receptor α, PPARα,γ) were not affected by IL-6 (Table 1). Those findings, therefore, suggest that stimulation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoAI by IL-6 likely results from induction of ABCA1 gene expression.TABLE 1Gene expression profile in human macrophages upon stimulation with interleukin-6Human macrophagesTHP-1HMDM-Fold increase (IL-6 vs. control)p-Fold increase (IL-6 vs. control)pLipid homeostasisABCG11.2 ± 0.2NS1.1 ± 0.1NSABCA71.1 ± 0.3NS1.0 ± 0.2NSCla-11.0 ± 0.2NS1.1 ± 0.3NSApoE1.0 ± 0.1NS0.9 ± 0.1NSLPL0.9 ± 0.3NS1.0 ± 0.2NSCEH1.0 ± 0.2NS0.8 ± 0.1NSACAT-11.1 ± 0.3NS1.0 ± 0.0NSHMG-CoA receptor1.1 ± 0.2NS1.1 ± 0.1NSLDL receptor1.1 ± 0.3NS1.2 ± 0.1NSSR-A0.9 ± 0.2NS1.1 ± 0.2NSCD361.0 ± 0.2NS1.2 ± 0.1NSLRP1.0 ± 0.1NS0.9 ± 0.1NSGene regulationPPARα1.2 ± 0.1<0.051.0 ± 0.1NSPPARδ1.4 ± 0.2<0.051.9 ± 0.1<0.00005PPARγ1.2 ± 0.2NS0.9 ± 0.2NSRXRα1.0 ± 0.1NS1.0 ± 0.1NSLXRα0.9 ± 0.2NS0.9 ± 0.1NSBcl-32.3 ± 0.8<0.052.5 ± 0.5<0.05Cell survivalBcl-21.2 ± 0.2NS1.0 ± 0.2NSBcl-xL1.1 ± 0.1NS1.0 ± 0.1NSJak/Stat pathwayStat11.1 ± 0.1NS1.2 ± 0.1NSStat31.7 ± 0.2<0.00051.7 ± 0.2<0.0005SOCS33.1 ± 1.1<0.059.4 ± 1.4<0.0005Oxidative stressHO-11.1 ± 0.1NS0.9 ± 0.1NS Open table in a new tab As IL-6 has been described to exert its cellular action by activation of the Jak/Stat pathway (32Levy D.E.

For example, DHA reduces the damage from impact acceleration injury and reduces β-amyloid precursor, a marker of axonal injury in vivo relevant in traumatic brain injury (2Bailes J.E. Mills J.D. J. Neurotrauma. 2010; 27: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Also, DHA reduces ischemic stroke in rats via production of neuroprotectin D1, which acts on leukocytes and reduces leukocyte infiltration and leukocyte-mediated tissue damage and regulates NF-κB (3Marcheselli V.L.

Hence, the metabolome and metabolic fate of DHA is of interest in the resolution of pain, inflammation, and tissue injury.Another metabolic fate of DHA in brain is conversion to docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), which is thought to be produced by the same pathway as N-acyl-arachidonoyl-ethanolamide (AEA, anandamide) (12De Petrocellis L. Melck D. Bisogno T. Di Marzo V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 191-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). DHEA is directly related to dietary intake of DHA and is enriched in brain tissue at levels comparable with AEA (13Berger A. Crozier G. Bisogno T. Cavaliere P. Innis S. Di Marzo V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6402-6406Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). AEA is an endocannabinoid that regulates neurofunctions and the immune system via cannabinoid (CB) 1 and 2 receptors (14Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G. Stevenson L.A. Griffin G. Gibson D.

Takizawa H. Nagano T. Hirobe M. Matsuki N. Saito H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we addressed whether the beneficial actions of DHA treatment, for example, protection against brain injury (2Bailes J.E. Mills J.D. J. Neurotrauma. 2010; 27: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), can be regulated in part by conversion of DHEA to bioactive products.Herein we report on the DHEA metabolome with identification of novel potent bioactive molecules that are organ-protective in vivo. These novel bioactive products from DHEA were identified using LC-MS-MS-based lipidomics in tandem with functional single-cell screening in newly engineered microfluidic chambers and in vivo systems. These new bioactive products from DHEA may underlie some of the beneficial effects of DHA administration.RESULTSFunctional MetabolomicsLC-UV-MS-MS Identification of 17-HDHEA from BrainTo investigate the potential endogenous generation of DHEA-derived bioactive products, mouse brain was harvested and subjected to solid phase extraction (19Yang, R., Chiang, N., Oh, S. F., Serhan, C. N. (2011) Curr. Protoc. Immunol., Suppl. 94, in press.Google Scholar), and the resulting methyl formate fractions were taken for LC-UV-MS-MS-based metabolomics. Tandem mass fragmentations and online UV spectrum with characteristic λmax at 237 nm are consistent with the proposed structure as shown in Fig. 1B, inset. Because of the lack of suitable functional groups for direct efficient ionization and analysis of 17-hydroxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoylethanolamide (17-HDHEA), its acetate adduct m/z 446 = [M+CH3COOH-H] was targeted for analysis. The major tandem mass ions were assigned as following: m/z 386 = [M-H], 368 = [M-H-H2O], 281 = [299-H2O]. The m/z 288 is consistent with fragmentation at Position 17 (see Table 1 for numbering) (Fig. 1B). Because of the limited quantities of endogenous 17-HDHEA produced in brain tissue, further analyses and in vitro enzymatic preparation were carried out by incubating DHEA with 15-LOX followed by reduction with NaBH4 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Endogenous 17-HDHEA and the enzymatically prepared compound in vitro gave essentially the same LC retention times and tandem mass fragmentations using LC-MS-MS (see supplemental Fig. 1). To assess their production by human and mouse tissues, DHEA was also incubated with isolated human PMN or whole mouse brain because DHEA is enriched in this tissue. LC-MS-MS-based targeted lipidomics indicated the production of a novel series of oxygenated DHEA (Table 1).TABLE 1Structures, LC-MS and GC-MS fragmentations, and UV λ max for novel DHEA metabolites identified using mediator-based lipidomics Open table in a new tab Decoding Metabolomics Using Microfluidic ChambersIn parallel to structure elucidation, chemotactic screening of HPLC-isolated DHEA metabolites obtained from mouse brain was carried out by utilizing microfluidic chamber (Fig. 1C). After IL-8 (0–10 nm gradient) was introduced to the main channel of the microfluidic device, P-selectin tethered leukocytes rapidly migrated along the IL-8 chemotactic gradient at an average rate of 2.3 μm/min. After 15 min, the mixture of metabolites was infused into the microfluidic main channel while an IL-8 (0–10 nm) gradient was maintained (Fig. 1C, left panel). Human PMN chemotaxis was dramatically reduced (p < 0.01) upon the addition of the brain metabolite mixture, whereby average human PMN chemotaxis velocity dropped from 2.3 to ∼0.7 μm/min (Fig. 1C, middle panel). This decrease in chemotaxic velocity was maintained even after the gradient was switched back to IL-8. These results indicated that the brain metabolites contained bioactive components that stopped PMN chemotaxis.LC-UV-MS-MS and GC-MS-based Metabolomics of DHEAResults from this screening uncovered that at least one bioactive product was present among the mixture of DHEA metabolites; thus, we pursued the metabolic fates of DHEA and 17-HpDHEA/17-HDHEA identified in mouse brain (Fig. 1B) using LC/UV/MS/MS-based lipidomics. As with 17-HDHEA, acetate adducts of potential DHEA-derived metabolites [M+CH3COOH-H] were targeted for tandem mass analysis (Table 1). These results demonstrated the presence and production of novel products in the DHEA metabolome.Incubations of isolated human PMNs with DHEA or 17-HpDHEA led to the generation of 17-HDHEA, 4,17-diHDHEA, 10,17-diHDHEA, and 15-HEDPEA. Human hemoglobin, which can be liberated upon tissue damage (25Kumar V. Fausto N. Abbas A. Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease. 7th Ed. Saunders Elsevier, Philadelphia2004Google Scholar), was incubated with 17-HpDHEA and gave 13-HEDPEA and 15-HEDPEA as prominent products, as well as 17-HDHEA (Table 1). Mouse brain homogenates with DHEA also produced 17-HDHEA and 4,17-diHDHEA as major products with smaller amounts of 7,17-diHDHEA, 10,17-diHDHEA, and 15-HEDPEA. The online UV and tandem mass spectra for 4,17-diHDHEA are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. The adduct parent ion, the analyte parent ion, and the ions resulting from neutral loss are m/z 462 = [M+CH3COOH-H], 402 = [M-H], 384 = [M-H-H2O], and 366 = [M-H-2H2O], which are common signature ions for all dihydroxy-containing DHEA products. The ions m/z 333, 315 = [333-H2O], 304, and 286 = [304-H2O] were assigned as diagnostic ions for fragmentations at Position 17. Fragmentations at Position 4 can lead to m/z 144, 257, and 239 = [257-H2O]. Its UV spectrum displayed characteristic maximum absorbance at 238 nm, which was consistent with the presence of two separated conjugated diene structures in this compound. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, diagnostic ions m/z 304, 286 = [304-H2O]; 184 and 156 corresponded to the fragmentations at Positions 7 and 17 of 7,17-diHDHEA respectively (see Table 1 for numbering). The UV spectrum of the compound displayed maximum absorbance, λmax, at 246 nm (26Tjonahen E. Oh S.F. Siegelman J. Elangovan S. Percarpio K.B. Hong S. Arita M. Serhan C.N. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 1193-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), consistent with the presence of two diene structures separated by a methylene group. For 10,17-diHDHEA, m/z 333, 315 = [333-H2O], 304, 286 = [304-H2O], and 196 came from fragmentations at Positions 10 and 17 as shown in Fig. 2, E and F. The presence of a conjugated triene structure in 10,17-diHDHEA was confirmed by the characteristic UV spectrum with λmax at 270 nm. Tandem mass spectrum of 13-HEDPEA is shown in supplemental Fig. 2A with signature fragmentation ions m/z 320, 304, 286 = [304-H2O], and 236. GC/MS was also utilized for additional structural analysis with 13-HEDPEA and 15-HEDPEA that confirmed the original tandem MS assignments shown in supplemental Fig. 2, C and D. The C-value for 13-HEDPEA was determined as 32.1 ± 0.2 (supplemental Fig. 2E), and for 15-HEDPEA, it was determined as 33.7 ± 0.2 (supplemental Fig. 2F).FIGURE 2DHEA metabolome via LC-UV-MS-MS-based lipidomics.

The chemical shift assignments are shown in supplemental Table 2, a and b, respectively. For 15-HEDPEA, the proton at Position 15 (H-15) displayed two distinct chemical shifts, which will be discussed later. Because of the limited amounts of materials and the lack of informative UV chromophores present in these compounds, NMR spectroscopy was also used for quantitation using 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA) as an internal standard with known concentrations. The NMR quantitated compounds were then used as standards for HPLC quantitation monitoring UV chromatogram at 210 nm or LC-tandem mass profiling (see “Experimental Procedures” for further details).Human PMN Single-cell Chemotactic Functional ScreeningHPLC-isolated dioxygenated DHEA products were individually screened for direct PMN actions using microfluidic chambers. Infusion of isolated 15-HEDPEA at 10 nm to the main channel stimulated changes in morphology and chemotaxis of PMN in the IL-8 gradient and stopped further PMN migration after ∼4 min (Fig. 3A). For direct comparison, PMN chemotaxis velocity did not change with time with the IL-8 gradient (supplemental Fig. 3A). At 10 nm, 4,17-diHDHEA (Fig. 3B), 7,17-diHDHEA, or 10,17-diHDHEA did not significantly regulate chemotaxis (supplemental Fig. 3, B and C), whereas at higher concentrations, e.g. 10 μm, 10,17-diHDHEA rapidly stopped PMN chemotaxis (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that 15-HEDPEA is the most potent of this series in regulating human PMN shape change and motility.FIGURE 3Microfluidic chamber-based screening of human PMN chemotaxis with DHEA-derived products.

To this end, we used recombinant human CB receptors overexpressed in a β-arrestin system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” AEA was used for direct comparison as a known agonist. Fig. 4 shows the dose response of CB1 and CB2 with each compound. Activation of CB2 by AEA gave EC50 ∼1.1 × 10−10 m and activation by DHEA gave EC50 9.8 × 10−9 m (Fig. 4B). For comparison, EC50 values for metabolically oxygenated products, 10,17-diHDHEA and 15-HEDPEA, were 3.9 × 10−10 and 1.0 × 10−10 m, respectively (Fig. 4, C and D). These results demonstrate that enzymatic oxidation products from DHEA are activators of CB2 receptors and that 10,17-diHDHEA and 15-HEDPEA also activated CB1 receptors but required much higher concentrations (Fig. 4A). By comparison, 15(S)-HETE ethanolamide, the oxygenated product of AEA, did not stimulate CB2 receptors in this dose range (Fig. 4B). CB2 receptor-ligand interactions were confirmed with the dose response of CB2-specific antagonist AM630. When incubated with GPCR CB2 overexpressed cells, AM630 inhibited activation stimulated with 15-HEDPEA (10 nm) and AEA (10 nm), used here for a known positive and direct comparison (Fig. 4, E and F). AM630 also inhibited GPCR CB2 interaction with 10,17-diHDHEA at higher concentration (n = 3, data not shown).FIGURE 4GPCR CB1 and CB2 are activated by DHEA-derived products. HEK cells overexpressing CB1 or CB2 in a β-arrestin system were incubated with the indicated concentrations of compounds for 1 h in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C.

At concentrations as low as 10 pm, 10,17-diHDHEA or 15-HEDPEA decreased PAF- (100 nm) stimulated platelet-monocyte aggregate formation in human whole blood by ∼30% (Fig. 5, A and B). The inhibitory action of 10,17-diHDHEA displayed a bell-shaped dose response and reached maximum reduction at ∼40% with 100 pm. Formation of PMN-platelet aggregates with PAF (100 nm) was also inhibited by 10,17-diHDEA at concentrations as low as 10 pm, as was the surface expression of P-selectin on platelets in whole blood (Fig. 5D). By comparison, the precursor DHEA (unoxidized) was not active in this dose range (Fig. 5, A and B).FIGURE 5In human whole blood, 10,17S-diHDHEA and 15-HEDPEA each block PAF-stimulated platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation.

Mills J.D. J. Neurotrauma. 2010; 27: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and is the precursor to potent proresolving mediators, including the resolvins and protectins (1Arnason B.G.

Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified HDHEA in mouse brain, which provided the basis for further investigation of 17-HDHEA and 17-HpDHEA metabolic fates and potential biological impact of DHEA metabolism. Given the lack of functional groups for efficient ionization via electrospray ionization, direct analysis/detection of DHEA or its oxygenated metabolites with LC-MS-MS was impeded with low sensitivity. To this end, their acetate adducts, [M+CH3COOH-H], were targeted for analysis, which proved to be a useful alternative strategy employed in the present investigation. In terms of both detection limits and tandem mass fragmentation patterns, these oxygenated DHEA acetate adducts were comparable with those of the corresponding free acid-derived products.Because AEA is a reported substrate for murine leukocyte type 12/15-LOX, reticulocyte type 15-LOX, and soybean 15-LOX to generate 15-hydroperoxyarachidonoyl ethanolamide (18Ueda N. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto S. Tokunaga T. Shirakawa E. Shinkai H. Ogawa M. Sato T. Kudo I. Inoue K. Takizawa H. Nagano T. Hirobe M. Matsuki N. Saito H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we rationalized 17-HDHEA as the reduced hydroxyl group containing the product of 15-lipoxygenase-like enzyme with DHEA. This hypothesis proved consistent with LC-MS-MS mass analysis of the reduced product obtained from incubation of DHEA with soy bean 15-LOX, which essentially showed the same LC retention time, tandem mass fragmentation patterns as well as online UV spectrum with endogenous 17-HDHEA (Fig. 1).To determine 17-HpDHEA/17-HDHEA metabolic fates, LC-MS-MS-based lipidomic investigation led to identification of a series of novel oxygenated products listed in Table 1. Incubation of either 17-HpDHEA or DHEA with human PMN or mouse brain also gave a novel series of dioxygenated products, such as 4,17-diHDHEA, 7,17-diHDHEA, 10,17-diHDHEA, as well as 15-HEDPEA (Table 1). From DHA, some of these products are biosynthesized in inflammatory exudates, namely resolvin D5 (7,17-dihydroxydocosahexaenoic acid; 7,17-diHDHA) and resolvin D6 (4,17-dihydroxydocosahexaenoic acid; 4,17-diHDHA) (8Serhan C.N.

Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), as well as the double dioxygenation product 10,17-dihydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (10,17-diHDHA), an isomer of neuroprotectin D1 (6Bazan N.G. Calandria J.M. Serhan C.N. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 2018-2031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Hence, their ethanolamide counterparts were identified in the present study. In addition, incubation of 17-HpDHEA with hemoglobin generated two major hepoxilin-like structures (29Pace-Asciak C.R. Reynaud D. Demin P. Nigam S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 447: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), 13-HEDPEA and 15-HEDPEA. Given that hepoxilin diastereomer mixtures are generated from hemoglobin or hemin (29Pace-Asciak C.R. Reynaud D. Demin P. Nigam S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 447: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it was of interest whether this was the case for 17-HpDHEA-derived compounds. To this end, NMR chemical shift of H-18 of isolated 13-HEDPEA displayed two distinguishable peaks at 4.23 and 4.45 ppm, and chemical shift of H-13 of isolated 13-HEDPEA showed broad peaks of ∼3.9 ppm (supplemental Table 2, a and b), which strongly suggested the presence of diastereomers. To determine the biosynthetic mechanism of formation of 13-HEDPEA and 15-HEDPEA from hemoglobin and 17-HpDHEA, incubations were also carried out in 18O water. Tandem mass analysis of these incubation products indicated that 18O was not incorporated within these products (data not shown), which suggested that the oxygen source of hydroxyl group could be attributed to atmospheric O2.Combining results from our lipidomic analyses and the mechanisms proposed for phytooxylipin and hepoxilin biosynthesis (30Rowley F.A. Kuhn H. Schewe T. Eicosanoids and Related Compounds in Plants and Animals. Portland Press, London1998Google Scholar), the pathways for novel oxygenated DHEA products are proposed in Fig. 6. In this scheme, DHEA is first converted to 17-HpDHEA mediated by 15-LOX. Then 17-HpDHEA is partially reduced to the oxide radical (Fig. 6) by hemoglobin, which reacts with the vicinal double bond at the 16-position to yield the 16(17)-epoxide radical. Non- or low stereospecific addition of oxygen to the intermediate leads to formation of two types of peroxide radical diastereomers. Further reduction can generate 13-HEDPEA and 15-HEDPEA. Alternatively, 17-HpDHEA can undergo reduction to yield 17-HDHEA. Of interest, hemoglobin interactions with 17-HpDHEA yield approximately equal amounts of 13-HEDPEA and 15-HEDPEA; for comparison, incubation of PMN with DHEA or HpDHEA generated predominant"
https://openalex.org/W2021224212,"Perilipin (PLIN1) is a constitutive adipocyte lipid droplet coat protein. N-terminal amphipathic helices and central hydrophobic stretches are thought to anchor it on the lipid droplet, where it appears to function as a scaffold protein regulating lipase activity. We recently identified two different C-terminal PLIN1 frame shift mutations (Leu-404fs and Val-398fs) in patients with a novel subtype of partial lipodystrophy, hypertriglyceridemia, severe insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (Gandotra, S., Le Dour, C., Bottomley, W., Cervera, P., Giral, P., Reznik, Y., Charpentier, G., Auclair, M., Delépine, M., Barroso, I., Semple, R. K., Lathrop, M., Lascols, O., Capeau, J., O'Rahilly, S., Magré, J., Savage, D. B., and Vigouroux, C. (2011) N. Engl. J. Med. 364, 740-748.) When overexpressed in preadipocytes, both mutants fail to inhibit basal lipolysis. Here we used bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays to show that the mutants fail to bind ABHD5, permitting its constitutive coactivation of ATGL, resulting in increased basal lipolysis. siRNA-mediated knockdown of either ABHD5 or ATGL expression in the stably transfected cells expressing mutant PLIN1 reduced basal lipolysis. These insights from naturally occurring human variants suggest that the C terminus sequesters ABHD5 and thus inhibits basal ATGL activity. The data also suggest that pharmacological inhibition of ATGL could have therapeutic potential in patients with this rare but metabolically serious disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2007286054,"Recently, we identified extracellular ubiquitin as an endogenous CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR) 4 agonist. However, the receptor selectivity and molecular basis of the CXCR4 agonist activity of ubiquitin are unknown, and functional consequences of CXCR4 activation with ubiquitin are poorly defined. Here, we provide evidence that ubiquitin and the cognate CXCR4 ligand stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α do not share CXCR7 as a receptor. We further demonstrate that ubiquitin does not utilize the typical two-site binding mechanism of chemokine-receptor interactions, in which the receptor N terminus is important for ligand binding. CXCR4 activation with ubiquitin and SDF-1α lead to similar Gα(i)-responses and to a comparable magnitude of phosphorylation of ERK-1/2, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase-l and Akt, although phosphorylations occur more transiently after activation with ubiquitin. Despite the similarity of signal transduction events after activation of CXCR4 with both ligands, ubiquitin possesses weaker chemotactic activity than SDF-lα in cell migration assays and does not interfere with productive entry of HIV-1 into P4.R5 multinuclear activation of galactosidase indicator cells. Unlike SDF-1α, ubiquitin lacks interactions with an N-terminal CXCR4 peptide in NMR spectroscopy experiments. Binding and signaling studies in the presence of antibodies against the N terminus and extracellular loops 2/3 of CXCR4 confirm that the ubiquitin CXCR4 interaction is independent of the N-terminal receptor domain, whereas blockade of extracellular loops 2/3 prevents receptor binding and activation. Our findings define ubiquitin as a CXCR4 agonist, which does not interfere with productive cellular entry of HIV-1, and provide new mechanistic insights into interactions between CXCR4 and its natural ligands."

Small bacterial peptides occur at substantially lower levels in the small intestine compared with the colon in line with the reduced numbers of prokaryotes present in the small intestine of humans. Interestingly, hPepT1 expression is normally restricted to the small intestine, a site in which the levels of small bacterial peptides are low, reflecting the sparse bacterial load of this tissue relative to that of the colon. Thus, the profile of hPepT1 expression along the normal human digestive tract is such that access of small bacterial peptides to hPepT1 minimizes intracellular uptake of these peptides. This normal expression pattern becomes altered in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease in whom expression of hPepT1 occurs in the colon. The transporter will consequently mediate the intracellular accumulation of small prokaryotic materials. We and others have shown that such accumulation of bacterial products (including Tri-DAP, fMLP, and MDP) may trigger intracellular signals that initiate intestinal inflammatory responses (3Vavricka S.R.

In addition to maintaining efficient physical and biological barriers, the intestinal epithelium takes an active part in inducing both the innate and adaptive immune systems.

NOD1 is activated by peptides that contain a diaminophilic acid, such as the PepT1 substrate Tri-DAP, whereas NOD2 recognizes muramyl dipeptides including the PepT1 substrate MDP. However, direct binding between NOD1 and Tri-DAP or NOD2 and MDP has not been demonstrated. In other words, PepT1 transport activity plays an important role in determining the intracellular loading levels of potential ligands for NOD1 and NOD2; this in turn determines the activation levels of downstream inflammatory pathways (9Daniel H.

NOD1 is expressed principally by antigen-presenting cells and epithelial cells that are exposed to microorganisms (14Watanabe T. Asano N. Kitani A. Fuss I.J. Chiba T. Strober W. Int. J. Inflam. 2010; 2010: 476482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NOD1 consists of a C-terminal leucine-rich region (LRR), a central NOD region, and an N-terminal caspase-activating domain (CARD) (14Watanabe T. Asano N. Kitani A. Fuss I.J. Chiba T. Strober W. Int. J. Inflam. 2010; 2010: 476482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NOD1 signaling has been shown to activate NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (14Watanabe T. Asano N. Kitani A. Fuss I.J. Chiba T. Strober W. Int. J. Inflam. 2010; 2010: 476482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such signaling is presumably initiated by detection of NOD1 ligands by the LRR domain of NOD1 followed by recruitment of the downstream effector molecule, RICK (14Watanabe T. Asano N. Kitani A. Fuss I.J. Chiba T. Strober W. Int. J. Inflam. 2010; 2010: 476482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). RICK is a CARD-containing serine/threonine kinase that physically binds to NOD1 via a CARD/CARD interaction (14Watanabe T. Asano N. Kitani A. Fuss I.J. Chiba T. Strober W. Int. J. Inflam. 2010; 2010: 476482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). In the present study, we explored a possible direct interaction between Tri-DAP and NOD1 and the consequence of this binding on downstream effector molecules involved in inflammatory pathways. The mechanism by which NOD1 receptors sense small bacterial products may cause a predisposition to intestinal inflammation; however, specific hypotheses remain to be formulated. Herein we used AFM and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques to investigate the binding between NOD1 and Tri-DAP. AFM data indicated that the height of the NOD1 protein layer increased by a value commensurate with the thickness of Tri-DAP, suggesting association of the tripeptide with the NOD1 protein. SPR data showed a direct binding constant between two molecules (NOD1 protein and Tri-DAP oligopeptide) or between a molecule (RICK kinase) and a molecular complex (NOD1·Tri-DAP). Caco2-BBE cells were cultured to confluence in 75-cm2 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2. The culture medium was DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (10%, v/v) (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA). Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas) and a Mastercycler Realplex (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The 18 S RNA and GAPDH housekeeping genes were used for controls, and -fold induction was calculated by the Ct method as follows: ΔΔCt = (CtTarget − Cthousekeeping)group 1 − (CtTarget − Cthousekeeping)group 2; the final data were derived from 2−ΔΔCt. The primers used were as follows. The NOD1 primers were 5′-TCC AAA GCC AAA CAG AAA CTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAG CAT CCA GAT GAA CGT G-3′ (antisense), the GAPDH primers were 5′-GTC GGA GTC AAC GGA TTT GG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAG CTT CCC GTT CTC AGC CT-3′ (antisense), and the 18 S RNA primers were 5′-CCC CTC GAT GAC TTT AGC TGA GTG T-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGC CGG TCC AAG AAT TTC ACC TCT-3′ (antisense). Recombinant proteins (NOD1, truncated NOD1 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), and RICK (Sigma)) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). As all recombinant proteins were GST-tagged, membranes were probed for 1 h at room temperature with anti-human GST tag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA). In vitro experiments of NOD1 Western blot were performed using an anti-mouse NOD1 antibody (Abnova, Walnut, CA). After washing, membranes were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). For each 12-well plate, 40 pmol of siRNA were dissolved in 100 μl of Opti-MEM. Either NOD1 siRNA or scrambled siRNA (from Ambion, Austin, TX) was mixed with 100 μl of Opti-MEM containing 5 μl of Lipofectamine. Cells were incubated with this mixture for 24 h. Next, cells were washed with PBS and placed in DMEM containing 5 mm Tri-DAP for 1, 2, or 4 h. The medium was collected for ELISA analysis of IL-8 levels. The ELISA detecting IL-8 was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). All AFM measurements were performed with a JEOL instrument (JSPM-4210 scanning probe microscope, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with ultrasharp contact mode cantilevers (MikroMasch, San Jose, CA) with a spring constant that ranged from 0.01 to 0.08 newton/m. To find the thickness of the adsorbed protein layers, the AFM tip was first used to remove molecules from the gold-coated carboxydextran chip surfaces by repeatedly scanning the same region with a high set point (+10.0 V) and rapid scan rate (∼100 Hz). The scan size was limited to a region of 500 × 500 nm, and these settings were selected to ensure that all soft matter was removed, thus exposing the underlying gold substrate and revealing the z-position of the solid support. To check that the AFM tip reached the surface, the films were scratched for different durations, and the resulting depths were measured under low force conditions. To passively image the thickness of the protein layer without introducing any scratches, the set point was reduced to 0.0 V, the scan area was increased to 2–4 μm2, and the scan speed was reduced (∼5.8 Hz). To account for surface variation within each chip and to acquire data amenable to statistical evaluation, topographical images were acquired from four different areas of the coated chip. The thickness of a chip coated with carboxydextran (only) was used as a reference (thus, z = 0.0 nm). Note that the tip was exchanged frequently to minimize the possibility of tip damage and tip wear due to excessive force application. For SPR experiments, we used gold films coated onto BK7 glass slides (Biosensing Instruments, Tempe, AZ). Each chip is a glass surface coated with a gold layer (47 nm thick) over an intermediate layer of chromium (2 nm in thickness). After each gold chip was cleaned with pure ethanol and dried under a stream of N2, 15–20 μl of cystamine dihydrochloride (20 mm; Sigma) was cast onto each film overnight in a humidified reaction chamber. Cystamine dihydrochloride is light-sensitive, and the chamber was thus covered with a lid. Next, each chip surface was thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and dried by gentle blowing with a stream of N2 (15Yao X. Li X. Toledo F. Zurita-Lopez C. Gutova M. Momand J. Zhou F. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 354: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We prepared a fresh mixture of 15 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide, 75 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, and 6 mg/ml carboxymethyldextran (Sigma) and added this mixture to chips modified with cystamine dihydrochloride followed by incubation in a humidified chamber for at least 3–5 h (often overnight). We next rinsed and dried each chip surface under a stream of N2 (15Yao X. Li X. Toledo F. Zurita-Lopez C. Gutova M. Momand J. Zhou F. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 354: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After placing a chip into the BI-2000 SPR machine, we coated NOD1 onto a gold film after preactivation with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide solution. This step was repeated until the NOD1 coating level permitted the conduct of SPR experiments (Δ ∼60–80 mDeg). Two fluidic channels can be used on this instrument, and the same sample plug flowed from the first to the second channel. When “serial mode” is selected, the BI-2000 machine coats simultaneously both channels with the same amount of NOD1. This option is essential to permit comparison of the interaction between NOD1 and RICK in the presence or absence of Tri-DAP. Residual activated carboxyl groups were neutralized by a final injection of 1 mm ethanolamine (Sigma). For analysis, a first injection of Tri-DAP was followed by RICK injection with “single mode” selected on channel 1. For comparison, the same protocol was used in the absence of Tri-DAP, again selecting single mode on channel 2. SPR is based on excitation and detection of the collective oscillations of free electrons in a metal film. Such electron oscillations are termed surface plasmons. A light is focused on the film through a glass prism, and reflected light is detected. At the resonance angle, plasmons absorb light, and a dark line is seen in the reflected beam. Any molecular binding event taking place on or near the metal film causes a shift in the resonance angle. By assessing shift over time, molecular binding events can be monitored, and the kinetics of binding events can be analyzed without the use of labels. Several different units have been used to describe SPR signals. The most common include angular shift in degrees, refractive index units (RIU), and resonance units (RU) (16Lahiri J. Isaacs L. Grzybowski B. Carbeck J.D. Whitesides G.M. Langmuir. 1999; 15: 7186-7198Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Angular shift in degrees is the shift in resonance angle upon molecular adsorption or change in the refractive index of the solution. RIU reflect a change in solution refractive index or development of any other process inducing an alteration in SPR signal equivalent to a variation in RIU. RU reflect adsorption at a chip surface that causes a change in an SPR signal. One RU is equivalent to 1 pg/mm2 of sensor surface. The three parameters may be interconverted as follows: 10−6 RIU = 0.73 RU = 7.3 × 10−5 degree = 0.73 pg/mm2; 0.1 mDeg = 1 pg/mm2. Conversion from mDeg or RU to RIU assumes the use of a buffer with an index of refraction close to 1.33, a BK7 prism, and a gold-coated sensor chip. Association and dissociation constants of interactions between NOD1 (full length) or LRR-truncated NOD1-coated molecules and RICK, Tri-DAP, or MDP circulating molecules (CMs) were obtained using a BI-2000 (Biosensing Instruments) using SPR theory. Kd values (expressed in mol/liter−1), which measure the 50% adsorption levels of CMs onto gold chips covered with coated molecules, are commonly used to describe the affinity between two molecules, such as how tightly a ligand binds to a particular receptor. Ligand-receptor affinities are influenced by non-covalent intermolecular interactions between the two molecules, including hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic and Van der Waals forces. Briefly, after coating a chip with NOD1 or LRR-truncated NOD1, CM solutions of increasing concentration were passed over the chip. A two-step interaction curve was obtained. The first step involved adsorption of CMs to the maximal level. In the second step, when the flow of CM concentration returned to zero, nonspecific adsorbed CMs are released with the running buffer. On the chip, only coated molecule remained “attached.” The adsorption curve kinetics thus decreased to a plateau located at a level above the initial base line. The amplitude of CM binding to coated molecules was taken to be the difference between the initial and final levels. Kd values were next determined by analysis of the binding curves obtained using different concentrations of CMs. The LANCE Ultra TR-FRET (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) assay uses the proprietary W1024 europium chelate donor dye in combination with ULight, a low molecular weight acceptor dye showing a red shift in fluorescence emission upon binding. In a typical LANCE assay, phosphorylation of a ULight-peptide substrate is detected using a specific anti-phosphopeptide antibody labeled with europium chelate. Binding of the europium chelate-labeled phosphopeptide antibody to a phosphorylated ULight-peptide brings the donor and acceptor molecules into spatial proximity. Upon irradiation of the reaction solution at 320 or 340 nm, energy emitted by the excited europium chelate donor is transferred to nearby ULight acceptors, which next emit a signal at 665 nm. The intensity of light emission is proportional to the level of ULight substrate phosphorylation. Results are presented as signal/background ratios of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) fluorescence (signal at 665 nm/control value (minus signal from ATP at 665 nm). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test featured in inStat version 3.06 (GraphPad) software. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Previously, we showed that hPepT1 efficiently transports the tripeptide Tri-DAP into the interior of human intestinal epithelial cells inducing an inflammatory response via interaction with NOD1. The response activated the NF-κB inflammatory pathway that in turn stimulated IL-8 secretion (6Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Hervé M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J.

To explore the importance of NOD1 in the proinflammatory signaling pathway activated by PepT1-mediated Tri-DAP transport (21Kufer T.A. Banks D.J. Philpott D.J. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1072: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we down-regulated NOD1 expression using an siRNA approach. As shown in Fig. 1B-1, NOD1 expression (protein) in Caco2-BBE cells transfected with siRNA directed against NOD1 was knocked down. Some NOD1 protein expression was apparent after 4 h of Tri-DAP (5 mm) stimulation; however, these levels were decreased compared with cells that were not transfected with NOD1 siRNA. Also as shown in Fig. 1B-1, Tri-DAP induced NOD1 protein expression after 2- and 4-h stimulation of Caco2-BBE cells. Similarly in Fig. 1B-2, NOD1 mRNA expression in Caco2-BBE cells transfected with siRNA directed against NOD1 was reduced by 93% after 4 h of Tri-DAP-mediated induction compared with the expression level in untransfected cells or those transfected with scrambled siRNA. Next, we showed that down-regulation of intestinal NOD1 in intestinal epithelial Caco2-BBE cells due to siRNA treatments reduced the enhancement in expression of IL-8 seen upon exposure to 1 mm Tri-DAP for 2 or 4 h. Thus, IL-8-encoding mRNA decreased 5-fold, whereas the protein level dropped by 2-fold. The resulting levels of IL-8-encoding mRNA and protein were comparable with those of unstimulated Caco2-BBE cells (Fig. 1, B-3 and B-4, respectively). These experiments demonstrate that NOD1 is essential for activity of the proinflammatory signaling pathway activated by PepT1-mediated transport of Tri-DAP (4Dalmasso G. Nguyen H.T.

However, these experiments did not provide direct evidence of binding between molecules involved in the pathway. To study direct protein/protein interactions, we obtained recombinant proteins that are known to be involved in the signaling pathway (Fig. 1C). In the present work, AFM was used to explore the possibility of a direct interaction among NOD1, Tri-DAP, and RICK that could be subsequently confirmed via SPR. The AFM tip scratch method (22Zhu R. Ebner A. Kastner M. Preiner J. Howorka S. Hinterdorfer P. Chemphyschem. 2009; 10: 1478-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was used to measure the thickness of the adsorbed protein film upon exposure to solutions of protein that associated with NOD1. Specifically, we repeatedly scanned (100–1,000 scans) a region of interest (500 × 500 nm2) applying high force loads to remove protein and to measure the z position of the underlying gold layer (z = 0). Next, the cantilever was retracted, and routine AFM imaging of a larger area (2–4 μm2) was used to measure z′, the thickness of the protein-coated layer in the vicinity of the scratched region. In Fig. 2, column 1 shows the topography, whereas column 2 contains data derived from lateral force microscopy. The topography channel provides quantitative information on the height of objects scanned by the AFM tip. The second signal, lateral force microscopy, is a measure of tip bending in the lateral direction. Such bending is the result of several factors including friction, force dissipation, surface rigidity, and molecular roughness. Here, lateral force microscopy data also reflect interactions with the meniscus as the work was conducted under ambient conditions. Fig. 2, column 3, shows the height difference (Δz) between the two regions, z′ and z, described above. All AFM experiments were conducted in triplicate, and the measurement of the height of the protein layer was statistically valid (Fig. 2). We first measured the thickness of the carboxydextran film bound to the gold surface, ΔzA (Fig. 2A, columns 1, 2, and 3), which was found to be 4.7 ± 0.4 nm. The thickness of the carbxydextr"

Biochem. 2010; 147: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Most secretory and membrane proteins cotranslationally enter the ER and are subjected to post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and disulfide bond formation. Disulfide bonds are vital for the correct folding and maintenance of the conformation of secretory proteins (3Anelli T. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The oxidative environment of the ER is suitable for efficient disulfide bond formation, and it harbors a number of oxidoreductases that participate in the oxidation, isomerization, and reduction of disulfide bonds (4Appenzeller-Herzog C. Ellgaard L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). endoplasmic reticulum protein disulfide isomerase surface plasmon resonance. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a representative ER-resident oxidoreductase that catalyzes disulfide formation and acts as a molecular chaperone (5Hatahet F. Ruddock L.W. Ahn K. Benham A.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). PDI has two catalytically active domains (a and a′), each of which possesses a catalytic Cys-X-X-Cys motif and two non-catalytic b and b′ domains (see Fig. 4A). The hydrophobic region of the b′ domain is known to serve as a substrate-binding domain. ERO1 (Ero1p in yeast), which encodes a flavoprotein oxidase, was identified as the primary oxidative source in the ER (7Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In conjunction with the oxidation of the substrate proteins, ERO1 consumes molecular oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor and produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). ERO1 does not transfer oxidizing equivalents directly to substrate proteins. Instead, ERO1 oxidizes PDI, which oxidizes substrate proteins by the formation of disulfide bonds (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 1pH-dependent oxygen consumption of ERO1α(WT). A, a schematic model of Ero1α-driven electron transfer. During the oxidation of PDI by ERO1α, ERO1α transfers electrons from PDI to O2, which in turn becomes a reactive oxygen species (ROS(H2O2)).

The C150A/C295A Ero1p mutant exhibited a deregulated increase in its oxidase activity and disturbed redox homeostasis by hyperoxidizing the yeast ER (8Sevier C.S. Qu H. Heldman N. Gross E. Fass D.

Thus, one or more regulatory intra-disulfide bonds have an important role in optimizing the ER redox environment. Human ERO1α has similar regulatory disulfide bonds; however, the regulatory mechanism is different from that of yeast Ero1p. Regulatory (non-catalytic) cysteines of ERO1α form disulfide bonds with the catalytic cysteines (10Baker K.M. Chakravarthi S. Langton K.P. Sheppard A.M. Lu H. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2988-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Inaba K. Masui S. Iida H. Vavassori S. Sitia R. Suzuki M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3330-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Specifically, when ERO1α is under inactivated condition, Cys94, which is known to be involved in receiving electrons from PDI, forms a disulfide bond with Cys131. The other cysteine of the outer active site (Cys99) forms a disulfide bond with Cys104. When both disulfide bonds are reduced/isomerized, the Cys94–Cys99 shuttle disulfide is formed and ERO1α is fully activated (see Fig. 2A) (9Appenzeller-Herzog C. Riemer J. Christensen B. S⊘rensen E.S.

In the present study, a detailed in vitro analysis of the regulatory disulfides in mammalian ERO1α was performed using an oxygen consumption assay that had been optimized for pH, temperature, and ionic strength. The functional differences between yeast and mammalian ERO1 proteins were compared in terms of their specificities for the substrates, PDI/Pdi1p proteins. Finally, the study yielded experimental evidence that ERO1α catalyzes the PDI oxidation by way of intramolecular electron transfer from its a domain to its a′ domain. Human PDI and ERO1α cDNAs without the signal sequence were amplified by PCR from a Matchmaker Pretransformed Human HeLa library (Clontech) and subcloned into the modified pETDuet-1 vector (Novagen) modified with an N-terminal His6 tag and TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease recognition site called the pETDuet-TEV vector. The C166A mutation was introduced into all ERO1α constructs to avoid formation of disulfide-linked ERO1α dimers or oligomers as mentioned previously, except in supplemental Fig. S4 (11Inaba K. Masui S. Iida H. Vavassori S. Sitia R. Suzuki M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3330-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Yeast Ero1p and Pdi1p were amplified from Yeast ORF Collections (ID, YML130C; Ero1p and YCL043C; Pdi1p) and subcloned into the pETDuet-TEV vector. All mutations for PDI, ERO1α, and Ero1p were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The overexpression and purification of ERO1α and its mutants that lacked the non-functional cysteine Cys166 was performed according to the method of Inaba et al. (11Inaba K. Masui S. Iida H. Vavassori S. Sitia R. Suzuki M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3330-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, ERO1α was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μm FAD to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.6, and the expression of the recombinant proteins was induced at 24 °C for 12–16 h by adding 200 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were collected, and protein purification was performed at 4 °C as follows. Harvested cells were sonicated in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Sigma). The supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 0.5 m imidazole after washing the column with the lysis buffer. The eluted ERO1α sample was oxidized with the addition of potassium ferricyanide at a final concentration of 20 mm for 20 min on ice, which was followed by gel-permeation chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200-pg column, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and no imidazole. The fractions containing monomeric ERO1α were applied onto the Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8). The sample was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient ranging from 0 to 500 mm. Yeast Ero1p and mutant protein were overexpressed in E. coli strain Origami B (DE3), and the other procedures were the same as those for ERO1α, but without the potassium ferricyanide treatment. The overexpression and purification of PDI/Pdi1p and its variants were performed essentially as described in Ushioda et al. (15Ushioda R. Hoseki J. Araki K. Jansen G. Thomas D.Y. Nagata K. Science. 2008; 321: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (YSI 5331). Experiments were performed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA at 25 °C using a constant temperature incubator in air-saturated buffer, except for the experiments shown in Figs. 1B, 1C, 2B, and 2C and supplemental Fig. S1A and S1B as described in each figure. Catalytic oxygen consumption was initiated by the addition of 2 μm ERO1α, Ero1p, or their variants in a reaction mixture containing 12.5 mm DTT, or PDI, Pdi1p or their variants and 10 mm GSH, as depicted in each figure. The oxidoreductase concentrations used are also given in each figure. Association or dissociation rate constants (kon or koff) for the direct binding of PDI/Pdi1p or their variants to immobilized ERO1α(WT) or its variants were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements on a ProteOn XPR36 Protein Interaction Array System (Bio-Rad). ERO1 was coupled to the GLC sensor chip (Bio-Rad) using amine coupling chemistry. As a control, one channel was coupled with BSA to exclude background binding. Sensorgrams were recorded simultaneously for five concentrations of analytes ranging from 0.44 μm to 36 μm in triplicate increments at 25 °C for a 2-min association phase, followed by a 10-min dissociation phase by using 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5; except Fig. 1D), 150 mm NaCl, 0.001% Tween 20 and 2 mm EDTA as running and sample buffer. Sensorgrams were analyzed by non-linear regression analysis according to a two-state model using ProteOn Manager Version 2.0.1 software (Bio-Rad), except when PDI(sub) was analyzed. PDI(sub) reached the steady state promptly, and the equilibrium parameter was extracted by analyzing a set of sensorgrams of the steady state. Experiments were replicated at least three times. The oxygen consumption assay using the Clark-type oxygen sensor is a useful technique to analyze the oxidase activity of the ERO1 protein family (Fig. 1A) (16Clark Jr., L.C. Wolf R. Granger D. Taylor Z. J. Appl. Physiol. 1953; 6: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The high sensitivity of this assay system causes the results to be affected by various experimental conditions, including temperature, ionic strength, pH, and stirring rate (17Berntsson M. Tengberg A. Hall P.O. Josefson M. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1997; 355: 43-53Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, these factors have not been adequately examined. The amount of dissolved oxygen is influenced by changes in temperature and ionic strength of the solvent. As the NaCl concentration and the temperature increase, the amount of dissolved oxygen decreases, which artificially affects the ERO1α oxygen consumption response curve (supplemental Figs. S1A and S1B). Alteration of pH affects the protonated or deprotonated states of the cysteine thiols within proteins depending on their pKa and directly affects the activity of oxidoreductases (5Hatahet F. Ruddock L.W. Ahn K. Benham A. Craik D. Ellgaard L. Ferrari D. Ventura S. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2009; 11: 2807-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). When DTT was used as the electron donor, the higher the pH value of the reaction buffer, the faster the oxygen consumption rate (Fig. 1B). This effect may be caused by the increased efficiency of electron transfers between DTT and ERO1 at higher pH values, which provided an apparent higher specific activity of ERO1α at higher pH values. However, when GSH was used as an electron donor in the presence of PDI, which will be oxidized by ERO1α (Fig. 1A), the oxygen consumption rate decreased as the pH value increased (Fig. 1C). This pH dependence in the oxidation reaction could be explained in part by differences in the binding affinity of PDI with ERO1α at different pH values. ERO1α binding affinity to PDI was strong at pH 7 but decreased to the extent of one-tenth at pH 8 (Fig. 1D). Previously, it was reported that oxidase and isomerase activities of PDI are pH-dependent and show maximum activities near pH 7 (18Wang Y.H. Narayan M. Protein J. 2008; 27: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, to obtain accurate results for the oxidoreductase activity of ERO1α in the oxygen consumption assay, it is necessary to maintain optimal and fixed conditions for the pH, temperature, and ionic strength of the solvent. Thus, physiologically relevant conditions for ERO1α and PDI were chosen, i.e. pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, with constant temperature and stirring speed in the following study. Isomerization of regulatory disulfide bonds is required for the activation of ERO1α activity (Fig. 2A). Mutations of both cysteine 104 and 131 to alanine produce a constitutively active mutant of ERO1α, ERO1α(C104A/C131A) (11Inaba K. Masui S. Iida H. Vavassori S. Sitia R. Suzuki M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3330-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Chambers J.E. Tavender T.J. Oka O.B. Warwood S. Knight D. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29200-29207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We confirmed its increased enzymatic activity and observed a pH dependence similar to that of ERO1α(WT) (Fig. 2, B and C). Some reports suggest the existence of an additional potential regulatory disulfide between cysteine 85 and 391 (10Baker K.M. Chakravarthi S. Langton K.P. Sheppard A.M. Lu H. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2988-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Tavender T.J. Bulleid N.J. Antioxid. Redox.

Chem. 2010; 285: 29200-29207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The effect of this disulfide bond Cys85–Cys391 on the activity of ERO1α was examined by constructing alanine mutations of these cysteines (C85A and C391A) in combination with the C104A and C131A mutations. C85A or C391A single mutants of ERO1α produced a poor yield and were intrinsically unstable, as reported previously (10Baker K.M. Chakravarthi S. Langton K.P. Sheppard A.M. Lu H. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2988-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 3K. Araki and K. Nagata, unpublished observation. On the other hand, ERO1α(C85A/C391A), a double cysteine mutant, was significantly more stable compared with the C85A and C391A single mutants, suggesting that the presence of a free counterpart cysteine (Cys391 in the C85A mutant and Cys85 in the C391A mutant) might disturb proper disulfide bond formation, resulting in structural instability. Oxygen consumption analysis confirmed that these mutations did not increase the oxidase activity of ERO1α (supplemental Fig. S2). In fact, ERO1α(C85A/C104A/C131A/C391A) decreased the accelerated activity of ERO1α(C104A/C131A) (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that its structure would not be disturbed by these mutations, because its oxygen consumption rate in the presence of DTT and its binding affinity for PDI were identical to those of ERO1α(WT) (Fig. 2, E and F). These results demonstrate that Cys94–Cys104 and Cys99–Cys131 disulfide bonds serve a major negative regulatory function and that Cys85–Cys391 disulfide bond formation would be necessary for proper oxidative activity of ERO1α. Thereafter, in experiments described below, ERO1α(C104A/C131A) was used as a constitutively active mutant. Human PDI-ERO1α and yeast Pdi1p-Ero1p pathways might have different characteristics in the regulation and complementation because of differences in the organization of their disulfide bonds. A short form of yeast Ero1p (Fig. 3A), hereafter named sEro1p, which consisted of amino acids 56–424, was used to determine the crystal structure and was shown to have oxidase activity as previously reported (Fig. 3B) (12Heldman N. Vonshak O. Sevier C.S. Vitu E. Mehlman T. Fass D. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Gross E. Sevier C.S. Heldman N. Vitu E. Bentzur M. Kaiser C.A.

Cell. 2004; 117: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The oxygen consumption assay showed that, when yeast sEro1p was used as an oxidase, yeast Pdi1p was oxidized whereas human PDI was not (Fig. 3C). This effect was also demonstrated when the constitutively active sEro1p was used. Next, when human ERO1α was used as an oxidase, the yeast Pdi1p was oxidized less efficiently than human PDI (Fig. 3D). The same result was found for the constitutively active mutant ERO1α(C104A/C131A). These results indicated that ERO1 oxidizes PDI in a species-specific manner. In addition, we found that the binding affinity of yeast Pdi1p with human ERO1α was two orders of magnitude weaker than that of human PDI with ERO1α (Fig. 3E). Hence, the low catalytic activity of ERO1α with yeast Pdi1p could be partly explained by this weak binding affinity. To confirm the correlation between the binding affinity and the oxygen consumption rate, a PDI mutant with decreased substrate-binding activity was constructed. Because both the F258W and I272A mutations in the b′ domain reduce the binding affinity for peptide substrates, we mutated these residues to obtain PDI(sub) (Fig. 4A) (23Koivunen P. Salo K.E.

This mutant showed a marked decrease in the binding affinity for ERO1α that was three orders of magnitude weaker than that of wild-type PDI (Fig. 4B). The rate of oxidation of PDI(sub) by ERO1α was much decreased compared with that of wild-type PDI (Fig. 4C). Thus, the binding affinity directly affects the ERO1α oxidation reaction (11Inaba K.

To examine whether the specificity of ERO1α toward the two active sites, a and a′ domains, of human PDI could be reproduced in our assay, we analyzed the activity of ERO1α in the presence of PDI mutants where the CGHC motif in the a or a′ domain was mutated to AGHA (Fig. 5A). The oxygen consumption assay showed that PDI(a′), with the intact CGHC motif in the a′ domain, was effectively oxidized by ERO1α. However, PDI(a) with the mutated AGHA motif in the a′ domain was not oxidized to any extent by ERO1α (Fig. 5B). Similar specific oxidation was also observed for the constitutively active ERO1α(C104A/C131A) mutant (Fig. 5C). There was a large difference between the oxygen consumption rate of PDI(a′) and PDI(WT) even in the presence of constitutively active ERO1α(C104A/C131A), whereas both PDI(WT) and PDI(a′) contain the intact CGHC motif in the a′ domain (compare the red curve (PDI(a′)) with the gray curve (PDI(WT)) in Fig. 5C). This raised the possibility that the lack of CGHC motif in the a domain caused such a decrease in the oxygen consumption by ERO1α. Fig. 5C showed that ERO1α selectively oxidized the a′ domain of PDI and accepted electrons from that domain. Therefore, electrons must be supplied from some other donor, either from different molecules or from different domains in the same molecule, most probably from the a domain of PDI. If intermolecular electron transfer can occur, electrons could be transferred from the a domain of one PDI to the a′ domain of the other PDI. To examine this possibility, PDI(a) and PDI(a′) were mixed in the presence of constitutively active ERO1α(C104A/C131A), and the oxygen consumption assay was performed. If intermolecular electron transfer can occur, that is, if the a′ domain accepted electrons from the a domain in different PDI molecules, the presence of both PDI(a) and PDI(a′) in the reaction mixture with ERO1α would result in the same oxygen consumption curve as that formed using wild-type PDI. However, the mixture of PDI(a) and PDI(a′) did not increase the oxygen consumption rate, and a rate almost similar to that found with PDI(a′) was observed. This suggested that intermolecular electron transfer did not occur during the oxidation of PDI by ERO1α. We further examined intermolecular electron transfer to determine whether changes in the reduction potential of the a domain affected reactivity with ERO1α. Altering the two residues between the cysteines in the Cys-X-X-Cys active motif in the thioredoxin domain has been reported to affect the reduction potential of this domain. For example, mutating the active motif from CGHC to CGPC in the a domain, here named PDI[H55P], was shown to lower its reduction potential, whereas mutation from CGHC to CPHC, here named PDI[G54P], was reported to increase its reduction potential (13Vitu E. Kim S. Sevier C.S. Lutzky O. Heldman N. Bentzur M. Unger T. Yona M. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. J. Biol.

To evaluate the effect of each of these mutations, we mutated G54P or H55P in the presence of an AXXA mutation in the a′ domain, resulting in PDI(a)[G54P] and PDI(a)[H55P], respectively (Fig. 6A). The results of the oxygen consumption assay showed that PDI(a)[G54P] and PDI(a)[H55P] were minimally oxidized by constitutively active ERO1α, which was consistent with the data obtained with PDI(a) (Fig. 6B). However, PDI[H55P], which has an intact a′ domain, exhibited a significantly increased oxygen consumption rate, whereas PDI[G54P] had a decreased oxygen consumption rate (Fig. 6B). Although previous reports demonstrated no correlation between the reduction potential and the rate of oxidation, altering the reduction potential in the a domain, which is minimally oxidized by ERO1α, affects the net reactivity with ERO1α. This suggests the presence of an intramolecular electron relay between the a and a′ domains (13Vitu E. Kim S. Sevier C.S. Lutzky O. Heldman N. Bentzur M. Unger T. Yona M. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 18155-18165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that electrons were transferred from the a domain to the a′ domain, within a single PDI molecule during oxidation by ERO1α. The oxygen consumption assay is used in the analysis of the ERO1 oxidase activity. However, the experimental conditions were not well characterized, which could cause discrepancies in the data obtained (10Baker K.M. Chakravarthi S. Langton K.P. Sheppard A.M. Lu H. Bulleid N.J.

We found a physical as well as functional pH dependence of ERO1α and PDI, with the apparent maximum catalytic rate and binding affinity observed at pH ∼7 (Fig. 1, C and D). This suggested that PDI is fine-tuned to catalyze oxidative folding near the physiological pH in the ER (27Kim J.H. Johannes L. Goud B. Antony C. Lingwood C.A. Daneman R. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with previous data, which suggests the isomerase and oxidase activities of PDI are most efficient at pH 7 when using RNase or a small peptide as model substrates (18Wang Y.H.

The low pKa of the N-terminal catalytic cysteines of PDI (4.4–6.7) compared with the normal pKa of cysteines on the protein (∼8.3) may cause such a pH dependence (28Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B.

The pH dependence of the binding affinity might be due to the electrostatic properties of positive and negative charges of ERO1α and PDI, respectively, which are affected by the pH shift (5Hatahet F.

Human ERO1α possesses regulatory disulfides, which serve as a redox-sensor to maintain the proper oxidative environment of the ER (14Tavender T.J. Bulleid N.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2010; 13: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It has not been clear whether the Cys85–Cys391 disulfide bond stabilizes the structure of ERO1α or regulates its activity (11Inaba K. Masui S. Iida H. Vavassori S. Sitia R. Suzuki M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3330-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Tavender T.J. Bulleid N.J. Antioxid. Redox.

The results indicate that the Cys85–Cys391 disulfide was not involved in the regulation of ERO1α activity, but that Cys94–Cys104 and Cys99–Cys131 are the critical disulfide bonds that negatively regulate the enzymatic activity of ERO1α. Recently solved crystal structures of human ERO1α and yeast Ero1p illustrated the structural differences that underlie their distinct regulatory mechanisms (11Inaba K. Masui S. Iida H. Vavassori S. Sitia R. Suzuki M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3330-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Heldman N. Vonshak O. Sevier C.S. Vitu E. Mehlman T. Fass D.

Cell. 2004; 117: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Yeast Ero1p contains a Cys150–Cys295 disulfide bond that innately controls its enzyme activation, but ERO1α does not have such a disulfide bond (7Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Ero1p also has the regulatory disulfide bond Cys90–Cys349 that, when reduced, increases enzyme activity to a lesser extent. The corresponding disulfide bond in ERO1α is the Cys85–Cys391 bond, but this did not contribute to enzyme activation (Fig. 2, D and E, and supplemental Fig. S2). Regulatory disulfide bonds of Ero1p/ERO1α are probably determined by the redox states of Pdi1p or PDI and/or the redox buffer within the ER. In vitro complementation analysis showed that the substrate specificity with the highest enzyme activity was obtained using protein combinations from the same species (Fig. 3, C and D). However, even though the catalytic activity of ERO1α with yeast Pdi1p was less efficient in the in vitro analysis, the human ERO1α complemented the temperature-sensitive yeast Ero1p mutant in vivo. This apparent discrepancy would be an interesting issue to address in the future (31Bertoli G. Simmen T. Anelli T. Molteni S.N. Fesce R. Sitia R. J. Biol.

The results also provide insights into the mechanism of how electrons are transferred within the PDI molecule during its oxidation by ERO1α. SPR analysis using point mutations in the b′ domain of PDI suggested that it is the b′ domain that contributes to the specific binding with ERO1α, a result that is consistent with previous reports (Fig. 4B) (11Inaba K. Masui S. Iida H. Vavassori S. Sitia R. Suzuki M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3330-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Wang L. Li S.J. Sidhu A. Zhu L. Liang Y. Freedman R.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2011; 286: 16261-16271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). If the single domains of each a and a′ domain were extracted, they showed the same oxygen consumption rate in the presence of constitutively active ERO1α (11Inaba K. Masui S. Iida H. Vavassori S. Sitia R. Suzuki M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3330-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Domain-swapping mutants of PDI showed that the position of a′ domain was preferentially oxidized, suggesting the importance of the domain position (25Wang L. Li S.J. Sidhu A. Zhu L. Liang Y. Freedman R.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 199-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recent structural analysis indicates that the b′ domain of PDI specifically interacts with a protruding β-hairpin of ERO1α (33Masui S. Vavassori S. Fagioli C. Sitia R. Inaba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16261-16271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hence, the specific binding site and domain architecture of PDI allow specific binding between PDI and ERO1α and define the preferred oxidation of the a′ domain by ERO1α. For ERO1α, the maximum rate of oxygen consumption required both the intact a and a′ domains, which suggests that electron exchange occurs between these domains. We also showed that the a′ domain of PDI was efficiently oxidized by ERO1α, whereas the a domain was not (Fig. 5, B and C). These results were reproduced using ERO1α containing a non-functional cysteine Cys166, which is thought to promote dimer formation of ERO1α, suggesting that Cys166 may not contribute to the preferential oxidation of the a′ domain (supplemental Fig. S4). Thus, the specific oxidation of the a′ domain is defined by the spatial binding of ERO1α to PDI, and the direct oxidation of the a domain of PDI by ERO1α is physically restricted. In addition, electron transfer occurred by way of intramolecular relay, but not through intermolecular transition (Fig. 5D). The occurrence of electron relay is further supported by the results of oxygen consumption assays using the reduction potential-altered mutants of the a domain. Although the a domain itself was minimally oxidized by ERO1α, the shift in reduction potential of the a domain dramatically affected the net oxidation rate, clearly indicating intra-electron relay between the a and a′ domains. Considering the fact that the a′ domain is preferentially oxidized by ERO1α, electrons are most probably transferred from the a domain to the a′ domain and, subsequently, to ERO1α (Fig. 6C). Recent data also indicated that the electron transfer occurred from the a to the a′ domain but did not distinguish between inter- or intramolecular electron transfer (20Chambers J.E. Tavender T.J. Oka O.B. Warwood S. Knight D. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29200-29207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A dynamic conformational change within PDI might allow direct electron transfer within the PDI molecule, or perhaps aromatic amino acid residues of PDI or ERO1α might allow intramolecular electron relays similar to those of photosynthesis or the mitochondrial respiratory complex (34Wang C.

https://openalex.org/W2161319069,"The immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) are a family of proteins induced by interferon-γ that play a crucial role in innate resistance to intracellular pathogens. The M subfamily of IRG proteins (IRGM) plays a profound role in this context, in part because of the ability of its members to regulate the localization and expression of other IRG proteins. We present here evidence that IRGM proteins affect the localization of the guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), a second family of interferon-induced GTP-binding proteins that also function in innate immunity. Absence of Irgm1 or Irgm3 led to accumulation of Gbp2 in intracellular compartments that were positive for both the macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) marker LC3 and the autophagic adapter molecule p62/Sqstm1. Gbp2 was similarly relocalized in cells in which autophagy was impaired because of the absence of Atg5. Both in Atg5- and IRGM-deficient cells, the IRG protein Irga6 relocalized to the same compartments as Gbp2, raising the possibility of a common regulatory mechanism. However, other data indicated that Irga6, but not Gbp2, was ubiquitinated in IRGM-deficient cells. Similarly, coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that although Irgm3 did interact directly with Irgb6, it did not interact with Gbp2. Collectively, these data suggest that IRGM proteins indirectly modulate the localization of GBPs through a distinct mechanism from that through which they regulate IRG protein localization. Further, these results suggest that a core function of IRGM proteins is to regulate autophagic flux, which influences the localization of GBPs and possibly other factors that instruct cell-autonomous immune resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1972486502,"Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases coordinate the highly disparate processes of apoptosis and inflammation. However, although hundreds of substrates for the apoptosis effector caspases (caspase-3 and caspase-7) have been identified, only two confirmed substrates for the key inflammatory protease (caspase-1) are known. Whether this reflects intrinsic differences in the substrate specificity of inflammatory <i>versus</i> apoptotic caspases or their relative abundance <i>in vivo</i> is unknown. To address this issue, we have compared the specificity of caspases-1, -3, and -7 toward peptide and protein substrates. Contrary to expectation, caspase-1 displayed concentration-dependent promiscuity toward a variety of substrates, suggesting that caspase-1 specificity is maintained by restricting its abundance. Although endogenous concentrations of caspase-1 were found to be similar to caspase-3, processed caspase-1 was found to be much more labile, with a half-life of ∼9 min. This contrasted sharply with the active forms of caspase-3 and caspase-7, which exhibited half-lives of 8 and 11 h, respectively. We propose that the high degree of substrate specificity displayed by caspase-1 is maintained through rapid spontaneous inactivation of this protease."

All vertebrate GLUTs contain 12 transmembrane (TM) domains and a conserved N-glycosylation consensus site (Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser) that is typically positioned in the first or fifth extracellular loop. Responsiveness to insulin is a functional feature of GLUT4, and it is therefore believed to play an essential role in glucose homeostasis. GLUT4 is selectively expressed in insulin-responsive tissues such as adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells (3Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized and glycosylated GLUT4 enters a continuous recycling pathway that concentrates most GLUT4 in intracellular storage vesicles under basal conditions (4Thong F.S. Dugani C.B. Klip A.

It is widely accepted that type 2 diabetes is caused by the impaired ability of insulin to regulate glucose homeostasis adequately, as a result of insulin resistance in multiple tissues. GLUT4 has drawn intense attention in the context of type 2 diabetes development, and several studies have found an association between impaired translocation/recycling of GLUT4 and insulin resistance (4Thong F.S.

Clarification of the molecular events involved in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is therefore of medical importance. The glycans on glycoproteins are known to play important roles in the physicochemical properties of proteins, including their solubility, proper folding, and thermal stability, as well as in their physiological properties, including their bioactivities or intracellular/intercellular trafficking (13Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 14Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). A GLUT4 glycosylation mutant was previously found to be nonfunctional primarily because of its very low level of expression in rat adipose cells (15Ing B.L. Chen H. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Quon M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of the N-glycan chain on GLUT4 has not yet been clarified. In this study, we used a GLUT4 mutant lacking the sole N-glycosylation site (N57Q) to assess the importance of the N-glycan chain on GLUT4. To this end, stable transfectants expressing C-terminally enhanced GFP (EGFP)-tagged wild-type (WT) GLUT4 or the GLUT4 glycosylation mutant were isolated using HeLa cells. The overall stability of the protein was compromised in the mutant, suggesting that the N-glycan chain contributes to quality control of newly synthesized GLUT4. Moreover, our results clearly indicated that WT and mutant GLUT4 exhibited different intracellular distributions, i.e. insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), a marker for GLUT4 storage vesicles, markedly co-localized with WT GLUT4, whereas its co-localization with the mutant was much less apparent. Consistent with this observation, WT GLUT4 retained the ability for enhanced cell surface expression upon insulin treatment in HeLa cells, whereas the mutant failed to respond to insulin. Interestingly, WT GLUT4 also lost sensitivity to insulin when cells were treated with kifunensine (KIF), an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi α-mannosidase I, strongly indicating an important role for N-glycan structure in GLUT4 trafficking. In contrast, the glucose transport activity of the cell surface transporter was not altered between WT and mutant GLUT4, suggesting that the N-glycan was not important for transporter activity. Taken together, these findings indicate critical roles for the N-glycan chain in quality control and intracellular trafficking of GLUT4.

These procedures were carried out by Kenji Ohtawa (Support Unit for Bio-Material Analysis, Research Resource Center, RIKEN Brain Science Institute). L6 myoblasts were a kind gift from Dr. Toshihide Kobayashi (RIKEN, Saitama, Japan). L6 myoblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin). The cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids using the FuGENE HD transfection reagent, and the transfected cells were cultured for 2 days after seeding to reach confluence. L6 cells differentiated into myotubes within 7 days after seeding in medium supplemented with 2% FBS. Anti-GFP polyclonal antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody was obtained from Millipore (Temecula, CA), and anti-HA (F-7) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies for Western blotting analyses were purchased from GE Healthcare and for immunofluorescence from Molecular Probes. Human recombinant insulin (4 mg/ml solution) was obtained from Invitrogen, and peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase) F was from Roche Applied Sciences. A BCA protein assay kit, Sulfo-NHS-Biotin, and NHS-SS-Biotin were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). HeLa cells stably expressing GLUT4-EGFP (WT or N57Q) were cultured in 24-well plates. The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA) containing CompleteTM protease inhibitor EDTA-free (Roche Applied Sciences) at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay. Aliquots of the lysates (3 μg of protein) were incubated with 0.5 unit of PNGase F overnight at 37 °C. Aliquots of the lysates incubated under the same conditions without PNGase F were used as controls. The incubated mixtures were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membrane was subjected to Western blotting procedures and visualized using a LAS3000mini (Fujifilm Co., Tokyo, Japan) and Immobilon Western Reagents (Millipore). Cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) and 10 μm MG-132 (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan) for various periods. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. For KIF treatment, cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml KIF (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) for 2 days prior to cycloheximide chase assay. HeLa cells stably expressing GLUT4-EGFP (WT or N57Q) were cultured in 6-well plates. The cells were serum-starved in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) (129 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm d-glucose, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% BSA; pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) for 3 h, and then incubated with or without 100 nm insulin for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm Sulfo-NHS-Biotin for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with 100 mm glycine in PBS, the cells were lysed as described above. The biotinylated proteins were pulled down with streptavidin-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and subjected to Western blot analysis. Internalization assays were performed as described previously (17Aroeti B. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2297-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Kato M.

Briefly, HeLa cells stably expressing GLUT4-EGFP (WT or N57Q) were serum-starved in KRB and then incubated with 100 nm insulin for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with ice-cold KRB and incubated on ice with ice-cold KRB containing 0.5 mg/ml NHS-SS-Biotin twice for 15 min at 4 °C. After two washes with ice-cold KRB, the cells were cultured in prewarmed KRB for 0, 30, or 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold KRB containing 10% FBS, and the remaining cell surface biotin was removed by incubating the cells in a reducing solution (50 mm glutathione (reduced form), 75 mm NaCl, 0.3% NaOH, and 10% FBS) twice for 20 min at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide in KRB, and cell lysates were prepared. The biotinylated cell surface proteins were pulled down with streptavidin-Sepharose for further analyses. Experiments were carried out using an FV1000-D laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an incubator, and the cells were maintained at 37 °C throughout the experiments. HeLa cells expressing GLUT4-EGFP (WT or N57Q) were plated on glass-bottomed dishes (35-mm diameter) and serum-starved in KRB. The cells were then stimulated with insulin (100 nm), and time lapse images were acquired at 5-min intervals at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For internalization assays, the cells were serum-starved in KRB and then stimulated with insulin (100 nm) for 30 min just prior to imaging. After washing to remove insulin, images of the cells in KRB were acquired under the same conditions described above. HeLa cells expressing GLUT4-EGFP (WT or N57Q) were grown on cover glasses (12-mm diameter) placed in 24-well plates in medium and serum-starved in KRB. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 20 min, washed twice with PBS, permeabilized with 50 μg/ml digitonin for 15 min, and incubated with 1% BSA-PBS for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti-IRAP (Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-transferrin receptor (TfR) (BD Transduction Laboratories) at 1:50 dilution for 1 h at room temperature followed by Alexa Fluor 546-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed, mounted with a drop of Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (FV500). See also supplemental Experimental Procedures. Flow cytometry analysis was performed as described previously (19Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4785-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, L6 myoblasts transiently expressing HA-GLUT4-EGFP (WT or N57Q) were cultured and differentiated in 6-well plates. Myotubes were serum-starved in KRB and then incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm insulin for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were transferred to 4 °C, washed with ice-cold KRB, and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of anti-HA in 2% BSA-KRB for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with ice-cold KRB, the cells were incubated with a 1:400 dilution of Alexa Fluor-633-labeled anti-mouse IgG in 2% BSA-KRB for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times with KRB, detached by incubation with 1 mm EDTA-PBS for 10 min at 37 °C, and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After three washes with 0.5% BSA-PBS, the cells were resuspended in 0.5% BSA-PBS. The fluorescence of stained cells was measured using a BD LSR flow cytometer and CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosystems). In each case, 5,000 GFP-positive cells were counted. The glucose uptake activity was measured using 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG) (Peptide Institute Inc.), as described previously (20Yamada K. Saito M. Matsuoka H. Inagaki N. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 24-well plates were serum-starved in KRB and then incubated in glucose-free KRB containing 100 nm insulin for 20 min at 37 °C. To measure the time course of 2-NBDG transport, the cells were incubated with 500 μm 2-NBDG in glucose-free KRB containing 100 nm insulin for various times, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of ice-cold KRB containing 0.5 mm phloretin. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer. The fluorescence intensities were measured using an F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with λex = 465 nm and λem = 540 nm. The kinetic parameters were determined under similar conditions with various concentrations of 2-NBDG (100 μm, 200 μm, 500 μm, 1 mm, or 2 mm), and the reactions were carried out for 2 min to determine the initial velocity of the transport. EGFPtagging does not affect the insulin-responsive trafficking of GLUT4 (21Lampson M.A. Racz A. Cushman S.W. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4065-4076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dawson K. Aviles-Hernandez A. Cushman S.W. Malide D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). C-terminally EGFP-tagged WT GLUT4 or its glycosylation mutant (N57Q) was therefore transfected into HeLa cells to provide insights into the roles of the N-glycan of GLUT4. Consistent with previous observations using rat adipose cells (15Ing B.L. Chen H. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Quon M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it was found that N57Q was expressed at a lower level than WT after transient transfection into HeLa cells. Cells stably expressing similar amounts of WT or N57Q were therefore selected using a FACS, and the isolated cells were used for further analyses. The N-glycosylation of GLUT4-EGFP was confirmed by SDS-PAGE in cells with or without PNGase F treatment (Fig. 1A). Cell proliferation did not differ significantly between HeLa cells expressing WT and N57Q (supplemental Fig. S1), but transfected cells expressing N57Q were smaller (data not shown). To examine the stability of N57Q and WT GLUT4, cycloheximide chase experiments were carried out. N57Q was degraded more rapidly than WT in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). This finding indicates that the N-glycan chain is critical for the stability of GLUT4 and may at least partly explain the low level of expression of the mutant protein in various cells. Consistent with this idea, when the proteasomal activity was inhibited by MG-132, N57Q degradation was delayed to the level of WT, whereas that of WT was barely affected (Fig. 1B). Collectively, these findings suggest that the compromised protein stability of N57Q was caused mainly by the quality control system for newly synthesized proteins and that the N-glycan on GLUT4 is critical for this protein to escape proteasomal degradation. The stability of the GLUT4 proteins on the cell surface was also examined. Cell surface proteins were labeled with biotin and chased for specified times. The remaining biotinylated GLUT4 proteins were then detected by Western blot analysis. In sharp contrast to the overall stability, N57Q on the cell surface was found to be as stable as WT (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest that the rapid degradation of N57Q occurred in its intracellular pool but that once it reached the cell surface, its half-life was not significantly affected by the absence of the N-glycan. GLUT4 is known to change its main subcellular localization from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface in response to insulin treatment (23Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the responses of GLUT4 proteins expressed in HeLa cells to insulin treatment. HeLa cells are known to express insulin receptors (24Blaker G.J. Birch J.R. Pirt S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1971; 9: 529-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as AS160 (25Pozuelo Rubio M. Geraghty K.M. Wong B.H. Wood N.T. Campbell D.G. Morrice N. Mackintosh C. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), a key molecule for mediating insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, and are therefore expected to respond to insulin treatment. Insulin stimulation of HeLa cells is also known to induce PI3K signaling (26Dubois F. Vandermoere F. Gernez A. Murphy J. Toth R. Chen S. Geraghty K.M. Morrice N.A. MacKintosh C. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 2487-2499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These previous observations led us to speculate that most, if not all, of the insulin-mediated signal transductions are intact in HeLa cells. The subcellular distributions of WT and N57Q were examined using confocal microscopy. A dominant localization in dot-like structures inside the cells was evident for WT (Fig. 2A, left panels for WT). A similar major intracellular localization was observed for N57Q, although the dot-like structures were less clear (Fig. 2A, left panels for N57Q). The dot-like structures for WT co-localized well with IRAP, one of the known components of GLUT4-specific vesicles referred to as “GLUT4 storage vesicles” (27Kandror K.V. Yu L. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30777-30780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B, panels for WT). In contrast, co-localization of N57Q with IRAP was much less apparent (Fig. 2B, panels for N57Q). Both WT and N57Q were partially distributed in TfR-containing recycling vesicles (Fig. 2C). The response to insulin in HeLa cells was examined using time lapse analysis. Time-dependent translocation of WT to the cell surface was clearly observed (Fig. 2A, WT clones 1 and 2), indicating that GLUT4-EGFP was capable of responding to insulin treatment in HeLa cells. In sharp contrast, no notable change in distribution of N57Q was observed (Fig. 2A, N57Q clones 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained for 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes, where GLUT4 is known to be expressed and to respond to insulin treatment (supplemental Fig. S2). Collectively, these findings suggest that the N-glycan on GLUT4 is critical for intracellular trafficking, which in turn affects its insulin-mediated translocation to the cell surface. To confirm the effects of the N-glycan on GLUT4 translocation, cell surface biotinylation experiments were carried out with or without insulin treatment. The cell surface expression of WT was markedly increased upon insulin treatment (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3), whereas no notable difference was observed for N57Q (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). Quantification of the data in Fig. 3A showed that the cell surface expression level of N57Q under basal conditions was higher than that of WT, possibly as a result of correct targeting of N57Q to the intracellular storage vesicles (Fig. 3B). It also demonstrated the insulin induced up-regulation of cell surface expression of WT, but not N57Q. These results suggest that the N-glycan on GLUT4 is critical for its insulin-mediated translocation. The N57Q mutation is associated with a distinct cellular distribution as well as insulin insensitivity of the GLUT4 protein; however, it is possible that the change in the protein structure induced by the N57Q mutation, rather than the N-glycan, is responsible for the altered behavior of the GLUT4 protein. We therefore examined the effects of KIF, an inhibitor of ER/Golgi α-mannosidase I, on the insulin sensitivity of WT GLUT4, to determine whether its insulin sensitivity depended on the N-glycan structure. HeLa cells expressing GLUT4(WT)-EGFP were treated with 2 μg/ml KIF for 2 days. As shown in Fig. 4A, GLUT4 in KIF-treated cells produced a faster migrating band on SDS-PAGE than KIF-untreated GLUT4 (compare lane 1 with lane 4). KIF-treated GLUT4 also became sensitive to treatment with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion (compare lane 4 with lane 5), clearly suggesting a change in the overall N-glycan structure on GLUT4 in the presence of KIF. After confirming the change in N-glycan structure, we examined the effect of KIF on GLUT4 stability. As shown in Fig. 4B, KIF had little effect on the stability of GLUT4 protein, indicating that the N-glycan structure was not critical for GLUT4 protein stability. The effects of KIF on GLUT4 insulin responsiveness were examined by cell surface biotinylation assay (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, WT GLUT4 in KIF-treated cells lost its insulin responsiveness and, as with N57Q (Fig. 3B), showed increased cell surface expression levels compared with KIF-untreated cells under basal conditions. These results collectively indicate that the insulin responsiveness, but not the protein stability, of GLUT4 is N-glycan structure-dependent. Flow cytometry revealed similar results in L6 myotubes expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP, which possesses an HA epitope in the first extracellular loop. Cell surface GLUT4 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 633 via the HA epitope. As shown in Fig. 5, enhanced cell surface expression of HA-GLUT4(WT)-EGFP in L6 myotubes was apparent upon insulin treatment (left panel), whereas no notable change was observed for N57Q (middle panel). Moreover, WT HA-GLUT4-GFP lost its insulin responsiveness in KIF-treated L6 cells (right panel), implying that the effect of N-glycan structure on insulin-mediated translocation is a general phenomenon, rather than a cell type-specific event.FIGURE 5Insulin-stimulated translocation of HA-GLUT4-EGFP in L6 myotubes. Flow cytometry was used to measure insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation of unstained HA-GLUT4(WT/N57Q)-EGFP-expressing cells (filled light gray histogram), insulin absence (thin lines), or insulin-stimulated (bold lines) cells. Alexa Fluor 633 fluorescence (proportional to cell surface GLUT4) was measured within GFP-positive cells (proportional to total GLUT4). Left, HA-GLUT4(WT)-EGFP-expressing cells.

Right, HA-GLUT4(WT)-EGFP-expressing cells treated with 2 μg/ml KIF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate further the effects of the N-glycan on GLUT4 translocation, GLUT4 internalization following insulin removal from the medium was also investigated. The insulin response is known to be reversible, and the distribution of GLUT4 returns to basal levels upon removal of insulin (5Huang S. Czech M.P. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 237-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Time lapse analyses clearly showed the apparent internalization of WT to form dot-like structures upon the removal of insulin, whereas the localization of N57Q did not appear to change (Fig. 6A). These findings further indicate that the N-glycan on GLUT4 is important for its translocation in response to insulin. There are two possible explanations for the observed insulin insensitivity of N57Q: (i) no response to the signal or (ii) balanced exocytosis/endocytosis, i.e. active recycling between the cell surface protein and intracellular pool at a steady state. To distinguish between these two possibilities, internalization assays were carried out for WT and N57Q upon removal of insulin. Cell surface WT and N57Q were labeled with a disulfide-cleavable biotinylation reagent on ice, and their internalization was induced by raising the temperature to 37 °C. Cell surface biotin was removed at specified times by treating the cells with glutathione, and the proteins with remaining biotin, representing endocytosed GLUT4, were quantified. WT at the cell surface was found to be internalized upon the removal of insulin in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6B, lanes 2–4), whereas no obvious increase in the incorporation of N57Q was observed (Fig. 6B, lanes 6–8). These findings imply that the insensitivity to insulin may simply be caused by a lack of the insulin re"

The complex as a whole is required for recognizing damage in DNA, and specific functions have been attributed to individual members. A heterotetrameric Mre11-Rad50 complex forms a globular DNA binding head that bridges DNA free ends via extended Rad50 coiled coils and a hook region that facilitates this linkage (13Chen L.

On localization to DNA DSB, Mre11 employs its single-strand endonuclease activity for DNA end processing (5Buis J. Wu Y. Deng Y. Leddon J. Westfield G. Eckersdorff M. Sekiguchi J.M. Chang S.

Use of a chromatinized DSB repair assay in Xenopus laevis extracts, depleted of Mre11, revealed efficient and accurate NHEJ (17Di Virgilio M. Gautier J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Huang and Dynan (18Huang J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) demonstrated that reconstitution of mammalian DNA DSB repair end-joining had a requirement for the MRN complex. This apparent contradiction has been resolved by a series of reports that provide evidence for a role for MRN in NHEJ. This complex plays a role in NHEJ during V(D)J recombination in developing immunocytes (19Deriano L. Stracker T.H. Baker A. Petrini J.H. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and during isotype class switching (20Dinkelmann M. Spehalski E. Stoneham T. Buis J. Wu Y. Sekiguchi J.M. Ferguson D.O. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Silencing Mre11 reduced the efficiency of both the canonical and alternate pathways of NHEJ independent of ATM, mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) (21Rass E. Grabarz A. Plo I. Gautier J. Bertrand P. Lopez B.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Xie A. Kwok A. Scully R. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have shown that C-terminal Binding Protein Interacting Protein and MRN promote NHEJ of DNA DSB in G1 phase. Mre11/Rad50/NBN Nijmegen breakage syndrome homologous recombination non-homologous end-joining ataxia-telangiectasia amino acids nucleoplasmic fraction double-strand break gray defective in ataxia-telangiectasia. Disorders in members of the MRN complex overlap in their clinical and cellular phenotype with A-T (24Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev.

This syndrome is characterized by a defect in the ATM protein that responds to DNA DSB by signaling to the cell cycle checkpoints and the DNA repair machinery (26Shiloh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 27McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2007; 8: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In its role as a sensor of DNA DSB, MRN recruits ATM to the sites of damage where it is fully activated in the presence of several other DNA damage response proteins (28Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 29Berkovich E. Monnat Jr., R.J. Kastan M.B. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, there is not an absolute requirement for the MRN complex for ATM activation as cells from patients with ATLD and NBS can activate ATM, albeit at a reduced efficiency (32Uziel T. Lerenthal Y. Moyal L. Andegeko Y. Mittelman L. Shiloh Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in vitro experiments point to an absolute requirement for MRN in ATM activation (33Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2005; 308: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). In human cells, autophosphorylation on specific sites (Ser-367, -1893, -1981, and -2996) is an inherent part of the mechanism of activation (34Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar, 35Kozlov S.V. Graham M.E. Peng C. Chen P. Robinson P.J. Lavin M.F.

Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 9107-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mutations at these sites alter the functional activity of ATM. However, dependence on autophosphorylation for Atm activation is not observed in mutant mice (38Daniel J.A. Pellegrini M. Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Feigenbaum L. Nussenzweig A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence that the mechanism of activation of ATM is also dependent upon the form of damage to the cell (39Guo Z. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Person M.D. Paull T.T. Science. 2010; 330: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Once activated, ATM phosphorylates a number of downstream substrates, including NBN (41Lim D.S. Kim S.T. Xu B. Maser R.S.

These studies show that ATM-dependent phosphorylation of NBN plays an adaptor role in downstream signaling as phosphosite mutants in this protein fail to correct the S-phase defect in NBS cells. On the other hand, there is evidence for and against the requirement for NBN phosphorylation for cell survival post-irradiation (40Gatei M. Young D. Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Spring K.

Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that Mre11 is phosphorylated, observed as a partial mobility shift of Mre11 after exposure to high doses of radiation (46Dong Z. Zhong Q. Chen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19513-19516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). More recently, Di Virgilio et al., (47Di Virgilio M. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) used Xenopus egg extracts to demonstrate that hyperphosphorylation of Mre11 inactivates the MRN complex by facilitating its dissociation from chromatin. This was achieved by analyzing the activity of different forms of Mre11 with all eight (S/T)Q ATM/ATR consensus sites mutated, but it was not possible to identify which specific sites were phosphorylated or which were responsible for MRN inactivation. On the other hand, Robison et al. (48Robison J.G. Elliott J. Dixon K. Oakley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34802-34810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the majority of DNA damage-induced phosphorylated Mre11 was found in the chromatin-bound fraction, pointing to tighter binding after phosphorylation. Although ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the third member of the complex, Rad50, has been detected in large scale phosphoproteomic studies (49Linding R. Jensen L.J. Ostheimer G.J. van Vugt M.A. J⊘rgensen C. Miron I.M. Diella F. Colwill K. Taylor L. Elder K. Metalnikov P. Nguyen V. Pasculescu A. Jin J. Park J.G. Samson L.D. Woodgett J.R. Russell R.B. Bork P.

Science. 2007; 316: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar), its functional significance has not been established. We report here that Rad50 phosphorylation on Ser-635 is required for ATM-dependent cell cycle control, DNA repair, and cell survival in response to DNA DSB. Lymphoblastoid cell lines from normal (C2ABR), A-T patients (AT25ABR), and a Rad50-deficient patient (HA239) were grown in RPMI with 10% FCS (15% FCS for Rad50-deficient lymphoblastoid cells), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Fibroblasts transformed with Human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase from control (NFF), A-T (AT4B1), and Rad50-deficient (F239) cells were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. All cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Full-length, wild-type FLAG-Rad50 was generated by ligation of an hRad50-FLAG PCR fragment into pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). Wild-type FLAG-Rad50 was mutated at Ser 635 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the resultant mutants were verified by sequencing. Transfection of Rad50-deficient fibroblasts with either empty vector or full-length wild-type or mutant Rad50 constructs was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Selection for resistant cells was initiated 48 h post-transfection with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science). Clonogenic cell survival after exposure to radiation was carried out as described previously (8Waltes R. Kalb R. Gatei M. Kijas A.W. Stumm M. Sobeck A. Wieland B. Varon R. Lerenthal Y. Lavin M.F. Schindler D. Dörk T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2009; 84: 605-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Control and A-T non-transfected fibroblasts and Rad50-deficient fibroblasts transfected with Rad50 constructs were resuspended at 2 × 105 cells/ml in medium. Cells were irradiated with 1–5 Gy of gamma rays and plated out to determine survival by counting colonies. Survival was expressed as the percentage of irradiated/unirradiated cells. Error bars represent S.E. using data from three separate experiments. Ion irradiation was done at the universal linear accelerator (GSI UNILAC). U2OS cells were transfected with either wild-type or mutant Rad50 constructs using the amaxa nucleofector 1 (Lonza, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the measurement of the Rad50 recruitment, U2OS were cultivated on biofoil (18-mm diameter, 25-μm thickness), irradiated with 197Au (Etarget: 4.55 MeV/n Linear energy transfer: 13,050 keV/μm) at the beamline microscope and analyzed as described (51Jakob B. Rudolph J.H. Gueven N. Lavin M.F. Taucher-Scholz G. Radiat. Res. 2005; 163: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 35–40 nuclei were analyzed per plasmid. Low angle irradiation was performed on cells seeded on squared coverslips as described (52Jakob B. Scholz M. Taucher-Scholz G. Radiat. Res. 2003; 159: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) using 197Au. All irradiations were done at a fluence of around 3 × 106 ions/cm2. Cell extracts were prepared by lysis in universal immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCI (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.3% Nonidet P-40). For immunoprecipitations, lysates were precleared with protein A beads and then incubated with the specific antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose using Towbin's buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm Glycine, 20% Methanol and 0.02% SDS) at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibodies to SMC1, NBS1, KAP-1, and KAP-1 Ser(P)-15 (rabbit polyclonal) were purchased from Novus Biologicals; anti-FLAG and anti-β actin were from Sigma; anti-rabbit p53 and anti-mouse p53 Ser 15 were from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies to Rad50, SMC1 Ser-957, and NBS, Ser 343 were from Upstate Biotechnology; anti-rabbit Chk2 and Chk2 pT68 were from Abcam; anti-rabbit ATM Ser-1981 was from Rockland, and anti-ATM and Mre11 (mouse monoclonal antibodies) were from GeneTex. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Millipore and Rockland, respectively. Immunoblottings and immunoprecipitations were carried out according to the manufacturers' directions. Membranes were visualized using ECL (PerkinElmer Life Science). Rad50 anti-Ser-635-phosphospecific antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with the diphtheria toxoid-conjugated synthetic peptide DVCGpSQDFES. Antibodies were purified from crude serum using the non-phosphorylated peptide immobilized on an Aminolink® Plus Immobilization kit in the first run-through followed by elution from an affinity column with the phosphorylated peptide. Purified antibody was separated into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. A series of 4 overlapping GST Rad50 constructs was generated that together spanned the full length of Rad50 (GST1 (aa 77–417), GST2 (aa 274–642), GST3 (aa 638–1021) and GST4 (aa 909–1312)). These fragments were generated by PCR and cloned in pGEX-5X-1. A short GST Rad50 containing Ser 635 (aa 588–666) was also prepared for substrate verification. The fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to standard procedures. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting mutants were verified by sequencing. For kinase assays, cells were irradiated as indicated. ATM immunoprecipitations were prepared with ATM-5BA antibody (35Kozlov S.V. Graham M.E. Peng C. Chen P. Robinson P.J. Lavin M.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3504-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and protein G-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C. ATM protein kinase assays were prepared as described previously (35Kozlov S.V. Graham M.E. Peng C. Chen P. Robinson P.J. Lavin M.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3504-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, immune complexes were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm, MnCl2, 1 mm DTT and 5 μm ATP) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of soluble GST-Rad50 fusion protein for 30 min at 30 °C. Kinase reactions were terminated, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. ATM kinase assays with purified components were performed as described previously (33Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2005; 308: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Rad50-deficient cells transfected with Rad50 constructs were labeled consecutively with 15 μm chlorodeoxyuridine for 20 min, including a mock or 5 Gy treatment, and then a further 20 min with 15 μm iododeoxyuridine. DNA fibers were prepared as described elsewhere (53Parra I. Windle B. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly 2 μl of cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were mixed with 6 μl of lysis solution (0.5% SDS, 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 50 mm EDTA), and after 10 min slides were tilted to 15° to spread the DNA fibers. Slides were air-dried both pre- and post-fixation in methanol/acetic acid (3:1). DNA fibers were denatured in 2.5 m HCl for 60 min and immunolabeled with rat monoclonal anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (BU1/75, Abcam) and anti-rat Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) to label chlorodeoxyuridine. Iododeoxyuridine was subsequently labeled with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd (BD Biosciences) and donkey anti-mouse Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). DNA tracks were scored (300–500) for each cell line for mock and 5 Gy treatments. The percentage of new DNA tracks was determined (new initiations/total elongations ×100, and standard deviation was calculated from three independent experiments. This assay was carried out as described previously (54Xu B. Kim St. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In short, control (NFF), A-T (AT5), and F239 Rad50-complemented cells were harvested by trypsinization at 1 and 2 h after exposure to 2 Gy irradiation and washed with PBS. Cells were fixed in suspension at a concentration of 106 cells/ml in 2.0 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol for 24 h at −20 °C. Cells were incubated in blocking solution (1% BSA in PBS) and with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phospho-H3 (S10) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) at a 1:30 dilution in blocking solution for 3 h at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in 25 μg/ml propidium iodide and RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) in PBS for 30 min. Cellular fluorescence was measured using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometry and analyzed using BD Cell Quest Pro Version 5.1.1. This assay was performed as described previously (8Waltes R. Kalb R. Gatei M. Kijas A.W. Stumm M. Sobeck A. Wieland B. Varon R. Lerenthal Y. Lavin M.F. Schindler D. Dörk T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2009; 84: 605-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Control and Rad50-deficient fibroblasts transfected with Rad50 constructs were irradiated with 1 Gy. For G2/M phase, colcemid at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml was added immediately after irradiation, ∼1–2 h before harvesting. The cells were treated with 0.075 m KCl, fixed, and stained as described above. A total of 50 metaphases were analyzed for each sample. Control and Rad50-deficient cells complimented with Rad50 constructs were seeded onto coverslips in 6-well plates for 24 h before treatment with 5 Gy and allowed to recover for 1 h. Cells were washed in PBS and then pre-extracted with Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 1 mm sodium fluoride) for 30 min on ice. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde on ice for 15 min and then blocked in PBS containing 5% bovine serum fraction V albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody incubations of either 53BP1 (Cell signaling, MA; 1:300), γH2AX (Upstate; 1:1000), Mre11 (Sigma; 1:1000), Rad50 (Sigma; 1:200), or Rad50 Ser(P)-635 (1:400) were performed in BSA blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI for 10 min at room temperature. After three final washing steps, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were captured using a Leica TCS confocal scanner equipped with an ArKr laser on the Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope (Lens: HCX PlanApo 63× oil/NAI.32). Cellular protein fractions were prepared as described previously (48Robison J.G. Elliott J. Dixon K. Oakley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34802-34810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and washed in ice-cold PBS. The nucleoplasmic fraction (NF) was obtained by incubation of cells for 10 min on ice in 0.5% Triton X-100 in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), 10 mm β-glycerophosphate and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet, consisting of intact nuclei (verified microscopically), was washed with PBS and treated with 100 μg/ml RNase-free DNase1 (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 37 °C. DNase-treated nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was retained. The DNase pellet was washed with lysis buffer and incubated with buffer containing 500 mm NaCl for 10 min at 4 °C. This extract was clarified by centrifugation and pooled with the DNase-retained supernatant to constitute the chromatin-bound fraction. The NaCl concentration in this fraction was adjusted to 150 mm with the lysis buffer. The NF and chromatin-bound fraction fractions were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. The NHEJ assay was carried out as described previously (55Wang H.C. Chou W.C. Shieh S.Y. Shen C.Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1391-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in which the pEGFP-N1 vector was used as a reporter. pEGFP-N1 was digested with HindIII for 6 h to cleave between the promoter and the GFP coding region. The linearized plasmid was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then purified by a Qiagen gel extraction kit. The complete digestion was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Cell lines for Rad50-deficient fibroblasts were established by transfection with either Rad50-FLAG-pcDNA1.3+, Rad50S635G- FLAG-pcDNA1.3+, or empty pcDNA1.3+ vector. Together with NFF (control), fibroblast cells (1 × 106) were transfected with either HindIII linearized or uncut pEGFP-N1 (1 μg) in 6-well plates using"
https://openalex.org/W2118355604,"Autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) arise from complex interactions between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Whole genome linkage scans and association studies have established thyroglobulin (TG) as a major AITD susceptibility gene. However, the causative TG variants and the pathogenic mechanisms are unknown. Here, we describe a genetic/epigenetic mechanism by which a newly identified TG promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant predisposes to AITD. Sequencing analyses followed by case control and family-based association studies identified an SNP (-1623A→G) that was associated with AITD in the Caucasian population (p = 0.006). We show that the nucleotide substitution introduced by SNP (-1623A/G) modified a binding site for interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a major interferon-induced transcription factor. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that IRF-1 binds to the 5' TG promoter motif, and the transcription factor binding correlates with active chromatin structure and is marked by enrichment of mono-methylated Lys-4 residue of histone H3, a signature of active transcriptional enhancers. Using reporter mutations and siRNA approaches, we demonstrate that the disease-associated allele (G) conferred increased TG promoter activity through IRF-1 binding. Finally, treatment of thyroid cells with interferon α, a known trigger of AITD, increased TG promoter activity only when it interacted with the disease-associated variant through IRF-1 binding. These results reveal a new mechanism of interaction between environmental (IFNα) and genetic (TG) factors to trigger AITD."
https://openalex.org/W2070489478,"Emerging evidence indicates that amyloid β peptide (Aβ) initially induces subtle alterations in synaptic function in Alzheimer disease. We have recently shown that Aβ binds to β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and activates protein kinase A (PKA) signaling for glutamatergic regulation of synaptic activities. Here we show that in the cerebrums of mice expressing human familial mutant presenilin 1 and amyloid precursor protein genes, the levels of β2AR are drastically reduced. Moreover, Aβ induces internalization of transfected human β2AR in fibroblasts and endogenous β2AR in primary prefrontal cortical neurons. In fibroblasts, Aβ treatment also induces transportation of β2AR into lysosome, and prolonged Aβ treatment causes β2AR degradation. The Aβ-induced β2AR internalization requires the N terminus of the receptor containing the peptide binding sites and phosphorylation of β2AR by G protein-coupled receptor kinase, not by PKA. However, the G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation of β2AR and the receptor internalization are much slower than that induced by βAR agonist isoproterenol. The Aβ-induced β2AR internalization is also dependent on adaptor protein arrestin 3 and GTPase dynamin, but not arrestin 2. Functionally, pretreatment of primary prefrontal cortical neurons with Aβ induces desensitization of β2AR, which leads to attenuated response to subsequent stimulation with isoproterenol, including decreased cAMP levels, PKA activities, PKA phosphorylation of serine 845 on α-amino-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-oxo-4-isoxazolepropanoic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit 1 (GluR1), and AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. This study indicates that Aβ induces β2AR internalization and degradation leading to impairment of adrenergic and glutamatergic activities. Emerging evidence indicates that amyloid β peptide (Aβ) initially induces subtle alterations in synaptic function in Alzheimer disease. We have recently shown that Aβ binds to β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and activates protein kinase A (PKA) signaling for glutamatergic regulation of synaptic activities. Here we show that in the cerebrums of mice expressing human familial mutant presenilin 1 and amyloid precursor protein genes, the levels of β2AR are drastically reduced. Moreover, Aβ induces internalization of transfected human β2AR in fibroblasts and endogenous β2AR in primary prefrontal cortical neurons. In fibroblasts, Aβ treatment also induces transportation of β2AR into lysosome, and prolonged Aβ treatment causes β2AR degradation. The Aβ-induced β2AR internalization requires the N terminus of the receptor containing the peptide binding sites and phosphorylation of β2AR by G protein-coupled receptor kinase, not by PKA. However, the G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation of β2AR and the receptor internalization are much slower than that induced by βAR agonist isoproterenol. The Aβ-induced β2AR internalization is also dependent on adaptor protein arrestin 3 and GTPase dynamin, but not arrestin 2. Functionally, pretreatment of primary prefrontal cortical neurons with Aβ induces desensitization of β2AR, which leads to attenuated response to subsequent stimulation with isoproterenol, including decreased cAMP levels, PKA activities, PKA phosphorylation of serine 845 on α-amino-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-oxo-4-isoxazolepropanoic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit 1 (GluR1), and AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. This study indicates that Aβ induces β2AR internalization and degradation leading to impairment of adrenergic and glutamatergic activities.

Oddo S. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 170-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Mounting evidence suggests that in the early phase of AD, memory loss is due to synaptic malfunction caused by diffusible amyloid β peptide (Aβ), before neuronal degeneration (2Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). In supporting this notion, we have recently shown that Aβ interacts with β2 adrenergic receptors (β2AR) in the central noradrenergic system to regulate synaptic functions in prefrontal cortical (PFC) neurons (3Wang D. Govindaiah G. Liu R. De Arcangelis V. Cox C.L. Xiang Y.K. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3511-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).

The central noradrenergic system is thought to determine the global orientation of the brain concerning events in the external world and within the viscera (4Sara S.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). It plays a critical role in arousal, which is important in regulating consciousness, attention, and information processing and is crucial for promoting certain behaviors such as mobility, learning, and pursuit of food (5Csikszentmihalyi M. Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement with Everyday Life. BasicBooks, New York1997: 1-34Google Scholar). βARs, an integral part of central noradrenergic system, belong to G protein-coupled receptors (6Ramos B.P. Arnsten A.F. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 113: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In the brain, βAR is widely distributed in different regions, including the frontal, parietal, piriform, and retrosplenial cortices, medial septal nuclei, olfactory tubercle, midbrain, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamic nuclei (7Asanuma M. Ogawa N. Mizukawa K. Haba K. Hirata H. Mori A. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), regulating working memory and other basic brain functions (3Wang D.

During early AD pathogenesis, the central noradrenergic system undergoes substantial changes in response to the degeneration of its main site, the locus ceruleus (LC) (12German D.C. Manaye K.F.

Psychiatry. 2002; 51: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); however, the levels of adrenergic receptors are not generally increased due to the compensatory mechanism. In fact, a decrease in β2AR levels has been observed in different areas of AD brain (14Westbroek W. Lambert J. Bahadoran P. Busca R. Herteleer M.C. Smit N. Mommaas M. Ballotti R. Naeyaert J.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and βAR response is also decreased in fibroblasts isolated from AD patients (15Huang H.M. Gibson G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Aβ has a binding capacity to β2AR that requires the N terminus of the receptor (3Wang D. Govindaiah G. Liu R. De Arcangelis V. Cox C.L. Xiang Y.K. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3511-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Acute treatment with Aβ initiates signaling transduction via β2AR as an allosteric partial agonist (3Wang D. Govindaiah G.

Aβ binding does not interfere with the binding of catecholamines to the orthosteric binding sites within the receptor transmembrane helices (3Wang D. Govindaiah G. Liu R. De Arcangelis V. Cox C.L. Xiang Y.K. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3511-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In recent years studies have shown that β2AR ligands have signaling selectivity via inducing differential conformational changes and activation of specific signaling pathways (18Reiner S. Ambrosio M.

Because of the heterogeneous binding property, it is necessary to analyze the action of Aβ on β2AR trafficking and cell function. In addition, Aβ is not catabolized as quickly as neurotransmitters at synapses, and the concentrations of the peptide are elevated in AD brains; therefore, persistent effects of Aβ on β2AR functions are of pertinence to AD pathology. PKA, a signaling component downstream to β2AR, promotes the function of AMPA receptors by phosphorylating AMPA receptor subunit 1 (GluR1) (24Banke T.G. Bowie D. Lee H. Huganir R.L. Schousboe A. Traynelis S.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 89-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hu H. Real E. Takamiya K. Kang M.G. Ledoux J. Huganir R.L. Malinow R.

AMPA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels and are one of major mediators of excitatory neurotransmission. We have shown that acute treatment with Aβ increases β2AR- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GluR1 and frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) mediated by AMPA receptors (3Wang D. Govindaiah G. Liu R. De Arcangelis V. Cox C.L. Xiang Y.K. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3511-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here we hypothesize that a persistent treatment with Aβ, in contrast to its acute effects, may impair cell function by decreasing β2AR agonist-induced phosphorylation of GluR1, which is modulated by a GluR1-β2AR complex (3Wang D. Govindaiah G. Liu R. De Arcangelis V. Cox C.L. Xiang Y.K. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3511-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Joiner M.L. Lisé M.F. Yuen E.Y. Kam A.Y. Zhang M. Hall D.D.

In this study a persistent treatment with Aβ indeed induces β2AR internalization and degradation leading to decreased mEPSCs mediated by AMPA receptors. Moreover, in AD animals, β2AR levels in cerebral tissues are significantly reduced, indicating its implication in brain adrenergic and glutamatergic dysfunction in AD. Wild type, β1AR, β2AR, both β1AR and β2AR gene-knock-out (KO), and presenilin 1/amyloid precursor protein (PS1/APP) transgenic mice were used (28Soto D. De Arcangelis V. Zhang J. Xiang Y. Circ.

PS1/APP-transgenic mice overexpress both the human PS1 gene harboring two familial AD mutations, M146L and L286V, and the APP gene (695) with Swedish (K670N, M671L), Florida (I716V), and London (V717I) familial AD mutations. Wild type and PS1/APP transgenic mice (7 months old) were used for analysis of endogenous β2AR levels in the cerebrum. All animal experimental procedures were approved by the University of Illinois Animal Care and Use Committee. Newborn WT, β1AR-KO, β2AR-KO, and β1/β2AR-KO mice were used to isolate PFC neurons under a stereomicroscope (30Chen C.J. Liao S.L. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Isolated neurons were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated dishes at a density of 1.0 × 105-106 cells/ml in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium containing 10% FBS, 1% insulin-transferin-sodium selenite supplement, 25 ng/ml nerve growth factor, 1 mm glutamine, 20 nm water-soluble progesterone, and 100 nm putrescine. The next day medium was changed to Neurobasal-A with B-27 supplement. Cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (2.5 μm, Sigma) was added 3 days after plating. Neurons were cultured for 2–3 weeks before experiments. HEK293 cells, wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and MEFs lacking either arrestin 2 (ARR2) or arrestin 3 (ARR3) gene were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. Aβ1–42 and amino acid sequence-inverted peptide Aβ42–1 (Biopeptide) were dissolved at 10−3 m in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as previously described (31Tong L. Thornton P.L. Balazs R. Cotman C.W. J.

Cells were treated with soluble Aβ1–42 peptide as indicated. Our previous study shows that under these conditions Aβ1–42 dimers are the primary species bound to human FLAG-β2AR expressed on the plasma membrane (3Wang D. Govindaiah G. Liu R. De Arcangelis V.

FLAG-tagged wild type, GRK3A mutant, or PKA4A mutant β2AR was expressed in HEK293 cells or MEFs by transfection or in freshly isolated PFC neurons by virus infection at 100 multiplicity of infection. After a 2-day expression, cells were treated with drugs for detection with anti-FLAG M1 (Sigma) or anti-β2AR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Wild type and K44E-mutant dynamin were detected with anti-HA antibody (Covance). Lysosomes were stained by anti-Lamp I antibody (BD Pharmingen). Alexa488- and Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used to reveal the primary antibodies. Wild type and V54D-mutant ARR3 and βARKct were indicated by GFP fluorescence. Images were quantified with ImageJ-based Fiji open source image-processing package. Briefly, images were rotated to enable optimal selection of areas across the cell body. Plot profile analysis was applied to selected regions for measure of fluorescence intensity. Average of cytosolic fluorescence intensity (CFI) of β2AR was divided by that of membrane fluorescence intensity (MFI) for analysis of β2AR internalization. The ratio of CFI/MFI after stimulation was normalized against the ratio of CFI/MFI at resting state. After serum starvation, cell surface proteins were labeled with 300 μg/ml biotin (Pierce) in PBS with calcium and magnesium containing 10 mm glucose (PBS/G) at 4 °C for 30 min. Free biotin was quenched with 100 mm glycine in PBS/G for 30 min followed by washing with ice-cold PBS/G. Cells were treated for 4 h with medicines replenished every 30 min. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 at 4 °C, 10% glycerol, 45 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 8 mm NaN3, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture) and homogenized using a Sonic Dismembrator 100 (Fisher). Streptavidin was added to 300-μl samples with equivalent protein concentration to precipitate biotin-labeled proteins. Eluates from beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE for detection of biotin-labeled β2AR. γ-Tubulin in supernatants was used as control. Biotin labeling and quenching were the same as that of the degradation assay. After stimulation, residual surface biotin was stripped off with 50 mm Mesna in NT buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% BSA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6) twice. The stripped cells were washed, lysed, and homogenized. Streptavidin was added to the samples to precipitate internalized biotin-labeled proteins. Eluates from beads were subjected to Western blot as mentioned above.

Forty-eight hours after the transfection, the cells were starved for 2 h and treated for 4 h in serum-free media with Aβ (10−6 m) or together with CGP 20712A (10−5 m) and ICI 118551 (10−5 m), which were replenished every 30 min.

The lysosomes were lysed in 5 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 50 mm CH3COONH4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors, pH 8.0. Aβ in the lysates were immunoprecipitated (39Klyubin I.

For detection of APP, samples were subjected to 8% Laemmli SDS-PAGE. Proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore) were blocked with 5% milk in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 8 mm NaN3, and 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against Aβ (Cell Signaling), APP (Sigma), β2AR, GRK-specific phospho-355/356 of β2AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GluR1, and PKA-specific phospho-Ser-845 of GluR1 (Abcam) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for detection with the Li-Cor system (Li-Cor). The optical density of the bands was analyzed with Fiji image-processing package. PFC neurons were infected with viruses to express protein kinase A activity reporter (AKAR2.2) at 37 °C for 24 h, then changed to virus-free medium and cultured for another 2 days. PKA activities were recorded as previously described (28Soto D. De Arcangelis V. Zhang J. Xiang Y. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Zhang J. Hupfeld C.J.

Cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a 40×/1.3NA oil-immersion objective lens and a cooled CCD camera. Dual emission ratio imaging was acquired with a 420DF20 excitation filter, a 450DRLP diachronic mirror, and two emission filters (475DF40 for cyan and 535DF25 for yellow). The acquisition was set with 200-ms exposure in both channels and 20-s elapses. Images in both channels were subjected to background subtraction, and ratios of yellow-to-cyan color were calculated at different time points. In some experiments PFC neurons were pretreated with Aβ (10−6 m) for 40 min, and neurons were then washed 3 times before administration of isoproterenol (10−7 m). The AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs in rat PFC cultures were recorded as described previously (41Yuen E.Y. Liu W. Kafri T. van Praag H. Yan Z. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The internal solution consisted of 130 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 10 mm CsCl, 4 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 2.2 mm QX-314, 12 mm phosphocreatine, 5 mm MgATP, 0.5 mm Na2GTP, 0.1 mm leupeptin, pH 7.2–7.3, 265–270 mosm. The external solution consisted of 127 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 12 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 μm tetrodotoxin, 5 μm bicuculline, pH 7.3–7.4, 300–305 mosm. Recording was conducted with a holding potential of −70 mV in the presence of 25 μm d-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate to block NMDA receptor-mediated components of mEPSCs. Neurons were treated with 0.1% DMSO or Aβ1–42 (10−6 m) for 40 min followed by 3 times washing with 0.1% DMSO-containing media. Synaptic currents were analyzed with Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft, Leonia, NJ). Unpaired t tests and one- or two-way ANOVA were used to compare different groups with Prism software as indicated (Graphpad). Statistical comparisons of the amplitude and frequency of synaptic currents (mean ± S.E.) were made using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A p value less than 0.05 is considered significant. During the early development of AD, the central noradrenergic system undergoes substantial changes in response to the degeneration of its main site, the LC. Recent publications have shown that an acute treatment with Aβ initiates signal transduction via β2AR as an allosteric partial agonist (3Wang D. Govindaiah G. Liu R. De Arcangelis V. Cox C.L. Xiang Y.K. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3511-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Igbavboa U. Johnson-Anuna L.N. Rossello X. Butterick T.A. Sun G.Y. Wood W.G.

In this study we sought to understand the impact of a prolonged treatment with Aβ (10−6 m) on protein levels and function of β2AR in vivo and in vitro. We first examined β2AR protein levels in the cerebrums of 7-month-old PS1/APP double transgenic mice. The β2AR levels were significantly lower than those in wild type animals (Fig. 1A). In agreement, human β2AR expressed in HEK293 cells underwent significant degradation after 4 h of treatment with Aβ (10−6 m) (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, a 40-min stimulation of human β2AR induced colocalization of the receptor with the lysosome marker Lamp I (Fig. 1C), supporting that β2AR internalization and degradation occurs after a prolonged treatment with Aβ. We then set out to examine whether Aβ induces β2AR internalization in HEK293 cells. As we expected, the peptide induced significant receptor internalization after a minimal 10-min stimulation (Fig. 2A). The observation was further confirmed with quantitative measurement of internalized receptors labeled with biotin on the cell surface. Cells expressing human β2AR were labeled with biotin and then stimulated with Aβ or isoproterenol. Biotin remaining on the cell surface was stripped, and the internalized and biotin-labeled receptors were precipitated and blotted with anti-FLAG antibody. The Aβ-induced β2AR internalization displayed a time-dependent accumulation over 40 min of stimulation, which was slower and less robust than that induced by isoproterenol (Fig. 2B). In comparison to β2AR, neither β1AR nor the chimeric β1NT-β2AR, in which the N terminus was replaced by that of β1AR, showed internalization upon Aβ treatment (10−6 m) (Fig. 3, A and C), consistent with the fact that they do not have binding capacity to Aβ (3Wang D. Govindaiah G. Liu R. De Arcangelis V. Cox C.L. Xiang Y.K. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3511-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As controls, both β1AR and the chimeric β1NT-β2AR displayed significant internalization upon isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 3, A and C). Furthermore, we found that the βAR antagonist timolol (10−5 m) blocked β2AR internalization induced by either Aβ (10−6 m) or isoproterenol (10−7 m) (supplemental Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Aβ induces internalization of β2AR in HEK293 cells.

First, we examined whether β2AR internalization induced by Aβ is dependent on dynamin GTPase activity. Overexpression of K44E dominant negative dynamin, but not wild type dynamin, almost completely inhibited β2AR internalization in HEK293 cells under either Aβ (10−6 m) or isoproterenol (10−7 m) stimulation (Fig. 4, A and B). This suggests that these two ligands induce receptor internalization via similar endocytosis pathways. PKA and GRK can phosphorylate β2AR at different sites, which are engaged in dynamin- and arrestin-dependent G protein-coupled receptor desensitization and trafficking. In order to know which kinase is involved in the Aβ-induced β2AR internalization, PKA and GRK phosphorylation site-mutant β2ARs,"

This study aimed first to assess how astrocytes in primary culture behave in response to inflammatory stimuli concerning intracellular Ca2+ responses, expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Na+/K+-ATPase, actin filament organization, and expression of cytokines. In a cell culture model with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), astrocyte response was assessed first in the acute phase and then after incubation with LPS for 1–48 h. The concentration curve for LPS-stimulated Ca2+ responses was bell-shaped, and the astrocytes expressed TLR4, which detects LPS and evokes intracellular Ca2+ transients. After a long incubation with LPS, TLR4 was up-regulated, LPS-evoked Ca2+ transients were expressed as oscillations, Na+/K+-ATPase was down-regulated, and the actin filaments were disorganized. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release was increased after 24 h in LPS. A second aim was to try to restore the LPS-induced changes in astrocytes with substances that may have dose-dependent anti-inflammatory properties. Naloxone and ouabain were tested separately in ultralow or high concentrations. Both substances evoked intracellular Ca2+ transients for all of the concentrations from 10−15 up to 10−4 m. Neither substance blocked the TLR4-evoked Ca2+ responses. Naloxone and ouabain prevented the LPS-induced down-regulation of Na+/K+-ATPase and restored the actin filaments. Ouabain, in addition, reduced the IL-1β release from reactive astrocytes. Notably, ultralow concentrations (10−12 m) of naloxone and ouabain showed these qualities.

As a result, cholangiocytes actively participate in microbe-associated, hepatic proinflammatory responses. We previously showed that infection of cultured human cholangiocytes with the protozoan parasite, Cryptosporidium parvum, or treatment with Gram-negative bacteria-derived LPS, activates NFκB in a myeloid differentiation 88 (MyD88)-dependent manner. Here, we describe a novel signaling pathway initiated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) involving the small GTPase, Ras, that mediates cholangiocyte proinflammatory cytokine production and induction of cholangiocyte proliferation. Using cultured human cholangiocytes and a Ras activation assay, we found that agonists of plasma membrane TLRs (TLR 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6) rapidly (<10 min) activated N-Ras, but not other p21 Ras isoforms, resulting in the rapid (<15 min) phosphorylation of the downstream Ras effector, ERK1/2. RNA interference-induced depletion of TRAF6, a downstream effector of MyD88 and known activator of MAPK signaling, had no effect on N-Ras activation. Following N-Ras activation the proinflammatory cytokine, IL6, is rapidly secreted. Using a luciferase reporter, we demonstrated that LPS treatment induced IL6 promoter-driven luciferase which was suppressed using MEK/ERK pharmacologic inhibitors (PD98059 or U0126) and RNAi-induced depletion of N-Ras. Finally, we showed that LPS increased cholangiocyte proliferation (1.5-fold), which was inhibited by depletion of N-Ras; TLR agonist-induced proliferation was also inhibited following pretreatment with an IL6 receptor-blocking antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2079141660,"The main kidney transporter of many commonly prescribed drugs (e.g. penicillins, diuretics, antivirals, methotrexate, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) is organic anion transporter-1 (OAT1), originally identified as NKT (Lopez-Nieto, C. E., You, G., Bush, K. T., Barros, E. J., Beier, D. R., and Nigam, S. K. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 6471-6478). Targeted metabolomics in knockouts have shown that OAT1 mediates the secretion or reabsorption of many important metabolites, including intermediates in carbohydrate, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism. This observation raises the possibility that OAT1 helps regulate broader metabolic activities. We therefore examined the potential roles of OAT1 in metabolic pathways using Recon 1, a functionally tested genome-scale reconstruction of human metabolism. A computational approach was used to analyze in vivo metabolomic as well as transcriptomic data from wild-type and OAT1 knock-out animals, resulting in the implication of several metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle, polyamine, and fatty acid metabolism. Validation by in vitro and ex vivo analysis using Xenopus oocyte, cell culture, and kidney tissue assays demonstrated interactions between OAT1 and key intermediates in these metabolic pathways, including previously unknown substrates, such as polyamines (e.g. spermine and spermidine). A genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction generated some experimentally supported predictions for metabolic pathways linked to OAT1-related transport. The data support the possibility that the SLC22 and other families of transporters, known to be expressed in many tissues and primarily known for drug and toxin clearance, are integral to a number of endogenous pathways and may be involved in a larger remote sensing and signaling system (Ahn, S. Y., and Nigam, S. K. (2009) Mol. Pharmacol. 76, 481-490, and Wu, W., Dnyanmote, A. V., and Nigam, S. K. (2011) Mol. Pharmacol. 79, 795-805).

https://openalex.org/W2016121442,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules and stimulates their assembly. Current descriptions of the tubulin-interacting regions of Tau involve microtubules as the target and result mainly from deletions of Tau domains based on sequence analysis and from NMR spectroscopy experiments. Here, instead of microtubules, we use the complex of two tubulin heterodimers with the stathmin-like domain of the RB3 protein (T(2)R) to identify interacting Tau fragments generated by limited proteolysis. We show that fragments in the proline-rich region and in the microtubule-binding repeats domain each interact on their own not only with T(2)R but also with microtubules, albeit with moderate affinity. NMR analysis of the interaction with T(2)R of constructs in these two regions leads to a fragment, composed of adjacent parts of the microtubule-binding repeat domain and of the proline-rich region, that binds tightly to stabilized microtubules. This demonstrates the synergy of the two Tau regions we identified in the Tau-microtubule interaction. Moreover, we show that this fragment, which binds to two tubulin heterodimers, stimulates efficiently microtubule assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2032463383,"Chromatin-modifying enzymes play a fundamental role in regulating chromatin structure so that DNA replication is spatially and temporally coordinated. For example, the lysine demethylase 4A/Jumonji domain-containing 2A (KDM4A/JMJD2A) is tightly regulated during the cell cycle. Overexpression of JMJD2A leads to altered replication timing and faster S phase progression. In this study, we demonstrate that degradation of JMJD2A is regulated by the proteasome. JMJD2A turnover is coordinated through the SKP1-Cul1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex that contains cullin 1 and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 4 (FbxL4). This complex interacted with JMJD2A. Ubiquitin overexpression restored turnover and blocked the JMJD2A-dependent faster S phase progression in a cullin 1-dependent manner. Furthermore, increased ubiquitin levels decreased JMJD2A occupancy and BrdU incorporation at target sites.

In eukaryotes, the genome is packaged into chromatin, a highly ordered structure that contains DNA, RNA, histones, and other chromosomal proteins. Histones are targeted by several posttranslational modifications that are regulated by a number of modifying enzymes. Maintaining the proper balance of these posttranslational modifications by chromatin-modifying enzymes is critical for regulating gene expression, cell fate, cell cycle, chromosomal structure, and genomic stability (1Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Cell Res. 2011; 21: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3486) Google Scholar, 2Lee J.S. Smith E. Shilatifard A.

For example, balancing the histone methylation state (e.g. the degree of methylation: mono, di, and tri) within the genome is important for regulating expression of differentiation programs and coordinating DNA replication during the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle (4Corpet A. Almouzni G. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 29-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Bernstein B.E. Meissner A. Lander E.S.

Furthermore, aberrant expression of histone methyltransferases and demethylases results in cancer, developmental defects, and mental retardation (7Varier R.A. Timmers H.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Understanding how these enzymes are regulated is required for comprehending their physiologic and pathological functions. Ubiquitination is a key regulatory pathway for protein stability. Ubiquitin is transferred to lysine residues by a three-enzyme cascade involving E1 activating, E2 conjugating, and E3 ligase enzymes. The E3 ligases, such as the cullin family, provide substrate specificity by coordinating interactions between the E2 and specific substrates (10Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 11Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the ubiquitin system in regulating chromatin modifiers. For example, the mammalian homolog of trithorax in Drosophila, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed lineage leukemia (MLL), is responsible for H3K4 methylation, and its tight regulation is necessary for proper cell cycle progression (12Liu H. Cheng E.H. Hsieh J.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2385-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mixed lineage leukemia is regulated via bimodal ubiquitin-dependent degradation, which results in biphasic expression during the cell cycle. This regulation involves two complexes, SCFSkp2 during S phase, and the anaphase-promoting complex APCCdc20 in late M phase (12Liu H. Cheng E.H. Hsieh J.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2385-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Another methyltransferase regulated via the ubiquitin system during cell cycle is the Su(var)3-9, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax (SET) domain containing lysine methyltransferase 8, Set8/PR-Set7/KMT5A, which catalyzes the monomethylation of H4K20. Set8/PR-Set7 is targeted by three different ubiquitination complexes, SCFSkp2 in G1 (13Yin Y. Yu V.C. Zhu G. Chang D.C.

Here we demonstrate that the decrease in JMJD2A protein levels during the cell cycle was regulated by the proteasome. Cullin 1 interacted with JMJD2A and contributed to ubiquitination and turnover. We then demonstrated that the F-box protein FbxL4 interacted with JMJD2A and regulated protein turnover. Interestingly, ubiquitin overexpression increased JMJD2A protein turnover in cells stably overexpressing JMJD2A and blocked the ability of JMJD2A to promote S phase progression by modulating turnover, occupancy, and replication at target sites. Cullin 1 was critical for the ubiquitin-dependent suppression of the JMJD2A-dependent faster S phase progression.

The DNA was eluted in 1% SDS and 10 μg of proteinase K for 1 h at 55 °C. The DNA was then column-purified (Promega) before analysis by quantitative PCR. BrdU immunoprecipitations and JMJD2A ChIPs were performed as described in Black et al. (25Black J.C. Allen A. Van Rechem C. Forbes E. Longworth M. Tschöp K. Rinehart C. Quiton J. Walsh R.

BrdU and JMJD2A immunoprecipitations were amplified with the WGA2 kit (Sigma). The amplified material was hybridized to chromosome 1–4 tiling arrays (Roche Nimblegen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The microarrays were scanned on a Nimblegen MS200 at 2-μm resolution. A total of 2408 JMJD2A peak locations in the JMJD2A-overexpressed cells were detected by using the MA2C software (p value cutoff = 1.0 E-3) (28Song J.S. Johnson W.E. Zhu X. Zhang X. Li W. Manrai A.K. Liu J.S. Chen R. Liu X.S. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R178Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Raw BrdU ChIP intensity values in each channel were log-transformed (based 2) followed by quantile normalization (29Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Astrand M. Speed T.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6426) Google Scholar). The normalization formula was determined on the basis of intensity values at the 12,900 control probes printed on the Nimblegen array and applied to adjust values at all other probes. After normalization, the replicates were averaged for each experiment. We averaged the normalized BrdU intensities around 2 MB regions centered at the JMJD2A peak locations. Because of the incomplete coverage of the Nimblegen array, we excluded those regions that were less than 50% covered by the microarray, corresponding to 380 peaks. The average BrdU intensities were smoothed using a moving average with a 50-kb window size in 1-kb increment step sizes. For comparison, we randomly selected the same number of regions from the genome and obtained an average profile using the same procedure. For each channel, the mean intensity level was subtracted to further remove any potential artifact. We used a one-sided paired t test to determine whether the difference was statistically significant. All error bars represent S.E. JMJD2A half-lives were calculated using a polynomial trend line. p values were determined with a two-tailed Student's t test. We demonstrated previously that JMJD2A protein levels are regulated during the cell cycle (25Black J.C. Allen A. Van Rechem C. Forbes E. Longworth M. Tschöp K. Rinehart C. Quiton J. Walsh R. Smallwood A. Dyson N.J. Whetstine J.R. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 736-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This observation was confirmed in Fig. 1A (left panel, lanes 1–4). JMJD2A protein levels were highest in G1/S, decreased through S phase, and reached their lowest levels during G2/M (Fig. 1A, left panel) (25Black J.C. Allen A. Van Rechem C. Forbes E. Longworth M. Tschöp K. Rinehart C. Quiton J. Walsh R. Smallwood A. Dyson N.J. Whetstine J.R. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 736-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because JMJD2A RNA levels remained relatively stable (25Black J.C. Allen A. Van Rechem C. Forbes E. Longworth M. Tschöp K. Rinehart C. Quiton J. Walsh R. Smallwood A. Dyson N.J. Whetstine J.R. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 736-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the decrease in JMJD2A protein levels was regulated by protein degradation. To test this hypothesis, we treated HEK293T cells synchronized in different cell cycle phases with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. JMJD2A levels were stabilized in S and G2/M phases (Fig. 1A, right panel). However, we did not observe as substantial an increase in JMJD2A levels in G2/M-synchronized cells treated with MG132. This suggests that the majority of degradation occurred during S phase. The increased levels of JMJD2A upon proteasome inhibition suggested that JMJD2A could be regulated by an ubiquitin-dependent turnover mechanism. Consistent with this hypothesis, endogenous JMJD2A was ubiquitinated under denaturing conditions (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data suggest that JMJD2A is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome. To confirm that the turnover of JMJD2A was mediated by proteasomal degradation, we inhibited protein synthesis with cycloheximide treatment and analyzed JMJD2A protein levels following treatment with vehicle or MG132. Endogenous JMJD2A had a half-life of 2 h. The turnover of JMJD2A was blocked by the addition of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 1C and graphed in D), demonstrating that JMJD2A turnover is 26S proteasome-dependent. To resolve the E3 ligase(s) that were responsible for ubiquitinating JMJD2A, cells were transfected with dominant negative cullin constructs and then synchronized with nocodazole and Western blotted for JMJD2A. Because JMJD2A levels decreased through S phase and are lowest in G2/M, we hypothesized that stabilizing JMJD2A would result in increased levels during G2/M. The dominant negative cullins that were used have a C-terminal truncation, which eliminates the ability to interact with Rbx-1 and the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, blocking ubiquitination and turnover. However, the dominant negative cullins are still able to interact with their substrate. For example, dominant negative cullin 1 interacts with the substrate through the S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1) and the F-box-containing protein but lacks the ability to promote ubiquitination and turnover (26Jin J. Ang X.L. Shirogane T. Wade Harper J. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 287-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consistent with our hypothesis, JMJD2A levels increased with dominant negative cullin 1 overexpression (Fig. 2A, DN-1 or DN-Cul1). This stabilization of JMJD2A was specific as dominant negative cullin 4a (DN-4a), an E3 ligase that regulates proteins associated with proliferating cell nuclear antigen during S phase and failed to stabilize JMJD2A protein levels (Fig. 2A, compare lane 1 to lanes 2, 3, and 4) (30Jackson S. Xiong Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 562-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). DN-Cul1 was also able to regulate exogenously expressed JMJD2A (Fig. 2A, compare lane 5 to lanes 6, 7, and 8). Importantly, overexpression of these dominant negative cullins did not alter the asynchronous cell cycle or the ability to synchronize cells with nocodazole (data not shown). We also observed the same increase in JMJD2A protein levels when cullin 1 was depleted with siRNA in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3The F-box protein FbxL4 interacts with JMJD2A and contributes to JMJD2A degradation. A, screen of F-box proteins involved in the degradation of JMJD2A. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting F-box proteins. For each siRNA, lysates from both asynchronous cells and cells arrested in G2/M by nocodazole and a shake off were immunoblotted for JMJD2A or β-actin. The asynchronous lysates are the first lanes followed by G2/M lysates for each siRNA treatment. The stars denote siRNA treatments that exhibited increased JMJD2A protein levels after nocodazole treatment when compared to si-Ctrl. B, depletion of FbxL4 and FbxW2 prevent the proteasomal degradation of JMJD2A in HeLa cells. HeLa cells transfected with an siRNA targeting FbxL4, FbxW2, FbxL19, or a control siRNA were treated for the indicated times with 89 μm of cycloheximide and then lysed and immunoblotted. C, depletion of FbxW2 prevents the proteasomal degradation of JMJD2A in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells transfected with an siRNA targeting FbxW2 or a control siRNA were treated for the indicated times with 400 μm of cycloheximide and then lysed and immunoblotted. D, depletion of FbxL4 prevents the proteasomal degradation of JMJD2A in HEK293T cells.

WCE, whole cell extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test if this functional interaction was direct, we conducted a series of coexpression experiments to demonstrate that JMJD2A and cullin 1 could coimmunoprecipitate. Immunoprecipitating either protein resulted in detectable association with either JMJD2A or cullin 1, respectively (Fig. 2B). These associations were also validated for endogenous proteins because cullin 1 was immunoblotted in endogenous JMJD2A immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2C). We next asked if cullin 1 contributed to the ubiquitination of JMJD2A. Consistent with the observed interactions, overexpression of DN-Cul1 decreased the amount of ubiquitination in the JMJD2A immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2D). Loss of ubiquitinated JMJD2A coincided with a complete block in the turnover of endogenous JMJD2A when DN-Cul1 was overexpressed (Fig. 2E). These data are consistent with the idea that one or more cullin 1-containing E3 ligase complex(es) contribute(s) to ubiquitination and turnover of JMJD2A. Cullin 1 is a shared subunit of the large family of SCF ubiquitin ligases. SCF family ligases also contain the linker protein SKP1 and one of a large number of F-box protein family members that act as substrate recognition subunits of SCF ligases (11Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). To identify the corresponding F-box protein(s) that interact with JMJD2A and modulate protein turnover, we performed an siRNA screen in HeLa cells for F-box proteins that effect JMJD2A protein levels. The cells were synchronized with nocodazole and immunoblotted for JMJD2A (the same method used to identify cullin 1). The depleted F-box proteins that appeared to increase JMJD2A levels were rescreened and tested for their impact on turnover. A total of eight siRNAs were rescreened, and only depletion of FbxL4, FbxL19, and the F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 2 (FbxW2) increased JMJD2A levels (Fig. 3A, stars). We then determined whether these F-box siRNAs affected protein turnover in HeLa cells. Only depletion of FbxL4 and FbxW2 blocked the turnover of JMJD2A (Fig. 3B). This observation was confirmed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3, C and D). To determine whether FbxL4 or FbxW2 interacted with JMJD2A, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Endogenous FbxL4 coimmunoprecipitated with JMJD2A, suggesting that the two proteins interact (Fig. 3E). We were not able to demonstrate endogenous interactions between JMJD2A and FbxW2. Therefore, we were not able to definitively address whether FbxW2 directly regulated JMJD2A turnover. We next determined whether immunopurified JMJD2A could interact with lysate containing overexpressed FbxL4 in vitro. JMJD2A was immobilized via its HA tag on magnetic beads coated with anti-HA antibodies. The JMJD2A bound on the beads was incubated with extracts from mock-transfected cells or cells expressing FLAG-FbxL4. Unbound proteins were removed by washing, and FbxL4 association was assayed by Western blot analysis. The immunopurified JMJD2A was able to interact with FbxL4 in vitro (Fig. 3F). Taken together, our results are consistent with FbxL4 interacting with JMJD2A and promoting turnover. We have demonstrated previously that increased JMJD2A levels result in faster S phase progression, which was accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility and more replication forks (25Black J.C.

Although much is known about its antimicrobial activity and mode of action, knowledge about the nisin modification process is still rather limited. The dehydratase NisB is believed to be the initial interaction partner in modification. NisB dehydrates specific serine and threonine residues in prenisin, whereas the cyclase NisC catalyzes the (methyl)lanthionine formation. The fully modified prenisin is exported and the leader peptide is cleaved off by the extracellular protease NisP. Light scattering analysis demonstrated that purified NisB is a dimer in solution. Using size exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance, the interaction of NisB and prenisin, including several of its modified derivatives, was studied. Unmodified prenisin binds to NisB with an affinity of 1.05 ± 0.25 μm, whereas the dehydrated and the fully modified derivatives bind with respective affinities of 0.31 ± 0.07 and 10.5 ± 1.7 μm. The much lower affinity for the fully modified prenisin was related to a >20-fold higher off-rate. For all three peptides the stoichiometry of binding was 1:1. Active nisin, which is the equivalent of fully modified prenisin lacking the leader peptide did not bind to NisB, nor did prenisin in which the highly conserved FNLD box within the leader peptide was mutated to AAAA.

The development of bacterial resistance against clinically relevant antibiotics is on the rise and represents a major scientific challenge (1Projan S.J. Bradford P.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2007; 10: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There is an ever growing demand for novel and improved antimicrobial agents. As potential antibiotics, bactericidal peptides that are secreted by many bacteria, mainly for self-defense purposes, have gained special interest (2Lubelski J. Rink R. Khusainov R. Moll G.N. Kuipers O.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 455-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Among these are the so-called lantibiotics, which are ribosomally synthesized peptides that are posttranslationally modified (3Hansen J.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 535-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and produced by a large number of Gram-positive bacteria. Nisin, probably the most well known lantibiotic, is produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis and its antimicrobial activity is directed against microorganisms of similar type. Nisin has been used for more than 40 years as a food preservative, but so far, no significant bacterial resistance has arisen. Recently, L. lactis subspecies have been identified that are capable to inactivate nisin via proteolytic cleavage (4Sun Z. Zhong J. Liang X. Liu J. Chen X. Huan L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 1964-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nisin exerts its bactericidal mode of action in a dual fashion. First, nisin inhibits bacterial cell-wall synthesis by binding to lipid II, an essential cell-wall precursor molecule (5Hasper H.E. Kramer N.E. Smith J.L. Hillman J.D. Zachariah C. Kuipers O.P. de Kruijff B. Breukink E. Science. 2006; 313: 1636-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Second, binding to lipid II leads to the formation of lipid II-nisin hybrid pores, which depolarizes and permeabilizes the cytoplasmic membrane of the target cell, leading to starvation and cell death (6Breukink E. van Heusden H.E.

The nisin biosynthesis operon comprises the nisin structural gene nisA and genes involved in modification (nisB and nisC), transport (nisT), and activation via processing (nisP) (9Siegers K. Heinzmann S. Entian K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12294-12301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).

For the maturation of nisin, the 57-amino acid prenisin peptide (NisA) requires modification by several enzymes. The dehydratase NisB catalyzes the dehydration of specific serine and threonine residues to didehydroalanine and didehydrobutyrine residues, respectively (13Kluskens L.D. Kuipers A.

The dehydratase NisB has a central role in nisin biosynthesis. An increase of NisB expression leads to an enhanced dehydration efficiency of prenisin (19Karakas Sen A. Narbad A. Horn N. Dodd H.M.

NisB can, however, function in the absence of the cyclase NisC, producing dehydrated prenisin devoid of thioether rings, whereas deletion of NisB results in a substantially reduced production of (unmodified) prenisin (17Kuipers A. de Boef E.

The introduction of thioether rings in therapeutic peptides, either via enzymatic activity (NisBC) or chemical synthesis, has been shown to increase the resistance to proteolytic degradation (26Rew Y.

Thus, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in nisin modification might be very important in the development of novel and improved peptide antibiotics as well as clinically relevant peptides that may be augmented by enzymatic posttranslational modification. However, whereas NisC cyclase activity has been successfully reconstituted in vitro and was shown to be independent of NisB and NisT (15Li B. Yu J.P. Brunzelle J.S. Moll G.N. van der Donk W.A.

Here we show a detailed biochemical and biophysical analysis of NisB and its interaction with prenisin and its modified derivatives, i.e. dehydrated and fully modified prenisin. Our results provide strong experimental evidence that the leader peptide and especially the FNLD box herein is a key determinant in substrate recognition and specificity of NisB. L. lactis NZ9000 containing the plasmid pNGnisBhis was grown overnight in 100 ml of M17 medium containing 0.5% (w/v) glucose (GM17) and 5 μg/ml of chloramphenicol at 30 °C. Cells were transferred to 2 liters of fresh GM17 medium and growth was continued to an A600 of 0.8, whereupon NisB expression was induced by the addition of nisin (Sigma) to a final concentration of 25 ng/ml. Three hours after induction cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was suspended in 14 ml of buffer composed of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl and stored at −20 °C until use. For purification, cells were thawed at 4 °C, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and DNase I (Sigma), and lysed with a cell disruptor (IUL Instruments), generally 4–5 cycles at a pressure of 2.5 kbar. The remaining cells were removed at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was cleared from membranes by centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing NisB was supplemented with imidazole, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 5 mm and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The solution was then loaded on a 5-ml HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) saturated with Ni2+ ions, using a flow rate of 2 ml/min at 4 °C. The column was washed with buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 10% (v/v) glycerol followed by a wash step in which the imidazole concentration was increased to 50 mm imidazole to remove unspecifically bound proteins. Finally, NisB was step-eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 250 mm using a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluted protein was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. NisB containing fractions were pooled and applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion column using 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol as elution buffer. NisB containing fractions were pooled and concentrated with an Amicon Ultracentrifugal filter Ultracel (100 kDa cut-off). Protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (peqlab) using the theoretical extinction coefficient of NisB of 128,400 liters mol−1 cm−1, as calculated for the His-tagged NisB using ProtParam webserver (EXPASY). Production of prenisin (NisA) and its derivatives was performed with L. lactis strain NZ9000 containing pNZnisA-E3 (17Kuipers A. de Boef E. Rink R. Fekken S. Kluskens L.D. Driessen A.J. Leenhouts K.

Cell-free medium containing the peptide was diluted 1:1 with 50 mm lactic acid, pH 3, and subjected to SP-Sepharose chromatography. After peptide binding, the lactic acid buffer, pH 3, was gradually changed to 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7, by applying a gradient (0–100% 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7) for 4 column volumes at a flow rate of 2 ml/min followed by a wash step for 8 column volumes with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7. At this stage, the eluent showed a pH of 7. Finally, bound prenisin was eluted with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7, 1 m NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Peptide elution was monitored at 215 nm and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Prenisin containing fractions were pooled and filtered through an Amicon Ultracentrifugal filter (30 kDa cut-off) to remove high molecular mass contaminants. The flow-through containing the prenisin was concentrated with an Amicon Ultracentrifugal filter (3 kDa cut-off). Peptide concentrations were determined with a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) at 584 nm. Nisin was obtained as a lyophilized powder from a commercial source (Sigma), which contains ∼2.5% (w/w) nisin. The active nisin was purified as described elsewhere (41Abts, A., Mavaro, A., Stindt, J., Bakkes, P. J., Metzger, S., Driessen, A. J. M., Smits, S. H., Schmitt, L. (2011) Int. J. Peptide, in press.Google Scholar). In brief, about 1.3 g of powder (corresponding to ∼32 mg of nisin) was diluted in 100 ml of 50 mm lactic acid, pH 3, and filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane filter (Pall Corporation). The nisin solution was then applied to a 5-ml HiTrap SP HP ion exchange column (GE Healthcare) using a flow of 2 ml/min. After binding, the column was washed with 50 mm lactic acid, pH 3, until a stable base line was reached. The elution was performed by block elution in which the NaCl concentration was increased from 0 to 1 m in 200 mm steps. Protein elution was monitored at 215 nm and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Active nisin eluted at 400 mm NaCl. Nisin containing fractions were pooled, and protein was precipitated with 25% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid overnight at 4 °C. Precipitated protein was washed two times with ice-cold acetone to remove residual NaCl and TCA and then suspended in 50 mm lactic acid, pH 3. Peptide concentrations were determined with a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) at 584 nm. Analytical RP-HPLC was performed with a LiChrospher WP 300 RP-18 end capped column (Merck) at room temperature. Purified prenisin or nisin were injected at a concentration of 50 μm and eluted by mixing the aqueous buffer A (10% acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) with the organic solvent buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). Elution was performed by applying a gradient of 0–100% of buffer B over the course of 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluent was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 220 nm.

SEC was performed using an analytical Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 250 mm NaCl. The protein concentration of the purified NisB in elution buffer was 2 mg/ml, whereas the sample volume was 100 μl. Data were analyzed with the ASTRA software package (Wyatt Technology). size exclusion chromatography surface plasmon resonance immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. For complex formation, 10 μl of a 300 μm solution of purified prenisin or nisin (in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7, 1 m NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) was mixed with 100 μl of 15 μm purified NisB (in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol), giving a molar ratio of 2:1. Complex formation was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the samples were applied to a Superdex 200 pc 3.2/30 size exclusion column on an ÄKTA micro (GE Healthcare) system at 4 °C using 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 500 mm NaCl as elution buffer. Protein elution was monitored at 215 and 280 nm and the co-elution of NisB and prenisin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein was visualized by silver staining. All measurements were performed with a Biacore X (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C and at a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min using a nitrilotriacetic acid sensor chip (GE Healthcare). The SPR buffer was composed of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, and 50 μm EDTA. Prior to immobilization of His-tagged NisB, both flow cells were saturated with Ni2+ by injecting 5 μl of a 10 mm Ni2+ solution at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. For immobilization, purified NisB was diluted in SPR buffer to a final concentration of 170 nm, whereupon 5 μl was injected on flow cell 2 with a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The first flow cell was left with just Ni2+ as reference. Prenisin and its derivatives (including active nisin and the FNLD/AAAA mutant) were diluted from stock solutions in SPR buffer to final concentrations ranging from 46 nm to 2.9 μm. Due to the low binding responses of the fully modified prenisin, higher concentrations were tested in addition, with no apparent effect on the kinetic constants and the affinity (data not shown). For each peptide concentration, 50 μl of the prenisin samples were injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Sensorgrams were recorded for 250 s. After every analyte injection, the chip surface was regenerated by injecting successively 10 μl of 350 mm EDTA, 10 μl of 100 mm NaOH, and 10 μl of 0.5% (w/v) SDS at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Subsequently NisB was immobilized again as described above. All sensorgrams presented are corrected for background and bulk flow effects. Each measurement was repeated at least three times. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 4.1 software (GE Healthcare) according to the Equation 1, which describes the association, Equation 2, which describes the dissociation, and Equation 3, which describes the dissociation constant, KD, as reported in Ref. 32Karlsson R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar. Where dR/dt is the binding rate, kon is the association rate, C is the concentration of injected analyte, Rmax is proportional to the ligand concentration, R is proportional to the formed ligand-analyte complex, and koff is the dissociation rate. As the binding responses from SPR measurements correlates to the mass of molecules bound to the surface, the stoichiometry of the interaction can be evaluated by Equation 4 (33Mistrík P. Moreau F. Allen J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 268-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Where the analyte binding capacity Rmax can be extrapolated from experimental data and the immobilized ligand response Rl is obtained directly from a sensorgram recorded during ligand immobilization. Nisin biosynthesis requires the dehydratase NisB to interact intimately with the nisin precursor peptide. To investigate the interaction of NisB and the nisin precursor peptide in vitro, NisB and unmodified prenisin and several modified derivatives thereof, were purified to homogeneity. NisB carrying a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag was expressed in L. lactis, and purified from the cytosol using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by SEC. After IMAC, NisB (∼120 kDa) and two contaminants (∼90 and ∼30 kDa) were present (Fig. 2, lane 4). These contaminants turned out to be degradation products of NisB, as determined by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry (data not shown), and could be removed by subsequent SEC (Fig. 2, lane 5). Thus, NisB could be purified to homogeneity from the cytosol with a typical yield of 1.5 mg of NisB/liter of cell culture. Notably, in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, NisB was stable for at least 1 week at 4 °C as demonstrated by SEC, where no change in the elution profile occurred, and SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). Next, the unmodified prenisin and several of its modified derivatives including the dehydrated and the fully modified prenisin and the FNLD/AAAA mutant (see also Fig. 1) were purified from the culture medium by ion exchange chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nisin on the other hand was purified from a commercial powder (Sigma). SDS-PAGE analysis of SP-Sepharose fractions and subsequent silver staining revealed that the various peptide preparations were pure (Fig. 3A). Subsequent mass spectrometry confirmed the expected masses for the purified peptides (data not shown). Mass spectrometry can, however, not directly distinguish between dehydrated prenisin and the fully modified prenisin as these peptides have identical masses: 5688 Da (peptide without initiating methionine, see also Ref. 30van den Berg van Saparoea H.B. Bakkes P.J. Moll G.N. Driessen A.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 5541-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore sought a simple and direct method to discriminate between these peptides. For this, the different prenisin peptides were analyzed by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3B). Nisin and the different prenisin peptides were injected separately at a concentration of 50 μm. Increasing the acetonitrile concentration eluted the peptides. Interestingly, the peptides showed markedly different elution profiles, which relates to significant differences in their hydrophobicity (Fig. 3B). The unmodified prenisin eluted between 19.0 and 20.5 min as a broad peak (Fig. 3B, black curve), whereas the dehydrated prenisin eluted in a similar broad peak but at a substantially later retention time of 19.5–22.5 min (Fig. 3B, red curve). Compared with the unmodified prenisin, the dehydrated prenisin showed reproducibly a higher absorbance at 220 nm likely due to the presence of an increased amount of double bonds as a result of the dehydration of the serine and threonine residues, which contribute to the absorbance at 220 nm (35Hesse M. Meier H. Zeeh B. Spektroskopische Methoden in der Organischen Chemie. 3rd Ed. Georg Thieme, Verlag Stuttgart1987Google Scholar). The fully modified prenisin eluted at 22.5 min and showed a characteristic double peak (Fig. 3B, blue curve). Nisin also showed a characteristic double peak but eluted much later from the column as compared with the fully modified prenisin, i.e. at 26.3 min (Fig. 3B, green curve). The double peak of nisin has been observed before and has been attributed to a small number of nisin molecules in which Ser-33 has escaped NisB-mediated dehydration (19Karakas Sen A. Narbad A.

https://openalex.org/W2150281429,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a central role in the regulation of a number of cellular processes including growth, metabolism, and ion transport. mTOR is found in two multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which phosphorylate distinct substrates and regulate distinct cellular processes. SGK1 is an mTORC2 substrate, which is a key regulator of epithelial Na(+) transport mediated by the epithelial sodium channel. Although it is known that SGK1 physically interacts with mTORC2, it is unknown which mTORC2 component mediates this interaction or whether this interaction plays a physiologically relevant role in specific activation of SGK1. Here we identify mSIN1 as the mTORC2 component that mediates interaction with SGK1 and demonstrate that this interaction is required for SGK1 phosphorylation and epithelial sodium channel activation. We used the yeast two-hybrid system coupled with random mutagenesis to identify a mutant mSIN1 (mSIN1/Q68H), which does not interact with SGK1. Expression of this mutant does not restore SGK1 phosphorylation to wild-type levels in mSIN1-deficient murine embryo fibroblasts. Furthermore, in kidney epithelial cells, mSIN1/Q68H has a dominant-negative effect on SGK1 phosphorylation and on SGK1-dependent Na(+) transport. Interestingly, this interaction appears to be specific in that another mTORC2 substrate, Akt, does not interact with mSIN1, and its phosphorylation and activity are unaffected by the Q68H mutation. These data support the conclusion that mTORC2 uses distinct strategies to phosphorylate different substrates and suggest a mechanism for mTORC2 specificity in the regulation of diverse cellular processes."

https://openalex.org/W1971946120,"Ionizing radiation (IR) induces proapoptotic gene expression programs that inhibit cell survival. These programs often involve RNA-binding proteins that associate with their mRNA targets to elicit changes in mRNA stability and/or translation. The RNA-binding protein IMP-3 is an oncofetal protein overexpressed in many human malignancies. IMP-3 abundance correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. As such, IMP-3 is proving to be a highly significant biomarker in surgical pathology. Among its many mRNA targets, IMP-3 binds to and promotes translation of insulin-like growth factor II (IGFII) mRNA. Our earlier studies showed that reducing IMP-3 abundance with siRNAs reduced proliferation of human K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells because of reduced IGF-II biosynthesis. However, the role of IMP-3 in apoptosis is unknown. Here, we have used IR-induced apoptosis of K562 cells as a model to explore a role for IMP-3 in cell survival. Knockdown of IMP-3 with siRNA increased susceptibility of cells to IR-induced apoptosis and led to reduced IGF-II production. Gene reporter assays revealed that IMP-3 acts through the 5′ UTR of IGFII mRNA during apoptosis to promote translation. Finally, culture of IR-treated cells with recombinant IGF-II partially reversed the effects of IMP-3 knockdown on IR-induced apoptosis. Together, these results indicate that IMP-3 acts in part through the IGF-II pathway to promote cell survival in response to IR. Thus, IMP-3 might serve as a new drug target to increase sensitivity of CML cells or other cancers to IR therapy.

Cell. 2005; 97: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). IMP-1 is identical to the MYC coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP). CRD-BP/IMP-1 stabilizes MYC mRNA by masking an endoribonucleolytic cleavage site in the coding region (3Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 4Prokipcak R.D. Herrick D.J. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9261-9269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also protects the coding region of βTrCP1 mRNA from miR-181-directed degradation (5Elcheva I. Goswami S. Noubissi F.K. Spiegelman V.S. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 240-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). IMP-1 is also identical to the zipcode-binding protein-1 (ZBP-1). This protein binds β-actin mRNA and localizes it to lamellipodia for translation during cell movement (6Ross A.F. Oleynikov Y. Kislauskis E.H. Taneja K.L. Singer R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hüttelmaier S. Zenklusen D. Lederer M. Dictenberg J. Lorenz M. Meng X. Bassell G.J. Condeelis J. Singer R.H. Nature. 2005; 438: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). IMP-2 is the most ubiquitously expressed IMP and is essential for cell motility; for example, muscle cells (8Boudoukha S. Cuvellier S. Polesskaya A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5710-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). IMP-3 is identical to both the human KH domain-containing protein overexpressed in cancer (KOC), first identified in pancreatic cancer, and to the Xenopus laevis Vg1 mRNA-binding protein (Vg1-RBP/Vera) (9Müeller-Pillasch F. Lacher U. Wallrapp C. Micha A. Zimmerhackl F. Hameister H. Varga G. Friess H. Büchler M. Beger H.G. Vila M.R. Adler G. Gress T.M.

These proteins have been collectively grouped into the VICKZ (Vg1 RBP/Vera, IMP, CRD-BP, KOC, and ZBP-1) family of RNA-binding proteins (2Yisraeli J.K. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As noted in the examples above, VICKZ proteins participate in the stability, localization, and translation of the mRNA subsets to which they bind. As such, VICKZ proteins are involved in cell polarity, migration, proliferation, and in cancer.

IMP-3 is largely expressed in fetal and neonatal mammals and in many cancers, suggesting that it is an oncofetal protein. IMP-3 appears early in mouse development, peaks at embryonic day 12.5, and then declines until birth (1Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Its level is very low or absent in tissues of adult mammals. It is also expressed in human embryonic stem cells and may be required to control the stem cell state (12Kim C.G. Lee J.J. Jung D.Y. Jeon J. Heo H.S. Kang H.C. Shin J.H. Cho Y.S. Cha K.J. Do B.R. Kim K.S. Kim H.S. Mol. Cells. 2006; 21: 343-355PubMed Google Scholar). IMP-3 protein and mRNA are elevated in many tumors with variable positivity, including pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary, gynecologic, lung, lymphoid, thyroid, central nervous system, breast, bone, soft tissue, and many other tumors (13Findeis-Hosey J.J. Xu H. Hum. Pathol. 2011; 42: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These and other observations suggest that IMP-3 can serve as a biomarker for tumor aggressiveness and metastasis and that its expression correlates with a poorer prognosis in many cancers. Often, the distinction between low-grade and high-grade tumors and between reactive processes and malignant neoplasms can be quite challenging. From a practical point of view, the ability to measure IMP3 gene expression by RT-PCR has thus been proven to be invaluable in pathology practice. For example, detection of IMP3 mRNA in lesions initially diagnosed as indeterminate by cytology has permitted subsequent malignant diagnoses (13Findeis-Hosey J.J. Xu H. Hum. Pathol. 2011; 42: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Mueller F. Bommer M. Lacher U. Ruhland C. Stagge V. Adler G. Gress T.M. Seufferlein T. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 88: 699-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As noted above, IMP-3 exerts its effects on gene expression and biological processes via the mRNAs to which it binds. Although to our knowledge most of its mRNA-binding targets remain uncharacterized, it was identified by its binding to insulin-like growth factor II (IGFII) mRNA. There are four IGFII mRNA isoforms, all with the same coding region and 3′ UTRs but four distinct 5′ UTRs designated leader-1 to leader-4, respectively (L1-L4) (15van Dijk E.L. Sussenbach J.S. Holthuizen P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3477-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). L4 is 100 nt in length and promotes constitutive translation of IGFII mRNA. L3, a major isoform in mammalian cells, is 1170 nt long and highly (48%) cytidine-rich. L3 permits proliferation-dependent translation. In response to activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, L3 permits cap-independent translation of IGFII mRNA, and this requires IMP-2 (16Dai N. Rapley J. Angel M. Yanik M.F. Blower M.D. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1159-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Messenger ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that IMP-3 binds the L3 5′ UTR, and this promotes translation of the mRNA in proliferating cells (17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18517-18524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). IMP-3 also binds the 3′ UTRs of all the IGFII mRNA isoforms, although the significance is not clear (18Nielsen J. Kristensen M.A. Willemoës M. Nielsen F.C. Christiansen J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4368-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The fetal growth factor IGF-II plays a pivotal role in embryonic development. Its expression is very high in the fetus and some tumors, whereas its abundance is greatly reduced or absent in adult tissues (19Zhang Q. Berggren P.O. Tally M. J. Biol.

Cell Physiol. 1987; 133: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Its oncofetal expression pattern is similar to that of IMP-3 (1Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). IGF-II also promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis (28Zapf J. Froesch E.R. Horm. Res. 1986; 24: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 29Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sun F.L. Dean W.L. Kelsey G. Allen N.D.

Genet. 1993; 5: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, as an RNA-binding protein and translational regulator of IGFII mRNA (17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18517-18524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), IMP-3 may also impact apoptosis. Human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disease presenting unregulated tyrosine kinase activity by the breakpoint cluster region and c-Abl oncoprotein (BCR-ABL) (32Quintás-Cardama A. Cortes J. Blood. 2009; 113: 1619-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Most CML patients possess the characteristic Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, which is a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that yields a fusion protein, BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL is a constitutively active, non-receptor tyrosine kinase in Ph+ CML cells. BCR-ABL activates numerous downstream signal transduction pathways, stimulating myeloid proliferation and causing resistance of CML cells to various chemo- and ionizing radiation (IR)-based therapies. Resistance to apoptosis can be reversed by specific inhibitors of BCR-ABL kinase activity, such as imatinib mesylate. However, CML cells have emerged with resistance to numerous kinase inhibitors (33Diamond J.M. Melo J.V. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2011; 52: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, finding additional means to increase the susceptibility of CML cells to apoptosis could provide efficacy for combination therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia. BCR-ABL also alters gene expression in a way that favors increased translation of mRNAs encoding antiapoptotic proteins (34Perrotti D. Harb J.G. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2011; 52: 30-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Given the aforementioned links between IMP-3 and IGFII gene expression, we examined the effects of IMP-3 on IR-induced apoptosis in the K562 CML cell model in this study. To this end, we reduced IMP-3 abundance by RNA interference in K562 cells undergoing IR-induced apoptosis and found that IMP-3 controls translation of IGFII mRNA during apoptosis. Moreover, IMP-3 knockdown significantly increased the susceptibility of cells to IR-induced apoptosis, at least in part through reduced IGF-II production. Thus, IMP-3 acts to promote cell survival after IR exposure. Human IMP-3 SMARTpool siRNA and control siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon) were the same as those used previously (17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18517-18524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Liao B. Patel M. Hu Y. Charles S. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48716-48724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). K562 cells (human, chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis, ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with siRNAs or buffer (mock control) by electroporation exactly as described (35Liao B. Patel M. Hu Y. Charles S. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48716-48724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained for the times indicated in the figure legends. Knockdown efficiency was assessed by Western blot analysis of IMP-3. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from K562 cells using the CellLytic NuCLEARTM extraction kit (Sigma). Total protein concentration in extracts was examined by Bradford assay using the protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Western blot analysis, cytoplasmic (40 μg) and nuclear (20 μg) lysates were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Fisher). Antibodies used and their dilutions were as follows: α-tubulin (Sigma) 1:8000, IMP-1 and IMP-3 1:5000 (17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol.

Detection and analyses were performed as described (17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18517-18524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Liao B. Patel M. Hu Y. Charles S. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48716-48724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). IGF-II concentrations in cytoplasmic lysates and culture media were examined by ELISA with the non-extraction IGF-II ELISA kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc.) exactly as described previously (35Liao B. Patel M. Hu Y. Charles S. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48716-48724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A standard curve was prepared, and sample IGF-II concentrations were calculated using Prism software (version 2.0, GraphPad software). The dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) was employed to assess luciferase activity following transfection of reporter plasmids and siRNAs exactly as described (17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18517-18524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Liao B. Patel M. Hu Y. Charles S. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48716-48724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The plasmids utilized were pcDNA-IGF-II leader-3/luciferase (pcDNA-IGF-II-L3-Luc) and pcDNA-IGF-II leader-4/luciferase (pcDNA-IGF-II-L4-Luc, both provided by Dr. Jan Christiansen). These contain the firefly luciferase coding region and the complete IGF-II L3 or L4 exon, respectively, in plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega) encoding Renilla luciferase served as an internal control. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity in the same cell extract and plotted as a ratio of firefly/Renilla luciferase activity. Total RNA samples were prepared with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and digested with RNase-free DNase (Promega). IGF-II, IGF-II L3, IGF-II L4, luciferase, IMP-3, IMP-1, and GAPDH mRNA levels were determined by one-step, real-time, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) with the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and the same dual-fluorescence labeled probes as described previously (17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18517-18524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Liao B. Patel M. Hu Y. Charles S. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48716-48724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells in culture medium were kept in the sample container and subjected to irradiation under a cesium-137 source with a Gammacell® 40 Exactor (Nordion International, Inc., Canada) at a dose rate of 0.92 Gy/min. The γ-irradiated cells were subsequently cultured for the indicated times. Untreated control cells were kept at room temperature for the same time as the irradiation time. Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry with the VybrantTM apoptosis assay kit #3 (annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide double staining kit, Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were harvested and washed in cold PBS. Five hundred thousand cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 1× annexin-binding buffer and incubated with 5 μl of FITC-labeled annexin V and 1 μl of 100 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) working solution at room temperature for 20 min, followed by addition of 400 μl of 1× annexin-binding buffer, mixed gently, and kept on ice. After staining, apoptotic cells showed green fluorescence (annexin V-FITC-positive), dead cells showed red and green fluorescence, and live cells showed little or no fluorescence signal. Ten thousand events were analyzed with a FC-500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter), and percent apoptosis was determined with the included software. Cell survival was assessed by MTS assay using the CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kit (Promega). Briefly, 20 μl of CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution reagent, MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium), was added to each well of a 96-well culture plate containing K562 cells in 100 μl of culture medium. The plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm and a reference of 660 nm with an SLT Rainbow 96-well plate reader (Tecan). The 490-nm absorbance is directly proportional to the number of viable cells in culture. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates for cell proliferation assays or 100-mm dishes for apoptosis analyses. Recombinant human IGF-II (Sigma), prepared in PBS following the manufacturer's instructions, was added to cell cultures at concentrations of 10, 100, 500 and 800 ng/ml, respectively. 20 μl/ml PBS alone and 500 ng/ml BSA (Sigma) dissolved in PBS were used as mock control and negative control, respectively. Cells were maintained for 48 h and used for analyses of apoptosis and proliferation as described above. Experimental results were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Scheffé test or two-tailed Student's t test. The data were expressed as mean ± S.E. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. To explore roles for IMP-3 during apoptosis, we generated an apoptotic cell model by exposing K562 cells, a human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (36Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to IR. Cells were harvested 24 h after irradiation for examination of apoptosis by flow cytometric analyses with FITC annexin V/PI double staining and examination of cell survival by MTS assay. Phosphatidylserine is normally located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane, but it translocates from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during apoptosis but not during necrosis (37Coxon K.M. Duggan J. Cordeiro M.F. Moss S.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 731: 293-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Annexin V, the human anticoagulant, can bind phosphatidylserine with high affinity. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V (FITC annexin V) was used for identification of apoptotic cells. The red-fluorescent, nucleic acid-binding dye PI stains necrotic cells. However, it is impermeable to live cells and apoptotic cells. PI staining was used to exclude dead cells in the analysis. After immunostaining, these populations among 10,000 cells were identified by flow cytometry. IR induced apoptosis in K562 cells (Fig. 1A) and was confirmed by reduced cell survival (B). IR doses ranging from 2–15 Gy led to 3–21% apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Increasing the dose to 30 Gy increased the percentage of necrotic cells (not shown) but not the percentage of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1). This suggests that K562 cells are somewhat resistant to IR. Clinically relevant doses are typically 2 Gy (38Niemoeller O.M. Niyazi M. Corradini S. Zehentmayr F. Li M. Lauber K. Belka C. Radiat. Oncol. 2011; 6: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of IR to induce apoptosis was dose-dependent from 2–15 Gy. For this reason, 15 Gy IR was chosen for subsequent experiments because approximately 70% of cells still survived at this dose of irradiation (Fig. 1B). IMP-3 is an RNA-binding protein and translational activator of IGFII mRNA with the L3 5′ UTR (1Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18517-18524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). IGF-II is a growth factor that promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. However, a relationship between IMP-3 and apoptosis is unknown. To address this issue, we first examined IMP3 gene expression during IR-induced apoptosis. Both IMP-3 protein and mRNA levels were reduced by 50–60% 1–3 days after IR exposure compared with unexposed cells (Fig. 2, p < 0.01). These results suggest that the remaining IMP-3 might contribute to the resistance of K562 cells to IR-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, the abundance of IMP-3 was reduced by RNA interference in K562 cells. Equal amounts of IMP-3 siRNA or negative control siRNA were transfected into K562 cells. An equal volume of oligonucleotide buffer without siRNAs (i.e. buffer only) served as a mock control. IMP-3 protein and mRNA levels were examined by Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR, respectively. Transfection of IMP-3 siRNA reduced cytoplasmic protein (Fig. 3, A and B) and mRNA levels (C) by 70–85% during the 4-day time course compared with the control siRNA transfection. The buffer-only (not shown) and control siRNA transfections had no effect on IMP-3 protein and mRNA abundance (Fig. 3). IMP-3 knockdown did not alter either α-tubulin (Fig. 3A) or IMP-1 (A and B) protein levels compared with the control siRNA transfection, indicating knockdown specificity.FIGURE 3Selective knockdown of IMP-3 in K562 cells. A, representative Western blot analyses for IMP-3, IMP-1, and α-tubulin cytoplasmic protein abundance 1–4 days after transfection of control and IMP-3 siRNAs. B, quantitative analyses of the indicated Western blot analyses (n = 6). α-Tubulin served as a loading control. C, quantitative analyses of qRT-PCRs for the indicated mRNAs following transfection of control and IMP-3 siRNAs (n = 6). For B and C, results are plotted as a percentage of levels compared with control siRNA-transfected cells. The experiment was performed three times independently. **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) K562 cells transfected with IMP-3 siRNA, control siRNA, or buffer only were cultured 24 h, exposed to 15 Gy γ-irradiation, and maintained 1–3 days in culture. Cells were examined for apoptosis by annexin V/PI double staining and flow cytometry. Non-transfected cells that were not exposed to IR served as a basal apoptosis control. The percentage of apoptotic cells under these basal conditions was typically 2–5%. Cells transfected by electroporation with buffer only, control siRNA, or IMP-3 siRNA showed about 10–13% apoptosis after 2 days (data not shown). This suggests that although electroporation may induce apoptosis in a small percentage of cells, knockdown of IMP-3 does not in itself promote apoptosis. However, IR exposure of cells transfected with buffer only or control siRNA increased the percentage of apoptotic cells to 20–28% during the 3-day time course, with a peak 2 days after irradiation (Fig. 4). By contrast, IMP-3 knockdown increased the percentage of apoptotic cells to 40–50% between 1–3 days (Fig. 4, p < 0.01). These results were confirmed by cell survival assays (data not shown). These findings suggest that IMP-3 knockdown significantly increases the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis induced by IR. Thus, we next investigated a possible mechanism by which IMP-3 regulates apoptosis. IMP-3 binds to and promotes translation of IGFII mRNA with the L3 5′ UTR during cell proliferation (17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18517-18524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To determine whether IMP-3 has similar effects on IGFII gene expression in cells exposed to IR, IMP-3 abundance was reduced by siRNA transfection immediately after induction of apoptosis by IR. IGF-II protein and mRNA levels were examined thereafter. IMP-3 knockdown had no obvious effect on IGFII mRNA levels (Fig. 5A, Basal), consistent with previous studies (17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18517-18524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, IR significantly decreased IGFII mRNA levels 1–3 days after IR (Fig. 5A). Concomitant IMP-3 knockdown did not further reduce IGFII mRNA levels compared with control siRNA transfections (Fig. 5A). Accordingly, we examined IGF-II protein levels after combined IR exposure and IMP-3 knockdown. As expected, IR decreased both cellular and secreted IGF-II protein levels compared with basal conditions (i.e. no transfection and no IR exposure, Fig. 5, B and C). However, concomitant IMP-3 knockdown further decreased IGF-II protein levels by 48–62% compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5, B and C, p < 0.01). These results suggest that IMP-3 can promote translation of IGFII mRNA during apoptosis. Consequently, we examined the effects of IR and IMP-3 knockdown on translation of reporter mRNAs. Cells were exposed to IR. Twenty-four hours later, cells were cotransfected with IMP-3 siRNA or control siRNA together with the pcDNA-IGF-II-L3/luciferase or pcDNA-IGF-II-L4/luciferase reporter plasmids and the pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase plasmid (as an internal control). IMP-3 knockdown had no effects on mRNA levels, as expected (Fig. 6A). However, IMP-3 knockdown significantly reduced IGFII L3-mediated luciferase activity by approximately 60% (Fig. 6B, p < 0.01). There was little effect on L4-mediated luciferase activity or control firefly luciferase activity (i.e. pGL) 48 h after transfection compared with control siRNA transfection (Fig. 6B, p > 0.05), even though L4 IGFII mRNA is also a binding target of IMP-3 (17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18517-18524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained at 24 and 72 h after transfection (data not shown). These results indicate that IMP-3 knockdown reduces IGFII gene expression by reducing translation of the L3 mRNA isoform during apoptosis. The above results indicate that IR and IMP-3 knockdown may exert their effects on apoptosis through IGFII gene expression. To address this, recombinant human IGF-II was applied to cell cultures. Cells were transfected with IMP-3 siRNA or control siRNA and 24 h later, cells were exposed to 15 Gy γ-irradiation and maintained in culture medium supplemented with either 500 ng/ml BSA; PBS alone (i.e. 0 ng/ml); or 10, 100, 500, or 800 ng/ml human IGF-II, respectively, for 48 h. IMP-3 knockdown markedly enhanced IR-induced apoptosis, as expected (Fig. 7, p < 0.01). BSA or PBS alone (0 ng/ml IGF-II) did not reduce the percentage of apoptotic cells, also as expected (Fig. 7, p > 0.05). By contrast, addition of recombinant IGF-II at concentrations of 10, 100, 500 and 800 ng/ml to irradiated cells transfected with control siRNA decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells by 20%, 35% (p < 0.05), 55% (p < 0.01), and 53% (gray bars in Fig. 7, p < 0.01), respectively, compared with the BSA control. These results are consistent with the antiapoptotic property of IGF-II. Moreover, recombinant IGF-II significantly reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner from 10 to 500 ng/ml in irradiated cells transfected with IMP-3 siRNA (Fig. 7, shaded bars) compared with BSA-treated cells transfected with IMP-3 siRNA (Fig. 7, shaded bars, p < 0.01). Additionally, 800 ng/ml recombinant IGF-II decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells with IMP-3 knockdown to that of cells transfected with control siRNA (i.e. the difference is not statistically significant, p > 0.05, Fig. 7). As we noted earlier, transfection by electroporation induces apoptosis in 10–12% of cells. Thus, IGF-II does not reduce the percentage of apoptotic cells to that of cells under basal conditions (no transfection, no IR) in which 2–3% of cells undergo apoptosis (Fig. 7, black bars). Taken together, these results indicate that IMP-3-IGF-II represents an important axis promoting cell survival in response to IR exposure. γ-irradiation induces DNA damage and subsequent apoptosis. Several known pathways controlling apoptosis involve proteins such as BRCA1, E2F-1, and p53 (39Ahn J. Urist M. Prives C. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 40Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). The fetal growth factor IGF-II inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation. Our earlier work identified the RNA-binding protein IMP-3 as a translational activator of IGFII mRNA and a protein abundantly expressed in K562 CML cells (17Liao B. Hu Y. Herrick D.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18517-18524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As K562 cells appear relatively resistant to IR-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1), we speculated that resistance may be due in part to IMP-3-dependent synthesis of IGF-II. Indeed, although IR exposure led to reduced IMP-3 protein and mRNA, it remained relatively abundant. However, >90% knockdown of IMP-3 by siRNA transfection led to a substantial increase in apoptosis (Fig. 4). The effect of IMP-3 knockdown was due in part to reduced IGF-II secretion because application of recombinant IGF-II to cultures restored resistance to IR-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7), i.e. exogenous IGF-II reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells in response to IR. Thus, the ability of IMP-3 to maintain IGF-II secretion after IR exposure promotes maintenance of cell survival. RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs continue to emerge as essential regulators of gene expression, especially in the processes of apoptosis and cell survival during stresses. For example, UVC irradiation induces AUF1 binding to bcl2 mRNA, which promotes degradation of bcl2 mRNA, permitting apoptosis (41Lapucci A. Donnini M. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Brewer G. Schiavone N. Capaccioli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16139-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). IR leads to global dissociation of HuR from its mRNA-binding targets, which promotes cell survival (42Masuda K. Abdelmohsen K. Kim M.M. Srikantan S. Lee E.K. Tominaga K. Selimyan R. Martindale J.L. Yang X. Lehrmann E. Zhang Y. Becker K.G. Wang J.Y. Kim H.H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2011; 30: 1040-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By contrast, the apoptosis-inducing agent etoposide induces HuR expression and its binding to XIAP (X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) mRNA. This promotes translation of XIAP mRNA and confers cytoprotection from etoposide (43Durie D. Lewis S.M. Liwak U. Kisilewicz M. Gorospe M. Holcik M. Oncogene. 2011; 30: 1460-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Likewise, a number of microRNAs control apoptosis, and their expression patterns are predictive of the outcomes of chemo- and radiotherapy (44Hummel R. Hussey D.J. Haier J. Eur. J. Cancer. 2010; 46: 298-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 45Wang Y. Lee C.G. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2009; 13: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For example, miR-21 modulates sensitivity to doxorubicin (46Tao J. Lu Q. Wu D. Li P. Xu B. Qing W. Wang M. Zhang Z. Zhang W. Oncol. Rep. 2011; 25: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar), miR-148a promotes apoptosis by targeting bcl2 (47Zhang, H., Li, Y., Huang, Q., Ren, X., Hu, H., Sheng, H., Lai, M. (2011) Cell Death Differ., in press.Google Scholar), and microRNA expression profiles even change in response to exposure of cells to IR (38Niemoeller O.M. Niyazi M. Corradini S. Zehentmayr F. Li M. Lauber K. Belka C. Radiat. Oncol. 2011; 6: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Another emerging theme is that the actions of RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs are not always mutually exclusive (48George A.D. Tenenbaum S.A. RNA Biol. 2006; 3: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation of RNA-binding protein Pumilio in response to EGF alters local RNA structure in the p27Kip 3′ UTR to unmask a binding site for miR-221/222. This represses p27 synthesis, permitting cell cycle entry (49Kedde M. van Kouwenhove M. Zwart W. Oude Vrielink J.A. Elkon R. Agami R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). How might IMP-3 control translation of IGFII mRNA? Perhaps IMP-3 controls microRNA access like IMP-1 does for βTrCP mRNA (50Noubissi F.K. Elcheva I. Bhatia N. Shakoori A. Ougolkov A. Liu J. Minamoto T. Ross J. Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Nature. 2006; 441: 898-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This might also explain the significance of IMP-3 binding to both the 5′ and 3′ UTRs of selected IGFII mRNA isoforms. There may be microRNAs that span both untranslated regions. There is precedence for microRNA bridging (51Lee I. Ajay S.S. Yook J.I. Kim H.S. Hong S.H. Kim N.H. Dhanasekaran S.M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Athey B.D. Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Indeed, a search of the miR-Bridge database suggests that IGFII 5′ and 3′ UTRs could potentially be bridged by several microRNAs, including miR-10a/b, miR-15b, and miR-152, among others (51Lee I. Ajay S.S. Yook J.I. Kim H.S. Hong S.H. Kim N.H. Dhanasekaran S.M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Athey B.D. Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Future work will be required to address possible roles for IMP-3 in microRNA-mediated translational control of IGFII mRNA. In any event, it is no wonder that IMP-3 can serve as a biomarker for tumor aggressiveness and that its expression levels correlate with metastasis and poor prognosis (13Findeis-Hosey J.J. Xu H. Hum. Pathol. 2011; 42: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This is likely due to additional mRNA targets beside IGFII mRNA. For example, IMP-3 plays important roles controlling genes required for cell adhesion and motility (52Vikesaa J. Hansen T.V. J⊘nson L. Borup R. Wewer U.M. Christiansen J. Nielsen F.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1456-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Clearly, it is important that future work characterize the regulation of its likely myriad mRNA targets to identify new pathways through which IMP-3 acts to control tumor aggressiveness and resistance to IR. Nonetheless, our work suggests that IMP-3 may be a novel target for drugs that affect its ability to bind its mRNA targets. In the case of IGFII mRNA, this could conceivably confer increased sensitivity of tumors to IR to increase efficacy of chemo-and-IR combination therapies. We thank Dr. Jan Christiansen for providing the pcDNA-IGF-II leader-3 and leader-4 luciferase reporter plasmids and Dr. David Herrick for providing IMP antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2107897349,"Fruiting body lectins have been proposed to act as effector proteins in the defense of fungi against parasites and predators. The Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA) is a Galα1,3Gal/GalNAc-specific lectin from the fairy ring mushroom that consists of an N-terminal ricin B-type lectin domain and a C-terminal dimerization domain. The latter domain shows structural similarity to catalytically active proteins, suggesting that, in addition to its carbohydrate-binding activity, MOA has an enzymatic function. Here, we demonstrate toxicity of MOA toward the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This toxicity depends on binding of MOA to glycosphingolipids of the worm via its lectin domain. We show further that MOA has cysteine protease activity and demonstrate a critical role of this catalytic function in MOA-mediated nematotoxicity. The proteolytic activity of MOA was dependent on high Ca(2+) concentrations and favored by slightly alkaline pH, suggesting that these conditions trigger activation of the toxin at the target location. Our results suggest that MOA is a fungal toxin with intriguing similarities to bacterial binary toxins and has a protective function against fungivorous soil nematodes."

Amerindian CagA proteins induced less production of IL-8 and cancer-associated Mucin 2 than did those of prototype Western or East Asian strains and behaved as dominant negative inhibitors of action of prototype CagA during mixed infection of Mongolian gerbils. We suggest that Amerindian cagA is of relatively low virulence, that this may have been selected in ancestral strains during infection of the people who migrated from Asia into the Americas many thousands of years ago, and that such attenuated CagA proteins could be useful therapeutically.

Infectious diarrheal disease caused by the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) 2The abbreviations used are: ETECenterotoxigenic E. coliLTlabile toxinKmkanamycinCmchloramphenicol. accounts for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year in areas where sanitation and clean water remain scarce (1Qadri F. Svennerholm A.M. Faruque A.S. Sack R.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 465-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). ETEC are a diverse group of pathogens that have in common the ability to colonize the small intestine where they deliver heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-stable toxins. These enterotoxins activate production of host cell cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP, respectively) in turn stimulating cellular kinases that phosphorylate and activate the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator chloride channel (2Fleckenstein J.M. Hardwidge P.R. Munson G.P. Rasko D.A. Sommerfelt H. Steinsland H. Microbes Infect. 2010; 12: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The ensuing salt and water losses in the intestinal lumen are ultimately responsible for the diarrheal illness. enterotoxigenic E. coli labile toxin kanamycin chloramphenicol. ETEC have recently been shown to produce a number of secreted proteins in addition to the established enterotoxins (3Patel S.K. Dotson J. Allen K.P. Fleckenstein J.M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1786-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Pilonieta M.C. Bodero M.D. Munson G.P. J.

Immun. 2006; 74: 2245-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of these exoproteins in pathogenesis is still being established. Like many pathogenic bacteria, ETEC produce putative virulence proteins that are secreted via the autotransporter mechanism. Autotransporters are contained in a single protein composed of three essential domains as follows: a signal peptide, amino-terminal passenger region, and a carboxyl-terminal β-barrel domain. Although the term autotransporter was devised to convey the notion that these proteins possessed all of the elements required for secretion of the passenger, it appears increasingly likely that additional conserved periplasmic chaperones or outer membrane proteins may be required for autotransporter biogenesis (6Ruiz-Perez F.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19120-19125Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The passenger region typically serves as the functional region of the molecule in autotransporters described to date. In a variety of Gram-negative pathogens, many passenger domains contain serine protease motifs (8Maroncle N.M. Sivick K.E. Brady R. Stokes F.E. Mobley H.L. Infect.

Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The pathogenic role played by the majority of SPATE proteins remains uncertain (9Dutta P.R. Cappello R. Navarro-García F. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 7105-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that EatA, a SPATE protein previously described in ETEC (Fig. 1a) (3Patel S.K. Dotson J. Allen K.P. Fleckenstein J.M. Infect.

Fleckenstein J.M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1786-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the precise functions of EatA as well as SepA remain unknown. To date, the majority of ETEC virulence studies have focused specifically on the role of plasmid-encoded fimbrial colonization factors, or the established enterotoxins. However, more recent data suggest that many elements of ETEC virulence, specifically processes pertaining to bacterial adhesion and intestinal colonization, are actually quite complex (2Fleckenstein J.M.

The remaining 7064-bp fragment was then religated on itself and re-introduced into E. coli Top10 to select white (lac−) colonies on Luria agar plates containing ampicillin, arabinose (0.02%), and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside (X-gal). The resulting plasmid pSB001 was then isolated and used to transform the eatA mutant jf904 to ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance. Adherence assays for these studies were performed as described previously (21Roy K. Hilliard G.M. Hamilton D.J. Luo J. Ostmann M.M. Fleckenstein J.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were grown overnight from frozen glycerol stocks in 2 ml of Luria broth containing antibiotics where appropriate at 37 °C, 225 rpm. The following morning strains were diluted 1:100 in fresh media and grown to mid-logarithmic growth phase (∼90 min of incubation at 37 °C). For strains complemented with arabinose-inducible plasmids, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.02% for the last 30 min of incubation. Bacteria were then added (at an multiplicity of infection (bacteria/target epithelial cell) of ∼100:1) to CaCo-2 cell monolayers seeded the previous evening in 96-well tissue culture plates. After 1 h, at 37 °C, 5% CO2, monolayers were washed with RPMI 1640 medium and lysed in 0.01% Triton X-100 to release both adherent and intracellular bacteria. Dilutions were then plated onto Luria agar plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. To identify intracellular bacteria, monolayers were washed at 3 h following infection and the media replaced with fresh pre-warmed media containing gentamicin (100 μg/ml) and incubated for 1 additional hour. After washing to remove remaining antibiotics, monolayers were lysed with Triton X-100 to release intracellular organisms and plated as above. To examine the pattern of bacterial attachment to the cell surface, organisms were added to Caco-2 epithelial cells grown on sterile glass coverslips pretreated with poly-l-lysine and incubated in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 1–2 h. After washing three times with tissue culture media, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA. Anti-O78 rabbit polyclonal antibody followed by AlexaFluor-488-labeled anti-rabbit antibody were used to identify the attached organisms, and cells were stained with both diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and membrane stain (CellMask, Red, Invitrogen). After acquisition of images on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope, the number of individual bacteria adherent to cells was examined by importing TIFF image files into ImageJ (version 1.44) and tracking the number of adherent bacteria/cell using the cell counter plugin module (ImageJ > plugins > analyze > cell counter). jf946, a derivative of ETEC H10407 containing a kanamycin resistance marker in the lacZYA locus (24Dorsey F.C. Fischer J.F. Fleckenstein J.M. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1516-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the jf904 eatA mutant (3Patel S.K. Dotson J. Allen K.P. Fleckenstein J.M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1786-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) were tested in the streptomycin-treated murine colonization model as described previously (25Allen K.P. Randolph M.M. Fleckenstein J.M. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice (CD-1, Charles River) were treated with streptomycin in drinking water (5 g/liter) for 48 h prior to inoculation, which was changed to antibiotic-free sterile water the evening before challenge. Cimetidine (50 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 1.5 h prior to gavage challenge with bacteria in a final volume of 400 μl. Mice were euthanized 24 h later, and bacterial colonization was assessed by plating saponin (5% solution in PBS) lysates of small intestinal segments onto Luria agar plates containing kanamycin (Km, 25 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (Cm, 25 μg/ml). To assess the number of ETEC organisms shed in stool, fecal pellets were collected from individual mice, resuspended in PBS, and dilutions plated onto replicate Luria agar plates. Competition studies were carried out as described previously (21Roy K. Hilliard G.M. Hamilton D.J. Luo J. Ostmann M.M. Fleckenstein J.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), with co-administration of ≈1 × 104 of both the jf946 and jf904 stains in a final volume of 400 μl. Intestinal lysates were used to separately inoculate both Cm- and Km-containing agar plates. The competitive index for each colonized mouse was then calculated as follows: competitive index = ((mutant (CmR)/wild type (KmR))output cfu/(mutant/wild type) input CFU), where the input fraction was determined directly by colony counting (cfu) prior to preparation of the inoculum. All experimental procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the University of Tennessee Health Science Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were housed, cared for, and used in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in an AAALAC International-accredited program. Production and purification of recombinant Myc-polyhistidine-tagged EtpA glycoprotein (rEtpA-myc-His) was carried out as described previously in detail (26Fleckenstein J.M. Roy K. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli Top10 carrying both pJL017 and pJL030 was induced with arabinose and the secreted rEtpA-myc-His protein recovered from concentrated supernatants by batch metal affinity chromatography (Talon, Clontech). To produce recombinant EatA passenger protein (rEatAp), the arabinose-inducible EatA expression plasmid pSP014 (3Patel S.K. Dotson J. Allen K.P. Fleckenstein J.M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1786-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was first introduced into LMG194ΔfliC, selecting for ampicillin- and kanamycin-resistant transformants. LMG194ΔfliC(pSP014) was then grown in 250 ml of Luria broth containing kanamycin (25 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to an A600 of ∼0.5 then induced for 2 h with arabinose at a final concentration 0.02%. Culture supernatants containing rEatAp were then concentrated ∼50-fold by ultrafiltration using a 100-kDa MWCO filter. After buffer exchange using column loading buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) and further concentration to a final volume of 0.5 ml, rEatAp was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 high resolution column (26Fleckenstein J.M. Roy K. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mutant rEatp(H134R) was prepared in the same fashion after introduction of pSP019 into LMG194ΔfliC. After growth of bacteria in Luria broth for the indicated time, cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to pellet bacteria, and supernatants of either H10407 or the jf904 eatA mutant were recovered, sterile-filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore), and concentrated by ultrafiltration as above. Equal amounts of protein were then loaded onto adjacent wells, separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), the gel stained with Sypro Ruby (Invitrogen) and imaged on a Typhoon variable-mode imager (GE Healthcare). To detect EtpA in culture supernatants, proteins were first concentrated by TCA precipitation as described previously (5Fleckenstein J.M. Roy K. Fischer J.F. Burkitt M. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 2245-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using pre-absorbed anti-EtpA polyclonal rabbit sera (1:2000) and goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Fc) horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:60,000, Pierce). All blocking and incubation steps were carried out at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and milk (5% w/v). Luminal-based chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal, Pierce) was used for detection. Antibody against the passenger domain of EatA was affinity-purified as described previously (27Harlow E. Lane D. Harlow E. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 77-80Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼100 μg of purified mutant EatA passenger domain was transferred onto nitrocellulose, and the membrane was blocked with 1% BSA in TBS-T for 30 min at room temperature. Next, the membrane was incubated with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against rEatA passenger domain (r6H-EatA(88–581)) (3Patel S.K. Dotson J. Allen K.P. Fleckenstein J.M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1786-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) diluted 1:10 in TBS-T for 2 h. Antibodies were then eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0, neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, dialyzed against PBS, concentrated, and then sterile-filtered. To detect interaction of EatA with EtpA, 5 μg of recombinant EtpA.myc.His was electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose and incubated with an equimolar amount of mutant protease activity-deficient EatA (H134R) for 2 h at room temperature. Membrane was washed and blocked in TBS, 3% milk for 30 min and probed with polyclonal affinity-purified primary antibody raised against r6H-EatA(88–581) (3Patel S.K. Dotson J. Allen K.P. Fleckenstein J.M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1786-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) followed by detection with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000) and chemiluminescent substrate. Varying amounts of rEatAp or rEatAp(H134R) were mixed with 1 μg of rEatA-myc-His and incubated at 37 °C. To inhibit protease activity, 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride was added at a final concentration of 25 μm. The contents of the reaction was mixed with loading dye (six times) and separated by SDS-PAGE prior to immunoblotting for EtpA. To examine the efficiency of LT delivery to target host cells, bacteria from overnight cultures of the wild type H10407 or the ΔeatA strain were added to Caco-2 epithelial cell monolayers. Following incubation of the bacteria with monolayers for 1–3 h, cells were lysed, and intracellular concentration of cAMP was determined by competitive enzyme immunoassay (GE Healthcare). To measure production of LT by wild type and eatA mutant, bacteria were grown at 37 °C, 225 rpm in 2 ml of casamino acids/yeast extract medium (CAYE, 2% casamino acids, 0.15% yeast extract, 0.25% NaCl, 0.871% K2HPO4, 0.25% glucose, and 0.1% (v/v) trace salts solution consisting of 5% MgSO4, 0.5% MnCl2, 0.5% FeCl3) (28Mundell D.H. Anselmo C.R. Wishnow R.M. Infect. Immun. 1976; 14: 383-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Supernatants were then tested in mixed ganglioside ELISAs as described previously (29Clements J.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess specific gene transcripts, total RNA was first isolated from bacteria (RNeasy, Qiagen) and quantified spectrophotometrically. RNA was freed of contaminating DNA by repeated DNase treatments. Total RNA from bacteria was converted to cDNA by use of reverse transcriptase and random hexamers. Gene expression was quantified by use of an ABI-PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system with gene-specific primers in PCR buffer containing SYBR Green. Gene-specific transcripts were normalized to the housekeeping gene arcA. To examine the activity of EatA in cAMP assays, the purified recombinant passenger domain of EatA (rEatAp) was added exogenously to Caco-2 target epithelial monolayers with or without purified LT holotoxin. After 3 h, cells were lysed, and cAMP concentrations were determined as above. To examine proteolytic cleavage of the A subunit of LT by EatA, the purified passenger domain (∼9 pmol) was mixed with LT holotoxin (116 pmol), and after incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Trypsin (∼2 pmol) was used as a positive control for proteolytic cleavage of the A subunit of LT. LT holotoxin used in these experiments was provided by Dr. John D. Clements of Tulane University School of Medicine. To date, most studies of ETEC adherence to the intestinal epithelium have focused specifically on the role of plasmid-encoded fimbrial colonization factors. However, more recent data suggest that the process of ETEC adhesion is complex and likely involves multiple virulence factors, including the secreted adhesin molecule, EtpA (5Fleckenstein J.M. Roy K. Fischer J.F. Burkitt M. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 2245-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), flagella (21Roy K. Hilliard G.M. Hamilton D.J. Luo J. Ostmann M.M. Fleckenstein J.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), as well as the heat-labile toxin (22Johnson A.M. Kaushik R.S. Francis D.H. Fleckenstein J.M. Hardwidge P.R. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Each of these factors has been shown to promote adhesion of ETEC to epithelial cells and to promote intestinal colonization. Curiously, by contrast, we observed that a mutant strain deficient in the production of another putative virulence protein, the EatA autotransporter (diagramed in Fig. 1a), appeared more adherent than wild type bacteria using in vitro intestinal epithelial cell monolayer adhesion assays (Fig. 1b), suggesting that this molecule might negatively modulate interactions between ETEC and the host cell. This inhibitory effect appeared to require protease activity of the EatA passenger domain as complementation of the mutant with a plasmid expressing wild type recombinant protein restored adherence to levels similar to those observed with the parent strain, whereas complementation with a plasmid-expressing protein bearing a H134R mutation in the EatA serine protease catalytic domain had no effect (Fig. 1b). Similarly, we were able to restore adherence of the eatA mutant to WT levels by addition of exogenous recombinant EatA passenger protein (rEatAp), although this was not true for the mutant rEatAp(H134R) molecule (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, antibodies raised against the passenger domain also enhanced adherence of the WT strain but had no appreciable effect on the mutant (Fig. 1d), further suggesting that EatA normally modulates the interaction of ETEC with target host cells. Because molecules influencing bacterial adherence in vitro also tend to participate in intestinal colonization, an essential virulence trait for enteric pathogens, we examined the relative ability of WT and eatA mutant ETEC strains to colonize small intestine. The results of these studies paralleled those obtained in vitro, with the eatA mutant exhibiting enhanced intestinal colonization at either 24 or 72 h following infection (Fig. 2, a and b). Similarly, the eatA mutant was shed with greater abundance in stool (Fig. 2, d and e). However, the eatA mutant did not out-compete the wild type ETEC strain when these organisms were introduced simultaneously (Fig. 2c), perhaps suggesting that levels of EatA secreted in vivo are sufficient to reverse the hyper-colonization phenotype exhibited by the mutant when introduced alone. We next questioned whether EatA might normally suppress bacterial adhesion by targeting one or more bacterial adhesins for proteolytic degradation. Because the passenger domain of EatA is released from the bacteria and freely secreted into the surrounding media (3Patel S.K. Dotson J. Allen K.P. Fleckenstein J.M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1786-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we first examined culture supernatants from WT bacteria or the eatA mutant. As predicted, these demonstrated that the EatA passenger was absent from the ΔeatA mutant (jf904) strain. However, we also noted an abundance of EtpA glycoprotein in culture supernatants of the jf904 strain relative to the WT (Fig. 3a). Immunoblots of culture supernatants demonstrated significant accumulation of EtpA in the eatA mutant cultures, whereas complementation of the eatA"

We now propose that the inhibitory effects of CD5 are also mediated by a parallel pathway that functions at the level of inhibition of Fyn, a kinase generally associated with T cell receptor-mediated activation. After CD5 ligation, phosphorylation of the negative regulatory tyrosine (Tyr531) of Fyn increases, and this correlates with a substantial reduction in the kinase activity of Fyn and a profound inhibition of ZAP-70 activation. The effect requires the last 23 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, strongly implying the involvement of a new CD5-interacting signaling or adaptor protein. Furthermore, we show that upon CD5 ligation there is a profound shift in its distribution from the bulk fluid phase to the lipid raft environment, where it associates with Fyn, Lck, and PAG. We suggest that the relocation of CD5, which we also show is capable of forming homodimers, to the proximity of raft-resident molecules enables CD5 to inhibit membrane proximal signaling by controlling the phosphorylation and activity of Fyn, possibly by interfering with the disassembly of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk)-PAG-Fyn complexes during T cell activation.

We demonstrated that the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) restored TGFβ signaling in breast cancer cell lines through induction of the TGFβ receptor type I (TGFβRI; Ref. 16Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32620-32625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The HDACi trichostatin A (TSA) activated TGFβRII promoter activity of epigenetically silenced TGFβRII (23Huang W. Zhao S. Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M. Venkatasubbarao K. Freeman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10047-10054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we reported that TGFβ signaling decreases survivin expression in colon cancer cells in response to stress (24Wang J. Yang L. Yang J. Kuropatwinski K. Wang W. Liu X.Q. Hauser J. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 3152-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Belinostat is a member of the hydroxamate class of HDACis with reported activity against a variety of human cell lines in vitro and in vivo (25Monks A. Hose C.D. Pezzoli P. Kondapaka S. Vansant G.

It is in clinical trials against both hematological and solid tumors. Therefore, we determined whether the drug induces re-expression of TGFβRII with concurrent restoration of the downstream effects of TGFβ signaling in colon, breast, and pancreatic cancer cells with epigenetically silenced TGFβ receptor. Furthermore, we examined the mechanism by which belinostat-mediated reactivation of TGFβ signaling leads to cancer cell death. We report the identification of belinostat-mediated induction of a novel TGFβ/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway leading to survivin down-regulation. Additionally, we report the identification of dual mechanisms involved in this TGFβ-dependent down-regulation of survivin induced by belinostat. The early repression of survivin is mediated by proteasomal degradation, whereas the late suppression involves transcriptional repression of survivin expression. The FET, CBS, and GEO colon carcinoma cells were cultured in a serum-free medium as described previously (26Ye S.C. Foster J.M. Li W. Liang J. Zborowska E. Venkateswarlu S. Gong J. Brattain M.G.

The FET dominant negative TGFβRII (designated FETDNRII) cells were obtained by stable transfection of a TGFβRII construct lacking the serine/threonine kinase domain and most of the carboxyl terminus (the cytoplasmic domain) into FET colon carcinoma cells as described previously (24Wang J.

The MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cancer cell line was obtained from Dr. Jim Freeman (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). It was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro, Mediatech, Inc.). Belinostat and TSA were obtained from Topotarget and Sigma, respectively. The TGFβRI kinase inhibitor ALK5 inhibitor I (ALK5i) was obtained from Calbiochem. Survivin, TGFβRII, p21, p15, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The phospho-Smad2 (Ser465/467) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Cleaved caspase 9 was purchased from Millipore. Anti-actin was purchased from Sigma. Smad2 shRNA (catalogue number sc-38378-SH) and PKA Catα shRNA (catalogue number sc-36240-SH) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. FET cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes. At about 40% confluence, the serum-free medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The cells were transfected with a pool of three shRNAs targeted against the human PKA Catα subunit or Smad2 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Control shRNA plasmid A (catalogue number sc-108060) was used as a negative control. Three stable clones were selected for the study. Representative data are shown here. Individual Smad2 siRNAs A and B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. catalogue numbers sc-38374A and sc-38374B) were transiently transfected in FET cells at 40% confluence. Control siRNA plasmid A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. catalogue number sc-37007) was used as a negative control. Transient transfections were done according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PKA catalytic α subunit plasmid construct was obtained from Susan Taylor's laboratory at University of California, San Francisco (supplied by Addgene; plasmid 14921, pET15b PKA Catα). The plasmid was transiently transfected into FETPKACatα KD cells using FuGENE HD transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed with TNESV lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris (ph 7.5), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% NP40, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4, 25 μg/ml β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)), as described previously (28Zhou Y. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5848-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Protein (30–100 μg) was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST or 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST according to the antibody data sheets. After washing with TBST for 10 min, the membrane was incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies, and proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). RNA was collected from treated cells using the High Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The two-step quantitative PCR using TaqMan reagents was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). The mRNA expression was normalized to GAPDH. The DNA fragmentation assay was performed using a cell death ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plate was read at 405 nm. Another set of treated cells was stained with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) as described previously (28Zhou Y. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5848-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) for measuring the inhibition of cell proliferation. The plate was read at 570 nm. Cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips suitable for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (29Maeda M. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The cell staining was visualized with a Leica DMRIE microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzler, Germany) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu City, Japan). The cell images were collected and analyzed using the image-processing software Openlab 4.0 (Improvision, Boston, MA). FET cells were plated at 800,000 cells/10-cm dish in serum-free medium (26Ye S.C. Foster J.M. Li W. Liang J. Zborowska E. Venkateswarlu S. Gong J. Brattain M.G. Willson J.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4725-4731PubMed Google Scholar). On day 5, cells were treated with belinostat (500 nm) for different time points and harvested for proteasomal activity assay in proteasomal assay buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 containing 2 mm ATP). The fluorometric proteasome substrate III for chymotrypsin (succinyl-LLVY-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) was obtained from Calbiochem. After quantification of protein concentration, cell lysates were incubated with the chymotrypsin substrate for 1 h at 37 °C, and the amount of chymotrypsin substrate cleavage was quantified fluorometrically (30Heider U. von Metzler I. Kaiser M. Rosche M. Sterz J. Rötzer S. Rademacher J. Jakob C. Fleissner C. Kuckelkorn U. Kloetzel P.M. Sezer O. Eur. J. Haematol. 2008; 80: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were tested for statistical significance by using one-way analysis of variance using GraphPad Prism 4 software. Only p values <0.05 were considered significant. All experiments were repeated three times independently. We first assessed the ability of belinostat to regulate TGFβRII expression in the TGFβ-sensitive FET colon carcinoma cell line, which expresses type II TGFβ receptor and retains the tumor suppressor effects of TGFβ (24Wang J. Yang L. Yang J. Kuropatwinski K. Wang W. Liu X.Q. Hauser J. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 3152-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, belinostat treatment increased both TGFβRII mRNA and protein expression at 48 h in a concentration-dependent manner. Having established that belinostat treatment is functionally effective in regulating TGFβRII expression in TGFβ-sensitive cells, we next assessed the effect of belinostat on different cancer cell lines with known epigenetic silencing of TGFβRII. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated TGFβRII epigenetic silencing in MCF-7L and the MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cell line (13Venkatasubbarao K. Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. Mimari D. Freeman J.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6239-6247PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ammanamanchi S. Freeman J.W. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35775-35780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Belinostat treatment reactivated TGFβRII mRNA and protein expression in both of these cell lines (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1A). We determined whether belinostat treatment can alter TGFβRII levels in cancer cell lines in which TGFβRII is not known to be epigenetically regulated and does not respond to HDAC inhibitors (63Arnold N.B. Arkus N. Gunn J. Korc M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We used the Panc1 pancreatic cancer cell line in these experiments. Panc1 cells showed no protein expression of TGFβRII, and treatment with belinostat was unable to increase its protein expression (supplemental Fig. S1C). To confirm that this reactivation was an effect of HDAC inhibition, we tested the effect of TSA on TGFβRII expression in these cell lines. Indeed, TSA treatment of MCF-7L cells resulted in re-expression of TGFβRII mRNA and protein (Fig. 1C). We also confirmed that belinostat reconstituted TGFβRII protein expression in a colon cancer cell line, CBS, that has been demonstrated to have attenuated TGFβ signaling (26Ye S.C. Foster J.M. Li W. Liang J. Zborowska E. Venkateswarlu S. Gong J. Brattain M.G. Willson J.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4725-4731PubMed Google Scholar). Belinostat treatment of TGFβRII-deficient CBS colon cancer cells again resulted in the induction of TGFβRII mRNA and protein expression (supplemental Fig. S1B). These data demonstrate that belinostat treatment is able to restore TGFβRII transcription, which results in reconstitution of the TGFβRII receptor protein. The ability of HDACi to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis indicates the critical role of HDACs in these processes (31Taghiyev A.F. Guseva N.V. Glover R.A. Rokhlin O.W. Cohen M.B. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2006; 5: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Yamamoto S. Tanaka K. Sakimura R. Okada T. Nakamura T. Li Y. Takasaki M. Nakabeppu Y. Iwamoto Y. Anticancer Res. 2008; 28: 1585-1591PubMed Google Scholar). Although TGFβRII epigenetic silencing has been extensively characterized and the reversion of transcriptional silencing by HDACi has been documented, its involvement in HDACi-mediated cell death has not been tested. We hypothesized that belinostat treatment mediates cell death through the TGFβ pathway. We reasoned that belinostat-mediated induction of TGFβRII might reactivate the TGFβ signaling pathway leading to the restoration of the growth-inhibitory and cell death effects of TGFβ signaling on inappropriate cell survival pathways. To test whether belinostat restores TGFβ signaling, we first investigated the ability of belinostat to induce Smad activation, which is a hallmark of canonical TGFβ-Smad signaling downstream of TGFβ receptor activation (33Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). Belinostat treatment resulted in phosphorylation of Smad2 in FET cells (Fig. 1D). To evaluate the dependence of TGFβ receptor signaling on Smad activation, we utilized the FETDNRII cells with abrogated TGFβ signaling due to transfection of a dominant negative TGFβRII vector construct (24Wang J. Yang L. Yang J. Kuropatwinski K. Wang W. Liu X.Q. Hauser J. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 3152-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Belinostat-mediated activation of Smad2 was completely abrogated in the FETDNRII cell line indicating that Smad activation is downstream of belinostat-mediated TGFβRII induction (Fig. 1D). Having established that belinostat mediates restoration of TGFβ receptor signaling leading to Smad activation, we investigated the role of this reconstituted TGFβ signaling in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Although HDACi-mediated restoration of transcription of epigenetically silenced TGFβRII has been well documented, the specific contribution of the ensuing TGFβ-Smad signaling to the HDACi-mediated cell cycle arrest and/or apoptotic cell death has not been demonstrated. We first tested the potential role of belinostat-mediated restoration of TGFβ signaling in the induction of cell cycle arrest by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 2A). We observed a TGFβ signaling-dependent increase in the G2-M phase following belinostat treatment. The expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p21WAF1/CIP1 has been shown to be induced in transformed cells by the HDACis phenylbutyrate, SAHA, and TSA and is associated with G1 phase cell cycle arrest (9Richon V.M. Sandhoff T.W. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10014-10019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 34Fandy T.E. Shankar S. Ross D.D. Sausville E. Srivastava R.K. Neoplasia. 2005; 7: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has also been reported that another CDKI, p15(INK4b), is induced by the HDACis TSA and sodium butyrate in colon cancer cells (35Hitomi T. Matsuzaki Y. Yokota T. Takaoka Y. Sakai T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory has shown that MCF-7L cells stably transfected with TGFβRII show inhibition of xenograft growth in association with the enhanced growth arrest resulting from p21WAF1/CIP1 induced by endogenous TGFβ signaling (27Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reconstitution of TGFβ signaling in the highly tumorigenic GEO cell line by stable transfection of TGFβRI also results in cell cycle arrest mediated by p21WAF1/CIP1 induction (36Wang J. Han W. Zborowska E. Liang J. Wang X. Willson J.K. Sun L. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17366-17371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The TGFβ signaling pathway also mediates induction of p15(INK4b) as another growth arrest mechanism (37Wang J. Sergina N. Ko T.C. Gong J. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40237-40244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether belinostat induced expression of these CDKIs and whether this effect was downstream of reconstitution of TGFβ signaling. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses revealed that belinostat induced increased expression of both p21WAF1/CIP1 and p15(INK4b) in MCF-7L cells (Fig. 2, B and C) in line with previous reports on the effects of HDACis. To test whether TGFβ signaling was involved in this belinostat-mediated effect on CDKIs, MCF-7L cells were pretreated with the TGFβRI inhibitor ALK5i prior to treatment with the HDACi. Inhibition of the TGFβ signaling pathway partially attenuated the induction of both p21WAF1/CIP1 and p15(INK4b) supporting the hypothesis that belinostat mediates cell cycle arrest through reconstitution of TGFβ signaling. To independently validate these results, we confirmed that belinostat treatment induced p21WAF1/CIP1 induction in the TGFβ-sensitive FET cells (Fig. 1D). It has been reported that TGFβ up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 leading to cell cycle arrest is mediated by Smad activation. There are Smad binding sites within the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter (38Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Smads mediated belinostat-induced cell cycle arrest through TGFβ signaling restoration, we utilized Smad2 knockdown in the FET cell line (designated FETSmad2 KD cells). Belinostat treatment of these Smad2 KD cells did not lead to p21WAF1/CIP1 induction (Fig. 1D) confirming the signaling intermediate role of the Smads in belinostat induction of cell cycle arrest. Therefore, HDACi belinostat-mediated induction of CDKIs is linked to TGFβ signaling. We next determined whether the apoptotic response to belinostat was mediated through induction of TGFβ signaling. HDACi treatment has been shown to selectively induce tumor cell death along with cell cycle arrest (7Bolden J.E. Peart M.J. Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, belinostat treatment showed a time-dependent increase in apoptotic cell death in all cancer cell lines tested. To begin to study the role of reactivation of TGFβ signaling in belinostat-induced apoptosis, we first studied the effect of belinostat in the FET colon carcinoma cell line FETDNRII. Abrogation of TGFβ signaling resulted in a decreased apoptotic response in these cells compared with the parental cell line (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained from using ALK5i pretreatment prior to belinostat treatment of FET cells as well as belinostat treatment of FETSmad2 KD cells (supplemental Fig. S2A). We performed flow cytometry analysis and stained for Annexin V (Fig. 3, D and E). We observed an increase in apoptosis with belinostat treatment. These data provide evidence that TGFβ signaling contributes to the apoptotic response induced by belinostat. It has been reported that the apoptotic response to HDACi is accompanied by the cleavage of PARP and procaspases 3 and 9 (39Jiang S. Dowdy S.C. Meng X.W. Wang Z. Jones M.B. Podratz K.C. Jiang S.W.

Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2767-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether abrogation of TGFβ signaling would affect the cleavage of these apoptotic markers in response to belinostat. As shown in Fig. 3C, belinostat treatment induced cleavage of procaspase 9 in a concentration-dependent manner in FET cells. However, this effect was abrogated in FETDNRII cells providing further evidence that the apoptotic response to belinostat is mediated by TGFβ signaling. As reported above, FET cells retain a low level of TGFβ signaling and therefore would be expected to be sensitive to the apoptotic effect of TGFβ. Therefore, we examined whether this TGFβ signaling had a role in the apoptotic response to belinostat in the cell lines in which the HDACi reactivated expression of epigenetically silenced TGFβRII. PARP is a substrate for caspases activated during early stages of apoptosis and serves as an early marker of apoptosis (42Heeres J.T. Hergenrother P.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We observed induction of both cleaved caspase 9 and PARP by immunochemistry in belinostat-treated MCF-7L cells (supplemental Fig. S2B). Furthermore, pretreatment with the ALK5i prior to belinostat treatment repressed the induction of both cleaved caspase 9 and PARP by belinostat again establishing a role of TGFβ signaling in the belinostat treatment-mediated apoptotic cell death response following induction of expression of the TGFβRII tumor suppressor gene. To gain further insight into the mechanisms relevant for belinostat treatment-induced cell death, we focused our attention on the expression of the IAP protein survivin (43Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 2010; 430: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory has shown that T"

We recently demonstrated that PI3K(p110α) protects the heart against myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to determine whether PI3K(p110α) directly regulates components of the Z-disc and cardiac structure. To address this question, a unique three-dimensional virtual muscle model was applied to gene expression data from transgenic mice with increased or decreased PI3K(p110α) activity under basal conditions (sham) and in a setting of myocardial infarction to display the location of structural proteins. Key findings from this analysis were then validated experimentally. The three-dimensional virtual muscle model visually highlighted reciprocally regulated transcripts associated with PI3K activation that encoded key components of the Z-disc and costamere, including melusin. Studies were performed to assess whether PI3K and melusin interact in the heart. Here, we identify a novel melusin-PI3K interaction that generates lipid kinase activity. The direct impact of PI3K(p110α) on myocyte structure was assessed by treating neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with PI3K(p110α) inhibitors and examining the myofiber morphology of hearts from PI3K transgenic mice. Results demonstrate that PI3K is critical for myofiber maturation and Z-disc alignment. In summary, PI3K regulates the expression of genes essential for cardiac structure and Z-disc signaling, interacts with melusin, and is critical for Z-disc alignment."

In mammalian cells, AICAr specifically promotes apoptosis of aneuploid cells and is a promising antitumor agent (2Tang Y.C. Williams B.R. Siegel J.J. Amon A. Cell. 2011; 144: 499-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Indeed, AICAr inhibits proliferation of various tumor cell lines (2Tang Y.C. Williams B.R. Siegel J.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 39582-39593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). AICAr is metabolized to AICAR, which is an agonist of the AMP-dependent kinase (4Sullivan J.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), a major regulator of metabolism. However, there are multiple examples where AICAr effects were partially or fully AMP-dependent kinase-independent (6Jacobs R.L. Lingrell S. Dyck J.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4516-4523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Kuo C.L. Ho F.M. Chang M.Y. Prakash E. Lin W.W. J. Cell.

The other effectors of AICAR are not yet known, and it is not totally clear whether all the cellular effects of AICAr can be attributed to AICAR. In yeast, besides its metabolic role, AICAR has important regulatory effects. In particular, AICAR co-regulates purine synthesis and phosphate utilization by promoting interaction of the transcription factor Pho2 with either Bas1 or Pho4 (9Pinson B. Vaur S. Sagot I. Coulpier F. Lemoine S. Daignan-Fornier B. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Rébora K. Desmoucelles C. Borne F. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Cell.

In human, severe symptoms are associated with AICAR transformylase inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase deficiency, a defect leading to accumulation of AICAR and derivatives (12Marie S. Heron B. Bitoun P. Timmerman T. Van Den Berghe G. Vincent M.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 1276-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In yeast, AICAR is accumulated in an ade16 ade17 mutant lacking AICAR transformylase inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase and in an ade3 mutant that cannot synthesize 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, a co-substrate for AICAR transformylase inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (see Fig. 1A) (9Pinson B. Vaur S. Sagot I. Coulpier F. Lemoine S. Daignan-Fornier B. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of the first step of the purine pathway is highly detrimental for cell growth when combined with ade16 ade17 (11Rébora K. Laloo B. Daignan-Fornier B. Genetics. 2005; 170: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, when the purine pathway is not hyperactivated, the ade16 ade17 and ade3 mutants are viable but display an auxotrophy for histidine (13Tibbetts A.S. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20920-20927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This auxotrophy is not dependent on the Pho2 and Bas1 transcription factors that regulate the purine and histidine pathways and can be suppressed by overexpression of the putative phosphomutase Pmu1 (11Rébora K. Laloo B. Daignan-Fornier B. Genetics. 2005; 170: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we combined genetic and metabolomics approaches to get insight into AICAR metabolism and its effects on yeast cell physiology. SD is a synthetic minimal medium containing 5% ammonium sulfate, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 2% glucose. SDcasaW is SD medium supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids (Difco) and tryptophan (0.2 mm). When indicated, adenine (0.3 mm) and/or uracil (0.3 mm) were added in SDcasaW medium resulting in media named SDcasaWA (+adenine), SDcasaWU (+uracil), and SDcasaWAU (+adenine +uracil). SC medium was prepared as described by Sherman et al. (14Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). SC complete medium is SC medium supplemented with adenine (0.3 mm), uracil (0.3 mm), histidine (0.06 mm), leucine (0.4 mm), lysine (0.06 mm), and tryptophan (0.2 mm). Yeast strains (Table 1) belong to or are derived from a set of disrupted strains isogenic to BY4741 or BY4742 purchased from Euroscarf. Plasmids allowing expression of the PHO13 gene (either wild type or mutant) (PHO13-1) were obtained by PCR amplification with oligonucleotides 2706 (5′-CGCGGATCCAAAATGACTGCTCAACAAGGTG-3′) and 2707 (5′-CCAATGCATCTATAACTCATTATTGGTTAAGG-3′) on genomic DNA from ade3 ade16 ade17 (Y2406) and dominant mutant (Y3438) strains, respectively. PCR products were digested with BamHI and NsiI and cloned in the pCM189 vector (15Garí E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) digested with BamHI and PstI, resulting in the tet-PHO13 (p4248) and tet-PHO13-1 (p4291) plasmids, respectively.

Sahin A. Pinson B. Ceschin J. Daignan-Fornier B. Sagot I. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), respectively. Metabolites were separated by ionic chromatography on an ICS3000 chromatography station (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) and detected by integrated pulsed amperometry for amino acid detection (Amino Acids Analyzer-certified electrodes; Dionex) and by a UV diode array detector for the other metabolites (Ultimate 3000 RS, Dionex). Amino acids were separated on an aminopacPA10 column (250 × 2 mm; Dionex) with improved gradient method 3 (19Hanko V.P. Heckenberg A. Rohrer J.S. J. Biomol. Tech. 2004; 15: 317-324PubMed Google Scholar). Other metabolites were usually separated on a carbopacPA1 column (250 × 2 mm; Dionex) using a sodium acetate gradient (from 300 to 800 mm) in 50 mm NaOH with a 0.25 ml/min flow as follows. Elution was started at 300 mm sodium acetate for 2 min, raised to 500 mm sodium acetate in 8 min followed by a step at 500 mm for 5 min, raised to 800 mm in 10 min, kept at 800 mm for 25 min, and returned to 300 mm in 1 min. The resin was re-equilibrated for 10 min at this sodium acetate concentration prior to any injection. For detection of physiological levels of AICAR/5-amino-4-imidazole N-succinocarboxamide ribonucleotide 5′-phosphate (SAICAR) derivatives, separation was also performed on the carbopacPA1 column with a 0.25 ml/min flow but using a modified sodium acetate gradient (from 50 to 800 mm) in 50 mm NaOH as follows. Elution was started at 50 mm sodium acetate for 2 min; raised to 75 mm in 8 min, then to 100 mm in 25 min, and finally to 350 mm in 30 min followed by a step at 350 mm for 5 min; raised to 500 mm in 10 min; kept at this sodium acetate concentration for 5 min; and finally raised to 800 mm in 10 min followed by a step at this concentration for 20 min. The resin was then equilibrated at 50 mm sodium acetate for 15 min before injection of a new sample. Peaks were identified by their retention time as well as by co-injection with standards and/or their UV spectrum signature depending on their chemical properties. Cell volume measurements used to calculate metabolite intracellular concentrations were performed using a MultisizerTM 4 Coulter Counter® (Beckman Coulter). A pho13Δ (Y6224) strain was transformed with plasmids allowing expression of PHO13 (either wild type (p4248) or mutant (p4291)) or by the corresponding pCM189 empty vector. For each strain, transformants were grown exponentially for 24 h in SDcasaWA medium (50 ml) and harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g, 4 min, 4 °C) when A600 nm reached 1. Cells were washed with 30 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT), resuspended in 0.4 ml of the same buffer, and then disrupted in dry ice with 300 μl of glass beads using a FastPrep (3 × 20 s; MP Biomedicals). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C, 21,000 × g), and the supernatant was dialyzed for 3 h at 4 °C against extraction buffer. The protein concentration for each extract was measured and diluted to 2 mg/ml. Enzyme assays were performed at 37 °C in 400 μl of extraction buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 and SAICAR (Fig. 1B) at the indicated concentrations. Assays were started by addition of 20 μg of total proteins, and 100-μl aliquots were collected at 0, 5, 10, and 15 min, time points for which apparition of 5-amino-4-imidazole N-succinocarboxamide ribonucleoside (SAICAr; Fig. 1B) is linear over time for all SAICAR concentrations. The reaction was stopped by incubation at 95 °C in a water bath for 5 min. Concentrations of SAICAR and SAICAr were determined by HPLC using a C18 reverse phase column as described previously (20Lecoq K. Konrad M. Daignan-Fornier B. Genetics. 2000; 156: 953-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). The specific activity (μmol of SAICAr synthesized/min/mg of total proteins) was determined by linear regression of the amount of SAICAr that appeared during the time. The activity measured with protein extract from the pho13Δ strain transformed with the empty vector was considered as Pho13-independent background and was subtracted. β-Gal assays were performed as described (22Pinson B. Sagot I. Borne F. Gabrielsen O.S. Daignan-Fornier B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3977-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the dominant mutants and control genomes was performed by GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). DNA microarray hybridizations were performed as described (23Breton A. Pinson B. Coulpier F. Giraud M.F. Dautant A. Daignan-Fornier B. Genetics. 2008; 178: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and microarray data were normalized without background subtraction by the global lowess method performed with Goulphar software (24Lemoine S. Combes F. Servant N. Le Crom S. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The yeast ade3 ade16 ade17 triple mutant is auxotrophic for histidine (Fig. 2A). When transferred to a growth medium lacking histidine, the mutant cells rapidly arrested in G1 with a 1N DNA content and a non-duplicated spindle pole body (data not shown). This arrest was associated with an overaccumulation of AICAR (Fig. 2B) and a strong decrease in intracellular histidine concentration down to a level comparable with that of the his1 mutant lacking the first enzyme of the histidine biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 2C). Of note, 32 h in the absence of histidine were required for the his1 mutant to fully deplete the histidine pool. A genetic screen was performed to isolate histidine prototroph suppressors from the ade3 ade16 ade17 strain mutagenized with UV light. A set of 159 suppressor mutants was further studied. Most of these suppressors (101 mutants) were recessive, whereas 58 were dominant. All the recessive mutants fell in a single complementation group, and all the tested dominant mutants (six mutants) were genetically linked. The suppression phenotype was stronger for the dominant than for the recessive suppressors (Fig. 2A). Importantly, in both dominant and recessive suppressors, AICAR accumulation was much lower than in the ade3 ade16 ade17 triple mutant (Fig. 2B), whereas intracellular histidine concentration was increased (Fig. 2C). The histidine concentration in the recessive suppressor strain was intermediate between that of the triple mutant and the wild-type strain (Fig. 2C). For the dominant suppressor, the histidine concentration was close to that of the wild-type strain (Fig. 2C). In both cases, the histidine concentration nicely followed the capacity of the suppressors to grow in the absence of histidine (Fig. 2A). Several recessive suppressors were analyzed by ionic chromatography, and similar metabolic profiles including major peaks undetectable in the ade3 ade16 ade17 triple mutant strain were revealed (Fig. 3A). Based on their retention time, their UV spectra, and co-injection experiments, the accumulated compounds were identified as AICAr, adenosine, S-adenosylmethionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (Fig. 3A). Two yeast mutants potentially accumulate S-adenosylhomocysteine: sah1, which affects S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (25Mizunuma M. Miyamura K. Hirata D. Yokoyama H. Miyakawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and ado1, which lacks adenosine kinase (26Lecoq K. Belloc I. Desgranges C. Daignan-Fornier B. Yeast. 2001; 18: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We found that S-adenosylhomocysteine was accumulated in a sah1-1 temperature-sensitive mutant (25Mizunuma M. Miyamura K. Hirata D. Yokoyama H. Miyakawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but adenosine and S-adenosylmethionine were not accumulated (data not shown). By contrast, adenosine, S-adenosylmethionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine were all accumulated in an ado1 knock-out mutant (Fig. 3B). Thus ADO1, encoding adenosine kinase (26Lecoq K. Belloc I. Desgranges C. Daignan-Fornier B. Yeast. 2001; 18: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), appeared to be a good candidate gene and was used for complementation studies in the recessive mutants. First, we showed that the ADO1 gene carried on a plasmid fully restored the histidine auxotrophy to the recessive mutant (data not shown). In addition, we found that a knock-out of ado1 when introduced in the triple ade3 ade16 ade17 mutant strain suppressed the histidine auxotrophy (Fig. 3C) although to a lesser extent than the suppressor mutants most probably because of the strong growth defect associated with the knock-out of ado1 (26Lecoq K. Belloc I. Desgranges C. Daignan-Fornier B. Yeast. 2001; 18: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The resulting ade3 ade16 ade17 ado1 strain was used for a complementation assay with the recessive suppressor. The two suppressor mutations were clearly unable to complement each other (Fig. 3D) and thus most probably affect the same gene. Finally, sequencing of the ADO1 gene in six recessive mutants revealed in each mutant the presence of one of four different mutations leading to changes in conserved amino acids (N68K (ado1-3), G119S (ado1-2), A320P (ado1-4), and P329R (ado1-1)). From these data, we conclude that the recessive suppressors are alleles of the ADO1 gene. In the recessive suppressor strains, the AICAR concentration was decreased, and the AICAr concentration was increased (Fig. 3A). Thus, we hypothesized that the adenosine kinase Ado1 could be responsible for AICAr phosphorylation. This was confirmed by feeding an ade16 ade17 ade8 his1 mutant (unable to synthesize AICAR from the histidine and purine pathways; see Fig. 1A) with AICAr. In this mutant, AICAr was taken up and metabolized to AICAR (Fig. 3E). By contrast, when the ado1 knock-out mutation was introduced in this quadruple mutant strain, the resulting strain was still able to internalize AICAr but became totally unable to synthesize AICAR (as well as SAICAR and its riboside form) (Fig. 3E). Of note, in both strains grown in the absence of AICAr, none of the AICAR/SAICAR derivatives were detectable (data not shown). These results show that adenosine kinase is required to synthesize AICAR monophosphate from its riboside form (AICAr) and that the ado1 suppressors by altering the replenishment of the AICAR pool from AICAr result in a lower intracellular AICAR concentration. The dominant suppressors (10 mutants analyzed) massively accumulated SAICAr (Fig. 4A), the riboside derivative of SAICAR (Fig. 1B). A simple explanation would be that the dominant suppressors somehow drain AICAR to SAICAR (just upstream in the pathway) and ultimately SAICAr, thus “detoxifying” excessive AICAR. Consistently, when the gene responsible for the AICAR to SAICAR conversion (ADE13; see Fig. 1A) was disrupted in the triple ade3 ade16 ade17 mutant carrying the dominant suppressor, the resulting strain was not prototrophic for histidine anymore (Fig. 4B). This implies that Ade13 is required for the suppressor to be efficient or that the suppressor is allelic to ADE13. However, sequencing of the ADE13 locus in the ade3 ade16 ade17 mutant and several dominant suppressor strains did not reveal any differences. To identify the dominant suppressor, we then used a whole genome sequencing approach and searched for polymorphisms among the genomes of three dominant suppressors and two control strains. This approach revealed among multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms a single nucleotide polymorphism (G32918A on chromosome 4) at the PHO13 (YDL236W) locus encoding an alkaline phosphatase of unknown function (27Kaneko Y. Toh-e A. Banno I. Oshima Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 220: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This single nucleotide polymorphism was particularly interesting because the ionic chromatography analysis suggested that the dominant suppressor was dephosphorylating SAICAR to SAICAr (Fig. 4A). Thus, we sequenced the PHO13 locus in five dominant suppressors and confirmed the presence of the polymorphism in all cases and no other mutation in the PHO13 gene. The mutation in PHO13 affects a glycine residue that is mutated to an aspartate (G208D). It is noteworthy that Pho13 orthologs in most organisms carry a glycine at this position, although in a few cases, an aspartate residue is found in this position (28Ndubuisil M.I. Kwok B.H. Vervoort J. Koh B.D. Elofsson M. Crews C.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7841-7848Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The dominant suppressor was then crossed to an ade3 pho13 double mutant, and we found that in the meiotic progeny (20 tetrads) none of the histidine prototroph spores carried the deletion of pho13. The suppressor and pho13 are thus tightly linked. Finally, we cloned the PHO13 coding region carrying the dominant mutation in a plasmid under the control of a heterologous promoter and found that this construct could suppress the histidine auxotrophy of an ade3 ade16 ade17 mutant (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the wild-type PHO13 open reading frame cloned in the same vector did not allow any growth in the absence of histidine (Fig. 4C). The same plasmids were transformed in a pho13 mutant, and protein extracts from the transformants were used to measure SAICAR phosphatase activity in vitro. Consistently, the ability to dephosphorylate SAICAR to SAICAr was high in the strain carrying the tet-PHO13-1 construct and much lower in the tet-PHO13 transformants (Fig. 4D). We conclude that the mutant form of Pho13 has gained the capacity to efficiently dephosphorylate SAICAR in vivo and in vitro. Of note, we measured in vitro a very slight enzymatic activity of Pho13-1 mutant toward AICAR as a substrate (0.012 ± 0.002 μmol/min/mg with 1 mm AICAR). This activity may account for the modest accumulation of AICAr in the dominant mutant. We previously reported an important regulatory role for SAICAR in transcriptional activation of the purine pathway (9Pinson B. Vaur S. Sagot I. Coulpier F. Lemoine S. Daignan-Fornier B. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Rébora K. Desmoucelles C. Borne F. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7901-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The ade16 ade17 mutant strain accumulates both the monophosphate form, SAICAR (190 ± 29 μm), and the riboside form, SAICAr (11 ± 3 μm). Interestingly enough, we observed that massive accumulation (1000-fold) of SAICAr in PHO13-1 mutants (11.1 ± 0.1 mm) had no effect on the expression of an ADE1-LacZ fusion (the results for two tetrads from a PHO13-1/pho13::kanMX4 diploid are shown in Fig. 4E). Altogether, these results indicate that the monophosphate form, SAICAR, is the active form and that the riboside form, SAICAr, does not interfere with SAICAR for transcriptional up-regulation of the purine regulon. To estimate the respective regulatory roles of AICAR and its riboside derivative AICAr, we first compared the effect of addition of AICAr on the transcriptome of two isogenic strains that are capable (ADO1) or not capable (ado1) of metabolizing AICAr to AICAR (Fig. 3E). Clearly, addition of AICAr stimulated expression of the ADE regulon (Fig. 5A, column 1) and PHO regulon genes (Fig. 5B, column 1) similarly to the effect found in ade3 (Fig. 5, A and B, column 3) and ade16 ade17 mutants (Fig. 5, A and B, columns 4 and 5) that accumulate AICAR due to the block in the pathway ([AICAR] is ∼0.5 and ∼1.5 mm in ade3 and ade16 ade17 mutants, respectively). However, this AICAr-dependent effect was totally abolished by the ado1 knock-out mutation (Fig. 5, A–D, column 2) that prevents AICAR synthesis from AICAr (Fig. 3E). We conclude that the riboside form, AICAr, has no effect on transcriptional regulation of the purine and phosphate pathways and more generally that AICAr accumulation does not affect transcription in yeast. These experiments do not allow us to make conclusions on the role of SAICAR, which is also accumulated whenever AICAR is abundant, although the concentration of SAICAR is always much lower (5–10-fold) than that of AICAR under these conditions. Of note, we have attempted to use a similar approach to study the effects of SAICAr and SAICAR, but because of the low solubility of SAICAr in the culture medium and its apparent inability to be taken up by yeast cells, we could neither measure any internalized SAICAr in ade13 ade1 cells grown in the presence of this metabolite nor detect any transcriptional effect on the expression of ADE genes subsequent to SAICAr supplementation (data not shown). Finally, we could reproduce the AICAR toxicity assay (11Rébora K. Laloo B. Daignan-Fornier B. Genetics. 2005; 170: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) by feeding the ade16 ade17 ade8 his1 mutant with high concentrations of AICAr (Fig. 5E). This toxicity was abolished when ado1 was mutated (Fig. 5E), i.e. when AICAr could not be metabolized to AICAR (Fig. 3E). This result establishes that AICAR, the monophosphate form, is the toxic form of this metabolite. Results presented in the previous sections indicate that AICAR and SAICAR are the effective regulatory molecules. In a previous work, we showed that AICAR binds the Pho2 and Pho4 transcription factors and that up-regulation of ADE and PHO pathway genes is clearly associated with increased AICAR concentration (9Pinson B. Vaur S. Sagot I. Coulpier F. Lemoine S. Daignan-Fornier B. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Rébora K. Desmoucelles C. Borne F. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B.

Together, these results indicate that AICAR and SAICAR are likely to be signal molecules under physiological conditions. Should this be true, the concentration of AICAR and/or SAICAR should vary under growth conditions known to induce activation of both the ADE and PHO pathways (16Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 29Gauthier S. Coulpier F. Jourdren L. Merle M. Beck S. Konrad M. Daignan-Fornier B. Pinson B. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), i.e. in response to external adenine. This expectation was directly addressed by ionic chromatography using a highly sensitive detection device. As shown in Fig. 6A, both AICAR and SAICAR were found in the adenine-depleted culture, whereas both compounds were undetectable in the adenine-replete growth condition (Fig. 6A). Of note, AICAr could not be detected in both growth conditions (Fig. 6A). Additionally, we found that in previously characterized adenine-unresponsive mutants (30Guetsova M.L. Lecoq K. Daignan-Fornier B. Genetics. 1997; 147: 383-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) AICAR and/or SAICAR could be detected even in the presence of adenine (Fig. 6B). Together, these results strongly substantiate the physiological regulatory role of AICAR and SAICAR in transcriptional activation. Finally, measurement of AICAR and SAICAR concentrations in a prototrophic strain grown in minimal medium containing or not containing adenine and histidine allowed us to establish that under physiological conditions both pathways contribute to AICAR synthesis, whereas only the purine pathway supplies SAICAR synthesis (Fig. 6C). In the presence of histidine and adenine (+Ade +His), both pathways are feedback-inhibited by their final product, and neither AICAR nor SAICAR can be detected (Fig. 6C). When the purine pathway is feedback-inhibited, but the histidine pathway is not (+Ade −His), only AICAR is detected (Fig. 6C). Finally, as soon as the purine pathway is not feedback-inhibited (−Ade +His), both AICAR and SAICAR are detected (Fig. 6C). The highest levels for these metabolites were found when both adenine and histidine were absent (−Ade −His; Fig. 6C). Our genetic approach to understand why AICAR-accumulating mutants are histidine auxotrophs, although rather exhaustive, only allowed the identification of two loci. In both cases, histidine prototrophy was most probably due to decreased AICAR concentration, suggesting that no single mutation could reverse the effect of AICAR leading to histidine auxotrophy. Our work clearly associates AICAR accumulation and histidine starvation, suggesting that a step in histidine biosynthesis could be inhibited by AICAR. The reason why we did not isolate any mutant affecting the inhibited step is unclear and could reflect the fact that more than one step is affected. It would be interesting to find out whether inhibition of the histidine pathway by AICAR takes place under physiological conditions. Our genetic study allowed us to show that adenosine kinase is responsible for phosphorylation of AICAr to AICAR in yeast as found previously in mammalian cells (31Sabina R.L. Patterson D. Holmes E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6107-6114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also show that SAICAr is not a good substrate for the adenosine kinase because the SAICAr concentration was only slightly higher in the ado1 suppressor strains, which accumulate a high level of AICAr (Fig. 3A). Our data do not provide any evidence for the existence of a yeast enzyme able to synthesize SAICAR from SAICAr (Fig. 7). The reverse dephosphorylation reaction catalyzed by the Pho13 mutant enzyme was very efficient for SAICAR, whereas AICAR was a very poor substrate (Fig. 4A). Importantly, the wild-type Pho13 enzyme was far less efficient in vitro (Fig. 4D) and could not restore histidine prototrophy when overexpressed (Fig. 4C). Thus, SAICAR does not appear to be a natural substrate for Pho13, the physiological role of which is not known. The putative enzymes responsible for physiological dephosphorylation of AICAR and SAICAR in the wild-type strain have not yet been identified (Fig. 7). This work clearly establishes that the monophosphate forms, AICAR and SAICAR, are detoxified via their dephosphorylation. In humans, adenylosuccinate lyase- and AICAR transformylase inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase-deficient patients excrete high levels of riboside derivatives in their body fluids. An emerging conclusion of our work is that the concentration of the riboside forms most likely reflects detoxification; their level should therefore be considered with caution to establish correlations with the gravity of syndromes associated with these diseases. This work strongly reinforces the proposed role of AICAR and SAICAR as regulators of transcription. These regulatory effects appear to be highly specific because our transcriptome analysis clearly shows that the riboside form, AICAr, does not substitute for AICAR and plays no major role in yeast transcriptional regulation. Whether AICAR and/or SAICAR plays other physiological roles besides transcriptional regulation remains to be investigated. Interestingly, although addition of extracellular AICAr has multiple effects on mammalian cells, it is not known whether intracellular AICAR naturally produced from the purine de novo pathway plays some physiological roles in these cells. Our work on yeast establishes for the first time that AICAR and SAICAR concentrations vary under physiological conditions (i.e. in the presence or absence of adenine and/or histidine). It would therefore not be surprising if in pluricellular organisms intracellular concentrations of these metabolites varied under physiological conditions in a cell type-specific way. Additionally, we previously reported a significant increase in the AICAR concentration when quiescent yeast cells were transferred to glucose, suggesting a wider role of this metabolite (18Laporte D. Lebaudy A. Sahin A. Pinson B. Ceschin J. Daignan-Fornier B. Sagot I. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Further understanding of the multiple roles of AICAR will necessitate the identification and study of its protein targets."

We demonstrated previously that eNOS translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytosol is required for hyperpermeability. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that eNOS activation in the cytosol is necessary for agonist-induced hyperpermeability. To study the fundamental properties of endothelial cell monolayer permeability, we generated ECV-304 cells that stably express cDNA constructs targeting eNOS to the cytosol or plasma membrane. eNOS-transfected ECV-304 cells recapitulate the eNOS translocation and permeability properties of postcapillary venular endothelial cells (Sánchez, F. A., Rana, R., Kim, D. D., Iwahashi, T., Zheng, R., Lal, B. K., Gordon, D. M., Meininger, C. J., and Durán, W. N. (2009) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106, 6849-6853). We used platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a proinflammatory agonist. PAF activated eNOS by increasing phosphorylation of Ser-1177 and inducing dephosphorylation of Thr-495, increasing NO production, and elevating permeability to FITC-dextran 70 in monolayers of cells expressing wild-type and cytosolic eNOS. PAF failed to increase permeability to FITC-dextran 70 in monolayers of cells transfected with eNOS targeted to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, this occurred despite eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation and production of comparable amounts of NO. Our results demonstrate that the presence of eNOS in the cytosol is necessary for PAF-induced hyperpermeability. Our data provide new insights into the dynamics of eNOS and eNOS-derived NO in the process of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2054884646,"Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is an abundant protein that binds fibrinogen and other plasma proteins in a Zn(2+)-dependent fashion but whose function is unclear. HRG has antimicrobial activity, and its incorporation into fibrin clots facilitates bacterial entrapment and killing and promotes inflammation. Although these findings suggest that HRG contributes to innate immunity and inflammation, little is known about the HRG-fibrin(ogen) interaction. By immunoassay, HRG-fibrinogen complexes were detected in Zn(2+)-supplemented human plasma, a finding consistent with a high affinity interaction. Surface plasmon resonance determinations support this concept and show that in the presence of Zn(2+), HRG binds the predominant γ(A)/γ(A)-fibrinogen and the γ-chain elongated isoform, γ(A)/γ'-fibrinogen, with K(d) values of 9 nm. Likewise, (125)I-labeled HRG binds γ(A)/γ(A)- or γ(A)/γ'-fibrin clots with similar K(d) values when Zn(2+) is present. There are multiple HRG binding sites on fibrin(ogen) because HRG binds immobilized fibrinogen fragment D or E and γ'-peptide, an analog of the COOH terminus of the γ'-chain that mediates the high affinity interaction of thrombin with γ(A)/γ'-fibrin. Thrombin competes with HRG for γ'-peptide binding and displaces (125)I-HRG from γ(A)/γ'-fibrin clots and vice versa. Taken together, these data suggest that (a) HRG circulates in complex with fibrinogen and that the complex persists upon fibrin formation, and (b) by competing with thrombin for γ(A)/γ'-fibrin binding, HRG may modulate coagulation. Therefore, the HRG-fibrin interaction may provide a novel link between coagulation, innate immunity, and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2034539016,"DNA polymerase (pol) ε is thought to be the leading strand replicase in eukaryotes, whereas pols λ and β are believed to be mainly involved in re-synthesis steps of DNA repair. DNA elongation by the human pol ε is halted by an abasic site (apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site). In this study, we present in vitro evidence that human pols λ, β, and η can perform translesion synthesis (TLS) of an AP site in the presence of pol ε, likely by initiating the 3'OHs created at the lesion by the arrested pol ε. However, in the case of pols λ and β, this TLS requires the presence of a DNA gap downstream from the product synthesized by the pol ε, and the optimal gap for efficient TLS is different for the two polymerases. The presence of gaps did not affect the TLS capacity of human pol η. Characterization of the reaction products showed that pol β inserted dAMP opposite the AP site, whereas gap filling synthesis by pol λ resulted in single or double deletions opposite the lesion. The synthesis up to the AP site by pol ε and the subsequent TLS by pols λ and β are not influenced by human processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen and human single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A. The bypass capacity of pol λ at the AP site is greatly reduced when a truncated form of the enzyme, which has lost the BRCA1 C-terminal and proline-rich domains, is used. Collectively, our in vitro results support the existence of a mechanism of gap-directed TLS at an AP site involving a switch between the replicative pol ε and the repair pols λ and β."
https://openalex.org/W2052971262,"Modulation of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) by erythropoietin (Epo) is an important signaling pathway controlling erythroid proliferation and differentiation. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPC3 and homologous TRPC6 are expressed on normal human erythroid precursors, but Epo stimulates an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) through TRPC3 but not TRPC6. Here, the role of specific domains in the different responsiveness of TRPC3 and TRPC6 to erythropoietin was explored. TRPC3 and TRPC6 TRP domains differ in seven amino acids. Substitution of five amino acids (DDKPS) in the TRPC3 TRP domain with those of TRPC6 (EERVN) abolished the Epo-stimulated increase in [Ca(2+)](i). Substitution of EERVN in TRPC6 TRP domain with DDKPS in TRPC3 did not confer Epo responsiveness. However, substitution of TRPC6 TRP with DDKPS from TRPC3 TRP, as well as swapping the TRPC6 distal C terminus (C2) with that of TRPC3, resulted in a chimeric TRPC6 channel with Epo responsiveness similar to TRPC3. Substitution of TRPC6 with TRPC3 TRP and the putative TRPC3 C-terminal AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) binding site straddling TRPC3 C1/C2 also resulted in TRPC6 activation. In contrast, substitution of the TRPC3 C-terminal leucine zipper motif or TRPC3 phosphorylation sites Ser-681, Ser-708, or Ser-764 with TRPC6 sequence did not affect TRPC3 Epo responsiveness. TRPC3, but not TRPC6, and TRPC6 chimeras expressing TRPC3 C2 showed significantly increased plasma membrane insertion following Epo stimulation and substantial cytoskeletal association. The TRPC3 TRP domain, distal C terminus (C2), and AMPK binding site are critical elements that confer Epo responsiveness. In particular, the TRPC3 C2 and AMPK site are essential for association of TRPC3 with the cytoskeleton and increased channel translocation to the cell surface in response to Epo stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W2044609070,"The bacterial tmRNA·SmpB system facilitates recycling of stalled translational complexes in a process termed “ribosome rescue.” During ribosome rescue, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmRNA-encoded ssrA peptide, which targets the tagged polypeptide for degradation. Translational pausing also induces a variety of recoding events such as frameshifts, ribosome hops, and stop codon readthrough. To examine the interplay between recoding and ribosome rescue, we determined the various fates of ribosomes that pause during translation termination. We expressed a model protein containing the C-terminal Asp-Pro nascent peptide motif (which interferes with translation termination) and quantified the protein chains produced by recoding and ssrA-peptide tagging. The nature and extent of translational recoding depended upon the codon for the C-terminal Pro residue, with CCU and CCC promoting efficient +1 frameshifting.

Moreover, +1 frameshifting was not suppressed by tmRNA·SmpB activity, suggesting that recoding and ribosome rescue are not competing events. However, cells lacking ribosomal protein L9 (ΔL9) exhibited a significant increase in recoding and a concomitant decrease in ssrA-peptide tagging.

Together, these results indicate that tmRNA·SmpB does not suppress transient ribosome pauses, but responds to prolonged translational arrest. IntroductionRibosomes usually decode mRNAs with high fidelity to ensure accurate protein synthesis. However, some messages contain recoding signals that instruct the ribosome to change translational reading frames (frameshifting) or to read stop codons as sense codons (stop codon readthrough). Translational recoding is exploited to expand the genetic code for the incorporation of selenocysteine at UGA stop codons (1Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 741-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Additionally, the synthesis of some proteins is regulated by programmed recoding. In many bacteria, release factor-2 (RF-2) 2The abbreviations used are: RFrelease factorNi2+-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidtmRNAtransfer-messenger RNAUTRuntranslated region. synthesis requires a +1 frameshift at a premature UGA stop codon (2Craigen W.J. Caskey C.T. Nature. 1986; 322: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because RF-2 itself mediates termination at UGA codons, high levels of the release factor suppress the frameshift, thereby providing a mechanism to autoregulate synthesis (2Craigen W.J. Caskey C.T. Nature. 1986; 322: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A more dramatic recoding event occurs during translation of the gp60 topoisomerase subunit from bacteriophage T4. The T4 gene 60 message contains two open reading frames (ORF) separated by an intervening sequence of 47 nucleotides. Instead of terminating translation at the first stop codon, ribosomes “hop” over the intervening sequence and resume translation after “landing” on the downstream coding sequence (3Herr A.J. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2671-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Frameshifting and ribosome hopping both involve detachment of peptidyl-tRNA from the P-site codon followed by rebinding to a new codon (4Atkins J.F. Björk G.R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 178-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Herr A.J. Nelson C.C. Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1029-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Frameshifting occurs if the new codon overlaps the original P-site codon, whereas ribosome hopping entails translocation/scanning down the mRNA until a suitable landing codon is identified (1Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 741-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Because detachment of the peptidyl-tRNA is kinetically unfavorable, programmed recoding events typically rely on translational pauses to promote alternative decoding.Although ribosome pauses are exploited for recoding, they are also a manifestation of defective protein synthesis. In eubacteria, the tmRNA·SmpB quality control system “rescues” paused ribosomes and targets their nascent polypeptides for degradation. tmRNA is a bi-functional RNA that acts sequentially as tRNA and mRNA during ribosome rescue (6Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). SmpB is a tmRNA-binding protein required for both the delivery of tmRNA to the ribosome, and translation of the ssrA peptide tag (7Jacob Y. Sharkady S.M. Bhardwaj K. Sanda A. Williams K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5503-5509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The tmRNA·SmpB complex binds to the A-site of paused ribosomes by virtue of the tRNA-like domain within tmRNA. After transfer of the nascent chain to tmRNA, the original mRNA is released from the ribosome and translation resumes using a short ORF within tmRNA. Thus, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmRNA-encoded ssrA peptide, which is recognized by a number of proteases (6Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 10Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nature structural biology. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In this manner, tmRNA·SmpB facilitates ribosome recycling and promotes the degradation of truncated proteins. Because translational pausing promotes both recoding and ribosome rescue, it is conceivable that tmRNA·SmpB activity suppresses recoding. Such a function could be beneficial by preventing translational errors and thereby increasing the fidelity of protein synthesis. However, it may also be disadvantageous for tmRNA·SmpB to interfere with programmed translational pauses that regulate protein synthesis.Here, we examine the interplay between tmRNA·SmpB-mediated ribosome rescue and translational recoding. Ribosomes were paused at stop codons using a C-terminal Asp-Pro nascent peptide motif, which interferes with translation termination (11Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol.

Biochemical and mass spectrometry analyses detected ssrA-tagged protein chains, as well as those produced by +1 frameshifting and ribosome hopping. Recoding was dependent upon the coding of the C-terminal Pro residue, with CCC and CCU codons promoting efficient +1 frameshifting. In contrast, the levels of ssrA-peptide tagging were not influenced by the C-terminal Pro codon. Cells lacking ribosomal protein L9 (ΔL9), which is required for frame maintenance during translational pauses (3Herr A.J. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2671-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Atkins J.F. Björk G.R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 178-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Herr A.J. Nelson C.C. Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1029-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), showed increased recoding and decreased ssrA-tagging compared with L9+ cells. Pulse-chase analyses showed that paused ribosomes turned over more rapidly in the ΔL9 background, presumably due to increased recoding during termination. The tmRNA·SmpB system did not suppress frameshifting in any of the examined strains, suggesting that recoding and ribosome rescue are not competing events. Because tmRNA·SmpB is only recruited to ribosomes that are paused on truncated mRNA (14Ivanova N. Pavlov M.Y. Felden B. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it appears that the rate of ribosome rescue is limited by mRNA cleavage or processing. According to this model, recoding occurs more rapidly than the nucleolytic processing required for tmRNA·SmpB activity. Taken together, these observations suggest that protein synthesis can be regulated by transient translational pauses without interference from the tmRNA·SmpB ribosome rescue system.DISCUSSIONThere are at least four general fates for paused ribosomes: (i) RF-mediated termination, (ii) translational recoding, (iii) tmRNA·SmpB-mediated rescue, and (iv) tmRNA-independent ribosome recycling. Translation termination is probably the major pathway because most of the released chains correspond to full-length protein. However, we note that full-length chains could also be released by the recently discovered ArfA peptide, which mediates tmRNA-independent ribosome rescue (33Chadani Y. Ono K. Ozawa S. Takahashi Y. Takai K. Nanamiya H. Tozawa Y. Kutsukake K. Abo T. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 796-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ArfA is normally tagged for degradation by tmRNA·SmpB (36Garza-Sánchez F. Schaub R.E. Janssen B.D. Hayes C.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 80: 1204-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but this alternative ribosome rescue system could significantly contribute to chain release in ΔtmRNA backgrounds. In accord with reports from Isaksson and colleagues (23Björnsson A. Mottagui-Tabar S. Isaksson L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Mottagui-Tabar S. Björnsson A. Isaksson L.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we find that the C-terminal Asp-Pro nascent peptide motif promotes a variety of recoding events including +1 frameshifting, stop codon readthrough and ribosome hopping. The propensity for recoding is well described by the P-site slippage model for frameshifting (26Baranov P.V. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. RNA. 2004; 10: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Näsvall S.J. Nilsson K. Björk G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 385: 350-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This model predicts that recoding frequencies are related to the energy of the new codon-anticodon interactions. Consistent with this model, we find +1 frameshifts occur at a higher frequency with the CCC-coded construct because P-site peptidyl-tRNA2Pro forms cognate base-pairs after advancing into the +1 reading frame. In contrast, +1 frameshifting is not favored during translation of the CCG-coded construct, and instead the paused ribosomes undergo stop codon readthrough and ribosome hopping. Quantification of recoding products indicates that +1 frameshifting during translation of the CCC construct occurs more frequently than readthrough/hopping with the CCG construct. This difference in recoding has no discernable effect on peptidyl-tRNAPro turnover as measured by pulse-chase analysis, presumably because only a small proportion of paused ribosomes undergo recoding.The tmRNA·SmpB quality control system is responsible for recycling stalled ribosomes and therefore could play a role in suppressing unwanted translational recoding events. However, the proportion of protein chains produced by recoding actually increases in tmRNA(DD) cells compared with the ΔtmRNA background. The mechanism underlying this seemingly paradoxical effect is unclear, but may be related to the observation that protein synthesis is more efficient in tmRNA+ cells. The ribosome rescue pathway is probably unable to suppress recoding because tmRNA·SmpB is only recruited to ribosomes arrested on truncated mRNA (6Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 14Ivanova N. Pavlov M.Y. Felden B. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore the 3′-UTR of the ybeL-DP transcript must be cleaved or degraded prior to tmRNA·SmpB activity. Recoding is likely to occur more rapidly than this mRNA processing because we did not detect any protein chains produced by frameshifting on truncated transcripts. Moreover, His6-YbeL-DP chains were ssrA-tagged to the same extent when produced from the CCC- and CCG-coded constructs despite the different recoding frequencies. Together, these observations suggest that ssrA-peptide tagging and recoding are not directly competing processes, and that only a subset of recalcitrant ribosomes is destined for tmRNA·SmpB-mediated ribosome rescue.The C-terminal Asp-Pro sequence is under-represented in the proteome of E. coli and many other eubacteria (11Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). E. coli encodes only one predicted protein with this C-terminal sequence (YabN), but ∼21 proteins are expected based on the frequency of the Asp-Pro dipeptide in E. coli proteins (11Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Boycheva et al. have shown that certain Pro:stop codon combinations are not found in the E. coli genome including CCC:UAG, CCU:UAG and CCA:UAG (38Boycheva S. Chkodrov G. Ivanov I. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 987-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). There also appears to be selection against Pro:Arg codon combinations that include either AGG or AGA rare Arg codons (38Boycheva S. Chkodrov G. Ivanov I. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 987-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Together with a variety of experimental results, these observations suggest that certain codon pairs are underrepresented because they induce translational pauses that induce tmRNA·SmpB activity and/or recoding events (11Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Mottagui-Tabar S. Björnsson A. Isaksson L.A.

However, the CCC:UGA codon pair is not underrepresented in E. coli and has been shown to induce significant +1 frameshifting during the translation of the PheL leader peptide (25Gurvich O.L. Baranov P.V. Zhou J. Hammer A.W. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5941-5950Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ribosome pausing during PheL synthesis regulates transcription of the phe operon through an attenuation mechanism. Although this recoding could conceivably modulate attenuation, Gurvich et al. recently showed that +1 frameshifting has no effect on phe operon expression (40Gurvich O.L. Näsvall S.J. Baranov P.V. Björk G.R. Atkins J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 3079-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Additionally, C-terminal Pro residues can be exploited to regulate gene expression. The E. coli TnaC leader peptide contains a critical C-terminal residue that is required for a programmed ribosome arrest that regulates expression of the tryptophanase (tna) operon through a novel attenuation mechanism (41Gong F. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8997-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 42Gong F. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1974-1983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the 3′-end of tnaC gene contains a CCU:UGA codon pair that supports +1 frameshifting, recoding is not likely to occur at appreciable levels because TnaC-arrested ribosomes have RF-2 bound stably in the A site (41Gong F. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8997-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 43Gong M. Cruz-Vera L.R. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3147-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, although some frameshifting signals are fairly common in E. coli genes, the actual frequency of recoding at these sites tends to be low (25Gurvich O.L. Baranov P.V. Zhou J. Hammer A.W. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5941-5950Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).In accord with work from Atkins, Gesteland, Björk and their co-workers (4Atkins J.F. Björk G.R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 178-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Herbst K.L. Nichols L.M. Gesteland R.F. Weiss R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 12525-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Leipuviene R. Björk G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7024-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we find that ribosomal protein L9 plays a role in reading-frame maintenance during translational arrest. This function was first described by Gesteland & Atkins, who discovered mutations in rplI gene (encoding L9) that modulate the frequency of ribosome hopping during translation of the bacteriophage T4 topoisomerase IV protein. High-resolution crystal structures have revealed the position of L9 on the ribosome (32Lieberman K.R. Firpo M.A. Herr A.J. Nguyenle T. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 44Schuwirth B.S. Borovinskaya M.A. Hau C.W. Zhang W. Vila-Sanjurjo A. Holton J.M. Cate J.H. Science. 2005; 310: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), but the role of L9 in frame maintenance is still uncertain. L9 is a component of the large subunit, which does not make contacts with the mRNA during translation. Moreover, L9 is bound near the E site and extends a domain away from the subunit. One model postulates that L9 influences release of deacylated tRNA from the E site in response to the binding of ternary complex to the A site. Presumably, ribosomes with empty E and A sites have increased mobility on mRNA, allowing them to advance into the unliganded A-site codon. Regardless of mechanism, deletion of L9 enhances +1 frameshifting during inefficient termination to such an extent that tmRNA·SmpB activity is reduced and peptidyl-tRNA turnover is increased. However, loss of L9 has no discernable effect on protein synthesis in the absence of translational pausing. This is consistent with the relatively subtle phenotype of E. coli ΔL9 mutants, which grow slightly more slowly in rich media under laboratory conditions. Moreover, L9 is not present in either eukaryotic or archaeal ribosomes (45Lecompte O. Ripp R. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Poch O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5382-5390Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), suggesting that this mode of reading frame maintenance is not a central function in protein synthesis. Perhaps L9 acts as a fail-safe system that holds the reading frame in response to stress or other untoward conditions. One such stress is amino acid starvation, which is known to slow translation rates and induce ribosome pausing at some codons. IntroductionRibosomes usually decode mRNAs with high fidelity to ensure accurate protein synthesis. However, some messages contain recoding signals that instruct the ribosome to change translational reading frames (frameshifting) or to read stop codons as sense codons (stop codon readthrough). Translational recoding is exploited to expand the genetic code for the incorporation of selenocysteine at UGA stop codons (1Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 741-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Additionally, the synthesis of some proteins is regulated by programmed recoding. In many bacteria, release factor-2 (RF-2) 2The abbreviations used are: RFrelease factorNi2+-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidtmRNAtransfer-messenger RNAUTRuntranslated region. synthesis requires a +1 frameshift at a premature UGA stop codon (2Craigen W.J. Caskey C.T. Nature. 1986; 322: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because RF-2 itself mediates termination at UGA codons, high levels of the release factor suppress the frameshift, thereby providing a mechanism to autoregulate synthesis (2Craigen W.J. Caskey C.T. Nature. 1986; 322: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A more dramatic recoding event occurs during translation of the gp60 topoisomerase subunit from bacteriophage T4. The T4 gene 60 message contains two open reading frames (ORF) separated by an intervening sequence of 47 nucleotides. Instead of terminating translation at the first stop codon, ribosomes “hop” over the intervening sequence and resume translation after “landing” on the downstream coding sequence (3Herr A.J. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2671-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Frameshifting and ribosome hopping both involve detachment of peptidyl-tRNA from the P-site codon followed by rebinding to a new codon (4Atkins J.F. Björk G.R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 178-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Herr A.J. Nelson C.C. Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1029-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Frameshifting occurs if the new codon overlaps the original P-site codon, whereas ribosome hopping entails translocation/scanning down the mRNA until a suitable landing codon is identified (1Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 741-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Because detachment of the peptidyl-tRNA is kinetically unfavorable, programmed recoding events typically rely on translational pauses to promote alternative decoding.Although ribosome pauses are exploited for recoding, they are also a manifestation of defective protein synthesis. In eubacteria, the tmRNA·SmpB quality control system “rescues” paused ribosomes and targets their nascent polypeptides for degradation. tmRNA is a bi-functional RNA that acts sequentially as tRNA and mRNA during ribosome rescue (6Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). SmpB is a tmRNA-binding protein required for both the delivery of tmRNA to the ribosome, and translation of the ssrA peptide tag (7Jacob Y. Sharkady S.M. Bhardwaj K. Sanda A. Williams K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5503-5509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 9Sundermeier T.R. Dulebohn D.P. Cho H.J. Karzai A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The tmRNA·SmpB complex binds to the A-site of paused ribosomes by virtue of the tRNA-like domain within tmRNA. After transfer of the nascent chain to tmRNA, the original mRNA is released from the ribosome and translation resumes using a short ORF within tmRNA. Thus, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmRNA-encoded ssrA peptide, which is recognized by a number of proteases (6Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 10Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nature structural biology. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In this manner, tmRNA·SmpB facilitates ribosome recycling and promotes the degradation of truncated proteins. Because translational pausing promotes both recoding and ribosome rescue, it is conceivable that tmRNA·SmpB activity suppresses recoding. Such a function could be beneficial by preventing translational errors and thereby increasing the fidelity of protein synthesis. However, it may also be disadvantageous for tmRNA·SmpB to interfere with programmed translational pauses that regulate protein synthesis.Here, we examine the interplay between tmRNA·SmpB-mediated ribosome rescue and translational recoding. Ribosomes were paused at stop codons using a C-terminal Asp-Pro nascent peptide motif, which interferes with translation termination (11Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol.

Biochemical and mass spectrometry analyses detected ssrA-tagged protein chains, as well as those produced by +1 frameshifting and ribosome hopping. Recoding was dependent upon the coding of the C-terminal Pro residue, with CCC and CCU codons promoting efficient +1 frameshifting. In contrast, the levels of ssrA-peptide tagging were not influenced by the C-terminal Pro codon. Cells lacking ribosomal protein L9 (ΔL9), which is required for frame maintenance during translational pauses (3Herr A.J. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2671-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Atkins J.F. Björk G.R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 178-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Herr A.J. Nelson C.C. Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1029-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), showed increased recoding and decreased ssrA-tagging compared with L9+ cells. Pulse-chase analyses showed that paused ribosomes turned over more rapidly in the ΔL9 background, presumably due to increased recoding during termination. The tmRNA·SmpB system did not suppress frameshifting in any of the examined strains, suggesting that recoding and ribosome rescue are not competing events. Because tmRNA·SmpB is only recruited to ribosomes that are paused on truncated mRNA (14Ivanova N. Pavlov M.Y. Felden B. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it appears that the rate of ribosome rescue is limited by mRNA cleavage or processing. According to this model, recoding occurs more rapidly than the nucleolytic processing required for tmRNA·SmpB activity. Taken together, these observations suggest that protein synthesis can be regulated by transient translational pauses without interference from the tmRNA·SmpB ribosome rescue system. Ribosomes usually decode mRNAs with high fidelity to ensure accurate protein synthesis. However, some messages contain recoding signals that instruct the ribosome to change translational reading frames (frameshifting) or to read stop codons as sense codons (stop codon readthrough).

Mitochondria synthesize ATP by oxidative phosphorylation in response to cellular ATP demand, thereby maintaining the cytosolic phosphorylation potential to drive a variety of processes coupled to ATP hydrolysis. One of the central questions in cardiac physiology is the nature of the mitochondrial response to changes in cellular ATP demand, i.e. whether feedback from products of ATP hydrolysis is sufficient to explain observed phenomena in cardiac phosphoenergetics at various levels of work (1Beard D.A. Kushmerick M.J. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000459Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). On the basis of the apparent stability of creatine phosphate/ATP and Pi over a wide range of workloads, Balaban et al. (2Balaban R.S. Kantor H.L. Katz L.A. Briggs R.W.

Physiol. 1989; 256: H265-H274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) postulated that this apparent stability is due to a “positive feedback” mechanism enabling mitochondrial response to match the demand. More properly, such a mechanism would be an example of open-loop control, where parallel Ca2+-dependent pathways would stimulate ATP utilization and synthesis. Cytosolic free Ca2+, which is a signal coupling cardiac electrical excitation to mechanical contraction, thereby increasing ATP demand, was identified as a putative open-loop controller activating mitochondrial matrix dehydrogenases and F1F0-ATPase in studies on isolated mitochondria utilizing glutamate/malate (4Territo P.R.

In this study, we measured the respiration and redox responses of mitochondria to extramitochondrial free Ca2+ when utilizing the physiological substrates pyruvate and malate at saturating, physiological, and subphysiological concentrations at physiological temperature and free magnesium (Mg2+) concentration. We tested the hypothesis that an increase in Ca2+ concentration could support higher respiration without a reduction in NAD(P)H concentration over the physiological range for respiration rates or a higher NAD(P)H concentration at a given respiration rate. Previous studies (4Territo P.R. Mootha V.K. French S.A. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C423-C435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mildaziene V. Baniene R. Nauciene Z.

The major point of this study was to examine the effect of calcium on mitochondrial respiration and NAD(P)H using pyruvate, which is the product of glycolysis entering the terminal oxidative pathway in mitochondria. Neither the respiration and NAD(P)H production rates nor the observed redox levels showed any apparent stimulatory effect of external Ca2+ over an average concentration range observed in isolated trabeculae and cells at physiological temperature and stimulation frequencies (7Dibb K.M. Eisner D.A. Trafford A.W. J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Ward M.L. Pope A.J. Loiselle D.S. Cannell M.B. J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 537-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Over a range of substrate concentration and at high initial Pi, only a 22–27% stimulatory effect on maximal State 3 respiration (which is never attained in vivo) was observed without a significant change in the corresponding NAD(P)H fraction. Mitochondria were isolated from the hearts of 12–14-week-old Dahl/SS rats using protocols that were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. After the animal was in the deep plane of anesthesia, the ventricles of the heart were excised and immediately placed in ice-cold isolation buffer containing 200 mm mannitol, 50 mm sucrose, 5 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% BSA. The ventricles were minced, added to 2.5 ml of a solution of 5 units/ml protease (Bacillus licheniformis), and homogenized for 1 min in a cold room. Isolation buffer was added to the homogenate to a final volume of 25 ml and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min to remove the protease. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer to 25 ml and centrifuged at 700 × g. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 700 × g. The pellet from the previous step was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 8000 × g. The pellet, which contained the mitochondrial fraction, was resuspended in 0.5 ml of isolation buffer, and the protein concentration was quantified in terms of an equivalent BSA concentration using the Bio-Rad Quick Start Bradford assay kit (9Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). The functional integrity of the mitochondria was determined by means of respiratory control indices defined as the ratio of State 3 to State 4 respiration upon addition of ADP at a final concentration of 375 μm at 37 °C. Respiration measurements at saturating substrate concentrations were performed using a Clark-type electrode (Mitocell S200, Strathkelvin Instruments Ltd.) with mitochondria suspended at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in pH 7.2 buffer containing 130 mm KCl, 2.5 mm K2HPO4, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% BSA. Mitochondrial preparations with respiratory control indices >6 with 10 mm sodium pyruvate and 10 mm potassium malate as substrates were considered to be of acceptable quality for our experiments. Mitochondrial respiration was also measured in the presence of 1 mm free Mg2+. State 4 respiration was much higher in the presence of Mg2+ due to ADP generation from extramitochondrial ATPases hydrolyzing MgATP, similar to the observations of Bishop and Atkinson (10Bishop P.D. Atkinson D.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Respiration measurements at limiting substrate concentrations were made using a high resolution respirometer (Oxygraph 2k, Oroboros Instruments GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria). NAD(P)H fluorescence was recorded at 470 nm with excitation at 350 nm and a 12-nm bandwidth in a multimode plate reader equipped with reagent dispensers (Varioskan Flash, Thermo Scientific) with the samples placed in 24-well microplate wells with thermal incubation to maintain the sample temperature at 37 °C. The maintenance of sample temperature at 37 °C during the course of an experiment, from the introduction of the sample into the plate reader until the end of the experiment, was verified by testing our protocol in a 24-well microplate custom-instrumented with a microthermistor (10 kiloohms QTUT-14C3, Quality Thermistor, Inc). Substrates and ADP were dispensed in the microplate wells using the automated reagent dispensers. At the start of a fluorescence time course recording, mitochondria were suspended in a microplate well in 1 ml of preheated experimental buffer to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml protein. NAD(P)H fluorescence was recorded every 3.5 s, and the samples were kept well mixed by 600 shakes/min (orbital shaking) between successive readings. A time course recording consisted of the following events: 1) 0 s, introduction of the sample into the plate reader and start of recording; 2) 70 s, addition of substrate; 3) 164.5 s, addition of ADP; 4) 514.5 s, addition of rotenone or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; and 5) 654.5 s, end of recording. Substrates were added as 10-μl aliquots of stock solutions to the 1-ml mitochondrial suspension to reach the desired final concentrations. ADP was added as a 15-μl addition of a 25 mm stock solution (375 μm final concentration) when saturating substrate concentrations were used or as a 7-μl addition of the same stock solution (175 μm final concentration) when limiting substrate concentrations were used. The saturating concentration for pyruvate/malate was 10 mm for both components, and the limiting concentrations were 0.1 mm pyruvate and 0.25 mm malate. The saturating concentration for 2-oxoglutarate was 5 mm, and the limiting concentration was 0.5 mm with 1 mm malate. The recorded time courses of NAD(P)H fluorescence were normalized with respect to maximally reduced (obtained after rotenone addition) and oxidized (obtained after carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone addition) states to express them on a percentage scale of NAD(P) reduction. [Ca2+]e was controlled by using appropriate amounts of total added Ca2+, calculated by solving multiple cation equilibrium equations based on temperature-corrected dissociation constants from Tsien and Pozzan (11Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) for the given amount of EGTA and other components in the experimental buffer. The correspondence between total added Ca2+ and Ca2+e is given by 0 μm to 0 nm, 300 μm to 50 nm, 450 μm to 100 nm, 630 μm to 200 nm, and 750 μm to 350 nm. The calculated [Ca2+]e values are subject to <5% uncertainty due to a 1% uncertainty in the stability constants or 0.01 pH unit uncertainty in the measured pH. The [Ca2+]e range was designed to include a nominally zero level of Ca2+, the typical Ca2+ level in a resting myocyte (100 nm), and the Ca2+ level averaged over a beat (350 nm) in a myocyte stimulated at heart rates achievable in the intact animal (7Dibb K.M. Eisner D.A. Trafford A.W. J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Ward M.L. Pope A.J. Loiselle D.S. Cannell M.B. J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 537-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The measurements of Dibb et al. (7Dibb K.M. Eisner D.A. Trafford A.W. J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) showed an average Ca2+ concentration of 361.5 nm at 6 Hz in isolated myocytes (control group), and those of Ward et al. (8Ward M.L. Pope A.J. Loiselle D.S. Cannell M.B. J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 537-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showed an average Ca2+ concentration of 300 nm at 5 Hz in isolated trabeculae. Experiments were also performed at [Ca2+]e > 750 nm with limiting pyruvate/malate. Fig. 1 shows a typical normalized NAD(P)H fluorescence transient obtained during the course of the experiment described above with 2.5 mm initial Pi. The normalization converts the fluorescence recording into fraction of NAD(P)H in the total NAD(P) + NAD(P)H pool based on a linear scaling between the fully reduced end point obtained by addition of the Complex I blocker rotenone and a fully oxidized end point obtained by addition of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. The increase of the NAD(P)H fraction after addition of substrate was fitted to an exponential function, N2 + (N1 − N2)exp(−k2t2), where N1 is the initial normalized fluorescence at the beginning of State 2, N2 is the normalized fluorescence toward the end of State 2, k2 is the rate constant of reduction of NAD(P) into NAD(P)H (which is a measure of the flux through the TCA cycle dehydrogenases generating NAD(P)H)), and t2 is the time during the State 2 segment. Note that our definition of State 2, as an approximate steady state in respiration rate and NAD(P)H level attained after addition of substrate in the presence of Pi to the buffer, differs from that of Chance and Williams (12Chance B. Williams G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 409-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard deviations of N2 and k2 were estimated using a local sensitivity-based method described by Landaw and DiStefano (13Landaw E.M. DiStefano 3rd, J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R665-R677PubMed Google Scholar). The maximally oxidized state N3 following ADP addition was recorded as the minimal normalized NAD(P)H fluorescence value during State 3. The normalized State 4 NAD(P)H fluorescence N4 was calculated by averaging 10 normalized fluorescence readings at the end of the State 4 recording. In the presence of 1 mm Mg2+, N4 attained a value between N2 and N3 due to the presence of the magnesium-dependent ATP hydrolysis reaction. When Mg2+ was not added to the buffer, N4 recovered to the N2 value, and the State 4 respiration rate equaled the State 2 rate (data not shown). Thus, with 1 mm Mg2+, the observed State 4 represents a mitochondrial ATP synthesis rate roughly halfway between the minimal and maximal in vivo rates. Mitochondrial respiration and NAD(P)H fluorescence were measured at 0, 50, 100, 200, and 350 nm Ca2+e and 1 mm free Mg2+ buffered by EGTA under State 2 conditions (after addition of 10 mm pyruvate/malate), under State 3 conditions (the maximally stimulated respiration reached upon addition of 375 μm ADP); and under State 4 conditions (the steady-state respiration achieved after State 3 due the presence of ATPases catalyzing the hydrolysis of MgATP) (10Bishop P.D. Atkinson D.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These measurements were conducted at two initial buffer Pi concentrations: 0.5 mm (near the resting physiological level) and 2.5 mm (near the maximal level, which may be attained at very high workloads) (14Wu F. Zhang E.Y. Zhang J. Bache R.J. Beard D.A. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 4193-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The physiologically achievable myocardial oxygen consumption rate range of 73–305 μl/min/g (wet weight) (15Tune J.D. Richmond K.N. Gorman M.W. Olsson R.A. Feigl E.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H74-H84PubMed Google Scholar) corresponds to a mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate range of 0.0613–0.2559 μmol/min/mg of mitochondrial protein calculated by using data on myocardial composition and water spaces from Vinnakota and Bassingthwaighte (16Vinnakota K.C. Bassingthwaighte J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H1742-H1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 (A and B) shows the relationship between [Ca2+]e and State 2, 3, and 4 respiration rates at 2.5 and 0.5 mm initial buffer Pi, respectively. The shaded boxes represent the physiological extent of average free Ca2+ and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates. At high initial buffer Pi (Fig. 2A), there was no significant effect of [Ca2+]e on State 2 and 4 respiration rates. State 3 respiration rates showed a slight increase with [Ca2+]e over the physiological Ca2+ range. However, the State 3 respiration rate exceeded the maximal in vivo rate by 20%. The State 4 respiration rate in the presence of Mg2+ most closely represented a physiological state. In Fig. 2 (A (high Pi) and B (near resting Pi)), there was no apparent influence of [Ca2+]e on State 4 respiration rates. State 3 respiration rates at low Pi may not be compared with the upper limit of the physiological respiration rate because the upper limit of the physiological respiration rate is reached under high workloads and is attained at Pi levels that are higher than the resting Pi level (14Wu F. Zhang E.Y. Zhang J. Bache R.J. Beard D.A. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 4193-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 (A and B) shows normalized NAD(P)H levels (N2, N3, and N4), defined under “Materials and Methods,” plotted as functions of [Ca2+]e at 2.5 and 0.5 mm initial buffer Pi, respectively. Linear fits to these data yield estimated slopes that were not different from zero (except for N4 in Fig. 3B) as inferred from the t test at a 95% significance level. The rate constant of NAD(P)H generation (k2) is a measure of the dehydrogenase (NAD(P)H-generating) flux. The estimated percent coefficients of variation of k2 were >100%, i.e. no statistically significant effects of [Ca2+]e on this parameter could be inferred. N2, N3, and N4 are plotted against their corresponding State 2, 3, and 4 respiration rates at high initial Pi at 100 nm (open symbols) and 350 nm (closed symbols) Ca2+e in Fig. 4A. If Ca2+ stimulation of mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes drives the mitochondrial response to [Ca2+]e, then for a given NAD(P)H level rate, an increase in [Ca2+]e should result in a higher respiration rate. The data in Fig. 4A do not support this hypothesis except at State 3 respiration rates outside of the physiological oxygen consumption rates. Fig. 4B shows the same variables plotted at low initial Pi. Here, all of the measured respiration rates were within the physiological range. Only State 3 rates demonstrated a slight effect in maintaining the same NAD(P)H level with the observed increase in respiration rate upon increasing [Ca2+]e from 100 to 350 nm. However, high ADP concentrations do not occur at resting Pi levels in vivo. The effects of Ca2+ on respiration rates and NAD(P) reduction could depend on substrate concentrations as shown for 2-oxoglutarate (6Mildaziene V. Baniene R. Nauciene Z. Marcinkeviciute A.

Therefore, we examined the effect of [Ca2+]e on respiration and NAD(P) reduction at limiting pyruvate and malate concentrations. The initial pyruvate and malate concentrations used were equivalent to the total tissue content of those metabolites measured in a glucose-perfused heart (20Okere I.C. McElfresh T.A.

Physiol. 2004; 286: H1742-H1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the time courses of normalized NAD(P)H fluorescence and respiration under limiting substrate conditions at 2.5 mm initial buffer Pi at 350 nm Ca2+e. The concentration of ADP added to induce State 3 was reduced to 175 μm to permit the formation of State 4 before the substrate became severely limiting, resulting in NAD(P)H oxidation. The plot of the NAD(P) reduction fraction versus respiratory rate in Fig. 6A shows a 22% stimulatory effect of [Ca2+]e on State 3 respiration at a constant NAD(P)H level. Fig. 6 (B and C) shows State 2-3-4 respiratory rates and redox levels plotted as functions of [Ca2+]e. The data show an apparent stimulatory effect of Ca2+ on State 3 and 4 respiration rates from 0 to 100 nm Ca2+e and no effects on NAD(P)H fractions. Extending the range of [Ca2+]e to >750 nm increased the stimulatory effect on both State 3 respiration and the NAD(P)H fraction N3 to 35%, with no apparent stimulatory effects on State 4 compared with the observations at 100 nm Ca2+e (data not shown). Although the initial concentrations of pyruvate and malate used here represent approximate physiological levels, other carbon substrates were not added. In addition, a significant fraction of pyruvate and malate was consumed before State 3 was reached in these experiments. Thus, the modest Ca2+-induced stimulation was observed under conditions of subphysiological substrate concentrations.FIGURE 6Ca2+ effect on State 2, 3, and 4 respiration and normalized NAD(P)H levels at subsaturating pyruvate/malate concentrations and 2.5 mm initial Pi.

However, the Pi range in those experiments was high at 2–25 mm compared with the physiological range of 0.29–2.3 mm (14Wu F. Zhang E.Y. Zhang J. Bache R.J. Beard D.A. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 4193-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mootha et al. (21Mootha V.K. Arai A.E. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H769-H775PubMed Google Scholar) reported maximal mitochondrial respiration rates measured as a function of ADP at a saturating level of Pi and as a function of Pi at a saturating level of ADP in pig and dog heart mitochondria utilizing glutamate/malate as substrate. Both sets of measurements show the highest sensitivity of the State 3 respiration rate to ADP or Pi in the physiological range of concentrations of those metabolites. Similar to the observations of Mootha et al. (21Mootha V.K. Arai A.E. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H769-H775PubMed Google Scholar) that the physiological maximal mitochondrial rate is 80–90% of the State 3 oxygen consumption rate in their mitochondrial preparation, we found that, at 100 nm or base-line Ca2+e, the maximal physiological oxygen consumption rate was 78.2% (21.8% gap) of the State 3 respiration rate at 2.5 mm initial buffer Pi. We found that the gap between the physiological maximal mitochondrial consumption and the State 3 respiration rate was increased to 32.7% of the State 3 respiration rate at 350 nm Ca2+e. This increase corresponds to an 11% increase in respiration rate over the 100–350 nm Ca2+e range. Over a 0–350 nm Ca2+ range, the State 3 respiration rate increased by 19%, which is similar to the observations of Mildaziene et al. (6Mildaziene V. Baniene R. Nauciene Z. Marcinkeviciute A. Morkuniene R. Borutaite V. Kholodenko B. Brown G.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using rat heart mitochondria respiring on 2-oxoglutarate. Mildaziene et al. reported the Ca2+ stimulation of respiration and phosphorylation fluxes by examining the relationship between membrane potential and respiratory rate during oligomycin and rotenone titrations with and without Ca2+. The highest effect on the respiratory subsystem was reported during State 3, but no data were presented for the oligomycin titration experiment that would have shown the Ca2+ effects on the respiratory subsystem during State 3.5 in their study, which corresponds to State 4 in our study. We tested the hypothesis that Ca2+ could stimulate 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and thereby help support higher respiration rates at a given NAD(P)H level (18Wan B. LaNoue K.F. Cheung J.Y. Scaduto Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13430-13439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by recording respiration rates and NAD(P)H fluorescence in mitochondria respiring on 5 mm 2-oxoglutarate at 0, 100, and 350 nm Ca2+e at 2.5 mm initial buffer Pi. The results plotted in Fig. 7 (A (respiration) and B (redox versus respiration)) show that respiration was stimulated from 0 to 100 nm Ca2+e and thereafter seemed to remain constant. The normalized NAD(P)H versus respiration rate plot shows that there is no noticeable difference between low Ca2+ (open symbols) and high Ca2+ (closed symbols) data. The effect of Ca2+ on the respiration and redox responses of cardiac mitochondria has been found to be dependent on the substrates used, the species of the animal, and the experiment temperature (5Baniene R. Nauciene Z. Maslauskaite S. Baliutyte G. Mildaziene V. Systems Biol. 2006; 153: 350-353Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 6Mildaziene V. Baniene R. Nauciene Z. Marcinkeviciute A. Morkuniene R.

The cited studies reported that the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ on State 3 mitochondrial respiration with pyruvate/malate was between 20 and 30%; therefore, subsaturating 2-oxoglutarate or saturating glutamate and malate were used as substrates to demonstrate Ca2+ stimulation of mitochondrial State 3 respiration. We found that 2-oxoglutarate achieved an overall increase in State 3 respiration rate similar to pyruvate/malate at saturating substrate concentrations (Fig. 7A), and substantial stimulation was observed at a subsaturating substrate concentration (Fig. 7C), as shown in previous studies (6Mildaziene V. Baniene R. Nauciene Z. Marcinkeviciute A. Morkuniene R. Borutaite V. Kholodenko B. Brown G.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Hansford R.G. Castro F.

The normalized NAD(P)H versus respiration rate plotted in Fig. 7B has a slope that is lower compared with the data in Fig. 3 (A and B) for mitochondria utilizing saturating pyruvate/malate, with no apparent Ca2+ stimulation in the physiological regime. At subsaturating 2-oxoglutarate concentrations, a 50% Ca2+ stimulation effect was seen in both respiration and redox levels in States 3 and 4 with [Ca2+]e increasing from 100 to 350 nm (Fig. 7D) (100% stimulation from 0 to 350 nm Ca2+e). These data show that the range of [Ca2+]e spanned in our study stimulates α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase by 100%. However, note that the redox levels and respiration rates with limiting 2-oxoglutarate/malate are much lower than those obtained with limiting pyruvate/malate. Calcium is known to be a modulator of TCA cycle enzyme kinetic fluxes as shown in part by Wan et al. (18Wan B. LaNoue K.F. Cheung J.Y. Scaduto Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13430-13439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Scaduto (22Scaduto Jr., R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Indeed, as has been observed previously, our observations reveal that, with subsaturating 2-oxoglutarate as the substrate, both respiration and NAD(P)H levels are significantly stimulated. This significant effect suggests a potential role of Ca2+ in controlling TCA cycle intermediate concentrations. The main finding of this study is that calcium stimulation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases cannot provide adequate stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to serve as a primary open-loop control mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation in vivo in the heart. A limitation of this study is the measurement of mitochondrial responses to fixed buffer Ca2+ concentrations, whereas the mitochondrion in the cell experiences transient Ca2+ levels, which might influence mitochondrial Ca2+ influx in a manner different from influx with fixed [Ca2+]e. Additionally, Baniene et al. (5Baniene R. Nauciene Z. Maslauskaite S. Baliutyte G. Mildaziene V. Systems Biol. 2006; 153: 350-353Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) showed that the cardiac mitochondrial respiratory response in the rat has a low calcium sensitivity with succinate as a substrate compared with rabbit and guinea pig. Similarly, the low Ca2+ sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration and NAD(P)H fraction with pyruvate/malate observed in our study could potentially be species-specific. Baniene et al. also observed that the Ca2+ sensitivity of rat heart mitochondrial respiration decreased with an increase in temperature from 28 to 37 °C, which underlines the importance of maintaining the temperature in the in vitro mitochondrial preparation close to 37 °C. In summary, in the physiological Ca2+ range, mitochondrial respiration is only modestly stimulated in State 3, at a supraphysiological ADP concentration and respiration rate. In the physiological regime, there is no apparently significant Ca2+ stimulation effect. The 22–27% stimulatory effect on State 3 respiration observed when [Ca2+]e was increased from 100 to 350 nm with both saturating and limiting substrate concentrations is not nearly enough to account for the ∼400% difference between resting and exercising respiration rates in cardiac mitochondria in vivo in terms of relative changes. Thus, the apparent direct Ca2+ stimulation of rat heart mitochondrial respiration and NAD(P)H synthesis that can be demonstrated in vitro cannot explain the full extent of in vivo regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in the heart. Our observations do not preclude potentially important effects of calcium on TCA cycle kinetics and intermediate concentrations as shown by Wan et al. (18Wan B. LaNoue K.F. Cheung J.Y. Scaduto Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13430-13439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Scaduto (22Scaduto Jr., R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally, the alternative hypothesis that feedback through products of ATP hydrolysis (particularly inorganic phosphate) is the primary control mechanism remains the much more feasible hypothesis (10Bishop P.D.

The crystal structure of the protein indicates that subunit I consists of a low-spin heme b and a high-spin heme a3-CuB binuclear center where the dioxygen and nitric oxide reactions take place (1Soulimane T.

Two proton pathways have been identified in ba3 oxidase and correspond to the putative so-called K and D pathways found in Paracoccus denitrificans and bovine oxidase despite the fact that most of the residues belonging to these pathways are not conserved (1Soulimane T.

Glu-278 (residue of P. denitrificans), which is highly conserved in heme-copper oxidases and is involved in redox-induced proton transfer reactions, is replaced by Ile in ba3 oxidase (1Soulimane T.

The highly conserved, covalently ring-linked His-Tyr species that has been determined by the crystal structures of bovine, P. denitrificans, and Thermus thermophilus heme-copper oxidases and by protein chemical analysis is a unique peptide (1Soulimane T.

It is located in the immediate vicinity of the binuclear center, within hydrogen-bonding distance of heme a3-ligated O2, and is capable of modulating the redox potential and the pKa of Tyr-O-His as occurs for the redox-active, covalently cross-linked tyrosine residue in galactose oxidase (8Klinman J.P. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2541-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). On the basis of the crystal structure of the bovine enzyme, Yoshikawa et al. (6Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T.

Recently, the reaction of ba3 oxidase with O2 was investigated by time-resolved optical spectroscopy, and the results indicated the formation of oxygenated intermediate species (9Smirnova I.A. Zaslavsky D. Fee J.A. Gennis R.B. Brzezinski P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2008; 40: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of the ba3 oxidase are expected to be similar to those of other distantly related heme-copper oxidases with respect to the oxygen chemistry and the oxygenation of CO to form the 607 nm P intermediate ferryl-oxo species (6Yoshikawa S.

Physiol. 1932; 102: 379-392Crossref Google Scholar). Mammalian cytochrome c oxidase was demonstrated to catalyze the monooxygenation of CO to CO2 when reductively activated in the presence of oxygen (13Young L.J. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the O2 cycle of oxidases, it has been suggested that the O–O bond cleavage proceeds by concerted hydrogen atom transfer from the cross-linked His-Tyr species to produce the Fe(IV)=O/Cu(II)B-H-Y· species (14Proshlyakov D.A. Pressler M.A. Babcock G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8020-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This raises important issues as to the means by which the electron transfer to these transient species is regulated for conformational transitions that are required for any pumping mechanism to occur (6Yoshikawa S.

In the oxidase/peroxide reaction at high pH, it has been demonstrated that the addition of stoichiometric amounts of H2O2 to oxidized enzyme leads to the formation of the 607 nm form having the proposed Fe(IV)=O … HO-Cu(II)B-His-Tyr• structure (15Michel H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15129-15140Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Furthermore, single protonation of the former species results in the formation of the 580 nm form with a proposed Fe(IV)=O Cu(II)B-His-Tyr• structure (15Michel H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15129-15140Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, no definite spectroscopic evidence has yet been observed for the formation of Tyr• in the binuclear center of heme-copper oxidases. It has been suggested that the additional electron needed to produce the 607 nm P (Fe(IV)=O) species is provided by Tyr-167 or Trp-272 (P. denitrificans sequence), which are near the binuclear heme Fe-CuB center and highly conserved in heme-copper oxidases (Tyr-136 and Trp-229 in T. thermophilus) (16Budiman K.

Determining the properties of the residue(s) responsible for the formation of the 607 nm P (Fe(IV)=O) species will resolve controversial aspects of the oxygen activation and O–O cleavage mechanisms. FTIR spectroscopy has proven to be a very powerful technique in studying changes at the level of individual amino acids during protein action (18Hellwig P. Pfitzner U. Behr J. Rost B. Pesavento R.P.

FTIR studies of a His-Tyr-OH model compound, 2-imidazol-1-yl-4-methylphenol, have demonstrated that the ν7a(CO) and δ(COH) modes in the deprotonated form of His-Tyr-O− shift from 1268 cm−1 (protonated) to 1301 cm−1 (18Hellwig P. Pfitzner U. Behr J. Rost B. Pesavento R.P. Donk W.V. Gennis R.B. Michel H. Ludwig B. Mäntele W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9116-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, the oxidized-minus-reduced FTIR spectra of aa3 oxidase from P. denitrificans showed signals at 1270 cm−1 that were attributed to ν7a(CO) and δ(COH) of a protonated tyrosine (18Hellwig P. Pfitzner U. Behr J. Rost B. Pesavento R.P. Donk W.V. Gennis R.B. Michel H. Ludwig B. Mäntele W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9116-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The observed reduced intensity of these signals in the Y280H mutant allowed Hellwig et al. (18Hellwig P. Pfitzner U. Behr J. Rost B. Pesavento R.P. Donk W.V. Gennis R.B. Michel H. Ludwig B.

With the purpose of identifying His-Tyr-OH modes in cytochrome bo3 oxidase, Woodruff and co-workers (19Tomson F. Bailey J.A. Gennis R.B. Unkefer C.J. Li Z. Silks L.A. Martinez R.A. Donohoe R.J.

They detected the fundamental His Nϵ-Cϵ Tyr mode and its combination at 1549 and 3033 cm−1, respectively (19Tomson F. Bailey J.A. Gennis R.B. Unkefer C.J. Li Z. Silks L.A. Martinez R.A. Donohoe R.J.

In addition to the dioxygen activation and reduction and the oxygenation of CO mechanisms, it is crucial to determine the intermediate protein structures subsequent to ligand binding/release and discrimination (20Luna V.M.

In addition, the ligand delivery channel at the CuB site and the presence of a docking site near the heme a3 propionates were identified (21Koutsoupakis C. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Am. Chem.

Cytochrome ba3 has preexisting cavities that are only modestly perturbed by the photodissociated CO from heme a3, and previous work revealed such a docking site that is responsible for the kinetic control of both ligand motion/binding and escape (21Koutsoupakis C. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14728-14732Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Those results, in conjunction with the reported protonic connectivity between the propionates of heme a3, Asp-372, and H2O, led to the identification of a proton exit channel (22Koutsoupakis C. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2438-2444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A pathway connecting the docking and binding sites was presented to explain how this pathway may lead to the escape of translocated protons and catalytically formed H2O molecules. Of note, both protonated and deprotonated forms of the ring A of heme a3 were detected in the TRS2-FTIR data (22Koutsoupakis C. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2438-2444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). time-resolved step-scan FTIR mixed-valence CO-bound 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. The identification of ionizable groups whose pKa values are near physiological pH is extremely useful because the conformational transition that is associated with such protonation/deprotonation events is crucial in our understanding of the proton motion in heme-copper oxidases. TRS2-FTIR spectroscopy has been applied to the carbonmonoxy derivatives of heme-copper oxidases to probe the protein dynamics subsequent to CO photolysis (22Koutsoupakis C. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2438-2444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The TRS2-FTIR spectra are the result of the perturbation induced by the photodissociation of CO from the heme iron and its subsequent binding to CuB to structures near heme iron and CuB. In the work presented here, we continued our TRS2-FTIR approach with heme-copper oxidases at room temperature, and in conjunction with the assignment of ν7a(CO) and δ(COH) in the aa3-type oxidase from P. denitrificans, we detected the protonated and deprotonated forms of tyrosine residue(s) near the induced perturbation, i.e. the heme a3-CuB binuclear center of cytochrome ba3 from T. thermophilus (4Koutsoupakis K.

Our TRS2-FTIR difference spectra show that ν7a(CO) and δ(COH) in the protonated form of Tyr are located at 1247 cm−1 and in the deprotonated form at 1301 cm−1. By monitoring the intensity changes of the 1247 and 1301 cm−1 modes as a function of pH, we measured a pKa of 7.8 for the observed Tyr residue. On the basis of the tentative assignments of the 1247 and 1301 cm−1 modes, the data indicate that Tyr-133 and/or Tyr-136 (both of which are located near the binuclear center) serves as a proton gating/transfer ionizable group. Mixed-valence ba3 oxidase is a two-electron reduced form of the enzyme (heme a32+-CuB1+) that carries out O2 reduction only to the controversial peroxy oxidation level. Upon direct mixing of O2 with the mixed-valence CO-bound enzyme (MV-CO) under alkaline and acidic conditions, the ∼607 nm P (Fe(IV)=O) species is formed. This intermediate is linked to the proton pump function of heme-copper oxidases (6Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T.

Our data obtained under both acidic and alkaline conditions do not favor the cross-linked Tyr-237 residue (whose protonation state is not altered between pH/pD 5.5 and 9.7), as the residue associated with the FTIR spectral changes, but other tyrosine residues with labile protons. We postulate that Tyr-133 and/or Tyr-136 (both of which are the only Tyr residues with labile protons near the vicinity of the heme Fe-CuB binuclear center) plays a role in either the dioxygen chemistry or proton gating during the enzymatic reactions. Cytochrome ba3 was isolated from T. thermophilus HB8 cells according to previously published procedures (2Buse G. Soulimane T. Dewor M. Meyer H.E. Blüggel M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The samples used for the FTIR measurements had an enzyme concentration of ∼1 mm and were placed in the desired buffer (pH 5.5–6.5, MES; pH 7.5, HEPES; or pH 8.5–9.5, CHES). Dithionite-reduced samples were exposed to 1 atm CO (1 mm) in an anaerobic cell to prepare the carbonmonoxy adduct and transferred to a tightly sealed FTIR cell under anaerobic conditions (l = 15 μm). CO gas was obtained from Messer. The 532-nm pulse from a Continuum Nd:YAG laser (7-ns width, 3 Hz) was used as a pump light (4 mJ/pulse) to photolyze the ba3-CO oxidase. FTIR measurements were performed on a Bruker Equinox IFS 55 spectrometer equipped with the step-scan option. For the time-resolved experiments, a TTL (transistor-transistor logic) pulse provided by a digital delay pulse generator (Quantum Composers 9314T) triggers, in order, the flashlamps, Q-switch, and FTIR spectrometer. Pretriggering the FTIR spectrometer to begin data collection before the laser fires allows 11 fixed reference points to be collected at each mirror position, which are used as the reference spectrum in the calculation of the difference spectra. Changes in intensity were recorded with an MCT (mercury-cadmium-telluride) detector (Graseby Infra-Red D316, response limit of 600 cm−1) amplified in the DC-coupled mode and digitized with a 200-kHz 16-bit analog-to-digital converter. A broadband interference optical filter (Optical Coating Laboratory, Santa Rosa, CA) with a short wavelength cutoff at 2.67 μm was used to limit the free spectral range from 2.67 to 8 μm. This leads to a spectral range of 3949.5 cm−1, which is equal to an undersampling ratio of 4. Single-sided spectra were collected at 8 cm−1 spectral resolution, 5-μs time resolution, and 10 co-additions per data point. The total accumulation time for each measurement was 62 min, and two to three measurements were collected and averaged. A Blackman-Harris three-term apodization function with 32 cm−1 phase resolution and the Mertz phase correction algorithm were used. Difference spectra were calculated by substracting the reference spectrum, recorded before the laser firing, from those after the photodissociation of CO from heme a3. The MV-CO enzyme was prepared by exposing an anaerobic solution of the resting enzyme to CO for 10 h at 20 °C. The 610 nm species was obtained by introducing O2 to the MV-CO enzyme. Optical absorption spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda UV-visible spectrometer before and after the FTIR measurements to ensure the formation and stability of the CO adducts. Intensity changes and frequency shifts of side chains and backbone structures have been observed in the FTIR difference spectra of heme-copper oxidases as the result of an electrochemical perturbation (oxidized minus reduced) of the metal centers at room temperature or of the perturbation induced by the photodissociation of CO bound to the heme at 80 K, at which the CO binds irreversibly to CuB (18Hellwig P.

In the latter case, the perturbation induced by the photodissociated CO exerts its main effect on the environment of the binuclear center. The kinetics data on the photodissociation of CO and its rebinding to heme a3 have shown that the CO ligation/release mechanism in cytochrome ba3 follows that found in other heme-copper oxidases and proceeds according to Scheme 1. In contrast to the bovine aa3 oxidase, CuB of cytochrome ba3 has a relatively high affinity for CO (K1 > 104), whereas the transfer of CO to heme a32+ is characterized by a small k2 = 8 s−1 and by k−2 = 0.8 s−1, which is 30-fold greater than that of bovine aa3 oxidase (25Woodruff W.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible to take advantage of the long life-time of the CuB1+-CO complex and collect TRS2-FTIR difference spectra at room temperature, in which maximum conformational changes and possible proton transfer reactions can take place. It should be noted that small conformational changes of the protein are expected at low temperatures, and thus, it is unlikely that proton transfer reactions can take place. In our room temperature TRS2-FTIR difference spectra, the positive bands are associated with the CuB1+-CO state, and the negative bands are due the heme a3 Fe2+-CO state. Fig. 1 shows the TRS2-FTIR difference spectrum (the co-averaged first 200 μs after photodissociation of CO) at pH 7.5. In this time scale, the photodissociated CO from the heme a3 iron (ν(CO) = 1976 cm−1) is bound to CuB (ν(CO) = 2053 cm−1). The data show that photodissociation of CO from heme a3 produces the same transient photoproduct as that obtained at pD 8.5 and without changes in the intensity ratio of the 1976/2053 cm−1 modes (4Koutsoupakis K.

In addition, the C=O mode of the protonated heme a3 propionates is seen as a derivative shape feature with a trough/peak at 1708/1696 cm−1; the negative band located at 1726 cm−1 is the C=O stretch of Asp-372. ν7a(CO) and δ(COH) of the protonated and deprotonated forms of tyrosine residues are expected in the 1200–1300 cm−1 region (18Hellwig P. Pfitzner U. Behr J. Rost B. Pesavento R.P. Donk W.V. Gennis R.B. Michel H. Ludwig B. Mäntele W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9116-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A close inspection of the data indicates that such features exist in the TRS2-FTIR difference spectrum (td = 0–200 μs) at pH 7.5 and appear as two pairs of peaks/troughs at 1247/1233 and 1301/1315 cm−1. The pH dependence of both pairs of the peaks/troughs is depicted in Fig. 1 (inset A). The TRS2-FTIR difference spectrum obtained at pH 9.1 indicates that the 1233/1247 cm−1 pair observed in the pH 5.5–7.5 range has vanished and that the 1301/1315 cm−1 pair has gained intensity relative to that observed at pH 7.5. On the basis of the similarity in the frequencies of the ν7a(CO) and δ(COH) modes in the model compound and in the aa3 oxidase from P. denitrificans, we assign the 1247 and 1301 cm−1 vibrations to the protonated and deprotonated forms of a tyrosine residue, respectively (18Hellwig P.

The relative intensities (peak area) of the peak/trough pair at 1247/1233 cm−1 are shown in Fig. 1 (inset B) as a function of pH. An apparent pKa of 7.8 was calculated from the titration curve. The pKa value we have measured is in excellent agreement with that predicted at 7.6 from calculations but lower than that reported at 8.6 and 9.2 for the model compound 2-imidazol-1-yl-4-methylphenol (26Kannt A.

The model compound studies have also demonstrated that the linked imidazole group causes lowering of the pKa of the phenolic OH by 1.5 pKa units compared with that of the isolated p-cresol OH value (10.2). Although these studies did not include the influence of CuB on the phenol pKa, the observed lowering of pKa to 7.8 in the protein can be explained in terms of electron-withdrawing effects from CuB and therefore does not rule out the cross-linked Tyr-237 as being the residue responsible for the observed spectral changes (see below). The latter effect will be minimized due to dπ-pπ back-bonding and the weak coordination ability expected for His-233. The observed shift of the pKa value from 8.6 to 9.2 in the model to 7.8 in the enzyme indicates a rather"

Expanded pQ disrupts the stability of the pQ-harboring protein and increases its susceptibility to aggregation. Aggregated pQ protein is recognized by the ubiquitin proteasome system, and the enzyme ubiquitin ligase covalently attaches ubiquitin, which serves as a degradation signal by the proteasome. However, accumulation of the aggregated proteins in the diseased brain suggests insufficient degradation machinery. Ubiquitin has several functionally related proteins that are similarly attached to target proteins through its C terminus glycine residue. They are called ubiquitin-like molecules, and some of them are similarly related to the protein degradation pathway. One of the ubiquitin-like molecules, FAT10, is known to accelerate protein degradation through a ubiquitin-independent manner, but its role in pQ aggregate degradation is completely unknown. Thus we investigated its role in a Huntington disease cellular model and found that FAT10 molecules were covalently attached to huntingtin through their C terminus glycine. FAT10 binds preferably to huntingtin with a short pQ chain and completely aggregated huntingtin was FAT10-negative. In addition, ataxin-1,3 and DRPLA proteins were both positive for FAT10, and aggregation enhancement was observed upon FAT10 knockdown. These findings were similar to those for huntingtin.

https://openalex.org/W1992023113,"Smoothened (Smo) is a seven-transmembrane (7-TM) receptor that is essential to most actions of the Hedgehog family of morphogens. We found previously that Smo couples to members of the Gi family of heterotrimeric G proteins, which in some cases are integral although alone insufficient in the activation of Gli transcription factors through Hedgehog signaling. In response to a report that the G12/13 family is relevant to Hedgehog signaling as well, we re-evaluated the coupling of Smo to one member of this family, G13, and investigated the capacity of this and other G proteins to activate one or more of forms of Gli. We found no evidence that Smo couples directly to G13. We found nonetheless that Gα13 and to some extent Gαq and Gα12 are able to effect activation of Gli(s). This capacity is realized in some cells, e.g. C3H10T1/2, MC3T3, and pancreatic cancer cells, but not all cells. The mechanism employed is distinct from that achieved through canonical Hedgehog signaling, as the activation does not involve autocrine signaling or in any other way require active Smo and does not necessarily involve enhanced transcription of Gli1. The activation by Gα13 can be replicated through a Gq/G12/13-coupled receptor, CCKA, and is attenuated by inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Tec tyrosine kinases. We posit that G proteins, and perhaps G13 in particular, provide access to Gli that is independent of Smo and that they thus establish a basis for control of at least some forms of Gli-mediated transcription apart from Hedgehogs.

Apoptosis is mediated by a cascade of caspase-family proteases that commit infected cells to a form of programmed cell death. Therefore, to replicate within host cells, viruses have developed various strategies to inhibit caspase activation. In the mitochondrial cell-death pathway, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol triggers assembly of the oligomeric apoptosome, resulting in dimerization and activation of the apical caspase-9 (C9), and in turn its downstream effector caspases, leading to apoptosis. We previously showed that the vaccinia virus-encoded Bcl-2-like protein, F1L, which suppresses cytochrome c release by binding Bcl-2 family proteins, is also a C9 inhibitor. Here, we identify a novel motif within the flexible N-terminal region of F1L that is necessary and sufficient for interaction with and inhibition of C9. Based on functional studies and mutagenesis, we developed an atomic model of the complex in which F1L inhibits C9 by engaging the active site in the reverse orientation with respect to substrate peptides, in a manner analogous to that of XIAP-mediated inhibition of caspases-3 and -7. These studies offer new insights into the mechanism of apoptosome inhibition by F1L as well as novel probes to understand the molecular bases of apoptosome regulation and turnover. They also suggest how the two distinct functionalities of F1L (inhibition of C9 and suppression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins) may operate in a cellular setting.

https://openalex.org/W2013487002,"PTTG1, also known as securin, is an inactivating partner of separase, the major effector for chromosome segregation during mitosis. At the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, securin is targeted for proteasomal destruction by the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome, allowing activation of separase. In addition, securin is overexpressed in metastatic or genomically instable tumors, suggesting a relevant role for securin in tumor progression. Stability of securin is regulated by phosphorylation; some phosphorylated forms are degraded out of mitosis, by the action of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein (SCF) complex. The kinases targeting securin for proteolysis have not been identified, and mechanistic insight into the cause of securin accumulation in human cancers is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) phosphorylates securin to promote its proteolysis via SCF(βTrCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase. Importantly, a strong correlation between securin accumulation and GSK3β inactivation was observed in breast cancer tissues, indicating that GSK3β inactivation may account for securin accumulation in breast cancers."

We recently showed that β-catenin accumulates specifically in mature thalamic neurons, where it regulates the expression of the Cav3.1 voltage-gated calcium channel gene. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying β-catenin accumulation in thalamic neurons. We report that a lack of soluble factors produced either by glia or cortical neurons does not impair nuclear β-catenin accumulation in thalamic neurons. We next found that the number of thalamic neurons with β-catenin nuclear localization did not change when the Wnt/Dishevelled signaling pathway was inhibited by Dickkopf1 or a dominant negative mutant of Dishevelled3. These results suggest a WNT-independent cell-autonomous mechanism. We found that the protein levels of APC, AXIN1, and GSK3β, components of the β-catenin degradation complex, were lower in the thalamus than in the cortex of the adult rat brain. Reduced levels of these proteins were also observed in cultured thalamic neurons compared with cortical cultures. Finally, pulse-chase experiments confirmed that cytoplasmic β-catenin turnover was slower in thalamic neurons than in cortical neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2019641863,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) regulates gene transcription via “genomic” (binding directly or indirectly, typically via Sp1 or AP-1 sites, to target genes) and/or “nongenomic” (signaling) mechanisms. ERα activation by estrogen up-regulates the murine Ca2+-activated K+ channel α subunit gene (mSlo1) via genomic mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether ERα also drives transcription of the human (hSlo1) gene. Consistent with this view, estrogen increased hSlo1 transcript levels in primary human smooth muscle cells. Promoter studies revealed that estrogen/hERα-mediated hSlo1 transcription was nearly 6-fold more efficient than for mSlo1 (EC50, 0.07 versus 0.4 nm). Unlike the genomic transcriptional mechanism employed by mSlo1, hSlo1 exhibits a nongenomic hERα-mediated regulatory mechanism. This is supported by the following: 1) efficient hSlo1 transcription after disruption of the DNA-binding domain of hERα or knockdown of Sp1, and 2) lack of AP-1 sites in the hSlo1 promoter. Three nongenomic signaling pathways were explored: Src, Rho, and PI3K. Inhibition of Src with 10 μm PP2, and reported downstream ERK with 25 μm PD98059 did not prevent estrogen action but caused an increase in hSlo1 basal transcription; conversely, constitutively active c-Src (Y527F) decreased hSlo1 basal transcription even preventing its estrogen/hERα-mediated transcriptional activation. Rho inhibition by coexpressed Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase did not alter estrogen action. In contrast, inhibition of PI3K activity with 10 μm LY294002 decreased estrogen-stimulated hSlo1 transcription by ∼40%. These results indicate that the nongenomic PI3K signaling pathway plays a role in estrogen/hERα-stimulated hSlo1 gene expression; whereas c-Src activity leads to hSlo1 gene tonic repression independently of estrogen, likely through ERK activation.

LH regulates gonadal steroid hormone synthesis and ovulation by mature follicle rupture, while FSH promotes follicle maturation to the preovulatory stage and estrogen release (23Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2184-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The female reproductive system is more vulnerable to gonadotropin dysregulation than the male. We then measured serum levels of LH and FSH prepared from female PRIP-1 and -2 double knock-out (KO) mice for 5 to 6 continuous days, and found that mutant mice exhibited higher levels of both hormones in all the sera examined, thus showing a less sharp LH surge (21Matsuda M. Tsutsumi K. Kanematsu T. Fukami K. Terada Y. Takenawa T. Nakayama K.I. Hirata M. Biol. Reprod. 2009; 81: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Anterior lobes of the pituitary glands isolated from KO mice secreted more LH and FSH in response to a mimicking peptide of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (21Matsuda M. Tsutsumi K. Kanematsu T. Fukami K. Terada Y. Takenawa T. Nakayama K.I. Hirata M. Biol. Reprod. 2009; 81: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results reminded us of our previous observation that PRIP-1 KO mice exhibited a higher level of serum insulin (24Doira N. Kanematsu T. Matsuda M. Takeuchi H. Nakano H. Ito Y. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Hirata M. Biomed Res. 2001; 22: 157-165Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar); therefore, PRIP is likely to be negatively involved in dense-core vesicle exocytosis, independent of the type of vesicular contents. The molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of exocytosis by PRIP are currently being studied in the laboratory; however, gonadal steroid hormones were not up-regulated in response to increased gonadotropins, but were rather lower in KO mice; the serum level of progesterone in KO mice was about half that in control mice, while estradiol appeared to be lower, albeit with no statistical significance (21Matsuda M. Tsutsumi K. Kanematsu T. Fukami K. Terada Y. Takenawa T. Nakayama K.I. Hirata M. Biol. Reprod. 2009; 81: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women frequently leads to osteoporosis, the most common skeletal disorder. Similarly, ovariectomy clearly produces an osteoporotic bone phenotype in mice. Osteoporotic bone loss is the result of high bone turnover in which bone resorption outpaces bone deposition. In this study, we investigated the bone property influenced by PRIP deficiency, comparing with control mice. Three-dimensional analysis of the femurs of female mice was performed, as well as a histomorphometrical assay of bone formation parameters, including the bone formation rate, mineral apposition rate, osteoid thickness, and osteoblast number. All these results indicated that the increased bone mass seen in mutant mice is caused by enhanced bone formation. We then performed a primary culture of calvaria prepared from both genotypes, followed by analysis of osteoblast differentiation, assessed by alkaline phosphatase activity and osteoblast-related gene expression. Smad phosphorylation in response to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) was also analyzed. These results indicated that PRIP is implicated in the regulation of bone formation in a negative manner, partly through the regulation of Smad phosphorylation. PRIP-1 and -2 double KO mouse strains and the corresponding wild type (WT) were generated as described previously (17Mizokami A. Kanematsu T. Ishibashi H. Yamaguchi T. Tanida I. Takenaka K. Nakayama K.I. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Kominami E. Moss S.J. Yamamoto T. Nabekura J. Hirata M. J Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In brief, PRIP-1 KO mice and PRIP-2 KO mice back-crossed against the C57BL/6J (Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc.) background were crossed to generate a KO mouse strain and the corresponding WT. Homozygous KO and WT mice were intercrossed to obtain the required number of mice, and only F1 and F2 generations of both genotypes were used for experiments. The handling of mice and all procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Kyushu University, following the guidelines of the Japanese Council on Animal Care. Femurs were excised from each genotype of mice at the age indicated, followed by fixation with 70% ethanol for 7 days. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the femurs was measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) with an XCT Research SA+ (Stratec Medizintechnik GMBH, Germany). For trabecular analysis, the femurs were analyzed by micro-computed tomography (μCT) and the three-dimensional images were constructed using 3D software, TRI/3D-BON (Ratoc System Engineering), followed by measurement of the bone volume, trabecular thickness, and number. Femurs excised from each genotype of mice at the age indicated were fixed with 70% ethanol for 7 days, then embedded in glycolmethacrylate resin, and sectioned into 5-μm slices. For double labeling, mice were injected with calcein at a concentration of 10 mg/kg body weight twice with an interval of 72 h, and then sacrificed 40 h after the second injection (25Monfoulet. L. Rabier B. Chassande O. Fricain J.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2010; 86: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The sections stained by the Villanueva bone staining method were subjected to histomorphometric analyses under a light microscope with a micrometer. Parameters of the trabecular bone were measured in an area of 1.125 mm2 from 0.25 mm above the growth plate at the distal metaphysis. Five mice of each genotype were analyzed. Blood was collected at 10 AM from retinal blood vessels of 2-month-old mice, and sera were prepared. Serum levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (form 5b, which is known to be bone-specific, TRAP-5b) and osteocalcin (both carboxylated and uncarboxylated) were determined as bone-resorbing and - forming markers, respectively, by respective ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits (Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd., London UK and Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. WT and KO mice at 2 months old were sham-operated or ovariectomized by routine surgery (26Yamane H. Sakai A. Mori T. Tanaka S. Moridera K. Nakamura T. Bone. 2009; 44: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Two months after surgery, the mice were sacrificed, and their femurs were subjected to analysis by pQCT and μCT as described above. Pre-osteoblasts from the calvaria of newborn mice were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate, followed by culture in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were treated with medium containing 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate for 7 days or left untreated but supplemented with bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) at 10 ng/ml for the final 72 h. After treatment, the cells were fixed with an acetone/ethanol mixture (50:50, v/v), followed by an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay by incubating with a substrate solution containing 0.1 m diethanolamine (pH 8.5), 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The reaction was terminated by adding 5 m NaOH to the final concentration of 1.67 m, and then absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader. To determine ALP activity histochemically, cells were stained for enzyme activity as described previously (27Yamazaki M. Fukushima H. Shin M. Katagiri T. Doi T. Takahashi T. Jimi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35987-35995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To examine mineralization, the cells were cultured in the presence of l-ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate for 21 days, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and then staining for von Kossa (28Lutter A.H. Hempel U. Wolf-Brandstetter C. Garbe A.I. Goettsch C. Hofbauer L. C Jessberger R. Dieter P. J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 109: 1025-1032PubMed Google Scholar). Cells containing osteoclast precursors were obtained from the bone marrow of the femurs of female mice at 5–6 weeks old as described (29Lee J. Kim K. Kim J.H. Jin H.M. Choi H.K. Lee S.H. Kook H. Kim K.K. Yokota Y. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. Kim N. Blood. 2006; 107: 2686-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In brief, bone marrow cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) for 24 h. Nonadherent cells were harvested and cultured further for 3 days in the presence of 20 ng/ml M-CSF. Floating cells were removed and adherent cells were used as osteoclast precursors. To generate osteoclasts, precursors were cultured with 30 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) for 3 days, followed by fixation by 4% paraformaldehyde and staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) as previously described (30So H. Rho J. Jeong D. Park R. Fisher D.E. Ostrowski M.C. Choi Y. Kim N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24209-24216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). TRAP-positive multinuclear cells [TRAP(+)], containing more than three nuclei, were regarded as osteoclasts. Bone resorption assay using a dentine slice and F-actin ring staining were performed according to the method described (31Hashiguchi D. Fukushima H. Yasuda H. Masuda W. Tomikawa M. Morikawa K. Maki K. Jimi E J. Dent. Res. 2011; 90: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells, including osteoblasts and osteoclasts differentiated from each genotype, were extracted with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA). Cell lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to the polyvinyldifluoride membrane and immunoblotting with antibodies against PRIP-1 (1:1000) (8Kanematsu T. Jang I.S. Yamaguchi T. Nagahama H. Yoshimura K. Hidaka K. Matsuda M. Takeuchi H. Misumi Y. Nakayama K. Yamamoto T. Akaike N. Hirata M. Nakayama K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), PRIP-2 (1:1000) (17Mizokami A. Kanematsu T. Ishibashi H. Yamaguchi T. Tanida I. Takenaka K. Nakayama K.I. Fukami K.

Blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and visualized using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). To investigate the phosphorylation of Smad by Western blotting, phosphatase inhibitors such as 10 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4 were included in the lysis buffer. Anti-Smad1 and anti-phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Density was quantified by Image Gauge software (version 3.0; Fujifilm) and is shown as a relative value after normalizing with that of β-tubulin or β-actin in each experiment. For real-time PCR, total RNA was extracted by the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cDNA synthesis using total RNA (1 μg) with Rever Tra Ace (Toyobo), PCR amplifications were performed in 25 μl with 2 μl of obtained cDNA and 10 nm of each primer using the Platinum PCR Super Mix High Fidelity kit (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Real-time PCR was performed using Brilliant II SYBR® Green QPCR Master Mix with the Mx3000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR System (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were matched to a standard curve generated by amplifying serially diluted products under the same PCR conditions. GAPDH expression served as an internal control. Each primer was added to a final concentration of 10 μm. PCR was performed using 40 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. Primer sequences were as follows: Id1: 5′-TCCTGCAGCATGTAATCGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGAGGGTGAGGCTCTGTTG-3′ (reverse); Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2): 5′-GCCGGGAATGATGATGGAGAAACTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGACCGTCCACTGTCACTTT-3′ (reverse); osteonectin: 5′-GCAGTGCGTGACTGGCTCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGTCTCGGGCCAACAGCTC-3′ (reverse); osteocalcin: 5′-AAGCAGGAGGGCAATAAGGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTGTAGGCGGTCTTCAAGC-3′ (reverse); G3PDH: 5′-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACA-3′ (reverse) (32Hirata S. Kitamura C. Fukushima H. Nakamichi I. Abiko Y. Terashita M. Jimi E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 111: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The arbitrary intensity threshold (Ct) of amplification was performed using MxPro QPCR software for Mx3000P. The fold change was calculated as 2(−ΔΔCt), where ΔCt = Cttarget gene − CtG3PDH and ΔΔCt = ΔCtsample − ΔCtcontrol. Three independent experiments were performed to estimate the values for each culture condition. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. (S.E.) of at least three independent experiments. Student's t-tests were used and significance is represented by * or ** for p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, respectively. The hormonal imbalance (higher gonadotropins and lower gonadal steroids) observed with KO mice might influence the bone property. We therefore analyzed female femurs isolated from each genotype regarding bone mineral density or the trabecular bone property by pQCT or μCT. For comparison, male mice at the ages of 1 and 3 months were first analyzed; male mice of both ages exhibited little difference in bone mineral density and trabecular bones between the genotypes. We then analyzed younger male mice at 2-weeks old, which exhibited higher bone mineral density by about 30% of the control (results not shown). In contrast, females at the ages of 1, 2, 4, and 6 months clearly showed higher bone mineral density or more enriched trabecules in KO mice, but those at 12 months showed a slight increase with no statistical significance. As an example, bone mineral density at the metaphysis of femurs isolated from each genotype of females at the ages of 6 and 12 months is shown in Fig. 1, A–C; the parameters of total bone and trabecular bone were higher in KO mice at both ages, but statistical significance was only seen in mice at 6 months, while cortical bone was not different. To examine the trabecular bone of femurs in detail, μCT images of distal femurs were reconstructed, followed by quantitative analysis. As the images shown in Fig. 1D indicate, all the parameters examined, such as trabecular bone volume, trabecular thickness and the number of trabeculae, were more increased in KO mice at the age of 6 months (Fig. 1, E–G). These results clearly indicate that female KO mice exhibited higher bone mass, particularly in the trabeculae. Results obtained at other ages will be described later, except for those at 1 month old. Histological analysis of the femurs at the age of 2 months after Villanueva bone staining is shown in Fig. 2. The wider primary sponge bone area was followed by a secondary sponge bone area where much more trabecular bone was seen in KO mice than in WT mice, and the growth plates were wider. The higher magnification clearly showed apparently more osteoblasts side-by-side on the bone surface than observed in WT bone (picture not shown). We next performed histomorphometric analysis of the femurs prepared from each genotype at the age of 2 months. Bone formation parameters, including the mineral apposition rate, osteoid thickness and osteoblast number were all up-regulated in KO mice (Fig. 3, A–C). On the other hand, bone resorption parameters, including the bone resorption rate and osteoclast number, showed no statistical significance between genotypes (Fig. 3, D and E), indicating that KO mice showed increased bone turnover, and that bone formation appeared to outpace resorption; therefore, we further performed calcein double-labeling experiments for bone formation rates. Mice of each genotype were injected with calcein twice at an interval of 72 h, and the results visually showed enhanced bone formation in KO mice (Fig. 3F). As such, the bone formation rate to bone surface (BFR/BS) was significantly higher in KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 3G). These results clearly showed that the deficiency of PRIP in bone cells accelerates bone formation. Villanueva bone staining of the trabecular bone surface absorbed by osteoclasts showed abnormal features of osteoclasts in KO mice at the age of 2 months. As shown in Fig. 4, larger osteoclasts containing more than 15 nuclei, which were not seen in the control, were seen, but the absorbing surfaces were less stained brown-black in KO mice, indicating that bone absorption was not so active that it was difficult for the staining solution to penetrate the bone for staining. Furthermore, the junction between the bone surface and osteoclasts appeared to be less tight, and a live single-nucleated small cell was seen between them. These results indicate that osteoclasts formed in KO mice appeared less active. Measurements of serum levels of TRAP-5b and osteocalcin, as markers for bone-resorping and -forming activity in the whole body, respectively, support these observations; values of TRAP-5b (units/liter) were 21.8 ± 1.8 and 11.5 ± 2.1 (mean ± S.E. of five mice, p < 0.006) and those of osteocalcin (ng/ml) were 14.0 ± 1.1 and 19.9 ± 1.5 (mean ± S.E. of five mice, p < 0.031) for WT and KO mice, respectively. We first assumed that KO mice would exhibit bone loss because of lower gonadal steroids; however, as described above, the results were opposite, indicating that PRIP itself influences the bone property, independent of gonadal hormones. To examine further, ovariectomy (OVX) was performed in 2-month-old female mice, and 2 months later the bone property of the femurs was analyzed by pQCT (Fig. 5, A–C) and μCT (Fig. 5, D–F), as described for Fig. 1. KO mice at the age of 4 months showed higher bone mineral density and enriched trabecular bones than WT mice. As expected, OVX in WT mice resulted in decreased total and trabecular bone mineral density, but not cortical bone mineral density (Fig. 5, A–C). On the other hand, a statistically significant decrease was not observed in KO mice, as in three-dimensional analysis by μCT (Fig. 5, D–F). OVX in KO mice did not have a great impact on the bone property, probably because gonadal steroids secreted from ovaries of KO mice were lower at origin (21Matsuda M. Tsutsumi K. Kanematsu T. Fukami K. Terada Y. Takenawa T. Nakayama K.I. Hirata M. Biol. Reprod. 2009; 81: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the increased bone mass seen in KO mice was independent of hormonal imbalance in the HPG axis, suggesting that PRIP itself is implicated in the regulation of bone property. If this is confirmed, PRIP must be present in cells related to the regulation of bone property. We previously observed the presence of PRIP-1 in osteoclasts by in situ hybridization experiments (5Matsuda M. Kanematsu T. Takeuchi H. Kukita T. Hirata M. Neurosci Lett. 1998; 257: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We here confirmed the presence of PRIP-1 and -2 in osteoclasts differentiated from WT bone marrow cells by cultivation in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF by immunoblotting (Fig. 6). Furthermore, cultures of primary cells isolated from calvaria prepared from new-born mice in the presence of l-ascorbic acid"
