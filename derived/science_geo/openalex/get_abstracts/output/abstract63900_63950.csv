https://openalex.org/W1968746678,"Various numbers of spleen cells from specifically immunized mice were mixed with constant numbers of target tumor cells, and were inoculated subcutaneously into thymectomized, x-irradiated recipients. Small numbers of admixed immune spleen cells produced a statistically significant, and reproducible, acceleration of tumor growth in the inoculum as compared with controls of either nonimmune spleen cells or spleen cells from animals immune to a different, non-cross-reacting, tumor. Larger. numbers of specifically immune spleen cells, however, produced inhibition of tumor growth. These data imply that the normal immune reaction may have a dual function in relation to neoplasia: (i) stimulation of tumor growth, early in the course of the disease, or whenever the immune reaction is minimal; (ii) inhibition of tumor growth at other times."

https://openalex.org/W1596341727,"Abstract The cytoplasmic progesterone-binding proteins of chick oviduct are shown to consist of two major 4 S fractions which occur in equal amounts. They are separated from each other by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Purification of the two components, A and B, was about 800- and 3000-fold, respectively, from estrogen-primed chick oviducts following ultracentrifugation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography. The components have identical hormone-binding kinetics and steroid specificities, suggesting that the same class of hormonebinding site is involved on both A and B. The components differ in their stabilities on low salt sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, in which component A is unstable but B remains a 4 S species. Component A is also less stable than B in solutions without 1-thioglycerol. The two forms cannot be interconverted or recombined. These experiments have permitted an analysis of the progesterone-binding capacity of oviduct cytosol free from major contaminants. The results obtained confirm work already published using crude preparations of binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1532436604,"Abstract The insulin-binding proteins isolated from membranes of rat liver and of fat cells with the nonionic detergent, Triton X-100, appear to have similar or identical physicochemical and kinetic properties. The denaturation of the soluble receptor by reagents, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, urea, and guanidine·HCl, is reversible if moderately low concentrations of the reagents are used. The binding protein is relatively stable to storage at 4 or -20°. Digestion of the water-soluble receptor with phospholipase C and neuraminidase does not affect its capacity to bind 125I-insulin. High concentrations of NaCl (2 m) are virtually without effect on the insulin-receptor-binding interaction. The specific insulin-binding activity of the receptor is completely destroyed by digesting with concentrations of trypsin which are too low to modify the native receptor in the intact membrane but which are equally effective in destroying the receptor of phospholipase-treated membranes. Gel filtration experiments on columns of Sepharose 6B calibrated with several standard [14C]acetyl proteins indicate that the soluble insulin receptor has a molecular radius (Stokes radius) of about 70 A. This large molecular size is not changed by delipidation of the membranes before extracting the receptor, by phospholipase digestion of the soluble receptor, or by performing the chromatography in buffers containing varying amounts of detergent, 2 m NaCl, or 10% sucrose. In the absence of detergent highly aggregated forms of the receptor are observed. Sedimentation in 5 to 20% sucrose gradients containing 0.1 to 1.0% Triton X-100 reveals that the water-soluble receptor has a sedimentation constant of 11 S, as judged by the behavior of various standard 14C-labeled proteins under similar conditions. As in the gel filtration experiments, no change in sedimentation occurs after delipidation procedures or by varying the detergent concentration of the sucrose solutions. On the basis of gel filtration and sedimentation experiments, the receptor has a molecular weight of about 300,000, a frictional ratio of about 1.5, and an axial ratio (prolate ellipsoid) of about 9. The highly asymmetrical character of the protein is probably not explained by unusually high values of solvation or of partial specific volume (v). The insulin-receptor sediments in cesium chloride solutions having densities of 1.228 and 1.298, consistent with the view that it is not a lipoprotein. Scatchard plots indicate the presence of a kinetically homogeneous binding function with a dissociation constant near 10-10 m. The rate constants of insulin-receptor complex formation and dissociation are 2 to 3 x 106 mole-1 sec-1 and about 4 x 10-4 sec-1, respectively. Complex formation does not result in detectable alteration of the insulin molecule. No specific insulin-binding activity is detected in the cytosol of fat cell homogenates, and after homogenization of fat cells treated with trypsin or agarose-trypsin, it is possible to show that intracellular membranes or particles have no significant and specific insulin-binding activity. These results argue strongly for the exclusive localization of the receptor to the cell surface."

Trace metal enrichment was observed in the particulate and organic fractions but not in the inorganic fraction.

Such cells responded only to active and passive hand movements. Tactile and autditory (click) stimuli were itneffective. The majority of cells were activated only by movements of the contralateral hand, but a significant number (4 of 16) could be excited if a given movement was made by either hand. Of the cells responding to active movement, some showed an increased discharge before onset of the voluntary action. Such cells were excited by the same movement executed passively, a result that indicates sensory feedback from receptors activated by that movement."
https://openalex.org/W1597425465,"Abstract Rat liver ribosomes are not synthesized and degraded as functional units but are in a continual state of flux in which most protein constituents of the ribosome rapidly exchange with similar ribosomal proteins in the cytoplasm. This conclusion is based on two main types of evidence. 1. The relative degradation rates of ribosomal proteins are heterogeneous. The relative rates of degradation of ribosomal proteins were studied by a double isotope technique in which a single injection of [14C]leucine was administered to rats 5 days prior to [3H]leucine. As indicated by 3H:14C ratios of ribosomal proteins separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels, there is a marked heterogeneity of turnover of ribosomal proteins and a general correlation between relative degradation rates and the molecular size of the protein. This general relationship was also found for soluble proteins (Dehlinger, P. J., and Schimke, R. T. (1970) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 40, 1473). One possible explanation for this similarity is that protein constituents of ribosomes are degraded primarily as free cytoplasmic proteins. 2. Ribosomal proteins in the cytoplasm appear to be in equilibrium with the protein components of ribosomes since most protein constituents of ribosomes easily exchange in vitro with cytoplasmic proteins. This exchange was demonstrated by adding radioactive ribosomes to a nonradioactive supernatant fraction, or vice versa, and comparing the specific activity of the ribosomes before and after exchange. Two classes of exchangeable proteins can be identified. At least 70% of the ribosomal protein exchanges rapidly at 8°, while an additional 20% exchanges at 37°. The protein constituents of polysomes, monosomes, and subunits and both split and core proteins, prepared by washing ribosomes with 0.4 m KCl, are involved in the exchange process. The exchanged proteins have mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfateacrylamide gels which are similar to those for proteins originally present on ribosomes. Free ribosomal proteins may constitute as much as 17% of the total soluble protein, indicating that in the rat liver there are, on the average, 10 times as many ribosomal proteins in the soluble form as are constituents of ribosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1528360166,"Abstract Extracts of rat skeletal muscle convert aspartate to ammonia and fumarate plus malate. The conversion is dependent on the presence of catalytic amounts of IMP, adenylosuccinate, or AMP. In addition, GTP is required as a source of energy. A GTP-regenerating system must be supplied since the accumulation of GDP inhibits the operation of the cycle. It is proposed that the purine nucleotide cycle accounts for the production of ammonia during muscular work."
https://openalex.org/W1519698907,Abstract The metabolic products of propionate metabolism in man were studied by determining the pattern of isotope in the urine following the intravenous injection of [1-14C]propionate. A major peak of radioactivity not present in control subjects was found in an organic acid in two patients with propionic acidemia and a patient with methylmalonic acidemia. This labeled compound was characterized as methylcitrate. Methylcitrate excretion was appreciable in patients with defective propionic acid metabolism and could be detected without administration of isotope. Methylcitrate is considered to be formed from the condensation of propionyl-CoA and oxalacetate. It could be involved in the pathogenesis of the clinical manifestations of these conditions.
https://openalex.org/W1949079135,"Abstract Crystalline glutaminase-asparaginase with antitumor activity was prepared from an Achromobacteraceae soil isolate organism. This enzyme has l-glutaminase and l-asparaginase activity in a ratio of 1.2:1. The purification procedure provides an over-all yield of 40 to 60% from crude cell-free extract to homogeneous glutaminase-asparaginase and is adaptable to large scale isolation of the enzyme. Glutaminase-asparaginase is crystallizable from aqueous alcohol solutions in the absence of heavy metal cations. The highest yields of enzyme were obtained when cells were grown aerobically in a basal synthetic medium composed of l-glutamic acid, ammonium sulfate, trace minerals, and phosphate buffer. Glutaminase-asparaginase content remained relatively constant when the organism was at temperatures between 15 and 25°. Above 25° the enzyme content decreased with increasing temperature. The isoelectric point by isoelectric focusing of glutaminase-asparaginase on ampholytes is 8.43. The specific activity of homogeneous enzyme is 190 ± 20 i.u. per mg of protein and the E1%280 is 10.2. No carbohydrate or phospholipid was detected in the enzyme. No disulfide or sulfhydryl groups appear to be present on the enzyme. The Km values for l-glutamine and l-asparagine are 5.8 ± 1.5 x 10-6 and 4.8 ± 1.4 x 10-6 m, respectively. Glutaminase-asparaginase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the d isomers of glutamine and asparagine at about one-third the rate of the l isomers. The enzyme is not inhibited by ethyl-enediaminetetraacetate (0.1 mm), ammonia (10 mm), l-glutamate (30 mm), or l-aspartate (30 mm). 6-Diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine which is not a substrate for the enzyme irreversibly inactivates glutaminase-asparaginase at very low concentrations. In contrast the l and d isomers of 5-diazo-4-oxonorvaline are attacked by the enzyme and are considerably poorer inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1585615821,"Abstract An α-l-fucosidase has been purified from rat epididymis by fractionation of extracts with ammonium sulfate and subsequent chromatography on ion exchange celluloses. It is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 210,000 to 220,000 and dissociates in the presence of mercaptoethanol and guanidine hydrochloride or sodium dodecyl sulfate. The dissociated material behaves as two components with molecular weights of approximately 47,000 and 60,000, thus suggesting two pairs of dissimilar subunits. A preliminary amino acid and carbohydrate composition is reported. Other glycosidases of rat epididymis, α-d-mannosidase, β-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and β-d-galactosidase have been partially purified from the same extract. All were active against a variety of glycoprotein and glycopeptide substrates. The purified fucosidase preparation is stable, is essentially free from other glycosidases with the exception of small amounts of N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, and it catalyzes the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-α-l-fucoside. Studies with glycopeptides show quantitative release of fucose by the purified enzyme from the tryptic glycopeptide of the hormone-specific chain of bovine luteinizing hormone and from a peptide of horse immunoglobulin G. A general method has been developed for quantitative determination by gas-liquid chromatography of the monosaccharides released by enzymic hydrolysis of glycoproteins and glycopeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1551160005,"Abstract Stimulation of rat liver adenylate cyclase activity by saturating concentrations of glucagon was found to increase with increasing concentrations of ATP from essentially no stimulation at 2.7 x 10-7 m to a maximum of 7- to 8-fold at approximately 3 x 10-3 m. Half-maximal stimulation was found at 1 x 10-4 m ATP. Stimulation (4-fold) by fluoride ion was independent of the concentration of ATP used. At low concentrations of ATP, stimulation by glucagon could also be elicited by GTP. It was concluded that the response of the rat liver adenylate cyclase system to glucagon exhibits an absolute requirement for either GTP or ATP. Addition of des-1-histidine-glucagon (DH-glucagon), a competitive inhibitor of glucagon action resulted within 45 to 60 s in complete inhibition of the effect of glucagon on adenylate cyclase activity. This action of DH-glucagon was independent of the time elapsed between the addition of glucagon and DH-glucagon and was not influenced by the presence of adenylate cyclase assay reagents prior to addition of DH-glucagon. Readdition of excess native glucagon resulted in restimulation of enzymatic activity. Exposure of liver membranes to 8 nm glucagon followed by a 4-fold dilution of the hormone resulted in glucagon-stimulated activity identical with that given by 2 mm glucagon. Inactivation of glucagon by a liver membrane process, which causes a loss of glucagon in the medium, also showed a proportional loss of stimulation of adenylate cyclase. It is concluded that glucagon reacts rapidly and reversibly with its receptor in the presence of ATP, that this interaction results in rapid and reversible stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, and, finally, that persistence of this stimulation depends on the continuous presence of glucagon in the assay medium."
https://openalex.org/W1525268213,"Abstract Purified α-bungarotoxin was prepared from the venom of Bungarus multicinctus by carboxymethyl Sephadex C-50 chromatography and Sephadex G-25 chromatography. The material was found to be a pure polypeptide of molecular weight 8000. The purified α-bungarotoxin was acetylated with [3H]acetic anhydride, and the [3H]acetylated, purified α-bungarotoxin was called [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin and was utilized to characterize and isolate an acetylcholine receptor from guinea pig cerebral cortex. With an isolated rat phrenic nerve diaphragm preparation, 1 x 10-5 g per ml of [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin caused a complete block of the indirectly stimulated rat hemidiaphragm in vitro, and this action was quantitatively and qualitatively similar to that of the unacetylated α-bungarotoxin. The [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin had an isoelectric point of pH 9.3. [3H]Acetyl-α-bungarotoxin prepared in this manner had a specific activity of 6.36 Ci per mmole. Binding of [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin was measured in a 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.6) homogenate of guinea pig cerebral cortex with an ultrafiltration cell apparatus. Binding of [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin to the homogenate was linear with an added homogenate protein, was reversible, was saturable, showed optimum binding at pH 7.1 to pH 7.7, and was not inhibited by high concentrations (10-2 m) of physostigmine. With excess 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.6) homogenate of guinea pig cerebral cortex, essentially 100% of the available [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin could be bound. At a [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin concentration of 0.875 µm, 1 µm d-tubocurarine inhibited binding 52%; 1 µm acetylcholine, 30%; 1 µm choline, 0%; 1 µm carbachol, 38%; 1 µm atropine, 0%; 1 mum gallamine, 33%; 1 µm decamethonium, 44%; 1 µm hexamethonium, 16%; 1 µm propanpheline, 0%; and 1 µm serotonin, 0%. A Scatchard plot indicated that two binding sites were present in the binding molecules with dissociation constants of 6.61 x 10-8 m and 2.41 x 10-7 m. Calculation of binding site concentrations give B1 of 12 nmoles per g of cerebral cortex wet weight and B2 of 26 nmoles per g of cerebral cortex wet weight. Treatment of the homogenate with proteolytic enzymes decreased binding; deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, lipase, phospholipase C, and neuraminidase were without effect. A receptor-[3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin complex was isolated and purified by centrifugation and Sephadex G-100, G-150, and G-200 column chromatography. The purified [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin-receptor complex was homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, had an isoelectric point of pH 4.8, and has a molecular weight of 94,000. The purified [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin-receptor complex had the properties of protein, indicating that the receptor is probably a protein. Fractionation of the cerebral cortex showed an enrichment of the receptor in the synaptosomal fraction. Subsynaptosomal fractionation showed the synaptosome plasma membrane to contain the highest concentration of receptors. The original cerebral cortex homogenate bound 87.5 ± 7 pmoles of [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin per mg of protein, which, assuming one molecule of [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin per receptor molecule, means that a 3 g (wet weight) guinea pig cerebral cortex contains 52.5 nmoles of receptor or 420 µg of receptor protein. The purified [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin-receptor complex contained 10.75 nmoles of [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin per mg of protein or 86 ± 4 µg of [3H]acetyl-α-bungarotoxin per mg of protein."

https://openalex.org/W1588343997,"Abstract The F3 histones of duck erythrocytes and calf thymus have been purified and compared by a variety of techniques. The results of analytical gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, cysteine content determinations, and amino acid analysis support the conclusion that there exist two chemically and metabolically distinct forms of F3 histone. The duck erythrocyte has a single form of F3 histone, which contains 1 cysteine residue. The calf thymus, however, has two forms of F3 histone. The minor form present as approximately 20% of the total F3 histone fraction closely resembles the duck erythrocyte F3 in that it contains a single cysteine residue. The major form of calf thymus F3 histone, however, contains 2 half-cystine residues. These two forms of F3 histone differ metabolically in that they are acetylated at different rates in isolated calf thymus nuclei. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the possible evolutionary origins of histone F3."

https://openalex.org/W1586886322,"Abstract Metabolites of [1,2-3H]dihycrotachysterol3 have been described in blood, bone, and intestinal mucosa of vitamin D-deficient rats following the intrajugular injection of 0.65, 6.5, and 65 nmoles per rat. In all cases studied, 25-hydroxy-dihydrotachysterol3 is the major metabolite of dihydrotachysterol3, achieving concentration of 51 pmoles per ml of serum and 28 pmoles per g of intestinal mucosa 24 hours after a 65-nmole dose, and approximately 170 pmoles per g of bone cells 24 hours following a 6.5-pmole dose. Four metabolites more polar than 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol, designated metabolites A and B (blood) and C and D (intestine), were demonstrated. At doses of dihydrotachysterol3 which induce mobilization of bone mineral in vivo, no metabolites more polar than 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol could be detected in the bone, leading to the conclusion that 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol is likely the metabolically active metabolite in this system. At doses which promote intestinal calcium transport, two polar metabolites, 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol3 and metabolite D can be considered the possible metabolically active forms in the intestine. The action of 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol3 in enhancing intestinal calcium transport is not affected by prior bilateral nephrectomy. A 62.5 pmole per rat dose of 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol3 is more potent in bilateral nephrectomy than 62.5 pmoles of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. Therefore, the active dihydrotachysterol metabolite, in contrast to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, the active vitamin D metabolite in intestine, does not require a kidney transformation (presumably one hydroxylation) for biological activity. The postulate is presented that 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol3 or metabolite D serves as a substitute for 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in the intestine, and as such, functions as a D vitamin."

Procedures for the synthesis of (l)-10-[14C]formyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate, (l)-10-formyl-[6,7-3H2]tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate, and (l)-[6,7-3H2]tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate with a high specific radioactivity are described."
https://openalex.org/W1600346961,"Abstract During the fermentation of purines by Clostridium acidi-urici and Clostridium cylindrosporum, formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase is thought to catalyze the synthesis of ATP from (l)-10-formyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate, ADP, and Pi. The reaction is energetically less favorable in this direction under conditions tested with the isolated enzyme. To further investigate the plausibility of this pathway, the kinetic parameters of the reaction in the direction of ATP synthesis were measured and the binding properties of the folate substrate and product, (l)-10-formyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate and (l)-tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate, were investigated. Both folate coenzymes bind with a strong affinity to four identical, noninteracting sites per mole of enzyme. These sites are presumed to be the active sites, and their number is consistent with the tetrameric structure of the enzyme. The 10-formyl derivative also binds to additional sites, but with a lower affinity. This additional binding does not occur at the nucleotide binding site. Competition experiments were performed to determine the relative affinities of tetrahydrofolate and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. The presence of the additional 2 γ-glutamyl residues results in approximately a 100-fold increase in binding affinity of the formylated and a 200-fold increase in binding affinity for the unformylated triglutamyl compounds. The unreduced pteroyltriglutamate was bound by the enzyme but with 10-fold lower affinity than the reduced derivative. Comparison of the Michaelis constants for 10-formyltetrahydrofolate and 10-formyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate confirms the 100-fold difference in affinities. Both the mono- and triglutamyl derivatives were deformylated with the same maximal velocity, suggesting that the 2 additional γ-glutamyl residues are bound at a noncatalytic subsite. The results of kinetic experiments indicate that the enzyme can efficiently catalyze the synthesis of ATP and that the relative concentrations of formylated and unformylated folate coenzymes may be a significant regulatory parameter in the purine-fermenting Clostridia."

https://openalex.org/W1587940123,"Abstract Preparations of cathepsin D from the bovine uterus contain at least 12 distinct forms of enzyme which digest hemoglobin at pH 3.2. Ten of these forms (2 through 11) have been purified by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography and disc electrophoresis. Six major forms (4, 5, 6, 7,8, and 12) account for 94% of the total cathepsin D activity of the uterus. These six forms have been unequivocally identified as cathepsin D on the basis of their specificity in cleaving the B chain of insulin. Forms 2 and 3 show pH optima at pH 3.2 and are 50% inhibited by 0.001 m dithiothreitol in agreement with the properties of cathepsin D. Forms 1, 9, 10, and 11 are present only in trace amounts; they have approximately the same molecular weight as cathepsin D and digest hemoglobin at acid pH. Forms 2 through 8 have also been resolved by isoelectric focusing; their isoelectric points range from 5.8 to 7.2. Disc electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol gave a single band of molecular weight 40,000 to 42,000 for Forms 2, 3, and 4; Forms 5 through 9 gave two distinct bands corresponding to weights of 13,000 to 14,000 and 25,000 to 28,000. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation gave a weight average molecular weight of 40,000 for Form 4 and slightly lower weights for Forms 5 and 6. Form 4 was more stable in acid and urea than Form 5. Forms 4 through 7 all had the same Vmax and Km when hemoglobin was used as substrate. This evidence suggests that Form 4 is the primary form of cathepsin D, that it consists of a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 40,000, and that this chain is cleaved in vivo without loss of activity into fragments of ⅓ and ⅔ length to produce higher numbered forms."
https://openalex.org/W1583596052,Abstract The proton magnetic resonance spectrum of dl-α-lecithin at 100 MHz in CHCl3 solvent is reported. An analysis of the spectrum is made. The chemical shifts of the N-(CH3)3 protons and the resonance peak associated with the condensed water molecule showed concentration dependence with the latter showing the more pronounced response. These chemical shift changes are interpreted in terms of micelle formation through intermolecular hydrogen bond formation between lecithin monomers. The chemical shift data are used to calculate the critical micelle concentration of lecithin as well as the number of monomer lecithin units required to form a micelle. The temperature-dependent studies showed a small negative enthalpy change associated with the micelle. The micellar behavior in CHCl3 is compared with those in benzene and carbon tetrachloride.
https://openalex.org/W1966175452,"Red illumination of a Balanus amphitrite photoreceptor that has been adapted to blue light leads to prolonged depolarization in the late receptor potential. This depolarization can be switched off by further exposure to a blue stimulus. The early receptor potential in this cell is purely depolarizing or largely hyperpolarizing; the former is true if the cell has been adapted to red light, and the latter, if blue light has been used. The color-adaptation ""memories"" for both early and late receptor potentials appear to be permanent. The existence of two stable states for the early receptor potential directly implies a pigment with two stable states, and these apparently contribute antagonistically to the late receptor potential."
https://openalex.org/W1503322100,"The responses of rat brain hexokinase, human red cell hexokinase, and human red cell pyruvate kinase to changes in the adenylate energy charge were observed. A number of factors were found to be capable of altering these responses. These include the concentration of total adenylates, the level of free uncomplexed Mg2+, the kinetic reaction mechanism of the enzyme under study, and the concentration of the other substrate (or substrates) and product (or products) involved in the reaction. The effects of some of these factors are further explored by computation of the energy charge response curves for rabbit muscle creatine kinase. These stimulations with a digital computer serve to show a possible role for the kinetic reaction mechanism in cellular regulation. The findings presented in this report suggest that the above enzymes may not be effectively modulated by the adenylate energy charge. They also suggest conditions under which the energy charge model can be best evaluated, limitations of the model, and point out where possible exceptions to the energy charge model may arise."

https://openalex.org/W1524918780,"Abstract Modulation of the synthesis of membrane proteins and chlorophyll during the light-dependent formation of the chloroplast membranes in Chlamydomonas reinhardi y-1 was achieved through use of inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis and alternating exposure to the light or dark. The relative content of membrane proteins of cytoplasmic origin (L protein), of chloroplast origin (activation proteins), and of chlorophyll in the growing membrane can be changed so as to obtain membranes of differing composition. Membranes formed in a normal greening process have a relatively constant proportion of L protein, activation proteins, chlorophyll, and lipids. Synthesis of activation proteins can be inhibited by chloramphenicol, resulting in the formation of photosynthetically inactive membranes relatively enriched in L protein and chlorophyll. Transfer of greening cells to the dark immediately blocks the synthesis of chlorophyll while allowing synthesis of L protein and activation proteins to continue for a short period. Transfer of cells containing membranes enriched in L protein, but relatively deficient in chlorophyll or activation proteins, to conditions which permit the synthesis of these latter components results in the integration of these components into the membranes which then regain a normal photosynthetic activity. If excess of L protein is present, activation proteins can be synthesized in the dark for long periods of time. Inhibition of RNA synthesis by actinomycin D was used to show that the synthesis of L protein is associated with the presence of an unstable RNA the synthesis of which depends on concomitant conversion of protochlorophyll to chlorophyll. The regulation by light of the greening process is explained as a control by the light-dependent conversion of protochlorophyll to chlorophyll on the synthesis of L protein at the transcription level."
https://openalex.org/W1537691466,Abstract Purified parathyroid hormone can be readily tritiated by reaction with high specific activity tritiated methyl ester of acetamidate. The reaction proceeds easily under mild conditions and a fully active acetamidino derivative of parathyroid hormone is obtained as determined by the serum calcium assay and the renal-adenylate cyclase system. The reaction produces no detectable side products of a protein or polypeptide nature and the acetamidino derivative appears radiochemically homogeneous upon disc electrophoresis.
https://openalex.org/W1541498305,"Abstract Tritiated acetamidino-parathyroid hormone localizes rapidly and specifically in the kidneys of thyroparathyroidectomized rats within 30 min after subcutaneous injection. There is some indication of saturation of the kidney by the hormone very early after injection with doses of greater than 40 µg per rat. The hormone is metabolized rapidly to trichloroacetic acid-soluble components with a resultant rapid loss of radioactivity from the kidney. Localization in bone is not demonstrable when data are calculated on a tissue weight basis. When calculated as disintegrations per min per g of cells, the bone cells are more radioactive than any other. However, direct evidence for binding to bone cells is not available. It was established that the radioactivity in bone is not due to vascular parathyroid hormone. Localization of 3H-labeled parathyroid hormone in kidney is less when the parathyroid glands are not removed, suggesting competition by endogenous parathyroid hormone. Neither [3H]insulin or methyl [3H]acetimidate localize in the kidney in the same manner as does parathyroid hormone, but oxidized, inactive, parathyroid hormone binds to kidney in a manner identical with native hormone."

https://openalex.org/W1579504092,"Abstract The circular dichroism of the cyanogen bromide peptide of glucagon, measured in dilute aqueous solution, in chloroethanol, and in urea is similar to that of glucagon. However, in more concentrated aqueous solutions the cyanogen bromide peptide does not rapidly aggregate to structures of higher helical content as does glucagon. Thus this property of glucagon is dependent on the presence of the two COOH-terminal amino acids. Intramolecular quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by tyrosinate is observed in the cyanogen bromide peptide. From this quenching the approximate distance between aromatic residues is calculated and it is concluded that the peptide is in a compact conformation. The lack of quenching in unmodified glucagon is interpreted as due to the fixed angle between the aromatic residues. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies at 250 MHz reveal small differences in the chemical shift of several of the protons between the cyanogen bromide peptide in water and the random coil spectrum. These differences suggest that the conformational change between a randomly coiled peptide and the glucagon monomer in water involves several sections of the molecule. The frictional coefficient calculated from sedimentation velocity results along with the fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance data suggests that the cyanogen bromide peptide, like glucagon, folds into a compact, globular structure in dilute aqueous solution."
https://openalex.org/W1609683328,"Abstract The β chain amino terminus of one or more hemoglobins in the blood of members of the Felidae family is substituted with an acetyl group. Such acetylated hemoglobins occur together with nonacetylated components in variable proportions in blood of different members of the family. In the lion, tiger, and snow leopard, the acetylated component comprises about 90% of the total hemoglobin; in the several and caracal it comprises about 70%; in the cheetah, puma, fishing cat, and jungle cat it comprises about 50%; and, among domestic cats it comprises 10 to 50%. The occurrence of such β chain-substituted hemoglobins as major components in animal blood is unusual. Except for the minor fetal human component hemoglobin Fi and the minor adult human component hemoglobin Aic, no animal hemoglobin thus far examined has been found to contain amino-blocked β (non α) chains. Domestic cat hemoglobins with N-acetylated β chain amino termini are insensitive to the modifying influence of organic phosphates on oxygen affinity, whereas cat hemoglobins with unsubstituted β chain amino termini are sensitive (Taketa, F., Mauk, A. G., and Lessard, J. L., J. Biol. Chem., 246, 4471 (1971))."
https://openalex.org/W1585675907,"β-Hydroxy[14C]biotin and two 14C-methyl ketones have been isolated and identified for the first time from culture filtrates of a pseudomonad grown on [14C]biotin. The methyl ketones arise from decarboxylation of the β-keto acids derived from biotin and bisnorbiotin. Also, β-hydroxy[14C]biotin sulfone was isolated from similar cultures which contained [carboxy-14C]biotin sulfone plus biotin for growth. These results confirm that the valeric acid side chain of biotin is degraded via β oxidation which can proceed only in part with the rather metabolically inactive sulfone. Biotin d-sulfoxide isolated from a culture filtrate of the pseudomonad grown on [carboxy-14C]biotin was found to have the same specific radioactivity as that of the biotin initially present. This provides strong evidence that the d-sulfoxide arises through natural oxidation of the thioether function of the vitamin. No radioactive, ring-degraded products could be detected following growth on [carboxy-14C]biotin, [carboxy-14C]biotin d-sulfoxide, [carboxy-14C]biotin 1-sulfoxide plus biotin, or [carboxy-14C]biotin sulfone plus biotin. Hence, it is increasingly certain that degradation of the side chain must precede cleavage of the bicyclic structure of this vitamin."
https://openalex.org/W1499107772,"Abstract A 2-keto-3-deoxyaldonic acid aldolase was shown to participate in the metabolism of d-fucose in a pseudomonad. The enzyme was purified 50-fold, and some of its properties are reported. Of several 2-keto-3-deoxyaldonic acids tested, only 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-fuconate and 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-arabonate served as substrates. The apparent Km values for 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-fuconate and 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-arabonate were 2.9 mm and 1.8 mm, respectively. The enzyme required a divalent cation for activity, with Mn++ being the most effective. The products of 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-fuconate cleavage were identified as pyruvate and d-lactaldehyde. The equilibrium constant for the 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-fuconate cleavage reaction was about 0.12 mm."
https://openalex.org/W1553644324,"Abstract The apparent buoyant density of the photosynthetic membranes was measured at different stages of their formation during the greening of dark-grown Chlamydomonas reinhardi y-1 cells. Changes in the banding position of membranes in Urografin density gradients between 1.120 g per cm3 to 1.140 g per cm3 could be correlated with increase in photosynthetic activity and with synthesis of specific membrane proteins in the chloroplast. Increase in density was observed during the initial phase of the greening process as well as during repair of nonphotosynthetic membranes formed in the presence of chloramphenicol. However, no correlation could be found between the later phenomenon and synthesis of specific lipids. The banding density was not significantly altered by sonic fragmentation of the membranes into vesicles of about 700 A average diameter. Membranes containing varying proportions of normal and damaged parts could be obtained by addition of chloramphenicol to greening cells at different times of the greening process. Such membranes exhibited gradual changes in the banding density and photosynthetic activity. However, their density was retained after sonic fragmentation indicating a homogeneous distribution of the different components within the growing membrane. These findings are compatible with a growth mechanism based on random intussusception of new material within pre-existing membranes. Such a growth mechanism supports the view that the process of recognition of the final target by the newly formed membrane material is based on the homogeneous distribution of microenvironmental structural properties of the membranes."

There was no radioprotective effect with salicylates at the doses used. Higher doses of salicylates resulted in death of the animals."
https://openalex.org/W1578663215,"Abstract Formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase undergoes inactivation at pH values below 7. Inactivation is accompanied by both the dissociation of the tetramer into monomers and the exposure of aromatic amino acids to the solvent. The rate of inactivation is a function of pH. This rate and the rate of exposure of tryptophan residues to the aqueous environment follow first order kinetics. After prolonged incubation under acidic conditions the monomers are still capable of reassociating to form tetramers but the tetramers produced have a reduced catalytic activity. The alterations in enzyme structure and function which occur during inactivation are reversed following an elevation of pH. The return of enzymic activity is accompanied by both the reassociation of monomers and the burying of exposed tryptophan residues. The rate of reactivation and the rate of burying of tryptophan follow first order kinetics. The first order rate constant for reactivation varies as a function of temperature, and the heat of activation calculated from the linear Arrhenius plot is 20.1 kcal per mole. The free energy of activation and entropy of activation at 25° have values of 21 kcal per mole and -3 e.u., respectively. A mechanism in which the rate-limiting step for reactivation is a conformational change of the monomer that occurs prior to reassociation is consistent with the experimental observations. Both the rate and extent of reactivation increase as the pH is raised from 6 to 7.9. The data suggest that reactivation is dependent on the deprotonation of histidine residues. The presence of an optimum concentration of sulfate enhances both the rate and extent of reactivation at pH values between 6 and 7. The presence of a thiol compound during inactivation and reactivation is required to achieve a maximum restoration of enzymic activity. It is suggested that the monomer is unstable in the absence of a thiol and is converted to other monomer forms possibly as a result of oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. These monomer forms are not converted to the active tetramer under the conditions used. The extent of reactivation is dependent upon protein concentration. The optimum protein concentration depends on the pH at which reactivation is performed. As the pH of reactivation is lowered toward pH 6, the concentration of protein required to achieve reactivation increases. These results are explained by assuming that an equilibrium exists between monomer and tetramer, and that the production of the monomer which is capable of reassociating to form the active tetramer results from a conformational change caused by a protonation of a residue with a pKa of about 6.0."

The A subunits of lactate dehydrogenase from erythrocytes deficient in isozyme 4 cannot assemble in vitro with B subunits to form active isozyme.

Rather, a factor that is bound to the A subunits of erythrocytes restricts free exchange with B subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1563807259,"Abstract An enzyme, designated glycine-cytochrome c reductase, catalyzing the reduction of cytochrome c in the presence of glycine, and apparently unlike other known enzymes catalyzing the oxidation of glycine, has been purified from the chemoautotrophic bacterium Nitrobacter agilis. The purification procedure of the activity, located in the 144,000 x g supernatant fraction from cells disrupted by sonic oscillation, included treatment with protamine sulfate, two precipitations with ammonium sulfate, adsorption on calcium phosphate gel, and chromatography on hydroxylapatite, diethylaminoethylcellulose, and Sephadex G-200 columns. Specific activity was thereby increased to about 250 times that in the 144,000 x g supernatant fraction, with a recovery of about 5% of the activity. Of a variety of substrates and acceptors listed, only glycine caused the enzymatic reduction of cytochrome c, and only cytochrome c was reduced in the presence of glycine. A molecular weight of about 69,000 was calculated using a Stokes radius of about 30 A, determined by Sephadex G-200 chromatography, and an s20, w of 5.6 S, determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. No evidence could be found for the role of cofactors in the reaction. In addition to ferrocytochrome c, the reaction products were shown to include ammonia and glyoxylate."
https://openalex.org/W1563643697,"Abstract Tritiated acetamidino derivatives of insulin are readily prepared. That the reaction is specific for amino groups has been confirmed and the mildest conditions for optimal labeling established. At acid pH, there is no significant loss of tritium from the polypeptide. A small loss of 3H occurs after 3 months at pH 9. Acetamidino-insulin is fully potent in the following assays: mouse convulsion, muscle sugar transport, fat cell glucose oxidation, and immunoassay. A slight loss of potency was observed in some cases with high specific activity preparations. Acetamidination introduces some heterogeneity into insulin preparations, but the products appear to be biologically active and can be separated by disc gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1996914790,"In the cochlear nucleus of decerebrate, paralyzed cats, multiple-unit responses to an acoustic stimulus showed significant decrements when the stimulus was repeatedly presented once every 5 seconds. These decrements developed in the absence of peripheral receptor adaptation. The responses recovered to the level prior to stimulation when stimulation was withheld for 5 to 10 minutes. Dishabituation by somatic stimulation of the forepaw, however, was less effective than in the intact cat. The continued development of response decrements after strychnine blockade of peripheral olivocochlear influences and central postsynaptic inhibition suggests a mechanism of decreased synaptic effectiveness, which has previously been postulated for neuronal habituation in brainstem and spinal cord."

https://openalex.org/W1591528200,"Abstract Previous studies of the catalytic functioning of the tryptophan oxygenase (EC 1.12.1.13) of Pseudomonas acidovorans indicated that this enzyme possesses two distinguishable types of binding sites for tryptophan. One of these is the catalytic site (or sites), the other is a regulatory site (or sites), which, when occupied, causes alterations in the enzyme conformation and a decrease in the Km for the second substrate, oxygen. The consequence of these interactions is a sigmoidal catalytic activity versus tryptophan concentration relationship. Kinetic studies of the behavior of tryptophan oxygenase of P. acidovorans indicated that three allosteric binding sites for tryptophan exist on the enzyme in addition to catalytic binding site (or sites) for tryptophan. Spectral studies of the enzyme and two tryptophan analogues, 5-fluoro-tryptophan, which specifically binds to the catalytic site, and α-methyltryptophan, which is relatively specific for the sites, indicate that both types of sites must be occupied to produce the shift in the Soret peak of the enzyme spectrum from 405 to 407 nm which earlier studies had shown was caused by binding of tryptophan. Stability to inactivation by sodium dodecyl sulfate is shown to be a function of both the valence state of the prosthetic heme iron and the degree of saturation of the sites."
