https://openalex.org/W26050007,"It has been observed that all of the erythrocytes of individuals with sickle-cell trait undergo sickling and that a greater reduction in partial pressure of oxygen is required to produce complete sickling in sickle-cell trait erythrocytes than in those of sickle-cell anemics (1). These observations indicate that each sicklemia erythrocyte contains both normal hemoglobin and sickle-cell anemia hemoglobin. In a pooled sample of blood from five sicklemic individuals the ratio of t,he abnormal to the normal hemoglobin was found to be 39:61 (7). 

In the light of this knowledge it was considered pertinent to ascertain the extent of the variation of the ratio of sickle-cell anemia hemoglobin (SCA hemoglobin) to normal hemoglobin in sicklemic individuals and the effect of various factors on this ratio. Such information not only would increase the knowledge of sickle-cell disease but also might shed some light on the general problem of the control of hemoglobin anabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1985687422,"THE “simplified” method of calculating a linear regression put forward by Aldridge, Berry and Davies1 is the well-known method of orthogonal polynomials which was put on a practical working basis by Fisher2,3. Unfortunately, in bringing this procedure again to the attention of research workers, the authors reproduce a misapprehension when they deduce that “whereas it is considered that four points are a minimum for determining the slope of the line, the number of observations should always be even”, because observations at the centre point of an odd number of values of the independent variable contribute no information to the linear regression."

https://openalex.org/W2083566383,"WHEN swine influenza virus (Shope) is inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 11-day eggs simultaneously with a dye of the Sulphonphthalein group (thymol blue, bromphenol blue, bromcresol green, bromcresol purple, bromthymol blue, phenol red, cresol red, 0.3 ml. of a 1 per thousand solution), it is found after forty-eight hours that a notable decrease in the colour intensity of the allantoic fluid has occurred as compared with that of the allantoic fluid of eggs inoculated with dye alone. We also found that this change in intensity was much less when the dye was inoculated together with human influenza A. For this experiment we used a W.S. strain, which for years had been cultivated on eggs in this Institute. This is also true of the swine influenza strain used for the first experiment. There was but little difference in the hæmagglutination titres of these strains. With this colour reaction it is possible to differentiate between the two strains. We are as yet unable to explain the cause of the change in colour intensity. A quantity of the dye is discoloured or removed from the allantoic fluid. There is no change in the pH of the allantoic fluid during the development of the virus."
