https://openalex.org/W2603296706,"Our understanding of how cells communicate has undergone a paradigm shift since the recent recognition of the role of exosomes in intercellular signaling. In this study, we investigated whether oxygen tension alters the exosome release and miRNA profile from extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells, modifying their bioactivity on endothelial cells (EC). Furthermore, we have established the exosomal miRNA profile at early gestation in women who develop pre-eclampsia (PE) and spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). HTR-8/SVneo cells were used as an EVT model. The effect of oxygen tension (i.e. 8% and 1% oxygen) on exosome release was quantified using nanocrystals (Qdot®) coupled to CD63 by fluorescence NTA. A real-time, live-cell imaging system (Incucyte™) was used to establish the effect of exosomes on EC. Plasma samples were obtained at early gestation (<18 weeks) and classified according to pregnancy outcomes. An Illumina TrueSeq Small RNA kit was used to construct a small RNA library from exosomal RNA obtained from EVT and plasma samples. The number of exosomes was significantly higher in EVT cultured under 1% compared to 8% oxygen. In total, 741 miRNA were identified in exosomes from EVT. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these miRNA were associated with cell migration and cytokine production. Interestingly, exosomes isolated from EVT cultured at 8% oxygen increased EC migration, whilst exosomes cultured at 1% oxygen decreased EC migration. These changes were inversely proportional to TNF-α released from EC. Finally, we have identified a set of unique miRNAs in exosomes from EVT cultured at 1% oxygen and exosomes isolated from the circulation of mothers at early gestation, who later developed PE and SPTB. We suggest that aberrant exosomal signalling by placental cells is a common aetiological factor in pregnancy complications characterised by incomplete SpA remodeling and is therefore a clinically relevant biomarker of pregnancy complications."
https://openalex.org/W2600585167,"The developmental competence of in vitro cultured (IVC) embryos is markedly lower than that of their in vivo counterparts, suggesting the need for optimization of IVC protocols. Embryo culture medium is routinely replaced three days after initial culture in bovine, however, whether this protocol is superior to continuous nonrenewal culture method under current conditions remains unclear. Using bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos as the model, our results showed that compared with routine renewal treatment, nonrenewal culture system significantly improved blastocyst formation, blastocyst quality (increased total cell number, decreased stress and apoptosis, enhanced Oct-4 expression and ratio of ICM/TE), as well as following development to term. Existence and function of SCNT embryo-derived exosomes were then investigated to reveal the cause of impaired development induced by culture medium replacement. Exosomes were successfully isolated through differential centrifugation and identified by both electron microscopy and immunostaining against exosomal membrane marker CD9. Supplementation of extracted exosomes into freshly renewed medium significantly rescued not only blastocyst formation and quality (in vitro development), but also following growth to term (in vivo development). Notably, ratio of ICM/TE and calving rate were enhanced to a similar level as that in nonrenewal group. In conclusion, our results for the first time indicate that 1: bovine SCNT embryos can secrete exosomes into chemically defined culture medium during IVC; 2: secreted exosomes are essential for SCNT blastocyst formation, blastocyst quality, and following development to term; 3: removal of exosomes induced by culture medium replacement impairs SCNT embryo development, which can be avoided by nonrenewal culture procedure or markedly recovered by exosome supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W2602568213,"Introduction Individuals with high levels of mathematics anxiety are more likely to have other forms of anxiety, such as general anxiety and test anxiety, and tend to have some math performance decrement compared to those with low math anxiety. However, it is unclear how the anxiety forms cluster in individuals, or how the presence of other anxiety forms influences the relationship between math anxiety and math performance. Method We measured math anxiety, test anxiety, general anxiety and mathematics and reading performance in 1720 UK students (year 4, aged 8–9, and years 7 and 8, aged 11–13). We conducted latent profile analysis of students’ anxiety scores in order to examine the developmental change in anxiety profiles, the demographics of each anxiety profile and the relationship between profiles and academic performance. Results Anxiety profiles appeared to change in specificity between the two age groups studied. Only in the older students did clusters emerge with specifically elevated general anxiety or academic anxiety (test and math anxiety). Our findings suggest that boys are slightly more likely than girls to have elevated academic anxieties relative to their general anxiety. Year 7/8 students with specifically academic anxiety show lower academic performance than those who also have elevated general anxiety. Conclusions There may be a developmental change in the specificity of anxiety and gender seems to play a strong role in determining one’s anxiety profile. The anxiety profiles present in our year 7/8 sample, and their relationships with math performance, suggest a bidirectional relationship between math anxiety and math performance."
https://openalex.org/W2602256679,"The widespread application of fertilizers has greatly influenced many processes and properties of agroecosystems, and agricultural fertilization is expected to increase even further in the future. To date, most research on fertilizer impacts has used short-term studies, which may be unrepresentative of long-term responses, thus hindering our capacity to predict long-term impacts. Here, we examined the effects of long-term fertilizer addition on key ecosystem properties in a long-term grassland experiment (Palace Leas Hay Meadow) in which farmyard manure (FYM) and inorganic fertilizer treatments have been applied consistently for 120 years in order to characterize the experimental site more fully and compare ecosystem responses with those observed at other long-term and short-term experiments. FYM inputs increased soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, hay yield, nutrient availability and acted as a buffer against soil acidification (>pH 5). In contrast, N-containing inorganic fertilizers strongly acidified the soil (<pH 4.5) and increased surface SOC stocks by increasing the C stored in the coarse (2.8 mm-200 μm) and fine (200-50 μm) fractions. Application of N fertilizers also reduced plant species richness and the abundance of forbs and legumes. Overall, our results were broadly consistent with those observed in other very long-term studies (the Park Grass and Steinach Grassland experiments) in that fertilization effects on plant and soil properties appeared to be driven by differences in both nutrient input and changes to soil pH. We also established that the direction of long-term fertilization effects tended to be comparable with short-term experiments, but that their magnitude differed considerably, particularly where ammonium sulphate-induced acidification had occurred. We therefore conclude that short-term studies are unlikely to possess the required timeframe to accurately predict long-term responses, thus necessitating the use of long-term study sites. Such experiments should be strategically established in regions where future fertilizer use is expected to increase rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W2598531881,"Wild birds are considered as a reservoir for avian chlamydiosis posing a potential infectious threat to domestic poultry and humans. Analysis of 894 cloacal or fecal swabs from free-living birds in Poland revealed an overall Chlamydiaceae prevalence of 14.8% (n = 132) with the highest prevalence noted in Anatidae (19.7%) and Corvidae (13.4%). Further testing conducted with species-specific real-time PCR showed that 65 samples (49.2%) were positive for C. psittaci whereas only one was positive for C. avium. To classify the non-identified chlamydial agents and to genotype the C. psittaci and C. avium-positive samples, specimens were subjected to ompA-PCR and sequencing (n = 83). The ompA-based NJ dendrogram revealed that only 23 out of 83 sequences were assigned to C. psittaci, in particular to four clades representing the previously described C. psittaci genotypes B, C, Mat116 and 1V. Whereas the 59 remaining sequences were assigned to two new clades named G1 and G2, each one including sequences recently obtained from chlamydiae detected in Swedish wetland birds. G1 (18 samples from Anatidae and Rallidae) grouped closely together with genotype 1V and in relative proximity to several C. abortus isolates, and G2 (41 samples from Anatidae and Corvidae) grouped closely to C. psittaci strains of the classical ABE cluster, Matt116 and M56. Finally, deep molecular analysis of four representative isolates of genotypes 1V, G1 and G2 based on 16S rRNA, IGS and partial 23S rRNA sequences as well as MLST clearly classify these isolates within the C. abortus species. Consequently, we propose an expansion of the C. abortus species to include not only the classical isolates of mammalian origin, but also avian isolates so far referred to as atypical C. psittaci or C. psittaci/C. abortus intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2602460727,"Objectives The aim of this study is to examine the bidirectional association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods The data was derived from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort study, which was established in 2008 and followed until October 2013. NAFLD was classified as none, mild, moderate/severe based on ultrasound examination. The analysis to examine the association between NAFLD and incident T2DM risk included 18,111 participants free of diabetes at baseline and the duration of follow-up was 4.60 ± 0.60 years. Cox proportional regression model was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for the association. The analysis to investigate the association between T2DM and incident NAFLD risk included 12,435 participants free of NAFLD at baseline. Logistic regression model was used to calculate the odd ratio (OR) of NAFLD. Results Compared with those without NAFLD, individuals with mild or moderate/severe NAFLD had a monotonic elevated risk of developing T2DM (HR: 1.88 [95% CI: 1.63–2.18] and 2.34 [1.85–2.96], respectively) after adjustment for potential confounders. In a parallel analysis, compared to participants with fasting plasma glucose < 6.1 mmol/L, the ORs of developing NAFLD in subjects with impaired fasting glucose and T2DM were 1.35 (95% CI: 1.16–1.57) and 1.40 (95% CI: 1.22–1.62), respectively. Conclusions Our results provide compelling evidence that the NAFLD-T2DM association is bidirectional in Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2603526864,"The scientific foundation for the criticism on the use of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) in evaluations of individual researchers and their publications was laid between 1989 and 1997 in a series of articles by Per O. Seglen. His basic work has since influenced initiatives such as the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), the Leiden Manifesto for research metrics, and The Metric Tide review on the role of metrics in research assessment and management. Seglen studied the publications of only 16 senior biomedical scientists. We investigate whether Seglen's main findings still hold when using the same methods for a much larger group of Norwegian biomedical scientists with more than 18,000 publications. Our results support and add new insights to Seglen's basic work."
https://openalex.org/W2601074930,"Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are constantly subjected to many biotic stressors including parasites. This study examined honeybees infected with Nosema ceranae (N. ceranae). N. ceranae infection increases the bees energy requirements and may contribute to their decreased survival. RNA-seq was used to investigate gene expression at days 5, 10 and 15 Post Infection (P.I) with N. ceranae. The expression levels of genes, isoforms, alternative transcription start sites (TSS) and differential promoter usage revealed a complex pattern of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation suggesting that bees use a range of tactics to cope with the stress of N. ceranae infection. N. ceranae infection may cause reduced immune function in the bees by: (i)disturbing the host amino acids metabolism (ii) down-regulating expression of antimicrobial peptides (iii) down-regulation of cuticle coatings and (iv) down-regulation of odorant binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2598218422,"Least-cost modelling and circuit theory are common analogs used in ecology and evolution to model gene flow or animal movement across landscapes. Least-cost modelling estimates the least-cost distance, whereas circuit theory estimates resistance distance. The bias added in choosing one method over the other has not been well documented. We designed an experiment to test whether both methods were linearly related. We also tested the sensitivity of these metrics to variation in Euclidean distance, spatial autocorrelation, the number of pixels representing the landscape, and data aggregation. We found that least-cost and resistance distance were not linearly related unless a transformation was applied. Resistance distance was less sensitive to the number of pixels representing a landscape and was also less sensitive than least-cost distance to the Euclidean distance between nodes. Spatial autocorrelation did not affect either method or the relationship between methods. Resistance distance was more sensitive to aggregation in any form compared to least-cost distance. Therefore, the metric used to infer movement or gene flow and the manipulations applied to the data used to calculate these metrics may govern findings."
https://openalex.org/W2599204705,"The present study was aimed to examine whether icariin, a traditional Chinese medicine, could improve therapeutic effects of adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) for diabetes-associated erectile dysfunction (DMED). DMED were induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin and confirmed by erectile function measurement. Then, rats of diabetic ED were randomly divided to receive the treatment of saline, ADSCs, icariin or ADSCs combined with icariin respectively. Compared with the treatment by ADSCs or icariin alone, intracavernosum injection of ADSCs combined with the following daily gastric gavage of icariin significantly augmented the value of ICP and ICP/MAP (p<0.01). Meanwhile, the survival of transplanted ADSCs was much improved due to the application of icariin. Similarly, immunofluorescent staining analysis demonstrated that the improved erectile tissue structure by combination of ADSCs and icariin was significantly associated with the increased expression of endothelial markers (vWF) (p<0.01) and smooth muscle markers (α-SMA) (p<0.01). Furthermore, the structure changes in corpus cavernosum were further confirmed by the Masson’s trichrome staining. To explore the possible mechanism underlying icariin-enhanced therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, we employed an in vitro testing system by introducing H2O2 to imitate oxidative stress condition considering the oxidative environment faced by engrafted ADSCs and anti-oxidative capacity of icariin. In vitro, we found that the addition of icariin considerably reduced the apoptosis of ADSCs, and attenuated the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), the superoxidase dismutase (SOD) activity and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Subsequently, we examined the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and explored the potential signaling pathway through which icariin promoted the survival of ADSCs against oxidative stress. It was demonstrated that icariin significantly inhibited the upregulation of apoptosis-related proteins under oxidative condition, including Bax and cleaved caspase-3, while promoted the expression of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2. These effects were accompanied with the activation of signal molecules, PI3K/Akt and STAT3. The further signal protein inhibition assays exhibited that the suppression of STAT3 abrogated the icariin-mediated anti-apoptotic effects observed above, while did not influence the expression of PI3K/Akt. However, PI3K inhibition could abrogate icariin–mediated STAT3 activation and achieved a similar effect as STAT3 inhibition. Our results suggested that icariin was an effective adjuvant for enhancing ADSC-based therapy of DMEM, which may be ascribed to their protection of ADSCs against oxidative stress via the regulation of PI3K/Akt-STAT3 signal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2597512928,"In the adult skeleton, cells of the immune system interact with those of the skeleton during all phases of bone repair to influence the outcome. Mast cells are immune cells best known for their pathologic role in allergy, and may be involved in chronic inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. Potential roles for mast cells in tissue homeostasis, vascularization and repair remain enigmatic. Previous studies in combined mast cell- and Kit-deficient KitW-sh/W-sh mice (KitW-sh) implicated mast cells in bone repair but KitW-sh mice suffer from additional Kit-dependent hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic deficiencies that could have confounded the outcome. The goal of the current study was to compare bone repair in normal wild type (WT) and Cpa3Cre/+ mice, which lack mast cells in the absence of any other hematopoietic or non- hematopoietic deficiencies. Repair of a femoral window defect was characterized using micro CT imaging and histological analyses from the early inflammatory phase, through soft and hard callus formation, and finally the remodeling phase. The data indicate 1) mast cells appear in healing bone of WT mice but not Cpa3Cre/+ mice, beginning 14 days after surgery; 2) re-vascularization of repair tissue and deposition of mineralized bone was delayed and dis-organised in Cpa3Cre/+ mice compared with WT mice; 3) the defects in Cpa3Cre/+ mice were associated with little change in anabolic activity and biphasic alterations in osteoclast and macrophage activity. The outcome at 56 days postoperative was complete bridging of the defect in most WT mice and fibrous mal-union in most Cpa3Cre/+ mice. The results indicate that mast cells promote bone healing, possibly by recruiting vascular endothelial cells during the inflammatory phase and coordinating anabolic and catabolic activity during tissue remodeling. Taken together the data indicate that mast cells have a positive impact on bone repair."
https://openalex.org/W2599192857,"We examined the downriver patterns of variation in taxonomic diversity of the Mississippi River bacterioplankton microbiome along 1,300 river kilometers, or approximately one third the total length of the river. The study section included portions of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Mississippi River, confluences with five tributaries draining distinct sub-basins, river cities, and extended stretches without major inputs to the Mississippi. The composition and proportional abundance of dominant bacterial phyla was distinct for free-living and particle-associated cells, and constant along the entire reach, except for a substantial but transient disturbance near the city of Memphis, Tennessee. At a finer scale of taxonomic resolution (operational taxonomic units, OTUs), however, there were notable patterns in downriver variation in bacterial community alpha diversity (richness within a site) and beta diversity (variation in composition among sites). There was a strong and steady increase downriver in alpha diversity of OTUs on suspended particles, suggesting an increase in particle niche heterogeneity, and/or particle colonization. Relatively large shifts in beta diversity of free-living and particle-associated communities occurred following major tributary confluences and transiently at Memphis, while in long stretches between these points diversity typically varied more gradually. We conclude that the Mississippi River possesses a bacterioplankton microbiome distinct in diversity from other large river microbiomes in the Mississippi River Basin, that at major river confluences or urban point sources its OTU diversity may shift abruptly and substantially, presumably by immigration of distinct external microbiomes, but that where environmental conditions are more stable along the downriver gradient, microbiome diversity tends to vary gradually, presumably by a process of successional change in community composition."
https://openalex.org/W2598369800,"The fetal membrane surrounds the fetus during pregnancy and is a thin tissue composed of two layers, the chorion and the amnion. While rupture of this membrane normally occurs at term, preterm rupture can result in increased risk of fetal mortality and morbidity, as well as danger of infection in the mother. Although structural changes have been observed in the membrane in such cases, the mechanical behaviour of the human fetal membrane in vivo remains poorly understood and is challenging to investigate experimentally. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop simplified finite element models to investigate the mechanical behaviour and rupture of the fetal membrane, particularly its constituent layers, under various physiological conditions. It was found that modelling the chorion and amnion as a single layer predicts remarkably different behaviour compared with a more anatomically-accurate bilayer, significantly underestimating stress in the amnion and under-predicting the risk of membrane rupture. Additionally, reductions in chorion-amnion interface lubrication and chorion thickness (reported in cases of preterm rupture) both resulted in increased membrane stress. Interestingly, the inclusion of a weak zone in the fetal membrane that has been observed to develop overlying the cervix would likely cause it to fail at term, during labour. Finally, these findings support the theory that the amnion is the dominant structural component of the fetal membrane and is required to maintain its integrity. The results provide a novel insight into the mechanical effect of structural changes in the chorion and amnion, in cases of both normal and preterm rupture."
https://openalex.org/W2601369491,"Fibrosis in multiple organs, including the liver, kidney, and lung, often occurs secondary to environmental exposure. Asbestos exposure is one important environmental cause of lung fibrosis. The mechanisms that mediate fibrosis is not fully understood, although mitochondrial oxidative stress in alveolar macrophages is critical for fibrosis development. Mitochondrial Ca2+ levels can be associated with production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we show that patients with asbestosis have higher levels of mitochondrial Ca2+ compared with normal patients. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is a highly selective ion channel that transports Ca2+ into the mitochondrial matrix to modulate metabolism. Asbestos exposure increased mitochondrial Ca2+ influx in alveolar macrophages from wild-type, but not MCU+/‒, mice. MCU expression polarized macrophages to a profibrotic phenotype after exposure to asbestos, and the profibrotic polarization was regulated by MCU-mediated ATP production. Profibrotic polarization was abrogated when MCU was absent or its activity was blocked. Of more importance, mice that were deficient in MCU were protected from pulmonary fibrosis. Regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ suggests that MCU may play a pivotal role in the development of fibrosis and could potentially be a therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.—Gu, L., Larson-Casey, J.

https://openalex.org/W2600990049,"Cataract, a leading cause of blindness, is of special concern in diabetics as it occurs at earlier onset. Polyol accumulation and increased oxidative-nitrosative stress in cataractogenesis are associated with NFκB activation, iNOS expression, ATP depletion, loss of ATPase functions, calpain activation and proteolysis of soluble to insoluble proteins. Tocotrienol was previously shown to reduce lens oxidative stress and inhibit cataractogenesis in galactose-fed rats. In current study, we investigated anticataract effects of topical tocotrienol and possible mechanisms involved in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Diabetic rats were treated with vehicle (DV) or tocotrienol (DT). A third group consists of normal, non-diabetic rats were treated with vehicle (NV). All treatments were given topically, bilaterally, twice daily for 8 weeks with weekly slit lamp monitoring. Subsequently, rats were euthanized and lenses were subjected to estimation of polyol accumulation, oxidative-nitrosative stress, NFκB activation, iNOS expression, ATP levels, ATPase activities, calpain activity and total protein levels. Cataract progression was delayed from the fifth week onwards in DT with lower mean of cataract stages compared to DV group (p<0.01) despite persistent hyperglycemia. Reduced cataractogenesis in DT group was accompanied with lower aldose reductase activity and sorbitol level compared to DV group (p<0.01). DT group also showed reduced NFκB activation, lower iNOS expression and reduced oxidative-nitrosative stress compared to DV group. Lenticular ATP and ATPase and calpain 2 activities in DT group were restored to normal. Consequently, soluble to insoluble protein ratio in DT group was higher compared to DV (p<0.05). In conclusion, preventive effect of topical tocotrienol on development of cataract in STZ-induced diabetic rats could be attributed to reduced lens aldose reductase activity, polyol levels and oxidative-nitrosative stress. These effects of tocotrienol invlove reduced NFκB activation, lower iNOS expression, restoration of ATP level, ATPase activities, calpain activity and lens protein levels."
https://openalex.org/W2597980462,"Aim Rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) is a malignancy cancer with the high morbidity and motility worldwide. Our study aimed to explore the potential pathogenesis of READ through integrated analysis of gene expression profiling and DNA methylation data. Methods The miRNA, mRNA expression profiling and corresponding DNA methylation data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Differentially expressed mRNAs/ miRNAs/methylated regions (DEmRNA/DEmiRNAs) were identified in READ. The negatively correlation of DEmiRNA-DEmRNAs and DNA methylation-DEmRNAs were obtained. DEmRNAs expression was validated through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and microarray expression profiling analyses. Results 1192 dysregulated DEmRNAs, 27 dysregulated DEmiRNAs and 6403 aberrant methylation CpG sites were screened in READ compared to normal controls. 1987 negative interaction pairs among 27 DEmiRNAs and 668 DEmRNAs were predicted. 446 genes with aberrant methylation were annotated. Eventually, 50 DEmRNAs (39 down- and 11 up-regulated DEmRNAs) with hypermethylation, synchronously negatively targeted by DEmiRNAs, were identified through the correlation analysis among 446 genes with aberrant methylation and 668 DEmRNAs. 50 DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in cAMP signaling pathway, circadian entrainment and glutamatergic synapse. The validation results of expression levels of DEmRNAs through qRT-PCR and microarray analyses were compatible with our study. Conclusion 7 genes of SORCS1, PDZRN4, LONRF2, CNGA3, HAND2, RSPO2 and GNAO1 with hypermethylation and negatively regulation by DEmiRNAs might contribute to the tumorigenesis of READ. Our work might provide valuable foundation for the READ in mechanism elucidation, early diagnosis and therapeutic target identification."
https://openalex.org/W2600193277,"It has been suspected that friction in hip implants is higher when walking is initiated after a resting period than during continuous movement. It cannot be excluded that such increased initial moments endanger the cup fixation in the acetabulum, overstress the taper connections in the implant or increase wear. To assess these risks, the contact forces, friction moments and friction coefficients in the joint were measured in vivo in ten subjects. Instrumented hip joint implants with telemetric data transmission were used to access the contact loads between the cup and head during the first steps of walking after a short rest.The analysis demonstrated that the contact force is not increased during the first step. The friction moment in the joint, however, is much higher during the first step than during continuous walking. The moment increases throughout the gait cycle were 32% to 143% on average and up to 621% individually. The high initial moments will probably not increase wear by much in the joint. However, comparisons with literature data on the fixation resistance of the cup against moments made clear that the stability can be endangered. This risk is highest during the first postoperative months for cementless cups with insufficient under-reaming. The high moments after a break can also put taper connections between the head and neck and neck and shaft at a higher risk.During continuous walking, the friction moments individually were extremely varied by factors of 4 to 10. Much of this difference is presumably caused by the varying lubrication properties of the synovia. These large moment variations can possibly lead to friction-induced temperature increases during walking, which are higher than the 43.1°C which have previously been observed in a group of only five subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2597578478,"Growing evidence links perceived stress-a potentially modifiable psychosocial risk factor-with health behaviors and obesity. Yet little is known about the relationship between stress during pregnancy and gestational weight gain, particularly among women with pregnancy complications. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to examine associations between psychosocial stress during pregnancy and gestational weight gain among women with gestational diabetes. We used baseline data from the Gestational Diabetes's Effects on Moms (GEM) study: 1,353 women with gestational diabetes who delivered a term singleton within Kaiser Permanente Northern California were included. Perceived stress near the time of gestational diabetes diagnosis was measured using the validated Perceived Stress Scale (PSS10). Gestational weight gain was categorized according to the 2009 Institute of Medicine recommendations. Binomial regression analyses adjusted for gestational age and maternal age at the time of gestational diabetes diagnosis, and race/ethnicity and estimated rate ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI). Among women with a normal pregravid Body Mass Index (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), there was a significant association between high (Q4) PSS score and risk of both exceeding and gaining below the Institute of Medicine recommendations compared to those with lower stress (Q1) [adjusted RR = 2.16 95% CI 1.45-3.21; RR = 1.39 95% CI 1.01-1.91, respectively.] Among women with pregravid overweight/obesity (BMI≥25 kg/m2), there was no association. Although the temporal relationship could not be established from this study, there may be a complex interplay between psychosocial stress and gestational weight gain among women with gestational diabetes. Further studies examining stress earlier in pregnancy, risk of developing gestational diabetes and excess/inadequate gestational weight gain are warranted to clarify these complex relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2599378387,"The neurotrophic factor neuregulin 1 (NRG1) regulates neuronal development, glial differentiation, and excitatory synapse maturation. NRG1 is synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor and is then liberated by proteolytic processing or exocytosis. Mature NRG1 then binds to its receptors expressed by neighboring neurons or glial cells. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern this process in the nervous system are not defined in detail. Here we prepared neuron-enriched and glia-enriched cultures from embryonic rat neocortex to investigate the role of neurotransmitters that regulate the liberation/release of NRG1 from the membrane of neurons or glial cells. Using a two-site enzyme immunoassay to detect soluble NRG1, we show that, of various neurotransmitters, glutamate was the most potent inducer of NRG1 release in neuron-enriched cultures. NRG1 release in glia-enriched cultures was relatively limited. Furthermore, among glutamate receptor agonists, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) and kainate (KA), but not AMPA or tACPD, mimicked the effects of glutamate. Similar findings were acquired from analysis of the hippocampus of rats with KA-induced seizures. To evaluate the contribution of members of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) families to NRG1 release, we transfected primary cultures of neurons with cDNA vectors encoding NRG1 types I, II, or III precursors, each tagged with the alkaline phosphatase reporter. Analysis of alkaline phosphatase activity revealed that the NRG1 type II precursor was subjected to tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) / a Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) -dependent ectodomain shedding in a protein kinase C-dependent manner. These results suggest that glutamatergic neurotransmission positively regulates the ectodomain shedding of NRG1 type II precursors and liberates the active NRG1 domain in an activity-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2597774543,"Progressive reduction of SnoN is associated with gradual elevation of TGF-β1 during diabetic nephropathy progression, suggesting SnoN to be a possible mediator of TGF-β1 signaling, with potential therapeutic benefits against TGF- β1 -induced renal fibrosis. To characterize SnoN for its role in renal fibrosis, we assessed SnoN expression patterns in response to high glucose stress, and evaluated the effects of upregulating SnoN on renal fibrosis. High glucose stress induced significantly elevated SnoN, TGF-β1, and Arkadia transcription; however, significantly reduced SnoN protein levels were observed under these conditions. Upregulating the SnoN protein was achieved by Arkadia knockdown, which resulted in inhibited high glucose-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in renal tubular cells, the onset phase of renal fibrosis. Alternatively, EMT was suppressed by dominantly expressed exogenous SnoN without interfering with TGF-β1. Overall, renal SnoN upregulation ameliorates renal fibrosis by relieving high glucose-induced EMT; these findings support a translational approach targeting SnoN for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2601256550,"A comparative study of the corrosion resistance of CoCr and NiCr alloys in artificial saliva (AS) containing tryptic soy broth (Solution 1) and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) species (Solution 2) was performed by electrochemical methods, including open circuit potential measurements, impedance spectroscopy, and potentiodynamic polarization. The adherence of S. mutans to the NiCr and CoCr alloy surfaces immersed in Solution 2 for 24 h was verified by scanning electron microscopy, while the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed the importance of biofilm formation for the corrosion process. The R(QR) equivalent circuit was successfully used to fit the data obtained for the AS mixture without S. mutans, while the R(Q(R(QR))) circuit was found to be more suitable for describing the biofilm properties after treatment with the AS containing S. mutans species. In addition, a negative shift of the open circuit potential with immersion time was observed for all samples regardless of the solution type. Both alloys exhibited higher charge transfer resistance after treatment with Solution 2, and lower corrosion current densities were detected for all samples in the presence of S. mutans. The obtained results suggest that the biofilm formation observed after 24 h of exposure to S. mutans bacteria might enhance the corrosion resistance of the studied samples by creating physical barriers that prevented oxygen interactions with the metal surfaces."

Despite the significant efforts, the understanding of the principles and underlying mechanisms of this modulatory circuit and the emergence of abnormal synchronized oscillations in movement disorders is still challenging. Dopamine loss has been proved to be responsible for Parkinson’s disease. We quantitatively described the dynamics of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit in Parkinson’s disease in terms of the emergence of both abnormal firing rates and firing patterns in the circuit. We developed a potential landscape and flux framework for exploring the modulatory circuit. The driving force of the circuit can be decomposed into a gradient of the potential, which is associated with the steady-state probability distributions, and the curl probability flux term. We uncovered the underlying potential landscape as a Mexican hat-shape closed ring valley where abnormal oscillations emerge due to dopamine depletion. We quantified the global stability of the network through the topography of the landscape in terms of the barrier height, which is defined as the potential difference between the maximum potential inside the ring and the minimum potential along the ring. Both a higher barrier and a larger flux originated from detailed balance breaking result in more stable oscillations. Meanwhile, more energy is consumed to support the increasing flux. Global sensitivity analysis on the landscape topography and flux indicates how changes in underlying neural network regulatory wirings and external inputs influence the dynamics of the system. We validated two of the main hypotheses(direct inhibition hypothesis and output activation hypothesis) on the therapeutic mechanism of deep brain stimulation (DBS). We found GPe appears to be another effective stimulated target for DBS besides GPi and STN. Our approach provides a general way to quantitatively explore neural networks and may help for uncovering more efficacious therapies for movement disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2599275795,"Background Advanced prostate cancers that are resistant to all current therapies create a need for new therapeutic strategies. One recent innovative approach to cancer therapy is the simultaneous use of multiple FDA-approved drugs to target multiple pathways. A challenge for this approach is caused by the different solubility requirements of each individual drug, resulting in the need for a drug vehicle that is non-toxic and capable of carrying multiple water-insoluble antitumor drugs. Micelles have recently been shown to be new candidate drug solubilizers for anti cancer therapy. Methods This study set out to examine the potential use of multi-drug loaded micelles for prostate cancer treatment in preclinical models including cell line and mouse models for prostate cancers with Pten deletions. Specifically antimitotic agent docetaxel, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, and HSP90 inhibitor 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin were incorporated into the micelle system (DR17) and tested for antitumor efficacy. Results In vitro growth inhibition of prostate cancer cells was greater when all three drugs were used in combination compared to each individual drug, and packaging the drugs into micelles enhanced the cytotoxic effects. At the molecular level DR17 targeted simultaneously several molecular signaling axes important in prostate cancer including androgen receptor, mTOR, and PI3K/AKT. In a mouse genetic model of prostate cancer, DR17 treatment decreased prostate weight, which was achieved by both increasing caspase-dependent cell death and decreasing cell proliferation. Similar effects were also observed when DR17 was administered to nude mice bearing prostate cancer cells xenografts. Conclusion These results suggest that combining these three cancer drugs in multi-drug loaded micelles may be a promising strategy for prostate cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2599662916,"Routine blood tests provide important basic information for disease diagnoses. The proportions of three subtypes of white blood cells (WBCs), which are neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, is key information for disease diagnosis. However, current instruments for routine blood tests, such as blood cell analyzers, flow cytometers, and optical microscopes, are cumbersome, time consuming and expensive. To make a smaller, automatic low-cost blood cell analyzer, much research has focused on a technique called lens-less shadow imaging, which can obtain microscopic images of cells in a lens-less system. Nevertheless, the efficiency of this imaging system is not satisfactory because of two problems: low resolution and imaging diffraction phenomena. In this paper, a novel method of classifying cells with the shadow imaging technique was proposed. It could be used for the classification of the three subtypes of WBCs, and the correlation of the results of classification between the proposed system and the reference system (BC-5180, Mindray) was 0.93. However, the instrument was only 10 × 10 × 10 cm, and the cost was less than $100. Depending on the lens-free shadow imaging technology, the main hardware could be integrated on a chip scale and could be called an on-chip instrument."
https://openalex.org/W2601031405,"The 7-oxysterols are recognised as strong enhancers of inflammatory processes in foamy macrophages. Atheroma-relevant 7-oxysterol mixtures induce a mixed type of cell death in macrophages, and trigger cellular oxidative stress responses, which mimic oxidative exposures observed in atherosclerotic lesions. However, the macrophage proteome has not previously been determined in the 7-oxysterol treated cell model. The aim of the present study was to determine the specific effects of an atheroma-relevant 7-oxysterol mixture on human macrophage proteome. Human THP-1 macrophages were exposed to an atheroma-relevant mixture of 7β-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry techniques were used to analyse the alterations in macrophage proteome, which resulted in the identification of 19 proteins with significant differential expression upon oxysterol loading; 8 increased and 11 decreased. The expression patterns of 11 out of 19 identified significant proteins were further confirmed by tandem-mass spectrometry, including further validation of increased histone deacetylase 2 and macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II expressions by western blot analysis. Identified proteins with differential expression in the cell model have been associated with i) signalling imbalance in cell death and cellular longevity; ii) lipid uptake and metabolism in foam cells; and iii) inflammatory proteins. The presented findings highlight a new proteomic platform for further studies into the functional roles of macrophages in atherosclerosis, and present a cell model for future studies to modulate the macrophage proteome by potential anti-atherosclerotic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2601706659,"While the effects of growth from birth to expected term on the subsequent development of preterm children has attracted plentiful attention, less is known about the effects of post-term growth. We aimed to delineate distinct patterns of post-term growth and to determine their association with the cognitive development of preterm children. Data from a prospective population-based cohort of 3,850 surviving infants born at less than 35 weeks of gestational age were used. Growth was assessed as the Body Mass Index (BMI) Z-scores at 3, 9, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. Cognitive development at five years of age was evaluated by the Global School Adaptation score (GSA). Latent class analysis was implemented to identify distinct growth patterns and logistic regressions based on propensity matching were used to evaluate the relationship between identified growth trajectories and cognitive development. Four patterns of post-term growth were identified: a normal group with a Z-score consistently around zero during childhood (n = 2,469; 64%); a group with an early rapid rise in the BMI Z-score, but only up to 2 years of age (n = 195; 5%); a group with a slow yet steady rise in the BMI Z-score during childhood (n = 510; 13%); and a group with a negative Z-score growth until 3 years of age (n = 676; 18%). The group with a slow yet steady rise in the BMI Z-score was significantly associated with low GSA scores. Our findings indicate heterogeneous post-term growth of preterm children, with potential for association with their cognitive development."
https://openalex.org/W2600718354,"The development of dermal equivalents (DEs) for the treatment of burns has contributed toward efficient wound closure. A collagen-glycosaminoglycan DE (C-GAG) grafted with hair follicles converted a full-thickness wound to partial-thickness resulting in complete wound closure and restored hair. In this study we compared the ability of both intact pilosebaceous units (PSU) or truncated hair follicles (THF) to regenerate a multilayered epidermis in vitro when implanted into de-epidermalized dermis (DED) or C-GAG with the epidermis generated in vivo using C-CAG. Keratinocytes explanted from the outer root sheath of PSU and THF in both DED and C-GAG but only formed a multilayered epidermis with PSU in DED. PSU were more effective at forming multilayered epidermis in DED than THF. Both DED and C-GAG skin expressed proliferation (PCNA), differentiation (K1, K10), hyperproliferation (K6, K16), basal (K14), putative stem cell (p63), extracellular matrix protein (Collagen IV), mesenchymal (vimentin) and adherens junction (β-catenin) markers. These data suggest DEs supported initial maintenance of the implanted hair follicles, in particular PSU, and provide an excellent model with which to investigate the regulation of hair follicle progenitor epithelial cells during epidermal regeneration. Although neither PSU nor THF formed multilayered epidermis in C-CAG in vitro, hair follicles implanted into engrafted C-GAG on a burns patient resulted in epithelial regeneration and expression of proliferation and differentiation markers in a similar manner to that seen in vitro. However, the failure of C-GAG to support epidermal regeneration in vitro suggests in vivo factors are essential for full epidermal regeneration using C-GAG."

This study evaluated an intervention designed to increase the percent of children meeting this MVPA guideline.Two-group, pre-post quasi-experimental.Twenty SDCs serving 1,830 children aged 5-12 years were assigned to MVPA intervention (n = 10) or healthy eating attention control (n = 10).The STEPs (Strategies to Enhance Practice) intervention is a capacity-building approach grounded in the Theory of Expanded, Extended and Enhanced Opportunities. Camp leaders and staff receive training to expand (e.g., introduction of activity breaks/active field trips), extend (e.g., schedule minimum of 3 hours/day for PA opportunities), and enhance (e.g., maximize MVPA children accumulate during schedule activity) activity opportunities. Camps in the comparison condition received support for improving the types of foods/beverages served.Percent of children accumulating the 60min/d MVPA guideline at baseline (summer 2015) and post-test (summer 2016) measured via wrist-accelerometry.Multilevel logistic regression conducted fall 2016 indicated boys and girls attending intervention SDCs were 2.04 (95CI = 1.10,3.78) and 3.84 (95CI = 2.02,7.33) times more likely to meet the 60min/d guideline compared to boys and girls attending control SDCs, respectively. This corresponded to increases of +10.6% (78-89%) and +12.6% (69-82%) in the percentage of boys and girls meeting the guideline in intervention SDCs, respectively. Boys in comparison SDCs increased by +1.6% (81-83%) and girls decreased by -5.5% (76-71%). Process data indicated intervention SDCs successfully extended and enhanced PA opportunities, but were unable to expand PA opportunities, compared to control SDCs.Although substantial proportions of children met the MVPA guideline at baseline, no SDCs ensured all children met the guideline. This intervention demonstrated that, with support, SDCs can help all children in attendance to accumulate their daily recommended 60min MVPA.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02161809."
https://openalex.org/W2598332240,"The dissociation between specific IgE and skin prick test reactivity to aeroallergens, a common finding in populations living in low and middle-income countries, has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. Few studies have investigated the determinants of this dissociation. In the present study, we explored potential factors explaining this dissociation in children living in an urban area of Northeast Brazil, focusing in particular on factors associated with poor hygiene.Of 1445 children from low income communities, investigated for risk factors of allergies, we studied 481 with specific IgE antibodies to any of Blomia tropicalis, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Periplaneta americana and Blatella germanica allergens. Data on demographic, environmental and social exposures were collected by questionnaire; serum IgG and stool examinations were done to detect current or past infections with viral, bacterial, protozoan and intestinal helminth pathogens. We measured atopy by skin prick testing (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) to aerollergens in serum (by ImmunoCAP). SIgE reactivity to B. tropicalis extract depleted of carbohydrates was measured by an in-house ELISA. Total IgE was measured by in house capture ELISA. SNPs were typed using Illumina Omni 2.5.Negative skin prick tests in the presence of specific IgE antibodies were frequent. Factors independently associated with a reduced frequency of positive skin prick tests were large number of siblings, the presence of IgG to herpes simplex virus, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura infections, living in neighborhoods with infrequent garbage collection, presence of rodents and cats in the household and sIgE reactivity to glycosylated B. tropicalis allergens. Also, SNP on IGHE (rs61737468) was negatively associated with SPT reactivity.A variety of factors were found to be associated with decreased frequency of SPT such as unhygienic living conditions, infections, total IgE, IgE response to glycosylated allergens and genetic polymorphisms, indicating that multiple mechanisms may be involved. Our data, showing that exposures to an unhygienic environment and childhood infections modulate immediate allergen skin test reactivity, provide support for the ""hygiene hypothesis""."

The results indicated that the groups containing Mn significantly promoted mycelia growth rates, and all the experimental groups resulted in higher yields than the control (P<0.01), although their mycelia and sclerotia did not show obvious differences. It was also found that Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroides, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae were the dominated bacterial phyla. The Zn·Fe group had an unexpectedly high proportion (75.49%) of Proteobacteria during the primordial differentiation stage, while Pseudomonas also occupied a high proportion (5.52%) in this group. These results suggested that different trace elements clearly affected morel yields and soil bacterial community structures, particularly due to the high proportions of Pseudomonas during the primordial differentiation stage."

As disorders arising from dysregulated energy metabolism, such as obesity and metabolic diseases, have increased, so has interest in the molecular mechanisms of adipocyte biology. Using a functional screen, we identified cyclin C (CycC), a conserved subunit of the Mediator complex, as a novel regulator for brown adipocyte formation. siRNA-mediated CycC knockdown (KD) in brown preadipocytes impaired the early transcriptional program of differentiation, and genetic KO of CycC completely blocked the differentiation process. RNA sequencing analyses of CycC-KD revealed a critical role of CycC in activating genes co-regulated by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα). Overexpression of PPARγ2 or addition of the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone rescued the defects in CycC-KO brown preadipocytes and efficiently activated the PPARγ-responsive promoters in both WT and CycC-KO cells, suggesting that CycC is not essential for PPARγ transcriptional activity. In contrast, CycC-KO significantly reduced C/EBPα-dependent gene expression.

These studies suggest the involvement of the Mediator complex in adipogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are distinct for different subunits. It is currently unclear whether other Mediator subunits also regulate adipogenesis. In this study, we identify cyclin C (CycC) as a novel regulator of adipogenesis. Unlike classical cyclins, CycC does not directly regulate the cell cycle but acts as a conserved subunit of the Mediator complex. Here we show that CycC is essential for adipogenesis. In contrast to MED1, MED14, and MED23, CycC functions primarily to support C/EBPα-mediated gene expression in adipogenesis. To study brown adipocyte biology, we established mouse brown preadipocyte cell lines according to protocols published previously (49Klein J. Fasshauer M. Ito M. Lowell B.B. Benito M. Kahn C.R. β(3)-Adrenergic stimulation differentially inhibits insulin signaling and decreases insulin-induced glucose uptake in brown adipocytes.J. Biol.

Selection of single clones was based on the efficiency of lipid accumulation as assayed by oil red O staining (Fig. 1A) as well as the induction of marker genes (i.e. the common adipocyte marker Fabp4, Fig. 1B, and the brown adipocyte-specific marker Ucp1, Fig. 1C) as detected by qRT-PCR in the presence of differentiation mixture (49Klein J. Fasshauer M. Ito M. Lowell B.B. Benito M. Kahn C.R. β(3)-Adrenergic stimulation differentially inhibits insulin signaling and decreases insulin-induced glucose uptake in brown adipocytes.J. Biol.

Differential roles of insulin receptor substrates in brown adipocyte differentiation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1918-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To identify novel regulators that control the formation of brown adipocytes, we transduced immortalized brown preadipocytes with a lentiviral library of shRNA, which included a total of 4551 protein-coding genes (Fig. 1D), and six or more independent sequences of shRNA were designed to target each gene. Before induction of differentiation, a small portion of those transduced cells was collected to determine the initial abundance of each shRNA in the library (i.e. control), and the remaining cells were cultured to confluence, followed by induction for 8 days (Fig. 1D). Taking advantage of the floating nature of lipid-filled adipocytes, we were able to isolate undifferentiated cells, which had little lipid droplets and were adherent, by two rounds of trypsin digestion and replating (Fig. 1D). We then extracted the genomic DNA from undifferentiated cells that were collected before and after induction. The gene identities were determined according to shRNA barcode sequences that were amplified by PCR and analyzed by Illumina next-generation sequencing (Fig. 1D). Because shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) may have off targets, we used the following cutoff to define a positive hit from this screen. Compared with the control, at least two different shRNA clones were enriched more than 1.5-fold, but none of the shRNA clones for that gene had less than a 0.3-fold reduction. Using these criteria, we identified a total of 543 genes (or 11.9%) as positive hits (data not shown). Functionally, those genes are involved in several biological processes, including cellular metabolism, macromolecule biosynthesis, regulation of gene expression, and protein modifications (Fig. 1E).

We aimed to investigate expression of claudin-11, -23 in different gastric tissues and its relationship with clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis of gastric cancer. We compared their expression levels in the paired cancerous tissues versus those in the adjacent noncancerous tissues by real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the expression of claudin-11, -23 was greatly increased in paracancerous gastric tissue compared with cancerous tissue. We also compared their expression levels of tissues from gastric cancer, superficial gastritis, and atrophic gastritis by immunohistochemistry. The results indicated that the expression of claudin-11 and 23 was significantly higher in superficial gastritis than that in atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer. The expression of claudin-23 was significantly lower in atrophic gastritis than that in gastric cancer, but no obviously difference was observed for claudin-11. As for analysis of clinicopathologic parameters of gastric cancer, logistic multiple regression indicated that claudin-11 was significantly associated with sex, smoking, alcohol, H. pylori infection and Borrmann classification while claudin-23 was significantly associated with vessel cancer embolus. Cox multivariate survival analysis indicated that gastric cancer patients with negative claudin-23 expression had significantly longer overall survival. In conclusion, the expression of claudin-11, -23 was remarkably downregulated in gastric cancer. Abnormal expression of these proteins was significantly correlated with some clinicopathologic parameters. In particular, claudin-23 positive expression was associated with poor prognostic outcomes of gastric cancer patients and may therefore serve as an independent prognosticator of patient survival."
https://openalex.org/W2601680475,"Rising sea levels increase the probability of future coastal flooding. Many decision-makers use risk analyses to inform the design of sea-level rise (SLR) adaptation strategies. These analyses are often silent on potentially relevant uncertainties. For example, some previous risk analyses use the expected, best, or large quantile (i.e., 90%) estimate of future SLR. Here, we use a case study to quantify and illustrate how neglecting SLR uncertainties can bias risk projections. Specifically, we focus on the future 100-yr (1% annual exceedance probability) coastal flood height (storm surge including SLR) in the year 2100 in the San Francisco Bay area. We find that accounting for uncertainty in future SLR increases the return level (the height associated with a probability of occurrence) by half a meter from roughly 2.2 to 2.7 m, compared to using the mean sea-level projection. Accounting for this uncertainty also changes the shape of the relationship between the return period (the inverse probability that an event of interest will occur) and the return level. For instance, incorporating uncertainties shortens the return period associated with the 2.2 m return level from a 100-yr to roughly a 7-yr return period (∼15% probability). Additionally, accounting for this uncertainty doubles the area at risk of flooding (the area to be flooded under a certain height; e.g., the 100-yr flood height) in San Francisco. These results indicate that the method of accounting for future SLR can have considerable impacts on the design of flood risk management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2602099501,"Background The study aimed to assess the feasibility of conducting large scale HIV prevention clinical trials in Mozambique by measuring HIV prevalence and incidence among women of reproductive age. This paper describes the baseline socio-demographic characteristics of the Mozambique Microbicides Development Programme (MDP) feasibility cohort, baseline prevalence of HIV and other STIs, and HIV incidence. Methods The Mozambique MDP feasibility study was conducted from September 2007 to August 2009 in urban Mavalane and rural Manhiça, in Southern Mozambique. Sexually active, HIV negative women aged 18 years and above were recruited to attend the study clinic every 4 weeks for a total of 40 weeks. At baseline, we collected demographic and sexual behaviour data, samples to test for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and conducted HIV rapid testing. STI and HIV testing were repeated at clinical follow-up visits. We describe HIV prevalence of women at screening, the demographic, behavioural and clinical characteristics of women at enrolment, and HIV incidence during follow-up. Results We screened 793 women (369 at Mavalane and 424 at Manhiça) and enrolled 505 eligible women (254 at Mavalane and 251 at Manhiça). Overall HIV prevalence at screening was 17%; 10% at Mavalane and 22% at Manhiça. Women screened at Manhiça were twice as likely as women screened at Mavalane to be HIV positive and HIV positive status was associated with younger age (18–34), lower educational level, not using a reliable method of contraception and being Zionist compared to other Christian religions. At enrolment contraceptive use was low in both clinics at 19% in Mavalane and 21% in Manhiça, as was reported condom use at last sex act at 48% in Mavalane and 25% in Manhiça. At enrolment, 8% of women tested positive for Trichomonas vaginalis, 2% for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 4% for Chlamydia trachomatis and 46% for bacterial vaginosis. In Manhiça, 8% of women had active syphilis at screening. HIV incidence was 4.3 per 100 person years at Mavalane and 9.2 per 100 person years at Manhiça. Conclusions We demonstrated the ability to recruit a cohort of women at risk of HIV who were willing to participate in clinical research. The high HIV incidence necessitates additional action around HIV prevention for women and offers opportunities to evaluate the impact of available prevention options, such as treatment as prevention and oral PrEP. The high HIV incidence and STI prevalence also offers opportunities to evaluate the added benefit of potential prevention options such as new formulations of oral PrEP, vaginal microbicides (also called topical PrEP), vaccines, and multi-purpose technologies for HIV, STIs and contraception."
https://openalex.org/W2599733337,"Changes occurring during evolution in the cis-regulatory landscapes of individual members of multigene families might impart diversification in their spatiotemporal expression and function. The archetypal member of the echinoid hbox12/pmar1/micro1 family is hbox12-a, a homeobox-containing gene expressed exclusively by dorsal blastomeres, where it governs the dorsal/ventral gene regulatory network during embryogenesis of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Here we describe the inventory of the hbox12/pmar1/micro1 genes in P. lividus, highlighting that gene copy number variation occurs across individual sea urchins of the same species. We show that the various hbox12/pmar1/micro1 genes group into three subfamilies according to their spatiotemporal expression, which ranges from broad transcription throughout development to transient expression in either the animal hemisphere or micromeres of the early embryo. Interestingly, the promoter regions of those genes showing comparable expression patterns are highly similar, while differing from those of the other subfamilies. Strikingly, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the hbox12/pmar1/micro1 genes are species-specific, exhibiting extensive divergence in their noncoding, but not in their coding, sequences across three distinct sea urchin species. In spite of this, two micromere-specific genes of P. lividus possess a TCF/LEF-binding motif in a similar position, and their transcription relies on Wnt/β-catenin signaling, similar to the pmar1 and micro1 genes, which in other sea urchin species are involved in micromere specification. Altogether, our findings suggest that the hbox12/pmar1/micro1 gene family evolved rather rapidly, generating paralogs whose cis-regulatory sequences diverged following multiple rounds of duplication from a common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W2599923511,"The sigma1 receptor acts as a chaperone at the endoplasmic reticulum, associates with multiple proteins in various cellular systems, and involves in a number of diseases, such as addiction, pain, cancer and psychiatric disorders. The sigma1 receptor is encoded by the single copy SIGMAR1 gene. The current study identifies five alternatively spliced variants of the mouse sigma1 receptor gene using a polymerase chain reaction cloning approach. All the splice variants are generated by exon skipping or alternative 3' or 5' splicing, producing the truncated sigma1 receptor. Similar alternative splicing has been observed in the human SIGMAR1 gene based on the molecular cloning or genome sequence prediction, suggesting conservation of alternative splicing of SIGMAR1 gene. Using quantitative polymerase chain reactions, we demonstrate differential expression of several splice variants in mouse tissues and brain regions. When expressed in HEK293 cells, all the splice variants fail to bind sigma ligands, implicating that each truncated region in these splice variants is important for ligand binding. However, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) study in HEK293 cells co-transfected with tagged constructs reveals that all the splice variants maintain their ability to physically associate with a mu opioid receptor (mMOR-1), providing useful information to correlate the motifs/sequences necessary for their physical association. Furthermore, a competition Co-IP study showed that all the variants can disrupt in a dose-dependent manner the dimerization of the original sigma1 receptor with mMOR-1, suggesting a potential dominant negative function and providing significant insights into their function."
https://openalex.org/W2601784088,"Background Postoperative hypoparathyroidism is the most common complication after total thyroidectomy, owing to unintentional injury or decreased blood flow to the parathyroid glands. Prediction of postoperative hypoparathyroidism would be helpful for surgeons to manage postoperative hypocalcemia. In this study, we scored the discoloration of the parathyroid glands using a new parathyroid scoring system and evaluated the correlation between the parathyroid score and duration of required calcium supplementation after total thyroidectomy. Methods A total of 316 patients undergoing total thyroidectomy between November 2009 and April 2010 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Parathyroid scoring was performed by one experienced surgeon. The status of each of the 4 parathyroid glands was classified as normal color (3 points), slightly discolored (2 points), dark discoloration (1 point), or loss of the gland (0 points), resulting in possible total scores of 0–12. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium, and ionized calcium concentrations were measured at 2 hours, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. Patients were also divided into three groups based on the duration of required calcium supplementation: no required supplementation (n = 260, 82.3%), required supplementation for <6 months (n = 38, 12%), and required supplementation for ≥6 months (n = 18, 5.75%). Results Parathyroid scores were positively correlated with ionized PTH concentrations at 2 hours (r = 0.053, p < 0.001), 2 weeks (r = 0.056, p < 0.001), 3 months (r = 0.032, p<0.001), 6 months (r = 0.072, p < 0.001), and 1 year (r = 0.071, p < 0.001) after thyroidectomy. Parathyroid scores were significantly and inversely associated with the duration of required calcium supplementation (p = 0.001). Conclusions Parathyroid scores at the end of surgery might be helpful for predicting the degree of postoperative hypocalcemia after total thyroidetomy."
https://openalex.org/W2598067378,"Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscle requires a physical interaction between the voltage-gated calcium channel dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channel. Although the exact molecular mechanism that initiates skeletal EC coupling is unresolved, it is clear that both the α1 and β subunits of DHPR are essential for this process. Here, we employed a series of techniques, including size-exclusion chromatography-multi-angle light scattering, differential scanning fluorimetry, and isothermal calorimetry, to characterize various biophysical properties of the skeletal DHPR β subunit β1a. Removal of the intrinsically disordered N and C termini and the hook region of β1a prevented oligomerization, allowing for its structural determination by X-ray crystallography. The structure had a topology similar to that of previously determined β isoforms, which consist of SH3 and guanylate kinase domains. However, transition melting temperatures derived from the differential scanning fluorimetry experiments indicated a significant difference in stability of ∼2–3 °C between the β1a and β2a constructs, and the addition of the DHPR α1s I-II loop (α-interaction domain) peptide stabilized both β isoforms by ∼6–8 °C. Similar to other β isoforms, β1a bound with nanomolar affinity to the α-interaction domain, but binding affinities were influenced by amino acid substitutions in the adjacent SH3 domain.

Key elements of the DHPR involve the voltage sensor and the Ca2+ ion pore, which are located in the α subunit (α1s), whereas other subunits are essential for correct α1S Ca2+ signaling, channel gating, and surface expression (1Obermair G.J. Tuluc P. Flucher B.E. Auxiliary Ca2+ channel subunits: lessons learned from muscle.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2008; 8: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DHPR α1s is the largest of the DHPR subunits consisting of four transmembrane repeats that are connected by a series of loops. These loops are linked to the cytoplasmic β subunit, which in the case of skeletal muscle interacts with ryanodine receptor and initiates skeletal EC coupling (2Coronado R. Ahern C.A. Sheridan D.C. Cheng W. Carbonneau L. Bhattacharya D. Functional equivalence of dihydropyridine receptor α1S and β1a subunits in triggering excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.Biol. Res. 2004; 37: 565-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the skeletal α1 subunit was initially solved to an overall resolution of 4.2 Å (3Wu J. Yan Z. Li Z. Yan C. Lu S. Dong M. Yan N. Structure of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.1 complex.Science. 2015; 350aad2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and more recently to 3.6 Å (4Wu J. Yan Z. Li Z. Qian X. Lu S.

However, the β1a component of these structures was resolved by docking the structure of the β2a isoform (PDB code 4DEY) caused by the unavailability of the β1a structure. It would therefore be useful if the structure of the β1a were to be determined. Similar to other DHPR β subunits, β1a is made up of a core Src-3 (SH3)-guanylate kinase (GK) module, with the SH3 domain split by a hook region of unknown function (see Fig. 1b) (5Chen Y.H. Li M.H.

The SH3 and GK domains are conserved in the β subunits, but the hook and N- and C-terminal regions show greater sequence diversity. It is known that the β subunit is anchored to α1 through a high affinity (∼5–50 nm) interaction (8Richards M.W. Butcher A.J. Dolphin A.C.

A number of studies have investigated the isoform-specific properties of the various β subunit domains. A dynamic exchange study of β subunits in situ revealed that the β1a formed a stable complex, whereas the other isoforms interacted in a dynamic fashion with their α1 subunits (9Campiglio M. Di Biase V. Tuluc P. Flucher B.E. Stable incorporation versus dynamic exchange of β subunits in a native Ca2+ channel complex.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 2092-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is also understood that a unique element of β1a lies in its C-terminal domain where a subset of residues is critical in the communication between the DHPR and ryanodine receptor (10Karunasekara Y. Rebbeck R.T. Weaver L.M. Board P.G. Dulhunty A.F. Casarotto M.G.

The importance of the β1a C-terminal domain has been subsequently confirmed in a number of studies in both mouse (11Eltit J.M. Franzini-Armstrong C. Perez C.F. Amino acid residues 489–503 of dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) β1a subunit are critical for structural communication between the skeletal muscle DHPR complex and type 1 ryanodine receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 36116-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and zebrafish myotubes (12Dayal A. Bhat V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Grabner M. Domain cooperativity in the β1a subunit is essential for dihydropyridine receptor voltage sensing in skeletal muscle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 7488-7493Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); the latter study also identified the β1a SH3 domain as a distinctive determinant for voltage sensing in skeletal muscle. From these works, there is a growing body of evidence that the β1a isoform could possess diverse functional traits compared with the other three isoforms (β2a, β3, and β4), and the structural make-up of β1a may be a determining factor driving these novel functions. Structural determination of full-length β subunits has not been not possible for two main reasons. First, β subunits have a tendency to aggregate at high concentrations (13Lao Q.Z. Kobrinsky E. Liu Z. Soldatov N.M. Oligomerization of Cavβ subunits is an essential correlate of Ca2+ channel activity.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 5013-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and second, the disordered C- and N-terminal domains and the hook region most likely impact upon their ability to crystallize. Therefore to overcome both of these obstacles and aid in the crystallization of β subunit proteins, it has been necessary to remove the disordered regions including the N- and C-terminal domains and in some cases the hook region. The core structures of three different β subunit isoforms (β2a, β3, and β4) have been solved (some with AID) with all three isoforms displaying very similar structures that resemble a family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins (5Chen Y.H. Li M.H. Zhang Y. He L.L. Yamada Y. Fitzmaurice A. Shen Y. Zhang H. Tong L. Yang J.

Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 599-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In this study we have determined the structure of the DHPR β1a core by X-ray crystallography. We also demonstrate key differences in the biophysical properties of β1a compared with the β2a isoforms by examining their stability and affinity with AID. Although there is high sequence homology between these two isoforms, subtle amino acid differences may be responsible for many of these biophysical differences. The capacity of the SH3 domain and the GK domains to interact with each other is an inherent feature of all β subunits, and the degree and mode of this interaction may play a role in conferring binding to various partner molecules. The β subunit protein constructs used in this study are shown in Fig. 1b and were purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental procedures.” All tags were cleaved prior to experiments being performed, and the minor variation in pH for the different experiment types did not in any way impact upon the conclusions reached. As part of the initial characterization of protein constructs, the solution molecular masses of β1a constructs were determined using size-exclusion chromatography-multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and are summarized in Table 1. This included the full-length protein (β1a), a core construct in which the unstructured termini are absent (β1a-core), and a construct that consisted only of structured folded domains (SH3 and GK) linked by a residual hook (β1a-SH3/GK). β1a eluted as two peaks; the first as a large (megadalton), soluble aggregate eluting at 8 ml, whereas the smaller peak was consistent with the monomer size of ∼58 kDa (Fig. 2a). The β1a·core construct eluted as multiple peaks, with a range of molecular masses including a large soluble aggregate (Fig. 2b). The non-integer values observed for each oligomeric state may be indicative of a protein in slow exchange between multiple states in solution and could explain why, despite multiple attempts, the β1a·core did not crystallize. The smaller β1a-SH3/GK construct eluted as a single, predominantly monodispersed peak with an experimental mass close to its predicted value peak of ∼37 kDa (Fig. 2c). To determine whether the excised hook region was responsible for the oligomerization of β1a, the hook region (β1a-hook) was expressed and examined by several techniques including SEC-MALS, circular dichroism, and NMR. The SEC-MALS profile (Fig. 2d) shows that the isolated hook region is monomeric, whereas the CD profile and NMR spectral dispersion indicate that the hook is disordered in solution (supplemental Fig. S1). To examine whether the hook region could induce oligomerization by interacting with β1a-SH3/GK, a titration experiment involving these two fragments was performed. Given that no labeled β1a-hook peaks shifted upon addition of β1a-SH3/GK (data not shown), it is reasonable to conclude that here is no evidence of any self-interaction between these two components in full-length β1a.Table 1The oligomeric state of β1a constructsProteinMolecular mass (kDa)Oligomeric state[Protein] @ refractometer μmObservedTheoretical monomerβ1a>1000Aggregate57.1 ± 1.1571.000.27β1a-core>1000Aggregate104 ± 12.420.3567 ± 0.81.560.8938 ± 0.1430.880.8629 ± 0.1Contaminantβ1a-SH3/GK35.2 ± 0.237.20.959.7β1a-hook11.09.61.14BSAaBSA was not monomeric.200 ± 1.62.990.38132.8 ± 0.51.981.267.1 ± 0.1671.006.8a BSA was not monomeric. Open table in a new tab Because of the monomeric nature of β1a-SH3/GK, this construct was selected for crystallographic analysis. Despite trialling numerous crystal screening conditions, β1a-SH3/GK could only be crystallized in the presence of the I-II loop (AID) peptide: a clear point of distinction from the β2a and β3 isoforms where structures have been solved with and without AID. We solved the structure of β1a-SH3/GK to a resolution of 1.83 Å by PHASER (15McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14504) Google Scholar), using the structure of the rat β2a homolog in complex with an α subunit peptide (PDB code 1T0J). Theβ1a-SH3/GK structure bears a marked similarity with the structures of other isoforms (Fig. 3a) (5Chen Y.H. Li M.H. Zhang Y. He L.L. Yamada Y. Fitzmaurice A. Shen Y. Zhang H. Tong L. Yang J.

Clark K.A. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Structure of a complex between a voltage-gated calcium channel β-subunit and an α-subunit domain.Nature. 2004; 429: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) displaying backbone root mean square deviations of 0.64, 0.74, and 0.89 Å with β isoforms 2a (PDB code 1T0H), 3 (PDB code 1VYT), and 4 (PDB code 1VYU) (over 265, 269, and 268 C-α atoms, respectively). Briefly, the structure is made up of well-conserved SH3 and GK domains sharing some of the features observed for the MAGUK family of proteins (Fig. 3a). The SH3 domain consists of five antiparallel β-strands with the truncated hook region separating the fourth and fifth β-strands. The SH3 domain and its RT-loop are sandwiched between an N-terminal helix (α1) and another helix that lies C-terminal to β4 (α2) through a network of hydrophobic interactions. The structure of all isoforms thus far examined show that the canonical SH3 polyproline-binding site is occluded by the RT-loop and the α2 helix, and this is also true for β1a (Fig. 3a). The GK domain consists of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices and forms an intramolecular interaction with the SH3 domain through a series of hydrogen bond and van der Waals contacts. The I-II loop AID peptide binds the GK domain in a hydrophobic groove that is situated on the opposite side of the SH3 domain. Similar to the other β isoforms, upon binding the DHPR I-II loop (AID) adopts an α-helical conformation that predominantly contacts the α3, α6, and α9 helices of β1a by means of several hydrophobic contacts and to a lesser extent hydrogen bond and ionic interactions as displayed in Fig. 3b. The thermal stability of a protein is often a good indicator of its crystallization potential and is typically used to screen for crystallization conditions (16Ristic M. Rosa N. Seabrook S.A. Newman J. Formulation screening by differential scanning fluorimetry: how often does it work?.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Commun. 2015; 71: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because it was possible to crystallize β2a-SH3/GK but not β1a-SH3/GK in the absence of AID, the temperature stability of both core constructs were examined using DSF. For all constructs (Fig. 4a), the transition melting curves showed only one inflection point (Fig. 4b), suggesting that either the SH3 and GK domains unfolded independently at similar temperatures or, more likely, because of their ability to interact, a synergic unfolding event had taken place. The Tm values of all βSH3/GK constructs are summarized in Fig. 4c.β1a-SH3/GK was found to be ∼3 °C less stable than β2a-SH3/GK, whereas the addition of AID increased the Tm of β2a-SH3/GK by ∼6.5 °C and β1a-SH3/GK by ∼8 °C, respectively, indicating the extent that AID stabilizes these constructs. These results may explain the difficulties surrounding the crystallizationβ1a-SH3/GK and why the addition of AID facilitates this process. As part of our preliminary studies, DSF studies were also performed with the full hook region (β1a-core). This experiment revealed a ∼3° reduction in Tm compared with truncated core (β1a-SH3/GK). The addition of AID did stabilize β1a-core to similar level as seen for β1a-SH3/GK, but neither the stand-alone protein nor its AID complex could be crystallized despite using a variety of screening conditions. To determine which regions of the β subunits are responsible for their differences in stability, we have analyzed the sequences of all four β isoforms. Fig. 5a shows that the β1a isoform most resembles β2a, with a sequence identity of 60%. This value increased to 78% upon removal of the N- and C-terminal domains and hook region (Fig. 5b). Further deletion of the GK domain only resulted in a modest 2% increase in homology (Fig. 5c), whereas a 13% increase was observed by deletion of the SH3 domain (Fig. 5d), indicating that the SH3 domain is primarily responsible for the sequence diversity between core region of β1a and β2a. Based on this analysis, it is evident that the SH3 domain displays a level of sequence diversity among the β isoforms that warrants further investigation; therefore two β-chimeras were constructed and subjected to thermal denaturation. Substitution of the β1a SH3 domain onto a β2a background (β1a-SH3/β2aGK) resulted in a reduced Tm compared with the β2a-SH3/GK (Fig. 4, b and c). A reduction in Tm was also evident upon substitution of the β1a SH3 RT-loop onto a β2a background (β2a-SH3(β1aRT)/GK), indicating that unique sequence elements in the SH3 domain of β1a increase the temperature instability for the β1a-SH3/GK. This suggests that from a thermal stability viewpoint, the SH3 domain of the two isoforms β1a and β2a are not interchangeable. Previous binding values between β subunits and AID peptides have been measured to range between 5 and 50 nm (8Richards M.W. Butcher A.J. Dolphin A.C. Ca2+ channel β-subunits: structural insights AID our understanding.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 626-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); however, the affinity between β1a and its corresponding AID peptide has not been measured. The affinities of various βSH3/GK constructs for the DHPR AID peptide were measured using isothermal calorimetry (ITC) and showed stoichiometric binding of 1:1 (Fig. 6 and Table 2). The affinity of β1a-SH3/GK for skeletal AID was measured to be 4.9 ± 2.1 nm, whereas a value of 17.1 ± 3.3 nm was observed for β2a-SH3/GK. Substitution of the β1a RT-loop onto β2a (β2a-SH3(β1aRT)/GK) had a negligible effect on binding (16.5 ± 4.2 nm), but replacing the entire SH3 domain (β1a-SH3/β2aGK) increased the affinity (7.0 ± 2.8 nm) to values comparable with that observed for β1a.Table 2Collated ITC data for β-SH3/GK constructs titrated with AIDnKDt test p value (to β1a-SH3/GK)NΔHΔSΔGnmkCal/molCal/mol·KkJ/molβ1a-SH3/GK34.9 ± 2.1NAaNA, not applicable.0.96−27.1−52.6−45.7β2a-SH3/GK317.1 ± 3.30.0130.80−29.33−62.7−42.6β2a-SH3(β1aRT)/GK316.5 ± 4.20.0020.72−26.8−54.2−44.8β1a-SH3/β2aGK37.0 ± 2.80.261.01−23.6−41.8−46.5a NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab In contrast to other DHPR β subunit isoforms, β1a is expressed only in skeletal muscle and is an exclusive partner of DHPR α1s. β1a is also essential in the functional assembly of skeletal muscle triads and is required to form DHPR tetrads (17Schredelseker J. Dayal A. Schwerte T. Franzini-Armstrong C. Grabner M. Proper restoration of excitation-contraction coupling in the dihydropyridine receptor β1-null zebrafish relaxed is an exclusive function of the β1a subunit.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1242-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Given the unique functional features of β1a, it has been important to characterize its structural and biophysical properties. Isolated, full-length β1a exists primarily in large, multimeric assemblies. Removal of the instrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal regions shifted its oligomerization profile, resulting in a series of multi-sized aggregates, whereas further excision of the hook region gave rise to a well-behaved monomeric species. This indicates that the hook region is intimately involved in the oligomerization process. CD, SEC-MALS, and NMR confirmed that the hook region is monomeric and intrinsically disordered but, based on NMR titration experiments, is unlikely to promote oligomerization by interacting with the β1a core SH3 and GK domains. Although the exact role of the hook region in oligomerization of β1a remains undefined, a possible role may be to enable domain swapping between the SH3 and GK domains, a hypothesis first proposed for another MAGUK protein, PSD-95 (18McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Structure of the SH3-guanylate kinase module from PSD-95 suggests a mechanism for regulated assembly of MAGUK scaffolding proteins.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The functional role of the hook region from various β isoforms has been examined previously and identified as an important element in regulating DHPR channel inactivation (19Richards M.W. Leroy J. Pratt W.S. Dolphin A.C. The HOOK-domain between the SH3 and the GK domains of Cavβ subunits contains key determinants controlling calcium channel inactivation.Channels. 2007; 1: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the case of β1a, removal of the hook region has been reported to reduce intracellular calcium release (12Dayal A. Bhat V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Grabner M. Domain cooperativity in the β1a subunit is essential for dihydropyridine receptor voltage sensing in skeletal muscle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 7488-7493Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). What is unknown and of future interest is whether the hook region that plays a role in the aggregation of β1a in vitro is implicated in DHPR tetrad formation? The crystal structure of the monomeric β1a-SH3/GK complexed with the AID peptide has been solved to a resolution of 1.86 Å, making it the most highly resolved β-structure so far determined. As shown in Fig. 7A, the structure shows a high degree overlap with structural elements from other β-structures with the only real point of difference visible in loop regions in GK domain between strand β7 and helix α5, as well as the residual hook region. Although the majority of hook region has been removed, the remaining hook residues display a well-defined loop structure. As previously discussed, the β1a SH3 domain exhibits the greatest sequence variation between the β isoforms; therefore it was of interest to focus more closely on this region. Despite a clear difference in the composition of the β1a SH3 RT-loop between various isoforms, this region reveals a remarkable degree of overlap with other β-structures (Fig. 7B) with the RT-loop stabilized by a series of hydrophobic interactions between the two α-helical segments effectively occluding the canonical SH3 binding site. A clear point of difference in this structure, however, is the absence of a salt bridge between an acidic RT-loop and a conserved basic residue in α2, which is present in other β isoform structures (Fig. 7C). It is likely that this interaction may help in stabilizing the position of the RT-loop. This argument is strengthened by the Tm measurements performed for the various β constructs. Comparison of coreβ1a-SH3/GK and β2a-SH3/GK consistently showed a marked difference in their Tm values of ∼3° with β2a-SH3/GK showing greater stability. Substitution of the β1a SH3 domain or the SH3 β1a RT-loop onto a β2a background served to lower the Tm values with respect to β2a, suggesting that the presence of specific amino acid residues within the β2a SH3 domain (in particular the RT-loop) stabilized the protein. The addition of the AID peptide resulted in a striking Tm increase for all constructs ranging from a maximum ∼8° C increase in β1a-SH3/GK to a minimum of ∼6.5° C in β2a-SH3/GK. This increase in Tm suggests that β1a exhibits a less stable, more dynamic structure that is markedly stabilized by the addition of AID, thereby facilitating crystallization. Even though there is an increase in the stability of β2a-SH3/GK upon the addition of AID, its presence is not a prerequisite for the crystallization of β2a (6Opatowsky Y. Chen C.C. Campbell K.P. Hirsch J.A. Structural analysis of the voltage-dependent calcium channel β subunit functional core and its complex with the α1 interaction domain.Neuron. 2004; 42: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The ITC results performed in this study indicate that the binding affinity of the AID peptide to β1a-SH3/GK is approximately three times tighter than that of β2a-SH3/GK, a result that is consistent with the trend observed in the thermal stability experiments (see above). However, of particular note was the Kd obtained for the β1a-SH3/β2aGK chimera, which was similar to that observed for β1a-SH3/GK. This result suggests that despite the AID-binding site being located on the GK domain, changes in the SH3 domain influenced binding on the other side of the molecule. Such an observation can be rationalized by considering the intramolecular interaction between the two domains as seen in all β X-ray crystal structures. In the case where the X-ray structures have been solved for both the apo/β and AID/β complexes (β2 and β3 isoforms), there are subtle but clear differences at the GK/SH3 domain interface as observed by changes in salt-bridge and hydrogen-bond connectivities (supplemental Fig. S2) and by overall changes in the buried surface area between the two domains (6Opatowsky Y.

Prior to the structural determination of the AID-binding site, it was assumed that AID interacted with what was described as the β-interaction domain, which spans the SH3, hook, and GK domains. This assumption was based"
https://openalex.org/W2602025587,"It is classically recognized that the physiological and oncogenic functions of Myc proteins depend on specific DNA binding enabled by the dimerization of its C-terminal basic-region-Helix-Loop-Helix-Leucine Zipper (b-HLH-LZ) domain with that of Max. However, a new paradigm is emerging, where the binding of the c-Myc/Max heterodimer to non-specific sequences in enhancers and promoters drives the transcription of genes involved in diverse oncogenic programs. Importantly, Max can form a stable homodimer even in the presence of c-Myc and bind DNA (specific and non-specific) with comparable affinity to the c-Myc/Max heterodimer. Intriguingly, alterations in the Max gene by germline and somatic mutations or changes in the gene product by alternative splicing (e.g. ΔMax) were recently associated with pheochromocytoma and glioblastoma, respectively. This has led to the proposition that Max is, by itself, a tumor suppressor. However, the actual mechanism through which it exerts such an activity remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that contrary to the WT motif, the b-HLH-LZ of ΔMax does not homodimerize in the absence of DNA. In addition, although ΔMax can still bind the E-box sequence as a homodimer, it cannot bind non-specific DNA in that form, while it can heterodimerize with c-Myc and bind E-box and non-specific DNA as a heterodimer with high affinity. Taken together, our results suggest that the WT Max homodimer is important for attenuating the binding of c-Myc to specific and non-specific DNA, whereas ΔMax is unable to do so. Conversely, the splicing of Max into ΔMax could provoke an increase in overall chromatin bound c-Myc. According to the new emerging paradigm, the splicing event and the stark reduction in homodimer stability and DNA binding should promote tumorigenesis impairing the tumor suppressor activity of the WT homodimer of Max."
https://openalex.org/W2602352938,"An understanding of microbial community structure is an important issue in the field of molecular ecology. The traditional molecular method involves amplification of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, PCR-based amplicon approaches are affected by primer bias and chimeras. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, unbiased SSU rRNA gene sequences can be mined from shotgun sequencing-based metagenomic or metatranscriptomic datasets to obtain a reflection of the microbial community structure in specific types of environment and to evaluate SSU primers. However, the use of short reads obtained through next-generation sequencing for primer evaluation has not been well resolved. The software MIPE (MIcrobiota metagenome Primer Explorer) was developed to adapt numerous short reads from metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. Using metagenomic or metatranscriptomic datasets as input, MIPE extracts and aligns rRNA to reveal detailed information on microbial composition and evaluate SSU rRNA primers. A mock dataset, a real Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (MG-RAST) test dataset, two PrimerProspector test datasets and a real metatranscriptomic dataset were used to validate MIPE. The software calls Mothur (v1.33.3) and the SILVA database (v119) for the alignment and classification of rRNA genes from a metagenome or metatranscriptome. MIPE can effectively extract shotgun rRNA reads from a metagenome or metatranscriptome and is capable of classifying these sequences and exhibiting sensitivity to different SSU rRNA PCR primers. Therefore, MIPE can be used to guide primer design for specific environmental samples."
https://openalex.org/W2601925972,"In ex-situ washing, HCl, EDTA and H2O2 solutions can effectively extract heavy metals in river sediment. Nevertheless they often target different sediment components, possibly transforming metal species into more bioavailable and hence toxic ones. This study, in batch settings, investigated the influences of different types of washing agents (i.e. HCl, EDTA and H2O2) on metal (i.e. Cu and Zn) removal from contaminated river sediment, destroy or dissolution of sediment components, and transformation of metal fractions during chemical washing treatment. Additionally, bioavailability of these metals left in the washed sediment was assessed. Results showed that HCl obtained the highest Cu and Zn removal through destroying the reducible, oxidizable and residual sediment components. Meanwhile, it transformed metal fractions to acid extractable one, resulting in an increase in metal bioavailability. Thus, the feasibility of washing with HCl for sediment remediation shall be reconsidered due to the caused high metal bioavailability. EDTA was capable of removing metals via direct complexation of labile metal species and indirect dissolution of reducible and oxidizable sediment components, where the transformation of corresponding metal binding fraction may occur. H2O2 obtained the lowest total Cu and Zn removal, but it preferentially removed the oxidizable metal species by oxidizing sulfides in the sediment. The bioavailable levels of Cu and Zn in the sediment washed by EDTA or H2O2 seemed not increase. To maintain a good balance between labile metal species removal and avoiding increase of metal bioavailability, EDTA and H2O2 are promising additives for metal removal by sediment washing."
https://openalex.org/W2599236195,"Auditory steady state responses (ASSRs) in cochlear implant (CI) patients are contaminated by the spread of a continuous CI electrical stimulation artifact. The aim of this work was to model the electrophysiological mixture of the CI artifact and the corresponding evoked potentials on scalp electrodes in order to evaluate the performance of denoising algorithms in eliminating the CI artifact in a controlled environment. The basis of the proposed computational framework is a neural mass model representing the nodes of the auditory pathways. Six main contributors to auditory evoked potentials from the cochlear level and up to the auditory cortex were taken into consideration. The simulated dynamics were then projected into a 3-layer realistic head model. 32-channel scalp recordings of the CI artifact-response were then generated by solving the electromagnetic forward problem. As an application, the framework’s simulated 32-channel datasets were used to compare the performance of 4 commonly used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms: infomax, extended infomax, jade and fastICA in eliminating the CI artifact. As expected, two major components were detectable in the simulated datasets, a low frequency component at the modulation frequency and a pulsatile high frequency component related to the stimulation frequency. The first can be attributed to the phase-locked ASSR and the second to the stimulation artifact. Among the ICA algorithms tested, simulations showed that infomax was the most efficient and reliable in denoising the CI artifact-response mixture. Denoising algorithms can induce undesirable deformation of the signal of interest in real CI patient recordings. The proposed framework is a valuable tool for evaluating these algorithms in a controllable environment ahead of experimental or clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2599928989,"Background Clinical networks are being used widely to facilitate large system transformation in healthcare, by engagement of stakeholders throughout the health system. However, there are no available instruments that measure engagement in these networks. Methods The study purpose was to develop and assess the measurement properties of a multiprofessional tool to measure engagement in clinical network initiatives. Based on components of the International Association of Public Participation Spectrum and expert panel review, we developed 40 items for testing. The draft instrument was distributed to 1,668 network stakeholders across different governance levels (leaders, members, support, frontline stakeholders) in 9 strategic clinical networks in Alberta (January to July 2014). With data from 424 completed surveys (25.4% response rate), descriptive statistics, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, Pearson correlations, linear regression, multivariate analysis, and Cronbach alpha were conducted to assess reliability and validity of the scores. Results Sixteen items were retained in the instrument. Exploratory factor analysis indicated a four-factor solution and accounted for 85.7% of the total variance in engagement with clinical network initiatives: global engagement, inform (provided with information), involve (worked together to address concerns), and empower (given final decision-making authority). All subscales demonstrated acceptable reliability (Cronbach alpha 0.87 to 0.99). Both the confirmatory factor analysis and regression analysis confirmed that inform, involve, and empower were all significant predictors of global engagement, with involve as the strongest predictor. Leaders had higher mean scores than frontline stakeholders, while members and support staff did not differ in mean scores. Conclusions This study provided foundational evidence for the use of this tool for assessing engagement in clinical networks. Further work is necessary to evaluate engagement in broader network functions and activities; to assess barriers and facilitators of engagement; and, to elucidate how the maturity of networks and other factors influence engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2600334721,"Cancer cells explore a broad mutational landscape, bringing the possibility that tumor-specific somatic mutations could fall in the same codons as germline SNVs and leverage their presence to produce substitutions with a larger impact on protein function. While multiple, temporally consecutive mutations to the same codon have in the past been detected in the germline, this phenomenon has not yet been explored in the context of germline-somatic variant co-occurrences during cancer development. We examined germline context at somatic mutation sites for 1395 patients across four cancer cohorts (breast, skin, colon, and head and neck) and found 392 codon-level co-occurrences between germline and somatic variants, including over a dozen in well-known cancer genes. We found that for the majority of these co-occurrence events, traditional somatic calling led to an inaccurate representation of the protein site and a significantly lower predicted impact on protein fitness. We conclude that these events often lead to imprecise annotation of somatic variants but do not appear to be a frequent source of driver events during cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2601560888,"Virological breakthrough (VBT) could be a manifestation of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in patients treated with long-term nucleot(s)ide analogues. We aimed to determine the association of on-treatment serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA with VBT in HBeAg-positive CHB patients receiving entecavir (ETV) treatment.A retrospective cohort study, including 162 consecutive patients (95 men and 67 women; mean age, 43.1±13.4 years) with HBeAg-positive CHB treated with ETV for at least 48 weeks between August 2008 and May 2015, was conducted. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis were used to identify associations with VBT and clinical factors, including HBV DNA and HBeAg serum status.Among the 162 ETV-treated HBeAg-positive CHB patients, eighteen patients (11.1%) experienced VBT (VBT group), whereas the other 144 patients were without VBT (non-VBT group). The cumulative rate of HBV DNA < 100 IU/mL in the VBT group and the non-VBT group at week 48 were 44.44% and 70.14%, and at week 96 were 58.33% and 92.56%, respectively (p = 0.015). The cumulative rate of HBeAg seroclearance in the VBT group and non-VBT group at week 48 and week 96 were statistically significant (p = 0.014). Multivariate analysis disclosed that failure to achieve HBeAg seroclearance were the factors significantly associated with VBT.Our results demonstrated that on-treatment HBV DNA could probably predict VBT in ETV-treated HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients. Failure to achieve HBeAg seroclearance was associated with VBT in ETV-treated HBeAg-positive CHB patients. HBV DNA >100IU/mL at 48 weeks is potentially a predictor for VBT."
https://openalex.org/W2601842144,"The possibility of using two different isotopomers, for the incorporation of isotopically labeled amino acids, was explored to enable longitudinal studies of de novo synthesis of two export liver proteins, albumin and fibrinogen. The agreement of the synthesis rates between the two different labels was evaluated along with the reproducibility of repeated experiments using different time intervals. Healthy volunteers were studied in a standardized fed state. Protocol A (n = 10) involved two measurements 48 hours apart. Protocol B (n = 6) involved three measurements at baseline and five hours and then seven days after the initial measurement. De novo synthesis of albumin and fibrinogen by the incorporation of D5-phenylalanine or D8-phenylalanine were measured using the flooding dose technique. Albumin and fibrinogen were isolated from plasma using standard techniques. Fractional and absolute synthesis rates were calculated. Repeated measurements employing the two isotoptomers showed good agreement for albumin fractional synthesis rate after 48 hours (p = 0.92) and after 7 days (p = 0.99), with a coefficient of variation of 5.9% when using the same isotopic label. For fibrinogen, the coefficient of variation for the fractional synthesis rate employing the same isotopic label was 16.6%. Repeated measurements after 48 hours and seven days showed less agreement although there was no statistical difference (P = 0.32 and P = 0.30 respectively). Repeated measurement after five hours showed a statistical significant difference for the fractional synthesis rate of fibrinogen (p = 0.008) but not for albumin (p = 0.12). Repeated measurements of albumin de novo synthesis more than 48 hours apart show acceptable agreement using either one or two different isotopic labels. For fibrinogen the larger intra-individual scatter necessitates larger study groups to detect changes in longitudinal studies. Repeated measurements within 48 hours need to be validated further."
https://openalex.org/W2603280691,"Protein classification is one of the critical problems in bioinformatics. Early studies used geometric distances and polygenetic-tree to classify proteins. These methods use binary trees to present protein classification. In this paper, we propose a new protein classification method, whereby theories of information and networks are used to classify the multivariate relationships of proteins. In this study, protein universe is modeled as an undirected network, where proteins are classified according to their connections. Our method is unsupervised, multivariate, and alignment-free. It can be applied to the classification of both protein sequences and structures. Nine examples are used to demonstrate the efficiency of our new method."
https://openalex.org/W2598612317,"To evaluate the effect of catheter ablation vs. direct current synchronized cardioversion (DCC) in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and to define baseline features of patients that will get more benefit from ablation.From July 2013 to October 2014, 97 consecutive single-center patients with persistent AF and symptomatic heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50%) underwent DCC followed by amiodarone (n = 40) or circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI; n = 57) according to patient's preference were recruited in the study. Post-ablation recurrence was treated with atrial roof and mitral isthmus lines ablation with or without PVI based on restoration or not of pulmonary vein (PV) potential conduction. Study outcomes were 12-month rate of sustained sinus rhythm (SR) and cardiac function. Baseline characteristics were compared between patients with and without cardiac function improvement post ablation.With similarly distributed characteristics at baseline, ablation (mean 1.8 procedures) relative to DCC yielded significantly higher level of 12-month SR maintenance rate (68.42% vs. 35%, P = 0.001); and better LVEF and New York Heart Association class. with significant effect for DCC only in maintained SR cases. Post ablation LVEF increased (>20% or to over 55%) in 31 (54.39%) patients with worse baseline cardiac function and ventricular rate control.Catheter ablation relative to cardioversion of persistent AF with symptomatic heart failure yielded better 12-month SR maintenance and cardiac function. Compared with non-responders, patients with improved LVEF post-ablation had poorer ventricular rate control and cardiac function at baseline, suggesting a significant component of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy in this group."
https://openalex.org/W2600247545,"The mechanisms underlying host HIV control hold much promise in the search for a functional HIV cure. We investigated the host genomic signatures in elite controllers or rapid progressors following recent infection and the correlates of immune reconstitution during combination antiretroviral therapy. We characterized the HIV-specific longitudinal host transcriptional response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from elite controllers, rapid progressors, immune responders and non-responders using a RT-qPCR array in a cohort of recently HIV-infected Brazilian individuals. The elite controllers expressed unique transcripts early in infection that were closely associated with specialized cross-presentation between XCR1+ DCs and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (XCL1). The natural suppression of HIV was also associated with the highly functional co-expression of cytokines and chemokines (CCL2, TNF and IL-10) concomitant with the maintenance of important anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant properties (Antithrombin III). Immune responders exhibited exclusively upregulated mRNAs possibly related to stem cell mobilization before combination antiretroviral therapy (neutrophil elastase). Our longitudinal approach to gene expression permitted us to discover previously unrecognized determinants that contribute to natural or antiretroviral-mediated HIV-1 immune control."
