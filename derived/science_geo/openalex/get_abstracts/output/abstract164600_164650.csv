https://openalex.org/W2146267270,"Huntingtin is a 350-kilodalton protein of unknown function that is mutated in Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder. The mutant protein is presumed to acquire a toxic gain of function that is detrimental to striatal neurons in the brain. However, loss of a beneficial activity of wild-type huntingtin may also cause the death of striatal neurons. Here we demonstrate that wild-type huntingtin up-regulates transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a pro-survival factor produced by cortical neurons that is necessary for survival of striatal neurons in the brain. We show that this beneficial activity of huntingtin is lost when the protein becomes mutated, resulting in decreased production of cortical BDNF. This leads to insufficient neurotrophic support for striatal neurons, which then die. Restoring wild-type huntingtin activity and increasing BDNF production may be therapeutic approaches for treating HD."

However, the mechanisms underlying tau-mediated neurotoxicity remain unclear. We created a genetic model of tau-related neurodegenerative disease by expressing wild-type and mutant forms of human tau in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster . Transgenic flies showed key features of the human disorders: adult onset, progressive neurodegeneration, early death, enhanced toxicity of mutant tau, accumulation of abnormal tau, and relative anatomic selectivity. However, neurodegeneration occurred without the neurofibrillary tangle formation that is seen in human disease and some rodent tauopathy models. This fly model may allow a genetic analysis of the cellular mechanisms underlying tau neurotoxicity."

We present the crystal structures of the ligand-binding domain of hPXR both alone and in complex with the cholesterol-lowering drug SR12813 at resolutions of 2.5 and 2.75 angstroms, respectively. The hydrophobic ligand-binding cavity of hPXR contains a small number of polar residues, permitting SR12813 to bind in three distinct orientations. The position and nature of these polar residues were found to be critical for establishing the precise pharmacologic activation profile of PXR. Our findings provide important insights into how hPXR detects xenobiotics and may prove useful in predicting and avoiding drug-drug interactions."

The unexpected result is that the chirality sign of these homoassociates can be selected by vortex motion during the aggregation process. This result is confirmed by means of circular dichroism spectra. These experimental findings are rationalized in terms of the asymmetric influence of macroscopic forces on bifurcation scenarios and by considering the specific binding characteristics of the porphyrin units to form the homoassociates."
https://openalex.org/W1991201692,"Sulforaphane (SFN), an aliphatic isothiocyanate, is a known cancer chemopreventive agent. Aiming to investigate anti-inflammatory mechanisms of SFN, we here report a potent decrease in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory and pro-carcinogenic signaling factors in cultured Raw 264.7 macrophages after SFN treatment, i.e. NO, prostaglandin E2, and tumor necrosis factor α. SFN did not directly interact with NO, nor did it inhibit inducible nitric-oxide synthase enzymatic activity. Western blot analyses revealed time- and dose-dependent reduction of LPS-induced inducible nitric-oxide synthase as well as Cox-2 protein expression, which was suppressed at the transcriptional level. To reveal the target of SFN beyond its anti-inflammatory action, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses of transcription factor-DNA binding. Consequently, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a pivotal transcription factor in LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory response, was identified as the key mediator. SFN selectively reduced DNA binding of NF-κB without interfering with LPS-induced degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB nor with nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Because SFN can interact with thiol groups by dithiocarbamate formation, it may impair the redox-sensitive DNA binding and transactivation of NF-κB. Sulforaphane could either directly inactivate NF-κB subunits by binding to essential Cys residues or interact with glutathione or other redox regulators like thioredoxin and Ref-1 relevant for NF-κB function. Our data provide novel evidence that anti-inflammatory mechanisms contribute to sulforaphane-mediated cancer chemoprevention."
https://openalex.org/W2020142583,"The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) promotes plant water conservation by decreasing the apertures of stomatal pores in the epidermis through which water loss occurs. We found that Arabidopsis thaliana plants harboring transferred DNA insertional mutations in the sole prototypical heterotrimeric GTP-binding (G) protein alpha subunit gene, GPA1, lack both ABA inhibition of guard cell inward K(+) channels and pH-independent ABA activation of anion channels. Stomatal opening in gpa1 plants is insensitive to inhibition by ABA, and the rate of water loss from gpa1 mutants is greater than that from wild-type plants. Manipulation of G protein status in guard cells may provide a mechanism for controlling plant water balance."
https://openalex.org/W2075202222,"In yeast, telomere position effect (TPE) results in the reversible silencing of genes near telomeres. Here we demonstrate the presence of TPE in human cells. HeLa clones containing a luciferase reporter adjacent to a newly formed telomere express 10 times less luciferase than do control clones generated by random integration. Luciferase expression is restored by trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Overexpression of a human telomerase reverse transcriptase complementary DNA results in telomere elongation and an additional 2- to 10-fold decrease in expression in telomeric clones but not control clones. The dependence of TPE on telomere length provides a mechanism for the modification of gene expression throughout the replicative life-span of human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2060909573,"Epidemiological data suggest that dietary antioxidants play a protective role against cancer. This has led to the proposal that dietary supplementation with antioxidants such as vitamin C (vit C) may be useful in disease prevention. However, vit C has proved to be ineffective in cancer chemoprevention studies. In addition, concerns have been raised over potentially deleterious transition metal ion-mediated pro-oxidant effects. We have now determined that vit C induces lipid hydroperoxide decomposition to the DNA-reactive bifunctional electrophiles 4-oxo-2-nonenal, 4,5-epoxy-2(E)-decenal, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. The compound 4,5-Epoxy-2(E)-decenal is a precursor of etheno-2'-deoxyadenosine, a highly mutagenic lesion found in human DNA. Vitamin C-mediated formation of genotoxins from lipid hydroperoxides in the absence of transition metal ions could help explain its lack of efficacy as a cancer chemoprevention agent."
https://openalex.org/W2029229332,"The alpha subunit of a prototypical heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein), which is encoded by a single gene (GPA1) in Arabidopsis, is a modulator of plant cell proliferation. gpa1 null mutants have reduced cell division in aerial tissues throughout development. Inducible overexpression of GPA1 in Arabidopsis confers inducible ectopic cell division. GPA1 overexpression in synchronized BY-2 cells causes premature advance of the nuclear cycle and the premature appearance of a division wall. Results from loss of function and ectopic expression and activation of GPA1 indicate that this subunit is a positive modulator of cell division in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2038540528,"The recent advances in large-scale monitoring of gene expression raise the challenge of mapping systems on the basis of kinetic expression data in living cells. To address this, we measured promoter activity in the flagellar system of Escherichia coli at high accuracy and temporal resolution by means of reporter plasmids. The genes in the pathway were ordered by analysis algorithms without dependence on mutant strains. The observed temporal program of transcription was much more detailed than was previously thought and was associated with multiple steps of flagella assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2017457068,"Congo red (CR) binding, monitored by characteristic yellow-green birefringence under crossed polarization has been used as a diagnostic test for the presence of amyloid in tissue sections for several decades. This assay is also widely used for the characterization of <i>in vitro</i> amyloid fibrils. In order to probe the structural specificity of Congo red binding to amyloid fibrils we have used an induced circular dichroism (CD) assay. Amyloid fibrils from insulin and the variable domain of Ig light chain demonstrate induced CD spectra upon binding to Congo red. Surprisingly, the native conformations of insulin and Ig light chain also induced Congo red circular dichroism, but with different spectral shapes than those from fibrils. In fact, a wide variety of native proteins exhibited induced CR circular dichroism indicating that CR bound to representative proteins from different classes of secondary structure such as α (citrate synthase), α + β (lysozyme), β (concavalin A), and parallel β-helical proteins (pectate lyase). Partially folded intermediates of apomyoglobin induced different Congo red CD bands than the corresponding native conformation, however, no induced CD bands were observed with unfolded protein. Congo red was also found to induce oligomerization of native proteins, as demonstrated by covalent cross-linking and small angle x-ray scattering. Our data suggest that Congo red is sandwiched between two protein molecules causing protein oligomerization. The fact that Congo red binds to native, partially folded conformations and amyloid fibrils of several proteins shows that it must be used with caution as a diagnostic test for the presence of amyloid fibrils <i>in vitro</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2086871275,"Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of L-type Ca2+ channels plays a critical role in controlling Ca2+ entry and downstream signal transduction in excitable cells. Ca2+-insensitive forms of calmodulin (CaM) act as dominant negatives to prevent CDI, suggesting that CaM acts as a resident Ca2+ sensor. However, it is not known how the Ca2+ sensor is constitutively tethered. We have found that the tethering of Ca2+-insensitive CaM was localized to the C-terminal tail of α1C, close to the CDI effector motif, and that it depended on nanomolar Ca2+concentrations, likely attained in quiescent cells. Two stretches of amino acids were found to support the tethering and to contain putative CaM-binding sequences close to or overlapping residues previously shown to affect CDI and Ca2+-independent inactivation. Synthetic peptides containing these sequences displayed differences in CaM-binding properties, both in affinity and Ca2+dependence, leading us to propose a novel mechanism for CDI. In contrast to a traditional disinhibitory scenario, we suggest that apoCaM is tethered at two sites and signals actively to slow inactivation. When the C-terminal lobe of CaM binds to the nearby CaM effector sequence (IQ motif), the braking effect is relieved, and CDI is accelerated.

These feedback mechanisms are of critical importance for regulation of the electromechanical activity of the heart and other essential physiological processes. CDI helps determine the length of the cardiac action potential plateau (1Beeler G.W. Reuter H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1970; 207: 191-209Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and CDF contributes to the positive force-frequency relationship of the cardiac contraction (2Lemaire S. Piot C. Leclercq F. Leuranguer V. Nargeot J. Richard S. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1998; 93 Suppl. 1: 51-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence from recent work suggest that the calcium sensor mediating both of these processes may be the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM). We (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) and others (4Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T.

A. 1999; 96: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) have shown that there is a Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding sequence (“IQ motif”) in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the pore-forming α1C subunit of the channel, within a region previously shown to confer Ca2+ sensitivity (6De Leon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E. Wei X. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We have also shown that those mutations within the IQ motif that render the channel subunit unable to bind CaM also disrupt CDI (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 7Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21121-21129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), suggesting that the IQ motif serves as the effector region for CDI. Furthermore, we (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) and others (4Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) have shown CDI can be blocked in a dominant negative fashion by those CaM mutants that lack Ca2+ binding in their C-terminal EF-hand domains. Several important questions remain unanswered about how Ca2+ and CaM might regulate L-type Ca2+ channel inactivation. The first question concerns how CaM may be tethered to the L-type channel (8Ehlers M.D. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1999; 399 (, 107–108): 105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). There are multiple reasons for thinking that there must be a binding site that tethers the Ca2+ sensor in the channel's resting state, keeping it poised for signaling as soon as Ca2+ entry begins. Without tethering it would be difficult to explain the rapid development of CDI, beginning within milliseconds after L-type channel opening is initiated by depolarization (5Qin N. Olcese R. Bransby M. Lin T. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Tethering would also explain the dominant negative inhibitory action of mutant CaM molecules inasmuch as their binding to the tethering site would preclude binding of wild-type CaM (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 4Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21121-21129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified sequences in a cytoplasmic domain of the α1C subunit that display significant affinity for CaM even at low Ca2+ concentrations (9Pate P. Mochca-Morales J. Wu Y. Zhang J.Z. Rodney G.G. Serysheva I.I Williams B.Y. Anderson M.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39786-39792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Romanin C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22359-22367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but these do not appear to bind to dominant negative CaM mutants, as would be expected for the putative tethering site. Thus, the molecular basis for CaM tethering remains unclear. A second question concerns the nature of the interaction between CaM and the IQ motif. How does CaM interact with the IQ motif so that CaM performs its effector functions? Is this interaction similar to CaM interactions with well known partners such as Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) or myosin light chain kinase? A third question concerns puzzling alterations in Ca2+-independent inactivation, produced by modifying amino acids within the IQ motif or in its general vicinity. Such modifications produce prominent changes in the kinetics of Ba2+ currents through L-type channels (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 7Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). How can one account for these experimental observations if the regulation of inactivation were strictly dependent on formation of a Ca2+·CaM complex? In addressing each of these questions, our experiments indicated that CaM acts through a switch-like mechanism significantly different than its classical disinhibitory mode of action. For the gel shift experiment in Fig. 1, the coding sequences of CaM and CaM234 (provided by J. Adelman, Oregon Health Sciences University) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-4-T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Constructs for the GST fusion proteins containing amino acids 1477–1592 and 1592–1875 of the α1C cytoplasmic tail were the generous gift of M. Hosey (Northwestern University) and have been described previously (13Meyers M.B. Puri T.S. Chien A.J. Gao T. Hsu P.H. Hosey M.M. Fishman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18930-18935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), although the numbering of the amino acids in this report reflects that of the cDNA clone 77wt that has been described previously (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The construct for the GST fusion protein containing amino acids 1551–1660 was generated by PCR amplification using primers 5′-CCGAATTCAACAGTGACGGGACGGTC-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGGTCGTGCAGAGTGCGCAG-3′ and cloning of the restriction enzyme-digested product into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1. The construct for the GST fusion protein containing the I-II loop was generated by PCR amplification using primers 5′-CCGAATTCAGCGGAGAGTTTTCCAAAG-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGGTTCGACTTGACCGCTGC-3′ and cloning of the restriction enzyme-digested product into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1. The construct used to generate the in vitro translated 77I/E protein was created by site-directed mutation of Ile1624 using QuikChange (Stratagene) from the wild-type construct described previously (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). For functional expression of wild-type and mutant L-type Ca2+ channels in Xenopus oocytes, the cDNA clone 77wt was used. For the construction of the deletion mutant 77d13, the 2878-bp HindIII-SpeI fragment of 77wt was first subcloned into pBluescript SK(−) to assemble the plasmid p77HS. This plasmid cDNA provided a convenient template cDNA for preparative mutagenic PCR. For the deletion of the 39-bp fragment (nt 1525–1563 in the open reading frame of 77wt) that encodes the 13-amino acid CaM-binding motif GARLAHRISKSKF (Fig. 2 A), a triple fragment ligation strategy was used. Two short cDNA fragments A (nt 1335–1524) and B (nt 1564–1800) were amplified, which flank the 39-bp sequence. For fragment A we used the forward primer 5′-GAAGCAGCAGCTAGAACGGGATCTCAAAGGCTAC-3′ (Afwd) and the reverse primer 5′-AGTTACTCTTCCGCAGTTTTCTCCCTCGATG-3′ (Arev). Fragment B was amplified with the forward primer 5′-AGTTACTCTTCATGCAGCCGCTACTGGCGC-3′ (Bfwd) and 5′-CTGCAGGCCCAGGCTGTACATC-3′ (Brev). The primers Arev and Bfwd both contained a mismatch-overhang containing an Eam1104I restriction site (underlined sequences). Fragment A and B were subsequently digested with the restriction enzymes SphI andEam1104I, and Eam1104I and SfiI, respectively, and the two fragments were ligated into theSphI-SfiI sites of p77HS. A 2532-bpMfeI-PpuMI fragment containing the deletion was then transferred into the full-length 77wt to form the deletion mutant 77d13, and the deletion was confirmed by cDNA sequencing.Figure 2Tests for involvement of I-II loop in tethering or effector functions of CaM.

CaM1234 cRNA (up to 200 fmol) was injected 3 days prior to Ca2+ channel cRNA.

They were used for electrophysiological analysis 3–7 days after injection. Before recording whole cellI Ba or I Ca, oocytes were injected with 23–46 nl of 100 mm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid solution, pH 7.4, to minimize contaminating Ca2+-activated Cl− currents. To evokeI Ca, the bath solution was switched to a solution containing Ca(NO3)2 instead of Ba(OH)2. Data acquisition and analysis were performed as described previously (7Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S.

Constructs for GST fusion proteins were transformed into BL21Escherichia coli, grown to mid-log phase, and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were lysed by passage through a French press in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 30 min, aliquots of supernatant were snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C. For CaM and CaM234 used in Fig. 2, protein was allowed to bind to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton for 30 min at 4 °C, washed extensively, and then cleaved from GST with thrombin without added Ca2+. For binding experiments between fusion proteins and CaM or CaM1234, an aliquot of fusion protein was thawed, allowed to bind to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed extensively with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100 (binding buffer), and the indicated amount of free Ca2+ buffered with either EGTA, EDTA or HEDTA, as calculated with WEBMAXC version 2.10 (www.stanford.edu/∼cpatton/webmaxc2.htm). Either CaM or CaM1234 was then added and allowed to interact with the fusion protein for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed extensively with binding buffer containing the indicated amounts of free Ca2+ and the retained protein eluted with SDS sample buffer. The protein was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by immunoblot with a polyclonal antibody against CaM (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The ability of this antibody to detect CaM1234 equally as well as CaM was confirmed (data not shown). The CaM expression vector pPCR2 containing either wild-type CaM or CaM1234 was transformed into BL21 E. coli, grown to mid-log phase, and induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were lysed by passage through a French press in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl. The lysate was heated to 70 °C, immediately cooled on ice, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. After gradually bringing the supernatant to a final concentration of 2 mammonium sulfate, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was then brought to a saturating final concentration of ammonium sulfate (∼5 m), and the precipitate was pelleted. The wild-type CaM pellet was then resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, and 1 mm EDTA and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column. CaCl2 was slowly added to the flow-through until a final concentration was 10 mm, and this was applied to a second phenyl-Sepharose column. This column was washed with 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, 10 mmCaCl2, and CaM was then eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, and 10 mmEDTA. The CaM1234 pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA and applied to a MonoQ (10 × 5; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) FPLC column. Protein was eluted with 1 m potassium glutamate over an 85-ml linear gradient. CaM1234 eluted around 150 mmpotassium glutamate. After purification, both proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. For Fig. 4 D, the amount of CaM1234 bound to the fusion protein was quantified by scanning the CaM immunoblot into Adobe Photoshop and counting the number of pixels above background in the area corresponding to the band in each lane. The standard curve was generated with known amounts of CaM1234. Peptides were synthesized at the PAN facility at Stanford University. Sequences for each peptide are given in the text. Stock solutions of peptides were suspended in water or Me2SO and diluted in water for working concentrations. Non-denaturing, non-reducing gel shift experiments were performed as described (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Fluorescent measurements and quantification of the interaction of dCaM and peptides were performed as described (7Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21121-21129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To assess the Ca2+ dependence of the interaction of a specific peptide with dCaM, a spectrum of dCaM in buffer containing the indicated amount of free Ca2+ (Molecular Probes) in the absence of the specific peptide was first obtained. A saturating amount of the peptide was then added to the cuvette and a second spectrum obtained, from which the first spectrum was then subtracted. Purified N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of CaM used in Fig. 6 were prepared by tryptic digestion and kindly provided by C. Klee (National Institutes of Health). These were added to stock starting mixtures of dCaM (33 nm) and peptide (at a concentration corresponding to its calculated K 0.5 for CaM binding) in incremental amounts. Excess unlabeled CaM was added at the end of every experiment to determine the fluorescence emission for no-added peptide and confirmed by obtaining the spectra of 33 nm dCaM in the absence of peptide. A constitutive interaction between CaM and the channel has been postulated to keep CaM strategically positioned to sense Ca2+ entry and to induce inactivation rapidly, but the molecular basis for the tethering is unclear. Because of its homology to Ca2+-independent CaM-binding sequences found in unconventional myosins and neuromodulin (17Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), we initially considered the possibility that the IQ motif in the C-terminal tail could serve as the tethering site for CaM at basal levels of [Ca2+]i. Although our previous results (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) showed that the C-terminal tail could not bind CaM in the absence of Ca2+, we considered that tethering to the IQ motif might require Ca2+ concentrations of 20–100 nm, like those in resting cells, and might be missed in zero Ca2+. To test this possibility, we chose to examine interactions between the IQ motif and CaM234, one of the Ca2+-insensitive CaM molecules that act as dominant negatives to prevent CDI. Because CaM234 clearly lacks the ability to act as a Ca2+ effector (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 7Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21121-21129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), any binding that it displayed with the IQ motif could be regarded as an unambiguous indication of a tethering interaction. Accordingly, we generated CaM234 and wild-type CaM by bacterial expression and tested the purified proteins for interaction with the IQ motif in a gel shift assay (Fig. 1). In the absence of added peptide, the CaM234 protein migrated faster than wild-type CaM protein, confirming that this CaM mutant is unable to bind Ca2+ and undergo the characteristic Ca2+-induced shift in mobility. The addition of the IQ motif peptide did not induce a shift in the mobility of CaM234, regardless of whether in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 1) or in 2 mm EGTA (data not shown). This indicated that CaM234 cannot bind to the IQ motif and that the basis for its dominant negative effect must be sought elsewhere. Our previous demonstration that a peptide containing the IQ motif could induce a shift in mobility of wild-type CaM even in the presence of 100 nm added Ca2+ (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) does not in itself establish a tethering role for the IQ motif. Micromolar concentrations of CaM are required in this assay in order to visualize CaM, thus requiring micromolar concentrations of peptide to achieve appropriate stoichiometry. The concentration of peptide used in such assays is therefore more than 10-fold greater than the K dvalue of 50 nm for interactions between IQ motif-containing peptide and CaM that we subsequently determined (7Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21121-21129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, the law of mass action would favor the detection of significant binding, even if the IQ motif interacted relatively weakly with CaM at 100 nm Ca2+. To expand our search for a tethering domain, we scanned the putative intracellular portions of the α1C subunit for sequences with homology to known CaM-binding domains, using the criteria as defined by Rhoads and Friedberg (17Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). We found three sites in the I-II intracellular loop (amino acids 438–451, 520–532, and 542–555, Fig. 2 A), one site in the cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 1565–1578, see below), but none in the N-terminal domain. Ivanina et al. (18Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Shistik E. Barzilai R. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39846-39854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) reported that CaM binds to a fusion protein containing the N-terminal domain; presumably CaM binds to a site that lacks homology to consensus sequences. The 520–532 sequence conforms to a consensus 1-5-10 CaM-binding motif, and the sequences 438–451 and 542–555 correspond to a consensus 1-8-14 type B motif. Chimeras of α1C and α1S had previously suggested a possible role for the I-II loop in CDI (19Adams B. Tanabe T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we synthesized peptides that contained these sequences and looked for interactions with 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-CaM (dCaM). In the presence of Ca2+, the 520–532 peptide increased the fluorescence of dCaM, with a concentration dependence corresponding to a binding affinity of ∼90 nm (Fig. 2 B). No significant interaction was detected in the absence of Ca2+. No significant interaction, either in the presence or absence of Ca2+, was detected with the 438–451 and the 542–555 peptides. To confirm the CaM-binding properties of the 520–532 peptide, we generated GST fusion proteins that contained the I-II loop and, for comparison, additional GST fusion proteins incorporating a segment of the C-terminal tail that included the IQ motif (Fig. 2 C). Potential interactions between the fusion proteins and CaM were examined in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and detected by an immunoblot for CaM. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the I-II loop fusion protein was able to bind CaM only in the presence of Ca2+ but not in its absence, confirming the results obtained with fluorescently labeled CaM. This suggested that CaM was not bound constitutively to the I-II loop in zero Ca2+ and was therefore unlikely to serve as the CaM-tethering site. As a further test of the possible involvement of the I-II loop, if not in tethering, as a possible effector site, we generated an α1C subunit that lacked the amino acids 520–532. This mutant was co-injected with α2δ and β1into Xenopus oocytes and L-type Ca2+ currents were recorded. As shown in Fig. 2 D, Ca2+-dependent inactivation and the dominant negative inhibition of CDI by CaM1234 were both unaffected by the deletion in α1C. We took this as strong evidence that the deleted sequence does not play a significant role in supporting either the tethering or effector aspects of Ca2+ sensing in CDI. Lacking evidence for involvement of the I-II loop, we proceeded to focus on the fourth CaM-binding site identified in our scan, in the C-terminal tail. Our previous experiments had weighed against possible tethering sites in regions of the C-terminal tail other than the IQ motif, because a Ile1624 → Glu substitution within the IQ motif (I/E mutation) appeared to render the tail unable to bind CaM in 1 mm Ca2+ or in EGTA (3Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). To check this result, we carried out further experiments, taking care to allow longer incubations of agarose-CaM with the in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled α1C fragment (Fig. 3). The new data showed a clear Ca2+ dependence of interaction between CaM and the C-terminal protein harboring the I/E mutation, although at reduced levels compared with wild-type protein. It is unlikely that this interaction represents residual binding to the mutated IQ site, since the concentration of 35S-labeled peptide in the reaction was about 10−17m, far below the K d value we have calculated for a IQ motif peptide containing the I/E mutation (>5 µm). A further hint that the cytoplasmic tail could support CaM binding outside of the IQ motif is provided by comparison of results from Qin et al. (5Qin N. Olcese R. Bransby M. Lin T. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) with our own findings (7Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol.

Extreme disruption of the IQ motif (IQEYFRKAAAAAAA) spared CaM binding to a fusion protein containing amino acids 1542–1688 (numbering as in 77wt) (5Qin N. Olcese R. Bransby M. Lin T. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1973319807,Most microalgae are obligate photoautotrophs and their growth is strictly dependent on the generation of photosynthetically derived energy. We show that the microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum can be genetically engineered to thrive on exogenous glucose in the absence of light through the introduction of a gene encoding a glucose transporter (glut1 or hup1). This demonstrates that a fundamental change in the metabolism of an organism can be accomplished through the introduction of a single gene. This also represents progress toward the use of fermentation technology for large-scale commercial exploitation of algae by reducing limitations associated with light-dependent growth.

Cytoskeletal organization plays an important role in most cellular activities including cell motility, adhesion, proliferation, and cytokinesis (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar).

Understanding the mechanism by which cytoskeletal regulatory proteins regulate polymerized actin structures is thus of critical biological importance. Members of the Rho family of small GTPases have key roles in regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in mammalian cells. Three of the major players of this family, Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, were shown to induce the production of filopodia, lamellipodia, and stress fibers, respectively, in a variety of cell types including fibroblasts (8Nobes C.D.

PAK1 and -2 and the closely related γPAK have been reported to induce a variety of different types of cytoskeletal changes, depending on the cell type. The activities that have been attributed to the PAKs include the induction of filopodia and membrane ruffles (26Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), the dissolution of stress fibers, down-regulation of focal adhesions, and cell retraction (27Manser E.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 471-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these changes are independent of the PAKs' kinase activities or their ability to bind to the Rho GTPases (26Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). PAK1 was recently found to regulate the activity of another serine/threonine kinase, LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) (29Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). LIMK1 is highly expressed in the brain, although it is also expressed in a wide variety of other tissues. A defect in LIMK1 is linked to the neurological disorder Williams syndrome, and may prevent neurons from making their proper connections (30Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). LIMK1 causes dramatic cytoskeletal changes, primarily the induction of actin clusters. LIMK1 operates by phosphorylating and inactivating another cytoskeletal regulatory protein, cofilin, thereby inhibiting cofilin's actin depolymerization activity (31Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 32Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Activated Rac also leads to the phosphorylation of LIMK1, and PAK1 may serve as a link between Rac and LIMK1 phosphorylation (29Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 31Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P.

The most recent PAK family member to be identified is PAK4 (25Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). PAK4 differs significantly from the other PAKs in sequence, especially in its regulatory domain, although it does have a modified GBD. PAK4 was first identified as a target of Cdc42, which forms a link between Cdc42 and filopodia formation. While wild-type PAK4 on its own does not induce dramatic cytoskeletal changes, co-expression of PAK4 with Cdc42 potentiates and prolongs the induction of filopodia by Cdc42. In contrast to PAK1 (26Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), the ability of PAK4 to regulate cytoskeletal organization is strictly dependent on its kinase activity and on the presence of its GBD (25Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We have recently characterized a constitutively active PAK4 mutant, PAK4(S445N). PAK4(S445N) leads to a transient induction of filopodia in fibroblasts that can be seen within minutes after cells are plated onto fibronectin coated surfaces. More long term effects include cell rounding, dissolution of stress fibers, reduced production of focal adhesions, and inhibition of cell spreading (34Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Shi Q. Ha K.C. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Many of these effects of PAK4(S445N) are similar to those observed in response to activated Cdc42 or Rac. Here we have further characterized the function of PAK4 and PAK4(S445N) in the myoblast cell line C2C12. We have found that in C2C12 cells, PAK4(S445N) also induced rounding and dissolution of stress fibers. Instead of stress fibers, C2C12 cells expressing high amounts of PAK4(S445N) often had aggregates of polymerized actin. Since these appeared similar to the actin clusters that are induced by LIMK1, this led us to investigate whether PAK4 may also signal through LIMK1. We have found that PAK4 and PAK4(S445N) both strongly phosphorylated LIMK1. In fact, they phosphorylated LIMK1 more efficiently than equivalent amounts of wild-type or constitutively active PAK1. Activated PAK4 also increased the ability of LIMK1 to phosphorylate cofilin. The induction of actin clusters by LIMK1 was potentiated in the presence of PAK4 or PAK4(S445N), while a dominant negative LIMK1 inhibited PAK4(S445N)-induced cytoskeletal changes. Likewise, a nonphosphorylatable cofilin mutant blocked the cytoskeletal and cell shape changes induced by PAK4(S445N). Myc-tagged PAK4 and PAK4(K350M) are described in Ref. 25Abo A. Qu J.

Mouse anti-Myc (sc-40) antibody is from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-PAK4 antibody (E40–883) was generated against full-length human PAK4 protein (purified using the Life Technologies BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression System) in conjunction with Pharmingen.

Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin is from Molecular Probes. Sf9 insect cells were grown at 27 °C, and cultured in TC-100 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma). All other cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 293 and C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium containing 10% donor bovine calf serum (JRH Biosciences). For transfection in Sf9 cells, 1 µg of recombinant bacmid DNA was transfected into the cells in 35-mm wells (9 × 105 cells/well) using 6 µl of CellFectin (Life Technologies) according to the BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression System (Life Technologies) instruction manual. For transfections in 293 cells, 10 µg of total DNA was transfected into the cells in 10-cm plates (50% confluent) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. For C2C12 cells, 16 µg of total DNA was transfected into the cells in 35-mm wells (seeded with 2.5 × 104 cells/well) containing coverslips, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. For NIH3T3 cells, 2 µg of total DNA was transfected into the cells in 35-mm wells (3 × 105 cells/well) using the LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) method according to the manufacturer's protocol. To investigate the interactions between PAK4 and LIMK1, equal amounts of purified recombinant PAK4 were incubated either alone or with an equivalent amount of purified recombinant LIMK1 (without the GST tag). The complexes were then incubated with rabbit anti-LIMK1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmbenzamidine. After washing twice with PBS, protein complexes associated with the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using a mouse monoclonal antibody against PAK4 (E40–883). Western blots were carried out as described (25Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To assay LIMK1M1 or histone H4 (HH4) phosphorylation by the PAKs, 293 cells were transfected with Myc-PAK4 or PAK1 (wild-type or constitutively active) expression vectors. Cells were harvested in M2 buffer (35Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) 48 h after transfection. The Myc-tagged proteins were then immunopurified from ∼100 µg of cell extracts using antibody generated against the Myc epitope tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; c-Myc (9E10), sc-40), in M2 buffer at 4 °C for 2 h to overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in M2 buffer and twice in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 10 mm MgCl2. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitates were then incubated together with either immunopurified Myc-LIMK1M1 (immunopurified from 293 cell lysates as described above for the PAK proteins), purified GST-LIMK1M1, or HH4. Immune complexes and substrates were then incubated in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm PNPP, 1 mm DTT, 50 µmNa3VO4, 20 µm ATP, and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To analyze the kinase activity of wild-type GST-LIMK1, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pEBG-LIMK1 (a eukaryotic GST vector) in the absence or presence of Myc-PAK4(S445N). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the amount of GST-LIMK1 in cell lysates was normalized by Western blot. Equal amounts of GST-LIMK1 were then purified from ∼100 µg of cell lysates using glutathione-conjugated agarose beads in M2 buffer at 4 °C for 2 h to overnight. The agarose beads were then washed twice in M2 buffer, washed twice in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 10 mm MgCl2, and then incubated in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 10 mmMnCl2, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmDTT, 50 µm Na3VO4, 20 µm ATP, and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, together with 4 µg of purified recombinant GST-cofilin for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. 250 ml of LB/Amp was inoculated with DH5α strain Escherichia coli that was transformed with pGEX-GST-cofilin. GST-cofilin was purified using the same method to purify GST-c-Jun as described in Ref. 36Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar. Purified PAK4, LIMK1, and LIMK1M1 were generated using the BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression System (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, Sf9 cells (9 × 105 Sf9 cells in a 35-mm plate) were transfected with 1 µg of pFASTBAC/6×His-PAK4, pFASTBAC1/GST-LIMK1, or pFASTBAC1/GST-LIMK1M1, according to the manufacturer's protocol. 72 h after transfection, the viral supernatant was removed. 1 ml of the viral supernatant was combined with 20 ml of complete medium to infect confluent Sf9 insect cells in a 200-ml cell culture flask to amplify the virus. 9 days after infection, the viral supernatant was removed, and 0.5 ml of the viral supernatant was combined with 20 ml of complete medium to infect confluent Sf9 insect cells in 150-mm plates. A total of five plates of cells were infected. 72 h after infection, each plate of cells was lysed with 2 ml of M2 buffer. The 6×His-PAK4 lysates were pooled and passed through a Ni2+column. The bound 6×His-PAK4 was then eluted with 150 mmimmidazole. The GST-LIMK1M1 and GST-LIMK1 lysates were pooled and incubated with 1.2 ml of glutathione-conjugated agarose beads. For GST-LIMK1M1, the beads were then washed with M2 buffer, and GST-LIMK1M1 was eluted with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 200 mmglutathione and dialyzed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For GST-LIMK1, the GST was first removed from the rest of the protein by incubation with thrombin. In this case, the beads were incubated in 0.6 ml of thrombin digestion buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 6 units of bovine thrombin (Sigma; T9677) overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The beads were then incubated with high salt/DTT buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected following centrifugation. The two supernatants were pooled and dialyzed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT. The protein was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE to ensure that it was the correct size and the GST had been removed. 48 h after transfection, C2C12 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% goat serum for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were stained for the presence of Myc-LIMK1, Myc-LIMK1M1, Myc-cofilin, or Myc-cofilin(S3A) with mouse anti-Myc antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa 350 (blue) (Molecular Probes). Filamentous actin was visualized by staining the cells with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (red). The presence of pIRES2-EGFP-PAK4 or pIRES2-EGFP-PAK4(S445N) was detected by fluorescence microscopy to visualize GFP-expressing cells (green). The images were taken with a Nikon DIAPHOT 300 inverted microscope with epifluorescence attachments and a color CCD camera. To determine whether PAK4 and LIMK1 interact with each other, purified recombinant PAK4 was incubated alone or together with purified LIMK1. The samples were then incubated with anti-LIMK1 antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. The complexes were then washed and analyzed by Western blot. The presence of PAK4 in the complexes was assessed by probing the blot with anti-PAK4 antibody (see Fig. 1). The results indicate that PAK4 interacts specifically with LIMK1. To determine whether PAK4 phosphorylates LIMK1, 293 cells were transfected with wild-type PAK4, activated PAK4(S445N), kinase-defective PAK4(K350M), wild-type PAK1, or activated PAK1(T423E), all fused to Myc epitope tags. After transient transfection, immunopurified PAK4 or PAK1 was incubated with equal amounts of either immunopurified Myc-LIMK1M1(D446E), purified GST-LIMK1M1(D446E), or HH4. LIMK1M1(D446E) has a point mutation in the kinase domain that abolishes its kinase activity, but it can still be phosphorylated by upstream activators (31Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). An immune complex kinase assay was then carried out in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The results indicate that LIMK1M1 was phosphorylated by wild-type PAK4, and it was phosphorylated even more strongly by PAK4(S445N) (Fig.2A). In contrast, phosphorylation of LIMK1M1 by wild-type PAK1 was not detectable, and constitutively active PAK1- (T423E) phosphorylated LIMK1M1 inefficiently compared with PAK4. (A faint band can be seen inlane 6, where purified GST-LIMK1M1 was used as a substrate.) In fact, phosphorylation of LIMK1M1 by PAK1(T423E) could only really be detected when the gel was overexposed relative to PAK4 activity (data not shown). The same amount of PAK1 and PAK1- (T423E), however, phosphorylated HH4 as efficiently as PAK4 (Fig.2 A). All of the different PAK proteins were expressed at equal levels as detected by Western blot (Fig. 2 A,bottom panel). LIMK1 is known to phosphorylate the cytoskeletal regulatory protein cofilin (31Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 32Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). To determine whether activated PAK4 increases the ability of LIMK1 to phosphorylate cofilin, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with Myc-PAK4(S445N) expression vector together with GST-LIMK1 vector. After transient expression, equal amounts of GST-LIMK1 were isolated from cell lysates using glutathione-agarose beads. GST-LIMK1 complexes were then used to phosphorylate recombinant cofilin in an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Although LIMK1 phosphorylated cofilin on its own, the presence of PAK4(S445N)-stimulated LIMK1 induced phosphorylation of cofilin ∼4-fold (Fig. 2 B). To see whether PAK4 and LIMK1 cooperate to induce cytoskeletal changes, C2C12 cells were transfected with PAK4 (wild-type or activated)-IRES2-EGFP vector or Myc-tagged LIMK1 (wild-type or kinase-inactive) expression vectors, alone or in combination. 48 h after transfection, cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (red) in order to visualize polymerized actin structures. PAK4-IRES2-EGFP-expressing cells were identified by fluorescence microscopy (green), and cells expressing LIMK1 were detected by immunofluorescence using anti-Myc antibody and Alexa 350 conjugated secondary antibody (blue). Representative phalloidin-stained cells are shown in Fig. 3, Aand B. Transfected cells are indicated by anarrow. Fig. 3 A shows cells that were transfected with either PAK4, activated PAK4(S445N), LIMK1, or kinase-dead LIMK1M1 expression vectors. While expression of wild-type PAK4 had little effect on the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 3 A, a andb), PAK4(S445N) induced dramatic cell changes, which varied depending on the expression level. In ∼50% of the cells, relatively low levels of PAK4(S445N) were expressed (as assessed by the intensity of the green color). These cells exhibited the dissolution of actin stress fibers and the formation of actin fibers at the periphery of the cell, similar to the results seen previously in fibroblasts (34Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Shi Q. Ha K.C. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A, c and d). The rest of the transfected cells, in which higher amounts of PAK4(S445N) were expressed, were rounded, lacked stress fibers, and contained actin clusters instead of stress fibers (Fig. 3 A, e andf). Filopodia were generally not visible in cells expressing PAK4(S445N). This is consistent with results in Rat1 fibroblasts in which filopodia were only visible transiently after PAK4(S445N)-expressing cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated surfaces and could not be seen 48 h later (34Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Shi Q. Ha K.C. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). LIMK1 expression, as reported previously (31Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 32Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar), led to an increase in actin clusters within the cell, similar to PAK4(S445N), but unlike PAK4(S445N), it did not induce cell rounding (Fig. 3 A, g andh). In contrast, LIMK1M1 led to a reduction of polymerized actin within the cell (Fig. 3 A, i andj). Fig. 3 B shows cells that were transfected with PAK4-IRES2-EGFP or PAK4(S445N)-IRES2-EGFP vectors together with either Myc-tagged LIMK1 or Myc-tagged LIMK1M1, which was used as a dominant negative mutant. Co-transfection of PAK4 and LIMK1 resulted in an increase in polymerized actin structures (Fig. 3 B,a–c). The amount of polymerized actin was generally higher than that seen with LIMK1 alone. Furthermore, cells were more rounded and less well spread than the cells containing LIMK1 alone, although not as rounded as the cells containing PAK4(S445N) (Compare with Fig.3 A, h or f). In contrast, cells transfected with PAK4 together with LIMK1M1 (Fig. 3 B,d–f) did not show an increase in polymerized actin or changes in cell spreading. Cells transfected with PAK4(S445N) together with LIMK1 vector (Fig. 3 B, g–i) showed a dramatic increase in polymerized actin. Polymerized actin appeared to fill the entire cells, which were rounded and condensed. Organized stress fibers, however, were not detected. The polymerized actin structures were much more abundant in cells co-expressing PAK4(S445N) and LIMK1 than in the presence of either one alone (compare with Fig.3 A, f or h). Strikingly, cells co-transfected with PAK4(S445N) and LIMK1M1 appeared similar to nontransfected cells (Fig. 3 B, j–l). Virtually all of the transfected cells completely lost the polymerized actin aggregates normally associated with PAK4(S445N), even when high levels of PAK4(S445N) were expressed as detected by fluorescence microscopy. In a significant proportion of the cells, cell rounding was also diminished. The major cellular changes seen in cells expressing PAK4(S445N) alone or together with LIMK1 or LIMK1M1 are summarized later in Fig. 5. Taken together, these results indicate that PAK4 and LIMK1 can cooperate to induce actin clusters, and dominant negative LIMK1 inhibits the cell shape and cytoskeletal changes induced by activated PAK4. LIMK is thought to function by phosphorylating cofilin and thereby inhibiting its ability to depolymerize actin (31Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). To see whether cofilin mediates the cytoskeletal changes induced by PAK4, C2C12 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged cofilin or a mutant Myc-tagged cofilin(S3A) (which cannot be phosphorylated by LIMK1), either alone or together with PAK4(S445N)-IRES2-EGFP vector (Fig.4). The right four panels show polymerized actin staining in cells as visualized by staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Theleft four panels show fluorescence micrographs of the same fields, used to identify the cells that contain the expressed plasmids, as described for Fig. 3. Cells expressing cofilin had a reduction in polymerized actin (Fig. 4, a andb), as expected because cofilin acts to depolymerize filamentous actin (37Moon A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Cells expressing cofilin(S3A) showed a more dramatic reduction in polymerized actin than the wild-type cofilin (Fig. 4, c and d). This is consistent with the idea that cofilin(S3A) is a deregulated form of cofilin that can no longer be inhibited by phosphorylation (29Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Cells expressing PAK4(S445N) (Fig. 4, e and f) were rounded with an increase in polymerized actin structures as seen in Fig. 3. Similar to LIMK1M1, co-expression of cofilin(S3A) with PAK4(S445N) (Fig. 4,g and h) led to a near complete loss of polymerized actin as well as a loss of the rounded morphology typically induced by PAK4(S445N) (compare f and h). The major cellular changes seen in cells expressing PAK4(S445N) alone or together with the cofilin mutant or LIMK1 are summarized in Fig.5. In summary, these results indicate that cofilin is an important mediator of the cytoskeletal and cell shape changes that are induced by activated PAK4. Members of the PAK family have been shown to regulate a wide variety of cytoskeletal changes, usually by mediating responses to Rho family GTPases. Here we have shown that PAK4 phosphorylates the serine/threonine kinase LIMK1 and stimulates its activity. Previous work has shown that recombinant constitutively active PAK1 phosphorylates purified LIMK1 and that PAK1 may be the link between Rac and LIMK1 (29Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Our phosphorylation assays were carried out using PAK proteins that were expressed in mammalian cells and immunopurified from cell lysates rather than recombinant proteins. When we compared immunopurified PAK1 with immunopurified PAK4, PAK4 phosphorylated LIMK1 significantly more strongly than an equivalent amount of activated PAK1, and wild-type PAK1 did not phosphorylate LIMK1 at all. These differences in substrate specificity are not surprising, because PAK1 and PAK4 are quite divergent in sequence and function (25Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In fact, PAK4 and PAK1 share only ∼50% sequence identity in the kinase domain and no identity in the regulatory domain except for the GBD motif (25Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). LIMK1 is known to regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting the activity of the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin (31Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). The exact function of LIMK1 however, appears to be complex, since it has been shown to mediate diverse types of morphological changes in response to different activators. For example, LIMK1 is regulated by Rac (29Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), a GTPase that can both promote lamellipodia formation (9Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar) and trigger a decrease in stress fiber formation in some cells (38Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have shown that LIMK1 is a target for PAK4, which also causes a decrease in stress fiber formation (Fig.3). 2J. Qu, M. S. Cammarano, Q. Shi, K. C. Ha, P. de Lanerolle, and A. Minden, submitted for publication. However, LIMK1 has also been shown to be activated by RhoA (39Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 40Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), a GTPase that triggers the formation of stress fibers (10Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3828) Google Scholar). These seemingly contradictory results may be partly explained by the fact that the formation and dissolution of stress fibers are regulated not only by actin polymerization and depolymerization but also by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of myosin light chain, an important component of stress fibers (39Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 40Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol.

Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which LIMK1 may contribute to the production of such diverse types of cytoskeletal structures in response to divergent types of activators is thus likely to involve the coordinated regulation of different types of cytoskeletal regulatory proteins acting in concert with LIMK1. Our results suggest that the function of PAK4 is also more complex than we previously predicted. While we and others have found evidence for a role for PAK4 and other PAK family members in cytoskeletal organization in response to Rac and Cdc42, some of the cytoskeletal changes induced by activated PAK4, such as actin clustering and cell rounding, differ from Rac- or Cdc42-induced changes. It seems likely, therefore, that PAK4 may regulate cytoskeletal changes in response to both Rho GTPase-dependent and -independent stimuli. It is interesting that dominant negative LIMK1 inhibits most of the changes induced by PAK4(S445N) including cell rounding and the formation of actin clusters, which is consistent with the idea that cell shape and cytoskeletal organization are tightly linked. Currently, we do not know the physiological significance of the actin clusters that are induced by activated PAK4(S445N). Since LIMK1 induces similar structures, they may be a result of the increase in actin polymerization triggered by inhibition of cofilin activity.

It is not activated by Cdc42, however, and it is not required for the induction of filopodia by Cdc42 (29Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 32Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). This raises questions about the role for PAK4 in LIMK1 activation, since PAK4 was identified as a kinase that is preferentially regulated by Cdc42 (25Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that although PAK4 binds more efficiently to Cdc42, it can also bind weakly to Rac (34Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Shi Q. Ha K.C. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and its kinase activity is partly elevated in response to expression of activated Rac. 3C. Dan and A. Minden, unpublished results. Some of the cytoskeletal effects induced by activated PAK4 in C2C12 cells also resemble Rac-induced cytoskeletal changes, such as increased actin at the cell periphery and a decrease in stress fibers. One possibility therefore, is that PAK4 can function downstream of both Cdc42 and Rac and that it can activate both LIMK1-dependent (Rac pathway) and LIMK1-independent (Cdc42 pathway) signaling pathways. Another intriguing possibility is that LIMK2, rather than LIMK1, is the real target for PAK4. LIMK2 is closely related in sequence to LIMK1 (42Nunoue K. Ohashi K. Okano I. Mizuno K. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 701-710PubMed Google Scholar), and it also operates by phosphorylating cofilin. However, recently it was shown that unlike LIMK1, LIMK2 is activated by Cdc42 (and also by Rho) (43Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LIMK2, but not LIMK1, was shown to be required for filopodia formation triggered by Cdc42. Thus, while they both inhibit cofilin activity, LIMK1 and LIMK2 regulate different types of cytoskeletal changes. This suggests that the two kinases may operate in concert with different cytoskeletal regulatory proteins. Upstream kinases that regulate LIMK2's activity have not yet been identified. Since LIMK2 shares considerable sequence similarity with LIMK1, an intriguing possibility is that PAK4 could actually be the link between Cdc42 and LIMK2 activation. Further work will be required to determine whether LIMK1 or LIMK2 or both are actually the physiological targets for PAK4. We thank J. Qu for providing PAK4 expression plasmids."

The molecular types of collagen, as well as the specific supramolecular aggregates they form, are often tissue-specific and provide a specialized function. For example, collagen I, the principal collagen of skin, is arranged in randomly oriented bundles in the dermis but in parallel bundles in tendons. Collagen II, a specific component of cartilage ECM, is arranged in an open meshwork that traps proteoglycans and facilitates resistance to compression. The synthesis, secretion, and assembly of collagens into specific supramolecular aggregates is a complex, multistep process (3Birk D.E. Silver F.H. Trelstad R.L. Hay E.D.

These disorders present clinically with severe fragility of skin. Their molecular hallmark is the presence of irregular, thin, branched collagen fibrils in the dermis that appear “hieroglyphic” in cross-section and contain collagen I with an intact N-propeptide, termed pN-collagen I (19Nusgens B.V.

Similar findings have been described very recently in adamts2 transgenic knockout mice (20Li S.W. Arita M. Fertala A. Bao Y. Kopen G.C. Langsjo T.K. Hyttinen M.M. Helminen H.J. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Among the various members of the ADAMTS family (currently 19 gene products), the overall domain organization and amino acid sequence of ADAMTS-2 is most similar to that of ADAMTS-3 (10Hurskainen T.L. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25555-25563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). ADAMTS3cDNA was originally cloned from human brain and named theKIAA0366 gene 3The partial sequence of ADAMTS3 (theKIAA0366 gene) was previously reported with GenBankTM accession number AB002364. (21Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The KIAA0366 cDNA was incomplete at the 5′ end, and the translation start codon had not been identified (21Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Through molecular cloning described herein, we now provide the complete primary structure of ADAMTS-3. Substrates for ADAMTS-3 have not been previously identified. In light of the new data presented here, showing that procollagen II in dermatosparactic cartilage is completely processed, we investigated a role for ADAMTS-3 in procollagen II processing. The model system we used to test this hypothesis was the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma-derived cell line, RCS-LTC. In monolayer culture, these cells deposit an ECM containing collagens II, IX, and XI. However, the collagen is organized into thin filaments instead of fibrils (22Fernandes R.J. Ph.D. thesis. Dept. of Biochemistry, Rush University, Chicago, IL1993Google Scholar). RCS-LTC cells fail to process procollagen II beyond the stage of pN-collagen II, although the amino acid sequence of the N-propeptidase cleavage site in RCS-LTC procollagen II is normal (23Fernandes R.J. Schmid T.M. Harkey M.A. Eyre D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). RCS-LTC pN-collagen II is, however, processed in vitro by addition of conditioned medium from cultures of chick chondrocytes (23Fernandes R.J. Schmid T.M. Harkey M.A. Eyre D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suggested that RCS-LTC chondrocytes either fail to express procollagen II N-propeptidase or lack a soluble, essential cofactor. In this article, we demonstrate that transfection of RCS-LTC cells withADAMTS3 or ADAMTS2 results in conversion of some of the pN-collagen II to a fully processed form. The results establish that N-propeptidase deficiency is responsible, at least in part, for defective collagen processing in RCS-LTC cells. We further demonstrate that steady-state mRNA levels of ADAMTS2 andADAMTS3 are different in normal human skin and in skin fibroblasts than in cartilage, with ADAMTS-3 being expressed at higher levels than ADAMTS-2 in cartilage. Together, these data suggest that ADAMTS-3, not ADAMTS-2, is the major procollagen II N-propeptidase. The previously reported 5774-base pair KIAA0366/ADAMTS3 cDNA (21Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) was extended further in the 5′ direction by RACE using the MarathonTM system, and MarathonTM human fetal brain cDNA (reagents fromCLONTECH, Palo Alto) as template, essentially as described previously (10Hurskainen T.L. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25555-25563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). PCR was done with nestedADAMTS3-specific antisense oligonucleotide primers 5′-TCAAGGCCTTCCAGGTCCGACTCTC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGCCTGTTCTACAGCTGATCTC-3′ and with nested adapter primers at the 5′ end of the template. The RACE products were cloned and sequenced as described previously (10Hurskainen T.L. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25555-25563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To generate a cDNA construct for expression of full-length ADAMTS-3, we first deleted the 5′ end of the KIAA0366 cDNA (in pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), provided by Dr. Takahiro Nagase of the Kazusa DNA Institute). The deleted segment extended from the 5′SalI cloning (i.e. vector) site up to a unique internal AccI site at nucleotide position 598 (KIAA0366 sequence enumeration). We replaced this fragment with a PCR-derived fragment of ADAMTS3 cDNA extending from the 5′-untranslated sequence to just downstream of the AccI site. Briefly, PCR was performed with Advantage PCR reagents (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), using the RACE cDNA clone as template, the forward primer 5′-AACTCGAGGAAAGTGAACTCGACTCGTG-3′ (XhoI site underlined) and reverse primer 5′-AGCCTGTTCTACAGCTGATC-3′. The resulting amplicon was digested with XhoI andAccI (at the internal AccI site) and cloned into the SalI-AccI-restricted KIAA0366 cDNA. This introduced the authentic ADAMTS3 ribosome-binding sequence, translation start codon, and complete signal peptide into the KIAA0366 cDNA. This insert encoding full-length ADAMTS-3 was excised from pBluescript with XhoI and NotI and ligated into the corresponding sites in pcDNA 3.1 (+)-myc-His A (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). In this mammalian expression construct, ADAMTS-3 is not in frame with the C-terminal mycand polyhistidine tags. For expression of ADAMTS-2, three overlapping bovine cDNA clones that have been reported previously (7Colige A. Li S.W. Sieron A.L. Nusgens B.V. Prockop D.J. Lapiere C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2374-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) were appropriately digested (with NotI, BclI,EagI, and KpnI) and assembled to generate a construct encoding full-length bovine ADAMTS-2. The ADAMTS2cDNA was inserted into the NotI/XbaI sites of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) using anXbaI adapter. Skin samples obtained from the forearm of healthy volunteers were used to isolate dermal fibroblasts or were stored in liquid nitrogen until use (Laboratoire de Biologie des Tissus Conjonctifs, Sart-Tilman, Belgium, Ethics Committee Approval F94/14/1871). Dermal fibroblasts grown from skin explants were cultivated in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For Northern analysis, total RNA was purified from skin samples pulverized in liquid nitrogen or from dermal fibroblasts in culture, after solubilization of homogenates and cells in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 1% β-mercaptoethanol. These extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 18 h on a cesium chloride (CsCl2) cushion (0.01 m EDTA, pH 7.5, 5.7m CsCl2). mRNA was subsequently purified using Poly(A)Tract mRNA Isolation System (Promega Benelux B.V.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitative RT-PCR, RNA was harvested from human fetal cartilage or from dermal fibroblasts using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the manufacturer's recommended protocols. DNA was eliminated by treatment with DNase I (DNA-FreeTM, Ambion, Austin, TX). Total RNA (2.5 µg) was reverse-transcribed with the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Life Technologies, Inc.) using oligo(dT) as a primer. Real time PCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector using SYBR Green PCR Core Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). In this system, continuous, automated quantitation of the PCR product is performed by measuring the fluorescence generated by the binding of SYBR Green to double-stranded DNA. PCR amplifications were performed in triplicate for skin fibroblast RNA and in quadruplicate for cartilage RNA, along with parallel measurements of GAPDH cDNA (an internal control). Data were analyzed according to the comparative C tmethod (Applied Biosystems protocols) and represented after normalization to GAPDH levels. To confirm these data, PCR products were also separated on a 2.0% agarose gel, visualized with UV light through a SYBR Green filter, and photographed. The following primers were used for amplification at a concentration of 300 nm:ADAMTS2, 5′-TGGGAAGCACAACGACATTG3-′ (forward) and 5′-CTCGGTCGTCGAGGGATTAG-3′ (reverse); ADAMTS3, 5′-TCAGTGGGAGGTCCAAATGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAAAGAAGGAAGCAGCAGCC-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5′-CCACTGCCAACGTGTCAGTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGGTGGAGGAGTGGGTGTCG-3′ (reverse). As an additional control, RT-PCR was also performed in the absence of template. A commercially available adult human multiple tissue Northern blot and a mouse embryo Northern blot (CLONTECH Inc. Palo Alto, CA) were hybridized as per manufacturer's instructions using ExpressHybTM hybridization fluid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The following cDNA probes were used after random-primed labeling with [α-32P]dCTP: a fragment containing nucleotides 946–1379 of human ADAMTS-2 cloned in pCR4-TOPO (for human multiple tissue Northern blot); a 1.1-kb HindIII fragment from the KIAA0366/ADAMTS3 cDNA (for human multiple tissue Northern blot); the insert of IMAGE clone 1246561, available with GenBankTM accession number AA832579 (mouse ADAMTS-2 probe for mouse embryo Northern blot); the insert of IMAGE clone 727026, available with GenBankTM accession number AA402760 (mouse ADAMTS-3 probe for mouse embryo Northern blot). Exposure of the blots to x-ray film was for 3–7 days. Poly(A)+ RNA (0.8 µg) from human skin or human skin fibroblasts was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted to Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cRNA probes for human ADAMTS2 andADAMTS3 were generated by transcription from the respective clones using the Strip-EZ RNA kit (Ambion), T3 RNA polymerase, and [α-32P]UTP as per manufacturer's instructions. Prehybridization (1 h) and hybridization (18 h) were performed at 65 °C in 0.2 m Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% SDS, and 20% formamide. Stringency washes were carried out at 65 °C in 40 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. Monolayer cultures of RCS-LTC cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Labs, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Culture medium was changed every other day, and confluent cultures were sub-cultured every 2 weeks as described previously (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar, 25Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for RCS-LTC transfections. Cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ). After 24 h, the wells were rinsed with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected with the human ADAMTS3 or bovineADAMTS2 cDNA constructs (1 µg of DNA/well) as per the manufacturer's instructions. As a control for efficiency of transfection and to provide a negative control for procollagen II processing, cells were separately transfected with pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (+)-lacZ encoding the Escherichia coli lacZ gene. Mock transfections were performed without cDNA as a control for efficacy of antibiotic selection. After 4 days in culture, transfected cells were selected in media supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 sulfate (geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 weeks in culture, the chondrocytes from the mock transfections did not survive selection. Geneticin-resistant ADAMTS3, ADAMTS2, and lacZ transfected chondrocytes were expanded and maintained as pools in serial monolayer culture as described previously for the RCS-LTC cell line but in the continued presence of 1 mg/ml geneticin. β-Galactosidase expression in the lacZ stable transfectants was detected histochemically by staining the cells with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal, Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, the cultures were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 15 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.3), fixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde, and incubated with 1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 2 mmMgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline for 24 h at 37 °C. ADAMTS3,ADAMTS2, and lacZ stable transfectants as well as untransfected RCS-LTC chondrocytes were grown in 6-well plates (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) following sub-culture as described. For the last day of culture, the culture medium was supplemented with 10 mg/mll-ascorbate and 100 mg/ml β-aminopropionitrile. Cells and ECM were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted at 100 °C with Laemmli sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) containing 100 mmdithiothreitol or with 0.4 m NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1% Triton X-100. To identify procollagen II-processing intermediates, untransfected RCS-LTC chondrocytes were grown for 4 days in the absence of ascorbate and β-aminopropionitrile. The cell layers were extracted as above. Extracts were repeatedly passed through a 27.5-gauge needle to reduce viscosity and were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Collagen II in extracts of cartilage and RCS-LTC transfectants was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Extracts were heated to 100 °C for 3 min in Laemmli sample buffer (25Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar) containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Collagen II chains were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE and detected after transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a monoclonal antibody to collagen II (1C10; 0.5 µg/ml) and the Renaissance Western blot detection reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Monoclonal antibody 1C10 4D. R. Eyre, unpublished data. recognizes an epitope in denatured α1(II) CB9,7. It detects procollagen II as well as processed collagen II on Western blots. As controls, fully processed collagen II from a 4 mguanidine HCl extract of human fetal cartilage and pepsin-extracted collagen II from the RCS-LTC cell line were used (23Fernandes R.J. Schmid T.M. Harkey M.A. Eyre D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Nasal cartilage from a dermatosparactic cow and normal fetal bovine epiphyseal cartilage were extracted in 4 mguanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline at 4 °C for 24 h. Collagen in this extract was separated by reducing SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and by Western blot analysis using 1C10 as described above. By using 5′-RACE, we obtained a novel 720-base pair cDNA clone encoding the 5′-untranslated region, the translation start codon, signal peptide, and pro-domain of ADAMTS-3. The novel 5′ sequence we obtained has not been previously described and is deposited in GenBankTM with accession number AF247668. When incorporated into the KIAA0366 sequence, we were therefore able to identify the complete open reading frame and conceptual translation product of ADAMTS3. The predicted start codon is the 5′-most methionine codon (ATG) in the open reading frame (Fig.1B) and is preceded by an in-frame stop codon, 16 nucleotides upstream. It is located within the context of a suitable Kozak consensus sequence for translation (contains purine (G) at position −3 with respect to the A of the ATG codon, and G at position +4) (25Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). The predicted ADAMTS-3 protein (1205 amino acids) is comparable in length to human and bovine ADAMTS-2 (1211 and 1205 amino acids, respectively) (7Colige A. Li S.W. Sieron A.L. Nusgens B.V.

The predicted mature (furin-processed) forms of these proteases are also of comparable length, 957 residues (ADAMTS-3) and 953 residues (bovine and human ADAMTS-2) long. ADAMTS3 predicts a full-length protein of molecular mass 135.6 kDa and a furin-processed form of 107.5 kDa, although it is likely that post-translational modification of ADAMTS-3 will increase its mass (see below). ADAMTS-3 and ADAMTS-2 have a similar domain structure (Fig.1 A) and an overall sequence identity of 61% (Fig.1 B). From N to C terminus, each of these enzymes consists of the following domains (with percent sequence identity in parentheses): signal peptide, pro-domain (37%), catalytic domain (85%), disintegrin-like domain (77%), central thrombospondin type I (TS) repeat (63%), cysteine-rich domain (67%), spacer domain (56%), and three additional TS repeats (64%), followed by an essentially unique C-terminal extension (Fig. 1 A). The putative ADAMTS-3 furin-processing site is at a location identical to the downstream of two furin consensus sites found in ADAMTS-2 (Fig.1 B). ADAMTS-3 and ADAMTS-2 catalytic domains have complete sequence identity (but for one amino acid) over 69 amino acids which includes the zinc-binding active site (Fig. 1 B). ADAMTS-3 and ADAMTS-2 each have eight consensus sequences (Asn-X-(Ser/Thr)) for potential N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 1, A and B). Of these, four are conserved absolutely between ADAMTS-2 and ADAMTS-3, two conserved sites being in the pro-domain, and one site each in the catalytic domain and the second TS domain. One site in both ADAMTS-2 and ADAMTS-3 has the sequence Asn-Pro-Ser. It has been shown that the presence of proline between Asn and Ser/Thr inhibits N-glycosylation (26Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), and it is possible that this particular site may not be modified. In contrast to ADAMTS-2, which contains the potential cell-binding sequence CVRGDC, ADAMTS-3 has the sequence CVRGEC at the corresponding location (Fig. 1 B). The C-terminal extensions of these two molecules are of comparable length (184 and 191 amino acids in ADAMTS-2 and ADAMTS-3, respectively) but show little sequence similarity other than a highly conserved PLAC (protease and LACunin) domain (83% identity, Fig.1 B) (27Nardi J.B. Martos R. Walden K.K. Lampe D.J. Robertson H.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The PLAC domain was first described in an insect protein, lacunin (27Nardi J.B. Martos R. Walden K.K. Lampe D.J. Robertson H.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which contains all the ancillary domains of ADAMTS, as well as other domains and can therefore be considered a complex ADAMTS-like protein. The PLAC domains of human ADAMTS-3 and bovine ADAMTS-2 each contain six cysteine residues (Fig.1 B). In a human ADAMTS-2 sequence published previously (8Colige A. Sieron A.L. Li S.W. Schwarze U. Petty E. Wertelecki W. Wilcox W. Krakow D. Cohn D.H. Reardon W. Byers P.H. Lapiere C.M. Prockop D.J. Nusgens B.V. Am. J. Hum.

However, it is likely that this represents a sequence variation or error since there is a cysteine at this position in three independent ADAMTS2 expressed sequence tag sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AI417257, AI624388, andAI089232). adamts2 and adamts3 were both expressed during mouse embryogenesis. adamts2 expression was noted in mouse embryos at 7, 15, and 17 days but not at 11 days. Two mRNA species (7.8 and 4.0 kb) were detected"

This wind wake drives an eastward ocean current that draws warm water from the Asian coast 8000 kilometers away, leaving marked changes in surface and subsurface ocean temperature. Standing in the path of the steady trade winds, Hawaii triggers an air-sea interaction that provides the feedback to sustain the influence of these small islands over a long stretch of the Pacific Ocean."

The mechanism of activation of cyclin D1 is mitogen- and cell context-dependent, and this study describes the role of multiple promoter elements required for induction of cyclin D1 by E2 in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive ZR-75 breast cancer cells. Transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 by E2 was dependent, in part, on a proximal cAMP-response element at −66, and this was linked to induction of protein kinase A-dependent pathways. These results contrasted to a recent report showing that induction of cyclin D1 by E2 in ER-positive MCF-7 and HeLa cells was due to up-regulation of c-jun and subsequent interaction of c-Jun-ATF-2 with the CRE. Moreover, further examination of the proximal region of the cyclin D1 promoter showed that three GC-rich Sp1-binding sites at −143 to −110 were also E2-responsive, and interaction of ERα and Sp1 proteins at these sites was confirmed by electromobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Thus, induction of cyclin D1 by E2 in ZR-75 cells is regulated through nuclear ERα/Sp1 and epigenetic protein kinase A activation pathways, and our results suggest that this mechanism may be cell context-dependent even among ER-positive breast cancer cell lines.

Cyclin D1 is induced early in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes are important for phosphorylation of several key substrates involved in cell proliferation including retinoblastoma protein and other pocket proteins. The critical role for cyclin D1 in the rate of progression of cells through G1 has stimulated studies on factors that regulate cyclin D1 gene expression in various cell types. Transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 depends in part on interaction of trans-acting factors with elements in the cyclin D1 gene promoter; it is clear from promoter analysis studies that the assembly of transcription factors is highly variable and dependent on multiple factors including the mitogen and cell context (8–20). For example, p21ras and p300 expression activated constructs containing cyclin D1 gene promoter inserts in JEG-3 human trophoblasts through interactions of proteins at a distal AP-1-like sequence at −954 in the promoter (13Albanese C.

They identified a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-independent pathway for activation of this CRE, and transactivation was linked to induction of c-jun and interaction of c-Jun-ATF-2 heterodimers at the CRE. This study reports that E2 also induces cyclin D1 gene expression in ER-positive ZR-75 breast cancer cells, and deletion analysis of the promoter confirmed that the downstream CRE was E2-inducible through activation of PKA. Moreover, further examination of the promoter shows that three GC-rich Sp1-binding sites at −142 to −110 were also E2-responsive indicating that transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 by E2 involves multiple proximal cis-elements including GC-rich sites that bind hERα·Sp1 complexes.

The pGL2 luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega Corp.) was modified with the insertion of TATA sequence into its polylinker site immediately upstream of the luciferase expression gene. Cyclin D1 promoter fragments (−174 to −100, −164 to −120, −145 to −100, and −107 to +100) were synthesized or amplified as double-stranded DNA and inserted into the vector betweenKpnI and XhoI polylinker sites. All ligation products were transformed into competent Escherichia colicells. Plasmids were isolated, and clones were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. High quality plasmids for transfection were prepared using Qiagen Plasmid Mega Kit. Oligonucleotides were synthesized, purified, and annealed, and 5 pmol of specific oligonucleotides were 32P-labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Gel mobility shift and supershift assays were performed as described previously (28Wang W. Smith R. Safe S. Arch. Biochem.

Cells were cultured in DME/F-12 (serum-free) for 3 days and then treated with Me2SO or E2 (for 30 min, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h). RNA was extracted using an RNA extraction kit from Tel-Test (Friendswood, TX), and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (35Dong L. Wang W. Wang F. Stoner M. Reed J.C.

The 874-base pair cyclin D1 cDNA used for Northern blot analysis was obtained using the following primers: sense primer, AGGAAGAGCCCCAGCCATGGGAA; antisense primer, TGTGCAAGCCAGGTCCACCT. β-Tubulin mRNA was used as an internal control to standardize cyclin D1 mRNA levels. Aliquots of whole cell extracts (100 µg) for Western blot analysis were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (35Dong L. Wang W. Wang F. Stoner M. Reed J.C. Harigai M. Kladde M. Vyhlidal C. Safe S.

Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211941) Google Scholar). ZR-75 cells were transiently transfected for 6–18 h by calcium phosphate coprecipitation with 2–4 µg of reporter plasmid and 2 µg of pcDNA3.1/His/LacZβ-galactosidase as a control vector. The reporter plasmids were cotransfected 1:0.33 to 1:0.5 with ERα or ERα variants expression vectors. Luciferase activities in the various treatment groups were performed on 30 µl of cell extract using the luciferase assay system, and results were normalized to β-galactosidase enzyme activity as described previously (28Wang W.

ZR-75 or MCF-7 breast cancer cells were grown in 150-mm tissue culture plates to >70% confluency and treated with 10 nm E2 for various times. Formaldehyde was then added to the medium to give a 1% solution and incubated with shaking for 10 min at 20 °C. After addition of glycine (0.125 m) and incubation for 10 min, the media were removed; cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, scraped, and collected by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended in swell buffer (85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin at pH 8.0) and homogenized. Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 30 s, then resuspended in sonication buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and sonicated for 45–60 s to obtain chromatin with appropriate fragment lengths (500–1000 base pair). This extract was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 0 °C, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C until used. The cross-linked chromatin preparations were diluted in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and 20 µl of Ultralink protein A or G or A/G beads (Pierce) were added per 100 µl of chromatin and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. A 100-µl aliquot was saved and used as the 100% input control. Salmon sperm DNA, specific antibodies, and 20 µl of Ultralink beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged; beads were resuspended in dialysis buffer, vortexed for 5 min at 20 °C, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 s. Beads were then resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (11 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, pH 8.0) and vortexed for 5 min at 20 °C. The procedures with the dialysis and immunoprecipitation buffers were repeated (3–4 times), and beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (50 nmNaHCO3, 1% SDS, 1.5 µg/m sonicated salmon sperm DNA), vortexed, and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min. Supernatants were then isolated by centrifugation and incubated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse protein-DNA cross-links. Wizard PCR kits (Promega) were used for additional DNA clean up, and PCR was used to detect the presence of promoter regions immunoprecipitated with commercially available ERα or Sp1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The following primers were used for PCR analysis of immunoprecipitated promoter regions: cathepsin D Fw-(−294), 5′-TCC AGA CAT CCT CTC TGG AA-3′, and Rv-(−54), 5′-GGA GCG GAG GGT CCA TTC-3′; cathepsin D (exon 2) Fw-(+2469), 5′-TGC ACA AGT TCA CGT CCA TC-3′, and Rv-(+2615) 5′-TGT AGT TCT TGA GCA CCT CG-3′; cyclin D1 Fw-(−204), 5′-GGC GAT TTG CAT TTC TAT GA-3′, and Rv-(+32) 5′-CAA AAC TCC CCT GTA GTC CGT-3′. Cells were grown at room temperature in T-150 flasks in Schneider's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% FBS (heat-inactivated at 55 °C for 30 min) and 0.5× antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Cells were grown in 12-well plates, and luciferase activities in various treatment groups were determined and normalized to β-galactosidase activity (internal control) as described previously (28Wang W.

Results of transient transfection studies are presented as means ± S.D. for at least three separate experiments for each treatment group. All other experiments were carried out at least two times to confirm a consistent pattern of responses. Statistical differences between treatment groups were determined by analysis of variance and Scheffe's test. Treatment of ZR-75 cells with 10 nm E2 resulted in the induction of cyclin D1 mRNA levels within 30 min, and elevated expression subsequently decreased with time (Fig.1 A). These results are comparable to those reported previously in other ER-positive breast cancer cell lines (24Foster J.S. Wimalasena J. Mol.

In addition, E2 also induces cyclin D1 protein (Fig. 1 B). Initial transient transfection studies with pCD1-(−1745 to +130) in ZR-75 cells showed that treatment with 50 nm E2 alone resulted in a 2-fold increase in reporter gene activity (Fig. 2 A). Transfection studies in ER-positive breast cancer cells with many E2-responsive constructs containing consensus and nonconsensus EREs, GC-rich, or AP1 sites show that hormone-induced transactivation is observed only after cotransfection with an ER expression plasmid (37Augereau P.

The results summarized in Fig. 2 A show that E2 induces luciferase activity in ZR-75 cells transfected with pCD1 and cotransfected with ERα, but not ERβ, expression plasmid. Deletion analysis of the cyclin D1 gene promoter showed that E2-induced reporter gene activity in ZR-75 cells transfected with pCD1, pCD2, pCD3, and pCD4 (Fig. 2 B), and it was evident that deletion of the −1745 to −163 region of the promoter did not affect E2 responsiveness.

https://openalex.org/W2028600729,"Defects of the SCN5A gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel α-subunit are associated with both the long QT-3 (LQT-3) subtype of long-QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome (BrS). One previously described SCN5A mutation (1795insD) in the C terminus results in a clinical phenotype combining QT prolongation and ST segment elevation, indicating a close interrelationship between the two disorders. Here we provide additional evidence that these two disorders are closely related. We report the analysis of two novel mutations on the same codon, Y1795C (LQT-3) and Y1795H (BrS), expressed in HEK 293 cells and characterized using whole-cell patch clamp procedures. We find marked and opposing effects on channel gating consistent with activity associated with the cellular basis of each clinical disorder. Y1795H speeds and Y1795C slows the onset of inactivation. The Y1795H, but not the Y1795C, mutation causes a marked negative shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation, and neither mutation affects the kinetics of the recovery from inactivation. Interestingly, both mutations increase the expression of sustained Na+ channel activity compared with wild type (WT) channels, although this effect is most pronounced for the Y1795C mutation, and both mutations promote entrance into an intermediate or a slowly developing inactivated state. These data confirm the key role of the C-terminal tail of the cardiac Na+ channel in the control of channel gating, illustrate how subtle changes in channel biophysics can have significant and distinct effects in human disease, and, additionally, provide further evidence of the close interrelationship between BrS and LQT-3 at the molecular level.

Despite this classification based on clinical characteristics such as ECG findings, age of first presentation, triggers of events, and others, significant clinical and pathophysiological overlap between these different disorders have been noted recently. This observation has led to the proposition that these syndromes are in fact only different appearances of a “unique”SCN5A disease. The most significant overlap exists between LQT-3 and the BrS (8Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Schwartz P.J. Bloise R. Crotti L. Ronchetti E. Circulation. 2000; 102: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The most frequent presentation in both disorders is a history of syncope or cardiac arrests with a very high lethality, occurring mainly during rest or sleep and with a poor response to anti-adrenergic treatment such as β receptor blockade (9Priori S.G.

However, the typical electrocardiographic manifestations of long-QT syndrome (QT interval prolongation) and BrS (ST segment elevation in leads V1 through V3) may coexist in the same patients, which raises questions about the actual differences between LQT3 and BrS (8Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Schwartz P.J. Bloise R. Crotti L. Ronchetti E. Circulation. 2000; 102: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Moreover, in some LQT-3 patients, exposure to the sodium channel blocker flecainide generates an ECG pattern that is very similar to the BrS (8Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Schwartz P.J. Bloise R. Crotti L. Ronchetti E. Circulation. 2000; 102: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).By definition LQT-3 is caused by mutations found in SCN5A, while, to date, all mutations linked with BrS are also in this gene. Multiple SCN5A mutations linked to both disorders have now been reported and characterized (13Bezzina C.R. Rook M.B. Wilde A.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 2Data base of SCN5A mutations and functional consequences. 2Data base of SCN5A mutations and functional consequences. The most common alteration in channel function caused by LQT-3 mutations is the induction of sustained sodium channel activity over the time course and voltage range of the ventricular action potential plateau phase first described by Bennett et al. (15Bennett Jr., P.B. Makita N. George Jr., A.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for the ΔKPQ LQT-3 mutation (16Clancy C.E. Rudy Y.

It is generally thought that mutation-induced loss of channel activity underlies the cellular and clinical phenotype of BrS (5Chen Q. Kirsch G.E. Zhang D. Brugada R. Brugada J. Brugada P. Potenza D.

Nevertheless, these functional changes, although sufficient, may not always be necessary to cause clinically either LQT-3 or BrS (21An R.H. Wang X.L. Kerem B. Benhorin J. Medina A. Goldmit M. Kass R.S. Circ.

Here we report and characterize two novel point mutations of SCN5A in the same codon (Y-1795) that were identified in patients clinically classified as LQT-3 (Y1795C) and BrS (Y1795H) cases. Functional analysis of these cardiac sodium channel mutations expressed in HEK 293 cells indicates marked and opposing effects on the kinetics and voltage dependence of the inactivated state of the expressed channels consistent with the disease phenotypes. Interestingly, both mutations also confer some biophysical properties upon the expressed channels that are not generally associated with the observed clinical phenotypes.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have presented further evidence of the close interrelationship in the molecular determinants of LQT-3 and BrS. We describe the functional consequences of two novel mutations of the same residue of the C-terminal portion of SCN5A linked to BrS (Y1795H) and LQT-3 (Y1795C). The most pronounced effects of the mutations are changes in channel gating that are consistent with the models that link channel to cellular to systems phenotypes for both LQT-3 (16Clancy C.E. Rudy Y. Nature. 1999; 400: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and BrS (20Yan G.X. Antzelevitch C. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1660-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Hence Y1795C mutant channels inactivate more slowly than WT channels and are characterized by a prominent fraction of current that is maintained during prolonged depolarization. Both of these changes in channel properties are expected to contribute more inward current during both the early and late phases of the action potential and hence are consistent with prolongation of the cellular action potential (16Clancy C.E. Rudy Y. Nature. 1999; 400: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 34Clayton R.H. Bailey A. Biktashev V.N. Holden A.V. J. Theor. Biol. 2001; 208: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Grant A.O. Am. J. Med. 2001; 110: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, the most pronounced effects of the Y1795H mutation are a negative shift in channel availability, a speeding of the onset of inactivation, particularly at voltages near threshold for channel activation, and a reduction in peak current density. These effects are consistent with a reduction in inward current in cells expressing mutant channels as required in models proposed by Yan and Antzelevitch (20Yan G.X. Antzelevitch C. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1660-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) to explain ST segment elevation in BrS.We also found a small but consistent and statistically significant increase in maintained Na+ channel activity caused by the Y1795H mutation. By itself, this effect on channel gating would be expected to prolong the cellular action potential and accompanying QT interval in carriers of this gene defect. Despite this the dominant clinical phenotype leading to the discovery of this mutation was ST-segment elevation and not QT prolongation. Furthermore, when we investigated the effects of both mutations on the development of slow or intermediate inactivation, we found that both mutations promote this state of the channel to a degree that is significantly greater than WT channels. Because promotion of inactivation of the channel leads to eventual loss of channel activity, such a biophysical change would not be anticipated for an LQT-3 mutation, which would generally be considered linked to gain of function activity. However, our data indicate that these effects would only be anticipated under conditions of rapid stimulation (high heart rates), and the LQT-3 proband did not present clinical characteristics linked to BrS such as ST elevation and or other evidence of right bundle branch block even during challenges with flecainide indicating that this reduction in current is not likely to be important under physiologically relevant conditions. On the other hand, our data for the YC mutation show that biophysical properties that contribute to action potential duration (APD), prolongation, slowing of the onset of inactivation, and the promotion of maintained Na+ channel current are more pronounced at slower heart rates (Fig. 7) indicate that carriers of this mutation will be at greatest risk for prolonged APD-induced arrhythmias at slow heart rates. Thus the YC mutation, like other previously described LQT-3 mutations, is most problematic during bradycardia or following pauses in excitation of the ventricle (16Clancy C.E. Rudy Y.

Circulation. 2000; 102: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).The biophysical duality of the Y1795H and Y1795C mutations in some ways resembles the duality demonstrated for the 1795insD mutation described by Veldkamp et al. (33Veldkamp M.W. Viswanathan P.C. Bezzina C. Baartscheer A. Wilde A.A. Balser J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E91-E97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of 1795insD, mutation-induced changes in an intermediate inactivated state of the channel reduce currents in a steeply heart rate-dependent manner. Thus at low heart rates a maintained current is revealed and potentiated relative to WT channels, and at faster heart rates, overall channel activity is reduced relative to WT (33Veldkamp M.W. Viswanathan P.C. Bezzina C. Baartscheer A. Wilde A.A. Balser J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E91-E97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We detected an increase in maintained Na+ channel activity for Y1795H mutant compared with WT channels which, even though much smaller in amplitude than similar activity induced by the Y1795C mutation, would contribute to delay in action potential repolarization. However, the overall reduction in the expression of YH channel activity (Fig. 5) apparently dominates the physiological impact of the mutation. The most pronounced biophysical consequence of the Y1795C mutation is the slowing of the onset of inactivation, which is accompanied by a marked increase in maintained channel activity. These two properties together are consistent with QT prolongation that characterizes the ECG of the proband, which as described above is also markedly dependent on heart rate. At sufficiently fast rates, the YC mutant channels will conduct less maintained current (Fig. 7), inactivate faster (Fig. 7), and, via enhanced Im inactivation (Fig. 6), express less peak current than WT channels. Taken together, these effects, although predicted for very fast stimulation rates, would predict BrS and not LQT-3 functional consequences.Together with the data of Veldkamp et al. (33Veldkamp M.W. Viswanathan P.C. Bezzina C. Baartscheer A. Wilde A.A. Balser J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E91-E97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the present results 1) demonstrate the critical importance of residue Tyr-1795 in controlling inactivation of the cardiac Na+ channel and 2) provide further evidence of the close interrelationship between Na+ channel properties that underlie BrS and LQT-3 in carriers of Na+ channel mutations. These mutations present an opportunity to dissect physiological conditions and pharmacological properties of the mutant channels that underlie expression of the distinct disease phenotypes both in the absence and presence of drug challenges.Further evidence for the crossover in mutation-induced channel properties and causal linkage to BrS and LQT-3 comes from a comparison of the properties of D1790G, another previously described LQT-3 mutation of the C terminus of the Na+ channel α-subunit, with those of the Y1795H BrS mutant channel. Both mutations speed the onset of inactivation, and both mutations cause a negative shift in the voltage dependence of steady state channel availability. Furthermore, under the same recording conditions, the Y1795H, but not the D1790G, mutation increases sustained channel activity, but clinically the two mutations have been linked distinctly to BrS (Y1795H) and LQT-3 (D1790G). A recent analysis of the D1790G channel using distinctly different intracellular recording conditions and a different cell line has revealed that, under these conditions, this mutation can promote sustained channel activity (14Baroudi G. Chahine M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Computational analysis has suggested that the D1790G mutation prolongs APD indirectly via calcium-sensitive pathways in a steeply inverse heart rate-dependent fashion. Taken together these results suggest that careful analysis of clinical data for carriers of these C-terminal mutations under a wide variety of conditions in which critical parameters such as heart rate and sympathetic tone can be controlled will be extremely useful in dissecting the crucial properties of these mutant channels that cause these inherited arrhythmias and the clinical conditions that are most likely to exacerbate fatal events in carriers of the specific gene defects. Mutations of SCN5A, the gene coding for the α-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel, have been linked to the following four human syndromes: congenital long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT-3),1 Brugada syndrome (BrS), different types of conduction block (2Schott J.J.

Despite this classification based on clinical characteristics such as ECG findings, age of first presentation, triggers of events, and others, significant clinical and pathophysiological overlap between these different disorders have been noted recently. This observation has led to the proposition that these syndromes are in fact only different appearances of a “unique”SCN5A disease. The most significant overlap exists between LQT-3 and the BrS (8Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Schwartz P.J. Bloise R. Crotti L. Ronchetti E. Circulation. 2000; 102: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The most frequent presentation in both disorders is a history of syncope or cardiac arrests with a very high lethality, occurring mainly during rest or sleep and with a poor response to anti-adrenergic treatment such as β receptor blockade (9Priori S.G. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2000; 11: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Moss A.J. Zareba W. Hall W.J. Schwartz P.J. Crampton R.S. Benhorin J. Vincent G.M. Locati E.H.

However, the typical electrocardiographic manifestations of long-QT syndrome (QT interval prolongation) and BrS (ST segment elevation in leads V1 through V3) may coexist in the same patients, which raises questions about the actual differences between LQT3 and BrS (8Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Schwartz P.J. Bloise R. Crotti L. Ronchetti E. Circulation. 2000; 102: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Moreover, in some LQT-3 patients, exposure to the sodium channel blocker flecainide generates an ECG pattern that is very similar to the BrS (8Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Schwartz P.J. Bloise R. Crotti L. Ronchetti E. Circulation. 2000; 102: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). By definition LQT-3 is caused by mutations found in SCN5A, while, to date, all mutations linked with BrS are also in this gene. Multiple SCN5A mutations linked to both disorders have now been reported and characterized (13Bezzina C.R. Rook M.B. Wilde A.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 2Data base of SCN5A mutations and functional consequences. 2Data base of SCN5A mutations and functional consequences. The most common alteration in channel function caused by LQT-3 mutations is the induction of sustained sodium channel activity over the time course and voltage range of the ventricular action potential plateau phase first described by Bennett et al. (15Bennett Jr., P.B. Makita N. George Jr., A.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for the ΔKPQ LQT-3 mutation (16Clancy C.E. Rudy Y. Nature. 1999; 400: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that mutation-induced loss of channel activity underlies the cellular and clinical phenotype of BrS (5Chen Q. Kirsch G.E. Zhang D. Brugada R. Brugada J. Brugada P. Potenza D.

Circulation. 1999; 100: 1660-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these functional changes, although sufficient, may not always be necessary to cause clinically either LQT-3 or BrS (21An R.H. Wang X.L. Kerem B. Benhorin J. Medina A. Goldmit M. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and it is possible that other, as yet undiscovered, genetic factors are likely to contribute to the expression of the specific disease phenotypes in these patients.

Hence Y1795C mutant channels inactivate more slowly than WT channels and are characterized by a prominent fraction of current that is maintained during prolonged depolarization. Both of these changes in channel properties are expected to contribute more inward current during both the early and late phases of the action potential and hence are consistent with prolongation of the cellular action potential (16Clancy C.E.

In the case of 1795insD, mutation-induced changes in an intermediate inactivated state of the channel reduce currents in a steeply heart rate-dependent manner.

The biophysical duality of the Y1795H and Y1795C mutations in some ways resembles the duality demonstrated for the 1795insD mutation described by Veldkamp et al. (33Veldkamp M.W. Viswanathan P.C. Bezzina C. Baartscheer A. Wilde A.A. Balser J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E91-E97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of 1795insD, mutation-induced changes in an intermediate inactivated state of the channel reduce currents in a steeply heart rate-dependent manner. Thus at low heart rates a maintained current is revealed and potentiated relative to WT channels, and at faster heart rates, overall channel activity is reduced relative to WT (33Veldkamp M.W. Viswanathan P.C. Bezzina C. Baartscheer A. Wilde A.A. Balser J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E91-E97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We detected an increase in maintained Na+ channel activity for Y1795H mutant compared with WT channels which, even though much smaller in amplitude than similar activity induced by the Y1795C mutation, would contribute to delay in action potential repolarization. However, the overall reduction in the expression of YH channel activity (Fig. 5) apparently dominates the physiological impact of the mutation. The most pronounced biophysical consequence of the Y1795C mutation is the slowing of the onset of inactivation, which is accompanied by a marked increase in maintained channel activity. These two properties together are consistent with QT prolongation that characterizes the ECG of the proband, which as described above is also markedly dependent on heart rate. At sufficiently fast rates, the YC mutant channels will conduct less maintained current (Fig. 7), inactivate faster (Fig. 7), and, via enhanced Im inactivation (Fig. 6), express less peak current than WT channels. Taken together, these effects, although predicted for very fast stimulation rates, would predict BrS and not LQT-3 functional consequences. Together with the data of Veldkamp et al. (33Veldkamp M.W. Viswanathan P.C. Bezzina C. Baartscheer A. Wilde A.A. Balser J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E91-E97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the present results 1) demonstrate the critical importance of residue Tyr-1795 in controlling inactivation of the cardiac Na+ channel and 2) provide further evidence of the close interrelationship between Na+ channel properties that underlie BrS and LQT-3 in carriers of Na+ channel mutations. These mutations present an opportunity to dissect physiological conditions and pharmacological properties of the mutant channels that underlie expression of the distinct disease phenotypes both in the absence and presence of drug challenges. Further evidence for the crossover in mutation-induced channel properties and causal linkage to BrS and LQT-3 comes from a comparison of the properties of D1790G, another previously described LQT-3 mutation of the C terminus of the Na+ channel α-subunit, with those of the Y1795H BrS mutant channel. Both mutations speed the onset of inactivation, and both mutations cause a negative shift in the voltage dependence of steady state channel availability. Furthermore, under the same recording conditions, the Y1795H, but not the D1790G, mutation increases sustained channel activity, but clinically the two mutations have been linked distinctly to BrS (Y1795H) and LQT-3 (D1790G). A recent analysis of the D1790G channel using distinctly different intracellular recording conditions and a different cell line has revealed that, under these conditions, this mutation can promote sustained channel activity (14Baroudi G. Chahine M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Computational analysis has suggested that the D1790G mutation prolongs APD indirectly via calcium-sensitive pathways in a steeply inverse heart rate-dependent fashion. Taken together these results suggest that careful analysis of clinical data for carriers of these C-terminal mutations under a wide variety of conditions in which critical parameters such as heart rate and sympathetic tone can be controlled will be extremely useful in dissecting the crucial properties of these mutant channels that cause these inherited arrhythmias and the clinical conditions that are most likely to exacerbate fatal events in carriers of the specific gene defects."

We demonstrate that cyclic AMP-induced steroid synthesis is dependent upon the phosphorylation and activation of ERKs and that ERK activation results in enhanced phosphorylation of SF-1 and increased steroid production through increased transcription of the StAR gene. Adenylate cyclase activation with forskolin (FSK) caused a time-dependent increase in ERK activity and translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus, which correlated with an increase in StAR mRNA levels, StAR protein accumulation, and steroidogenesis. Similarly, ERK inhibition led to a reduction in the levels of FSK-stimulated StAR mRNA, StAR protein, and steroid secretion. These effects were attributed to the finding that ERK activity is required for SF-1 phosphorylation, a transcription factor required for the regulation of StAR gene transcription. This conclusion was supported by our demonstration of an ERK-dependent increase in the binding of SF-1 from FSK-treated Y1 nuclei to three consensus double-stranded DNA sequences from the StARpromoter region. These observations suggest that the activation of ERK2/1 by increasing cAMP is an obligatory and regulated stage in the stimulation of steroid synthesis by cyclic AMP-generating stimuli.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA activation stimulates the rapid mobilization of intracellular stores of cholesterol to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and promotes cholesterol transport to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), where it is converted to pregnenolone by the cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage complex (P450SCC) (3Christenson L.K. Strauss III, J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The delivery of cholesterol to the IMM is the rate-limiting step in steroid synthesis, thus regulating the rate of secretion of steroid hormones (3Christenson L.K. Strauss III, J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is now generally accepted that a mitochondrial phosphoprotein, known as steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, is essential for cholesterol transport to the IMM, and that the expression of StAR protein is the key regulatory event in steroid synthesis (4Stocco D.M. Rev. Reprod. 1998; 3: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 5Stocco D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 445-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, transcription of the StAR gene is closely coupled to steroidogenesis in a variety of tissues (6Liu J. Hekkila P. Kahri A. Voutilainen R. J.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4778-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar); and mutations in the StAR gene produce endocrine pathologies with a phenotype of reduced or absent steroidogenesis (11Bose H.S. Sato S. Aisenberg J. Shalev S.A. Matsuo N. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 3636-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).The regulation of StAR gene transcription is not fully understood, although the StAR gene contains binding sites for transcriptional regulators such as SF-1 (steroidogenic factor-1, at least three separate binding sites), DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hyperplasia congenital critical region on the X-chromosome), and AP-1 (activator protein-1), which have phosphorylation-dependent transcriptional activities (12Wooton-Kee C.R.

Although PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation is undoubtedly important in regulating steroid synthesis, other signaling systems have also been implicated in StAR gene expression (seee.g. Refs. 14Reyland M.E.

Endocrinol. 2000; 142: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family is a point of convergence for diverse signaling pathways in which extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK2/1 or p42/44 MAPKs), c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 kinases are the terminal kinases in three distinct yet interacting signal transduction cascades (18Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar). These enzymes commonly regulate target gene expression by the activation of downstream transcription factors, and ERK2/1 have been implicated in the regulation of SF-1 and AP-1 activity in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and in human kidney COS cells (19Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 521-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated that cyclic AMP-induced steroid synthesis is dependent upon the activation of the ERK cascade and that ERK2/1 activation leads to increased phosphorylation of SF-1, enhanced SF-1 binding to regions of the StAR promoter, and enhanced steroid production by increasing the availability of StAR protein through increased transcription of the StAR gene.DISCUSSIONMammalian steroid-producing tissues share a number of common general features. Steroid production is normally regulated by extracellular trophic signals (e.g. LH, FSH, ACTH), which act through specific cell surface receptors to activate intracellular effector systems and thus increase cholesterol metabolism (1Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 2Clark B.J. Soo S.C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymic events involved in the conversion of cholesterol to the various steroid hormones share common elements that are now fairly well understood (3Christenson L.K. Strauss III, J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Similarly, evidence is accumulating that the control of mitochondrial cholesterol transport in most steroid-producing cells involves the expression of StAR protein and its import into the mitochondria (3Christenson L.K. Strauss III, J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).A number of recent studies have suggested that the MAPK cascade is involved in cellular regulation in steroidogenic tissues, although many of the observations reported to date appear to be contradictory. MAPKs are known to be involved in proliferative responses in many tissues (31Bonventre J.V. Force T. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and there is evidence that this is an important mechanism in adrenal tissue (32Lotfi C.F. Lepique A.P. Forti F.L. Schwindt T.T. Eichler C.B. Santos M.O. Rebustini I.T. Hajj G.N. Juliano L. Armelin H.A. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2000; 33: 1133-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of ERK2/1 has been implicated in the mitogenic responses of human H295R or mouse Y1 adrenocortical cells to angiotensin ll or ACTH, respectively (33Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Rainey W.E. Batle D. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22570-22577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Lotfi C.F. Todorovic Z. Armelin H.A.

Res. 2000; 26: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although inhibition of other MAPK activities has also been reported during ACTH-induced cell-cycle progression in Y1 cells (36Watanabe G. Pena P. Albanese C. Wilsbacher L.D. Young J.B. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20063-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A similar confusion surrounds the potential role(s) of ERK2/1 as transduction elements in the regulation of steroidogenesis. Thus, for example, the anterior pituitary trophic hormones LH and FSH are reported to activate ERK2/1 and enhance steroid production in ovarian cells (37Cameron M.R. Foster J.S. Bukovsky A. Wimalasena J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 38Das S. Maizels E.T. DeManno D. St. Clair E. Adam S.A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), but ERK activation has also been associated with the inhibition of agonist-induced steroidogenesis in granulosa-derived cell lines (39Seger R. Hanoch T. Rosenberg R. Dantes A. Merz W.E. Strauss III, J.F. Amsterdam A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13957-13964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Similarly, the activation of ERK2/1 has been linked to enhanced steroid production in human granulosa-luteal cells, and cAMP-induced steroidogenesis was inhibited by inhibitors of ERK2/1 (40Dewi D.A. Abayasekara D.R.E. Wheeler-Jones C.P.D. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: OC17Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory effects of prostaglandin F2α (41Tai C. Kang S.K. Choi K. Tzeng C. Leung P.C.K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 375-380PubMed Google Scholar) or gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (42Kang S.K. Tai C. Nathwani P.S. Choi K. Leung P.C.K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) on steroidogenesis in this tissue have also been attributed to the activation of ERK2/1. There are several likely explanations for these apparently contradictory reports. A prime reason may be the existence of multiple transduction pathways coupled to cell surface receptors, with differences in receptor-effector coupling between tissues, cell lines, and species. One of the major intracellular effector systems in the regulation of steroidogenesis is the adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP system, although this may not be the sole mechanism through which trophic hormones regulate steroid production in their target tissues (43Cooke B.A. Mol. Cell Endcorinol. 1990; 69: C11-C15Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study we have circumvented receptor expression, agonist binding, and receptor-effector coupling by using forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, to directly elevate intracellular cyclic AMP and thus allow us to focus on the downstream events in the signaling cascade. We chose mouse adrenocortical Y1 cells for these studies because an in vitro cell line can provide the large amount of starting material required for the immunodetection of StAR and for the immunoprecipitation and analysis of the phosphorylation state of transcription factors. In addition, Y1 cells offer an excellent adrenocortical model for the present experiments because they retain intact the cyclic AMP-responsive early rate-limiting stages of steroid synthesis, including the transport of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane and its P450SCC-mediated conversion to pregnenolone (26Schimmer B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Schimmer B.P. Sato G. Functionally Differentiated Cell Lines. A. R. Liss, New York1981: 61-92Google Scholar).An additional reason for disparate conclusions between studies may be the differences in the experimental protocols, particularly with respect to different time courses of the events being measured. Thus, in other tissues, ERK2/1 activation tends to be a rapid and often transient event (44Lopez-Ilasaca M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), whereas it normally takes longer for increased steroid production to be detectable, partly because of the requirements for increased expression of the StAR protein (1Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 2Clark B.J. Soo S.C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Christenson L.K. Strauss III, J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 4Stocco D.M.

Voutilainen R. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present study we measured cyclic AMP-dependent ERK2/1 activation over the same time course as enhanced steroid production, to demonstrate that the timing of both events is consistent with ERK2/1 activation being involved in initiating the steroidogenic response. Our results clearly demonstrate that cyclic AMP-induced steroidogenesis in Y1 cells is dependent on activation of the ERK2/1 signaling cascade and that steroid production is accompanied by a prolonged activation of ERK2/1. Thus activation of adenylate cyclase induced the activation of ERK2/1 in Y1 cells and the translocation of active ERK2/1 into the nucleus; we were able to link this activation to steroid synthesis because ERK2/1 inhibition reduced cyclic-AMP-dependent steroid production. Furthermore, our demonstration of similar effects in the adrenocortical Y1 cell line and the testicular MA10 cell line suggests that the involvement of ERK2/1 in steroidogenic responses to cyclic AMP may be a general effect rather than a cell type-specific event.The importance of ERK2/1 activation in steroid production was confirmed by our quantitative measurements of the expression of StAR mRNA and protein in Y1 cells. It is now well established that StAR protein plays a major role in regulating steroid synthesis (1Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 2Clark B.J. Soo S.C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 7: 445-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that the stimulation of steroid production by agonists or by pharmacological elevations in cyclic AMP is dependent upon enhanced transcription of the StAR gene, elevations in StAR mRNA, and the intracellular accumulation of StAR protein (3Christenson L.K. Strauss III, J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 5Stocco D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 445-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Burns C.J. Gyles S.L. Persaud S.J. Sugden D. Whitehouse B.J. Jones P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our results confirm the importance of StAR in steroid production, because forskolin caused a rapid and prolonged increase in the levels of StAR mRNA and protein in Y1 cells, associated with increased production of steroid. More importantly, our data show that ERK2/1 activation is required for the effects of cyclic AMP on StAR expression, because preventing the activation of ERK2/1 by inhibiting their upstream activator, MEK-1, was alone sufficient to reduce the cyclic AMP-dependent increases in StAR mRNA and protein. This effect was selective for StAR mRNA, because inhibition of MEK-1, and thus of ERK2/1, did not affect the accumulation of P450SCC mRNA induced by forskolin. These observations also imply multiple effects of cyclic AMP on the regulation of gene expression in Y1 cells, some of which (e.g. StAR) are mediated through ERK2/1, whereas others (e.g.P450SCC) do not require the activation of ERK2/1.Our current results therefore explain the inhibitory effects of two structurally distinct MEK-1 inhibitors on cyclic AMP-induced steroid production in two different cell lines and are consistent with a transduction sequence in which increased intracellular cyclic AMP leads to the phosphorylation and activation of MEK-1, presumably through activation of PKA (45Yarwood S.J. Kilgour E. Anderson N.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Activated MEK-1 in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK2/1, which accumulates in the nucleus and increases the transcription of the StAR gene and hence the accumulation of StAR mRNA and protein. Because StAR protein is rate-limiting for cholesterol transport into the mitochondria (1Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 2Clark B.J.

Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), this sequence of events inevitably results in enhanced delivery of cholesterol to the P450SCC complexes inside the mitochondria and to increased production of steroids. This sequence of events also explains the lack of effect of inhibitors of MEK-1 on steroid production from cells supplied with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. This cholesterol analogue is water-soluble and is therefore not dependent on the ERK2/1-driven expression of StAR to enable it to reach the inner mitochondrial membrane and act as a substrate for the P450SCC.In other tissues, activated ERK2/1 modify cellular function primarily by regulating the expression of numerous genes through phosphorylating a variety of transcriptional regulators (18Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar, 46Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our measurements of the cellular localization of active ERK2/1 by confocal immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the low level of active ERK2/1 found in unstimulated cells was localized to small extranuclear “caps” associated with specific areas of the nuclear membrane. Activation of Y1 cells by forskolin caused a large increase in active ERK2/1 in the intranuclear compartment, consistent with an intranuclear location for the protein substrates of ERK2/1 in Y1 cells. The complex mechanisms regulating basal and stimulated transcription of the StAR gene are not fully understood, although the cyclic AMP-responsive region is thought to be coded within the first 254 base pairs of the StAR promoter (47Reinhart A.J. Williams S.C. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 729-741PubMed Google Scholar), and several activating factors have been implicated in the regulation of StAR gene transcription (48Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21931-21938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Nalbant D. Williams S.C. Stocco D.M. Khan S.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30729-30735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Among these is the 53-kDa SF-1, the presence of which appears to be an absolute requirement forStAR gene expression, because SF-1 knockout mice fail to express StAR mRNA (8Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Soo S.C. Stocco D.M. Parker K.L. Clark B.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 136-147Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). SF-1 contains a serine residue (Ser-203) residing within the ERK2/1 consensus phosphorylation sequence (PXn(S/T)P) (19Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol.

Clark B.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and our results suggest that SF-1 binding to these sites may be the mechanism through which ERK2/1 activation leads to enhanced steroid production. Thus, we have demonstrated that the ERK2/1-dependent phosphorylation of SF-1 enhances its ability to bind to all three sites in the StAR promoter, supporting a role for ERK2/1-dependent phosphorylation of SF-1 as an important regulator of activational activity. These observations do not rule out an additional regulatory role for direct phosphorylation of SF-1 by PKA (51Zhang P. Mellon S.H. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar), but they do suggest that the ERK2/1-dependent event is obligatory for cAMP-induced StAR expression and steroid synthesis.In summary, the current study provides a direct link from PKA activation through the MEK/ERK cascade to the phosphorylation of SF-1, enhanced binding to the StAR promoter region, increased expression of StAR protein, and enhanced steroid production in adrenal cells. Stimulus recognition in steroidogenic cells is dependent initially on the receptor-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase, and subsequent increases in intracellular cyclic AMP that activate the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 (1Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 2Clark B.J. Soo S.C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA activation stimulates the rapid mobilization of intracellular stores of cholesterol to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and promotes cholesterol transport to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), where it is converted to pregnenolone by the cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage complex (P450SCC) (3Christenson L.K. Strauss III, J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The delivery of cholesterol to the IMM is the rate-limiting step in steroid synthesis, thus regulating the rate of secretion of steroid hormones (3Christenson L.K. Strauss III, J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is now generally accepted that a mitochondrial phosphoprotein, known as steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, is essential for cholesterol transport to the IMM, and that the expression of StAR protein is the key regulatory event in steroid synthesis (4Stocco D.M. Rev. Reprod. 1998; 3: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 5Stocco D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 445-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, transcription of the StAR gene is closely coupled to steroidogenesis in a variety of tissues (6Liu J. Hekkila P. Kahri A. Voutilainen R. J.

The regulation of StAR gene transcription is not fully understood, although the StAR gene contains binding sites for transcriptional regulators such as SF-1 (steroidogenic factor-1, at least three separate binding sites), DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hyperplasia congenital critical region on the X-chromosome), and AP-1 (activator protein-1), which have phosphorylation-dependent transcriptional activities (12Wooton-Kee C.R.

Western blot analysis with the pS748 antibody, carried out with a variety of PKD forms and in a variety of cell types including full-length PKD transfected in COS-7 and HEK 293 cells, a green fluorescent protein-PKD fusion protein transfected in either Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts or Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, and endogenous PKD expressed in A20 lymphocytes and Rat-1 fibroblasts, indicated that Ser748 phosphorylation was absent from unstimulated cells. In contrast, dramatic increases in Ser748 phosphorylation were induced by phorbol esters, bombesin, or cross-linking of B lymphocyte antigen receptors or by cotransfection with active PKCε or PKCη. Western analysis using a second phosphospecific antibody, which primarily recognizes PKD phosphorylated at Ser744, revealed that Ser744phosphorylation accompanies Ser748 phosphorylation during PKD activation in vivo.

Novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, θ), like classic PKCs, also bind diacylglycerol in a phospholipid-dependent manner but lack functional Ca2+ binding domains. The atypical PKCs (ζ, ι/λ) do not respond to diacylglycerol/phorbol esters but are stimulated by lipid products of phospholipase A2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activities (2Nishizuka Y.

PKC isoforms exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns (3Nishizuka Y.

Protein kinase D (PKD, also called PKCµ) is a serine protein kinase with structural and enzymological properties distinct from all PKC isoforms (11Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J.

PKD possesses an N-terminal regulatory domain comprising a putative transmembrane domain, a cysteine-rich region that mediates phorbol ester/diacylglycerol binding, and a pleckstrin homology domain. The PKD catalytic domain is divergent from PKCs and, consistent with this, phosphorylates distinct substrates (11Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, the recent identification of additional distinct cDNA clones, similar in overall structure, primary sequence, and enzymological properties to PKD/PKCµ (24Hayashi A. Seki N. Hattori A.

PKD activation is pharmacologically blocked during all types of cell stimulation by pretreatment of cells with PKC inhibitors, including GF I and Ro 31-8220. Recent evidence from experiments undertaken in lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells indicated that activated PKD is transiently localized to cell membranes but then returns to the cytosol, where its activity is retained for extended periods (36Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) demonstrate that PKCs also play an important role in regulating the rapid release of activated PKD from the cell membrane. Collectively, these findings establish PKD as a novel downstream effector of PKC-mediated signal transduction. PKC-mediated PKD activation depends on phosphorylation of specific serine and/or threonine residues in PKD, but all the possible sites are not yet known. We previously proposed that phosphorylation of Ser744 and Ser748 within the PKD activation loop plays a critical role in PKD activation (42Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Specifically, a PKD mutant with both Ser744 and Ser748 altered to non-phosphorylatable alanines could not be activated in vivo by PKC stimulation. In contrast, a mutant with these residues substituted with glutamic acid residues to mimic phosphorylation was constitutively active. Phosphospots present in two-dimensional tryptic maps of wild-type PKD after in vivo activation were selectively eliminated by point mutations targeting Ser744and Ser748. Taken together, these results correlated Ser744 and Ser748 phosphorylation with in vivo PKD activation. In contrast to our study, Vertommen et al. (44Vertommen D. Rider M. Ni Y. Waelkens E.

These authors suggested a conclusion different from our own, i.e.that Ser744 and Ser748 phosphorylation might occur only by autophosphorylation in the isolated PKD catalytic domain but not in the intact enzyme stimulated in living cells (44Vertommen D.

In an effort to resolve these differences, we developed a novel phosphorylation state-specific antibody directed against Ser748 in the PKD activation loop (pS748). A second novel phosphospecific antibody, recognizing phospho-PKD, was also recently developed. Although this second antibody was raised against a peptide bearing phosphoserine in both activation loop sites, we found that the major determinant of binding of this antibody to phosphorylated PKD is the degree of Ser744 phosphorylation. Using the pS748 and pSpS744/748 antibodies, we demonstrate here that PKD Ser744/Ser748 phosphorylation is rapidly triggered in a variety of model systems, including COS-7 cells, HEK 293 cells, B cell lymphocytes, Swiss 3T3 and Rat-1 fibroblasts, and MDCK epithelial cells, by stimulation of cells either with PDB or via receptor-mediated pathways. Stock cultures of COS-7, HEK-293, Swiss 3T3, MDCK, and Rat-1 cells were maintained in 10-cm tissue culture plates by subculturing every 3–4 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air. For experimental dishes, confluent cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104cells/ml in 6-cm dishes 8–18 h prior to transfections. BALB/c mouse B lymphoma A20 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 µm2-mercaptoethanol. Plasmid constructs encoding untagged wild-type (22Van Lint J.

Additional untagged PKD mutants (PKD-S744E and PKD-S748E) were constructed by overlap PCR using pBluescript SK(+)-PKDcDNA (pBSK-PKD) as template. Oligonucleotide primers (forward, 5′-CAG TGT TCT CCC CAG TGG CAT CGG TC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTC ACT AAA GGG AAC AAA AGC TGG AGC TC-3′) designed to anneal with template at sites flanking the mutation site, i.e. located either within the PKD coding sequence (nucleotides 1694–1719) or within pBSK at a site near the polylinker, respectively, were synthesized. These external forward and reverse primers were used in initial PCR reactions together with template DNA and a second (internal) reverse or forward primer, respectively. These internal primers were complementary to each other, spanned the mutation target site, and encoded the nucleotide changes required to introduce the desired mutations. The sense primers corresponding to the different sequence changes were 5′-C ATT GGA GAG AAG GAG TTT AGG AGG TCA GTG G-3′ for PKD-S744E, and 5′-GAG AAG TCT TTT AGG AGG GAA GTG GTG GGT AC-3′ for PKD-S748E. In a second set of PCR reactions, products of the first reactions were amplified and extended using external primers, and then the resulting PCR products were cut with SphI andXbaI and these fragments used to replace the original pBSK-PKD SphI-XbaI segment. Constructs were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer, and then subcloned into the EcoRI site within the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The GFP-tagged PKD expression construct (GFP-PKD) has been described previously (36Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transfection of COS-7 cells with single plasmids were carried out using equivalent amounts of DNA (5 µg/dish). For cotransfections, 3 µg of each DNA were included, with vector pcDNA3 as the control DNA added to dishes transfected with only one construct. In separate tubes, Lipofectin (10 µl/60-mm dish) or plasmid DNA was suspended in Opti-MEM (1 ml/60-mm dish) and incubated at 25 °C for 40 min. DNA-Lipofectin complexes were formed by combining the two suspensions (final volume, 2 ml/dish) and incubating this mixture at 25 °C for an additional 15 min. Medium from COS-7 cell cultures (50–60% confluent) was then replaced with the suspensions of Lipofectin-DNA complexes, and these cultures were incubated in the absence of fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, for 5–6 h or overnight to allow uptake of complexes. Fetal bovine serum (10% final concentration) in Opti-MEM was then added to the dishes to yield a final volume of 4 ml/dish. Cells were used for experiments after an additional 72 h of incubation. Swiss 3T3 and MDCK cells were incubated with DNA-LipofectAMINE complexes for 3–5 h, and then the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cultures were incubated overnight prior to experiments. For experimental treatments, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and stimulated in serum-free medium for times and at concentrations indicated in the figures. Treatments were terminated by removing medium and addition of either lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) or 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) to cells on ice. These lysates were subjected to further analysis following immunoprecipitations or direct SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described below. COS-7 cells either transfected with wild-type or mutant PKDs or A20 lymphoma cells were treated as indicated in figures, and then lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer. These lysates were either used for immunoprecipitations or were directly combined with equal volumes of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analysis. PKD was isolated by immunoprecipitation at 4 °C for 3 h using the PA-1 antiserum (1:100 dilution) raised against the synthetic peptide EEREMKALSERVSIL that corresponds to the predicted C-terminal region of PKD, as described previously (22Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were recovered using protein A coupled to agarose. For assays of exogenous substrate phosphorylation, immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, then twice with kinase buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol. Substrate peptide (syntide-2 at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml) was added to immune complexes in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (2 µCi/reaction, diluted with cold ATP to give a final concentration of 100 µm) in kinase buffer (final reaction volume, 30 µl), and transferred to a water bath at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 100 µl of 75 mm H3PO4, and 75 µl of the mixed supernatant was spotted to Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Papers were washed thoroughly in 75 µmH3PO4, dried, and radioactivity incorporated into syntide-2 was determined by detection of Cerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter. For Western blot analysis, cells lysed either directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer or lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer and subsequently combined 1:1 with SDS-PAGE sample buffer were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), as described previously (29Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23952-23960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and blocked by overnight incubation with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.2. Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with antisera specifically recognizing the C-terminal of PKD at a dilution of 1 µg/ml, or the phosphospecific pS748 antibody recognizing PKD phosphorylated at Ser748 (1:500), in PBS containing 3% nonfat dried milk, or the phosphospecific pSpS744/748 antibody recognizing PKD dually phosphorylated at Ser744and Ser748 (1:1000) in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) methods. A phosphopeptide corresponding to the activation loop of PKD (residues 738–754) was synthesized with Ser748 as a phosphorylated residue. The peptide was then coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using glutaraldehyde and used to generate a rabbit antibody specific for PKD using standard immunization techniques. The resulting pS748 antibody was screened for antigen reactivity by ELISA and by Western blot analysis. The PKD (amino acids 738–754) peptide and related phosphopeptides used in this study were synthesized by the peptide synthesis facility of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF, London, United Kingdom). PA-1 and pS748 antisera were produced by the central antibody production facility of ICRF. Phospho-PKD/PKCµ Ser744/748 antibody (catalog no. 2054) and a corresponding blocking peptide were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and ECL reagent kits were fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein A-agarose and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (Pefabloc) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The antiserum (PKD C-20) and anti-GFP monoclonal antibody used in Western blot analysis of PKD expression were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Palo Alto, CA). Wortmannin, AG-1487, PP-2, and Ro 81,3220 were from Calbiochem. GF109203X was from Sigma. Opti-MEM, Lipofectin, and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were the highest grade commercially available. Generation of phosphorylation state-specific antibodies is a powerful strategy to analyze site-specific phosphorylations of a variety of proteins, including members of the PKC family (46Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). In order to clarify the role of Ser744/Ser748 phosphorylation in PKD activation, we decided to generate an antibody selectively reactive to a phosphopeptide encompassing amino acids 738–754 of PKD, with phosphoserine at the position corresponding to Ser748. The immunoreactivity of the resulting pS748 antibody was examined using standard ELISA protocols and, as indicated in Fig.1A, showed a strong selectivity for the immunogenic phosphopeptide in comparison with the nonphosphorylated activation loop peptide (PKD amino acids 738–754). The recognition of the phospho-Ser748 phosphopeptide was specific since this antibody showed very little binding to microplate wells coated with a similar peptide phosphorylated at Ser744 instead of Ser748 (Fig. 1 A). In addition, the pS748 antibody did not bind to an unrelated peptide comprising the C terminus of PKD. Thus, an antibody had been generated that was specifically reactive with a phosphopeptide bearing phosphoserine at the position corresponding to Ser748within the amino acid sequence 738–754 of PKD. To determine whether the pS748 antibody could recognize PKD isolated from cells, we used both COS-7 cells (which express low levels of endogenous PKD) transfected with a cDNA construct encoding wild-type PKD and A20 lymphocytes, whi"

The MRC is composed of ∼70 nuclear and 12 mitochondrial gene products. Complexes I and V are multisubunit proteins of the MRC. Thenuo-1 gene encodes the NADH- and FMN-binding subunit of complex I, the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase. The atp-2gene encodes the active-site subunit of complex V, the ATP synthase. The nuo-1(ua1) and atp-2(ua2) mutations are both lethal. They result in developmental arrest at the third larval stage (L3), arrest of gonad development at the second larval stage (L2), and impaired mobility, pharyngeal pumping, and defecation. Surprisingly, the nuo-1 and atp-2 mutations significantly lengthen the life spans of the arrested animals. When MRC biogenesis is blocked by chloramphenicol or doxycycline (inhibitors of mitochondrial translation), a quantitative and homogeneous developmental arrest as L3 larvae also results. The common phenotype induced by the mutations and drugs suggests that the L3-to-L4 transition may involve an energy-sensing developmental checkpoint.

Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). These additional genes encode the import apparatus for transporting polypeptides into the organelle, chaperones, and other assembly factors, as well as the machinery needed to replicate, transcribe, and translate the 13 MRC subunits encoded by mtDNA. The MRC generates the majority of cellular ATP. Thus, the loss of one member of this large class of genes can compromise the entire pathway of energy production. The consequences of such events are diverse and debilitating (2DiMauro S. Andreu A.L. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Rubio-Gozalbo M.E.

Vogel K. Sanadi D.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1976; 53: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, the nematode mtDNA is similar in size and gene content to the human mtDNA (6Okimoto R. Macfarlane J.L. Clary D.O. Wolstenholme D.R. Genetics. 1992; 130: 471-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MRC is organized into five multisubunit proteins. Complexes I–IV form the electron transport chain, which couples the oxidation of NADH and succinate to the reduction of oxygen and the formation of a proton gradient. Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is an elaborate enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. Bovine complex I consists of ∼43 subunits, an FMN cofactor, and up to eight iron-sulfur clusters (7Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 8Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The FMN- and NADH-binding sites, as well as one iron-sulfur cluster, are considered to reside in the 51-kDa subunit. One predicted C. elegansgene product (C09H10.3) bears strong sequence resemblance (75% identical amino acids) to the human gene. We have designated the gene encoding the C. elegans NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 51-kDa subunit as nuo-1. Complex I deficiency is one of the most frequently encountered mitochondrial defects (9Morris A.A.M. Leonard J.V. Brown G.K. Bidouki S.K. Bindoff L.A. Woodward C.E. Harding A.E. Lake B.D.

Mutations in the NDUFV1 gene, which encodes the human 51-kDa subunit of complex I, result in myoclonic epilepsy and leukodystrophy (12Schuelke M. Smeitink J. Mariman E. Loeffen J. Plecko B. Trijbels F. Stockler-Ipsiroglu S. van den Heuvel L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 260-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Complex V (the ATP synthase) uses the proton gradient to catalyze the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (13Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). A selective deficiency of the human mitochondrial ATP synthase caused by an uncharacterized nuclear mutation results in heart failure (14Houstek J. Klement P. Floryk D. Antonicka H. Hermanska J.

The ATP synthase is composed of a membrane-intrinsic proton channel (F0) and a peripheral catalytic domain (F1). The F1 domain comprises five types of subunits forming an α3β3γδε complex. Three catalytic nucleotide-binding sites are associated primarily with the β-subunits (15Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). The C. elegans gene product C34E10.6 shares 80% identical amino acids with the human β-subunit gene. We have designated this gene as atp-2. The contribution of the mitochondrial genome to cellular energy metabolism and organismal development is an area of active research (16Jenuth J.P. Peterson A.C.

In humans, mtDNA mutations produce a heterogeneous group of disorders (19Zeviani M. Antozzi C. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Depletion of mtDNA, which also impairs MRC biogenesis, produces an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in myopathy or hepatopathy and early death (19Zeviani M. Antozzi C. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mice heteroplasmic for a large deletion in their mtDNA demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction in various tissues and die of renal failure (20Inoue K. Nakada K. Ogura A. Isobe K. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.I. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In this work, we present the isolation and characterization of two lethal mutations in the nuclear nuo-1 and atp-2genes, encoding subunits of complexes I and V, respectively. The mutants are phenotypically similar, being developmentally impaired and arresting in the third larval stage. Gonad development is even more severely affected, arresting in the second larval stage. Despite the developmental arrest, mutant animals have extended life spans. Mutant development to L3 larvae requires the contributions of maternally inherited protein and mRNA. The mutations also interfere with the proper expression of the dauer developmental pathway. Chloramphenicol and doxycycline are specific inhibitors of mitochondrial protein synthesis and have been used to inhibit the synthesis of essential mtDNA-encoded subunits of the MRC (21Nijtmans L.G. Klement P. Houstek J. van den Bogert C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Pikó L. Chase D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 58: 357-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of the nuo-1 and atp-2 mutants can be mimicked when the expression of the mitochondrial genome is prevented with these inhibitors. The common larval arrest induced by the mutations and drugs suggests that the L3-to-L4 transition may involve an energy-sensing developmental checkpoint. Our results suggest that an intact MRC is a prerequisite for normal development in the nematode. Assembly of a functional MRC requires ∼200 genes or 1% of the genome content, and the nuo-1 and atp-2 mutations define the first two essential members of this large class of genes (23C. elegans Sequencing Consortium Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3613) Google Scholar). Worms were cultured as described (24Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The following strains or mutations were used: N2 (Bristol) wild-type strain; CB404, unc-53(e404); DR2078,mIn1[dpy-10(e128) mIs14]/bli-2(e768) unc-4(e120)II(mIs14 containing the myo-2 and pes-10promoters and a gut enhancer fused individually to the green fluorescent protein coding sequence is integrated intomIn1[dpy-10]); SP127, unc-4(e120)/mnC1[dpy-10(e128) unc-52(e444)]II; MT1580, dpy-10(e128) unc-53(n569)II; SP471, dpy-17(e164) unc-32(e189)III; BC986,sDp3(III;f), eT1(III;V); and JK1122,dpy-17(e164) unc-32(e189)/qC1 dpy-19(e1259) glp-1(q339)III. The following strains were isolated or constructed: LB1,nuo-1(ua1) (the original unbalanced isolate); LB4,nuo-1(ua1)/unc-53(e404); LB10,nuo-1(ua1)/mnC1[dpy-10(e128) unc-52(e444)]; LB21B,nuo-1(ua1)/mIn1[dpy-10(e128) mIs14]; LB100,atp-2(ua2) (the original unbalanced isolate); LB121,dpy-17(e164)/atp-2(ua2) unc-32(e189); LB127,atp-2(ua2) sDp3(III;f); LB128, atp-2(ua2) unc-32(e189)/qC1[dpy-19(e1259) glp-1(q339)]. Chemical mutagenesis was used to generate a library of deletion mutants that could be screened by PCR in a process called target-selected gene inactivation (25Jansen G. Hazendonk E. Thijssen K.L. Plasterk R.H.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A library of ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized N2 (synchronized and treated as L4 larvae, 50 mm for 4 h) was constructed by transferring ∼1000 F1animals to each of 135 plates (26Anderson P. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 31-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). After the plates had cleared, the worms were washed off and divided into three portions, two for freezing and one for DNA isolation (27Plasterk R.H. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 59-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We visualized deletions using pairs of nested primers chosen to be ∼3 kb apart, using duplicate or triplicate reactions with standard PCR conditions (27Plasterk R.H. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 59-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The primers used were as follows. For nuo-1: NFP1, 5′-TGCCTGAAAAGCCATACTGTC-3′; NFP2, 5′-GTAAACGACACTCCGAAATTCC-3′; NFP3, 5′-CTCATTCATTCAGCGAGGTTG-3′; and NFP4, 5′-AGATCTTCTACGGACAAGGTG-3′. Foratp-2: F1B1, 5′-CTGAATTCTGCACTGCAATCAC-3′; F1B2, 5′-ACGTTCAGCCTGAACTGAGAC-3′; F1B3, 5′-CCGATGTGTATTCTAGAGTTCG-3′; and F1B4, 5′-AGAACCAGAAGACATCTGTTCC-3′. One positive address was found for each gene, and the authenticity of the PCR product was determined by DNA sequencing. Three rounds of sibling selection were required to derive heterozygous clonal lines containing either thenuo-1 or atp-2 deletions. We took advantage of the fact that nuo-1 maps at 3.10 map units on linkage group II, tightly linked to unc-53, which maps at 3.07 map units, to create LB4 (nuo-1(ua1)/unc-53(e404)) by outcrossing five times against CB404. The nuo-1(ua1) mutation was also balanced by crossing LB4 with SP127 to generate LB10 and by crossing LB10 with DR2078 to generate LB21B. For atp-2, we used the fact that atp-2 maps at −2.00 map units on linkage group III, tightly linked to dpy-17 (−2.16 map units) andunc-32 (0.00 map units), to create LB121 (dpy-17(e164)/atp-2(ua2) unc-32(e189)) by outcrossing six times against SP471 and dpy-17(e164). Theatp-2(ua2) mutation was balanced by crossing LB121 with JK1122 to generate LB128. The atp-2(ua2) mutation was also outcrossed six times and balanced by crossing LB100 with BC986 andunc-36(e251) to generate LB127. cDNA clones fornuo-1 and atp-2 were obtained from Y. Kohara. Thenuo-1 and atp-2 cDNA sequences were determined on yk389c4 and yk63b5, respectively. 100 synchronized L3 worms or 300 embryos laid over a 12-h period were picked, lysed, and subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was treated with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP2p (28Dibrov E. Fu S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32042-32048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Detection was with a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie-d'Urfé, Québec, Canada). Animals were mounted on 2% agarose pads and observed under a Zeiss Axioskop-2 research microscope with a SPOT-2 digital camera (Carl Zeiss Canada Ltd., Calgary, Canada). N2, LB21B, or LB128 gravid adults were allowed to lay eggs for 6 h at 25 °C. Once hatched, groups of five wild-type or homozygous nuo-1 or atp-2progeny were transferred onto single nematode growth medium plates. Animals were monitored daily and were scored as dead when they no longer responded with movement to light prodding on the head. Wild-type animals were transferred daily during egg laying to keep them separate from their progeny. Animals were placed in drops of M9 buffer, and the simple rhythmic thrashing (swimming) of the animals was counted. The animals were scored for 1 min, and each animal was scored twice. Pharyngeal pumping and defecation were measured on seeded plates, and each animal was scored twice. Pumping was scored for 1 min. The time interval between two consecutive defecation muscle contractions was measured. For nuo-1, a 2.9-kb PCR product, amplified using N2 genomic DNA as a template with primers NFP2 and NFP4, was digested with SacI and SacII. The 0.8-kb SacI/SacII fragment was cloned into likewise digested pBluescript II SK and pBC-KS (both from PDI BioScience, Aurora, Ontario, Canada) to place the gene under the control of the T7 promoter in both the forward and reverse orientations. For atp-2, a 2.9-kb PCR product amplified with primers F1B2 and F1B4 was digested with XhoI andHindIII. The 1.1-kb XhoI/HindIII fragment was cloned into likewise digested pBluescript II SK and pBC-KS. The resulting constructs were transformed into a bacterial strain (BL21(DE3), PDI BioScience) expressing the T7 RNA polymerase gene from an inducible lac promoter and were grown either in the absence or presence of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 37 °C. As a control, empty pBluescript II SK and pBC-KS vectors were also transformed into BL21(DE3). N2 L4 hermaphrodites were fed with the bacteria, and their progeny were analyzed. All other C. elegans genes have a <60% nucleotide sequence identity over 200 nucleotides to the atp-2 and nuo-1 regions we used for our RNA interference (RNAi) studies, making it unlikely any cross-interference is responsible for the observed phenotypes (29Bosher J.M. Labouesse M. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E31-E36Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). LB21B or LB127 was grown on single nematode growth medium plates. 7 days after the plates had cleared, SDS was added at a final concentration of 1% and gently stirred for 30 min. SDS-resistant animals were picked onto fresh plates at 15 °C to allow for recovery from dauer. Chloramphenicol or 3-doxycycline was added to seeded nematode growth medium plates (24Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and synchronized animals were placed directly onto the plates. All experiments were performed at room temperature (23 °C) unless otherwise stated. We identified by sequence comparison two genes (designated nuo-1 andatp-2) that encode the C. elegans homologs of critical mammalian MRC subunits. We employed target-selected mutagenesis to produce deletion mutations in both genes (25Jansen G. Hazendonk E. Thijssen K.L. Plasterk R.H.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 27Plasterk R.H. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 59-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We prepared genomic DNA from an ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized library of animals and screened with nested oligonucleotide primers by PCR amplification of nuo-1 and atp-2 sequences. For the nuo-1 gene, we found one allele (designatedua1) in which a 1190-base pair sequence (nucleotides 26259–27448 in GenBankTM accession number Z50109) is replaced with a single A nucleotide (Fig.1A). The deletion completely removes exons 1–3 as well as the beginning of exon 4. Exon 3 contains the sequences proposed to mediate NADH and FMN binding; thus, we believe that the ua1 deletion is a null allele. InNeurospora crassa, loss of the 51-kDa subunit results in the complete loss of complex I activity (30Fecke W. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The intron/exon structure predicted by the GENEFINDER program was confirmed by sequence analysis of the yk389c4 cDNA (23C. elegans Sequencing Consortium Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3613) Google Scholar). The protein is predicted to contain 479 amino acids and have a mass of 52,422 Da. The first 24 amino acids are predicted to be removed upon import into mitochondria, leaving a mature subunit of 50,076 Da (31Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). For the atp-2 gene, we isolated one allele designatedua2, a 710-base pair deletion (nucleotides 947–1656 in GenBankTM accession number U10402) (Fig. 1 B). The atp-2 intron/exon structure was determined by sequence analysis of the yk63b5 cDNA. The first exon predicted by the GENEFINDER program (labeled X in Fig. 1 B) is not present in the cDNA (23C. elegans Sequencing Consortium Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3613) Google Scholar). Protein sequence corresponding to this first predicted exon is not present in any of the many ATP-2 homologs in the data base (data not shown). Translated exon 1 sequence aligns with the amino termini of other β-subunits and includes a possible initiator methionine at nucleotides 12–14. Furthermore, exon 1 (but not exon X) is transcribed as judged by the >25 expressed sequence tags in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. The atp-2gene, containing five exons, encodes a 538-amino acid protein with a predicted mass of 57,490 Da. The predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence is 72 amino acids long, leaving a mature subunit of 50,247 Da (31Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). The ua2 deletion completely removes exon 1 plus 6 nucleotides of exon 2; 27 residues of the mitochondrial targeting sequence are deleted. Western blot analysis using a cross-reacting antiserum directed against the yeast ATP2p subunit did not detect a truncated C. elegans ATP-2, suggesting that the protein either is not expressed from the ua2 allele or is unstable (Fig. 1 C). The atp-2(ua2) phenotype (L3 arrest; see below) was not affected by placing the ua2allele in trans to a deficiency (atp-2(ua2)/sDf121). This genetic evidence and the absence of detectable truncated protein led us to believe that theua2 allele is a null mutation. The completeC. elegans life cycle takes ∼3 days at 25 °C (24Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Following fertilization, the embryo undergoes cell proliferation, organogenesis, and morphogenesis, culminating in the hatching of the L1 larva after ∼14 h (32Wood W.B. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 1-16Google Scholar). Over the next 2 days, development proceeds through three additional larval stages, L2, L3, and L4, until the adult emerges from the final molt. The gonad consists of four cells at hatching (33Schedl T. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J. C. elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 241-269Google Scholar). During L2, the hermaphrodite gonad extends anteriorly and posteriorly, led by distal tip cells (34Sulston J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 123-155Google Scholar). The nuo-1(ua1) and atp-2(ua2) mutations are recessive alleles that exhibit typical mendelian patterns of inheritance. Both resulted in the developmental arrest of homozygotes in the third larval stage. Gonad development was more severely affected, however, and was arrested in the second larval stage. Gonad development up to L2 proceeded normally (Fig.2, A, C, andE). 6 h later in wild-type animals, the distal tip cells had migrated anteriorly and posteriorly, and the two gonad arms had extended considerably along the ventral surface (Fig.2 B). This migration of the distal tip cells did not proceed in nuo-1 and atp-2 animals, and the gonad primordium contained between 6 and 18 nuclei. This suggests that germ-line proliferation was also impaired (Fig. 2, D andF). In addition, mutant animals were somewhat smaller than the wild-type animals (Fig. 2, D and F). Over several days, the gonad arms partially extended, and the animals developed an L3-sized body. Surprisingly, the L3-arrestednuo-1 and atp-2 larvae had life spans significantly longer than those of the wild-type animals (TableI).Table Inuo-1 and atp-2 mutants have extended life spansGenotypeLife spanSignificance (pvalue)1-aBased on a two-tailed Student's t test to +/+.mean days ± S.D.+/+11.9 ± 2.7 (n = 27)nuo-1/nuo-114.8 ± 3.3 (n = 24)<0.01atp-2/atp-213.6 ± 2.6 (n = 31)<0.051-a Based on a two-tailed Student's t test to +/+. Open table in a new tab We reasoned that an impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain might lead to mobility or sensory defects due to the normally high rates of respiration in muscle and nerve cells. When placed in liquid medium, both the nuo-1 and atp-2 animals swam more slowly than wild-type animals (Table II). After being arrested for 2 days, their swimming rates were even further decreased. Pharyngeal pumping was irregular, and the rates were severely decreased in the mutants (Table II). The defecation cycle was also slowed (Table II). We also tested whether nuo-1 animals could sense an osmotic gradient of sodium chloride (35Culotti J.G. Russell R.L. Genetics. 1978; 90: 243-256PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant animals could sense and avoid the salt barrier (data not shown). Furthermore, the fractions of wild-type, nuo-1, or atp-2animals found away from a localized bacterial food source did not differ (data not shown). These observations indicate that the ability of the mutants to sense environmental stimuli was not abolished.Table IInuo-1 and atp-2 mutations impair swimming, pumping, and defecationGenotype (stage)Swimming2-aValues are means ± S.D.Pharyngeal pumping2-aValues are means ± S.D.Defecation2-aValues are means ± S.D.cycles/mincontractions/mins/cycle+/+ (adult)112 ± 9 (n = 10)258 ± 14 (n = 20)56 ± 5 (n = 20)+/+ (L3)116 ± 7 (n = 20)274 ± 17 (n = 20)53 ± 8 (n = 20)nuo-1/nuo-1 (L3; arrested 1 day)81 ± 12 (n = 16)97 ± 6 (n = 20)187 ± 40 (n = 20)nuo-1/nuo-1 (L3; arrested 2 days)51 ± 19 (n = 6)ND2-bNot determined.NDatp-2/atp-2 (L3; arrested 1 day)85 ± 7 (n = 20)86 ± 10 (n = 20)220 ± 39 (n = 20)atp-2/atp-2 (L3; arrested 2 days)51 ± 10 (n = 20)NDND2-a Values are means ± S.D.2-b Not determined. Open table in a new tab RNAi with double-stranded RNA is a potent sequence-specific mechanism for eliciting mRNA degradation and inhibiting gene expression in C. elegans (36Fire A. Xu S.Q.

Science. 1998; 282: 430-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Simply feeding worms Escherichia coli expressing double-stranded RNA can result in interference (37Tabara H. Grishok A. Mello C.C. Science. 1998; 282: 430-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 38Timmons L. Fire A. Nature. 1998; 395: 854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). We engineered two bacterial strains to express both sense and antisense RNAs, one by cloning a genomic nuo-1 fragment encoding most of exons 3–5 and the other by cloning a genomic atp-2 fragment encoding most of exons 3 and 4. Sense and antisense RNAs were produced from T7 promoters on two separate plasmids bearing different antibiotic markers. With a bacterial strain containing empty vectors as a control, the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce the expression of the T7 RNA polymerase had no effect on N2 worms (Fig.3A). However, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced transcription of the nuo-1- and atp-2-containing plasmids produced double-stranded RNA and led to the degradation of the maternalnuo-1 and atp-2 mRNAs; this resulted in ∼10 and 65% embryonic arrest, respectively (Fig. 3 A). Western blot analysis of the arrested embryos confirmed that the double-stranded RNA reduced ATP-2 levels by ∼2-fold (Fig.3 B). The majority (80–90%) of nuo-1( RNAi ) andatp-2( RNAi ) embryos arrested after gastrulation with very little tissue differentiation (Fig. 3 C). A small fraction of the embryos (10–20%) arrested earlier, with the earliest arresting at the one-cell stage (Fig. 3 C). The RNAi phenotype in each case was more severe than its mutant allele, suggesting thatnuo-1(+) or atp-2(+) expression in the heterozygote hermaphrodite contributes to the survival of the corresponding homozygous mutant offspring. Thus, interference with maternal expression prevents or reduces the inheritance ofnuo-1- or atp-2-derived protein by the embryo. We suggest that the maternal contribution of protein and mRNA allows the nuo-1 and atp-2 offspring to develop beyond the embryo stage before arresting. In agreement with this, we have detected full-length ATP-2 protein of maternal origin in theatp-2 homozygotes; it was present at approximately one-quarter the level in the wild-type animals (Fig.1 C). Entrance and exit from the dauer larval stage are developmental responses to chemosensory signals of food availability (39Troemel E.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Dauer larvae are resistant to treatment with 1% SDS (40Tissenbaum H.A. Hawdon J. Perregaux M. Hotez P. Guarente L. Ruvkun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). When starved LB127 animals were subjected to an SDS treatment, only atp-2/atp-2 sDp3animals were recovered, indicating that a wild-type atp-2gene, present on the sDp3 balancer, is required for dauer formation (Table III). To rule out the possibility that homozygous atp-2 dauers are sensitive to the SDS treatment, we introduced either daf-2(e1370) ordaf-7(e1000) alleles into the atp-2 mutant background. Dauers were picked and subjected to genotype analysis by PCR. None of the >90 animals tested in this way had lost the sDp3 balancer (data not shown). Therefore, atp-2 animals are dauer-defective.Table IIIatp-2 mutants are defective in entering into the dauer stageNo. of animals scoredatp-2/atp-2 sDp3atp-2/atp-2Before 1% SDS treatment3854After 1% SDS treatment1250Recovery123/125NA3-aNot applicable.3-a Not applicable.

Here we describe a method to simultaneously measure water permeability and ion conductance of purified human AQP1 after reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers. Water permeability was determined by measuring Na+ concentrations adjacent to the membrane. Comparisons with the known single channel water permeability of AQP1 indicate that the planar lipid bilayers contain from 106 to 107 water channels. Addition of cGMP induced ion conductance in planar bilayers containing AQP1, whereas cAMP was without effect. The number of water channels exceeded the number of active ion channels by approximately 1 million-fold, yet p-chloromethylbenzenesulfonate inhibited the water permeability but not ion conductance. Identical ion channel parameters were achieved with AQP1 purified from human red blood cells or AQP1 heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisae and affinity purified with either N- or C-terminal poly-histidine tags. Rp-8-Br-cGMP inhibited all of the observed conductance levels of the cation selective channel (2, 6, and 10 pS in 100 mmNa+ or K+). Deletion of the putative cGMP binding motif at the C terminus by introduction of a stop codon at position 237 yielded a truncated AQP1 protein that was still permeated by water but not by ions. Our studies demonstrate a method for simultaneously measuring water permeability and ion conductance of AQP1 reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers.

Haydon D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 510-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Water diffusion occurs through the lipid matrix (2Hanai T. Haydon D.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1966; 11: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) across transient defects arising from density fluctuations in the bilayers (3Deamer D.W. Bramhall J. Chem. Phys.

The discovery of aquaporin channel proteins provided the first molecular insight into how water may cross the plasma membrane (6Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). After a century of investigation, it is still not entirely resolved whether transepithelial water flow is mediated by local osmosis (7Spring K.R. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 92-98PubMed Google Scholar), or secondary active transport is induced by protein cotransporters (8Loo D.D. Zeuthen T. Chandy G. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(Lond.). 1999; 518: 195-202Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The former theory is supported by the observation that aquaporin-1 (AQP1)1 is required for NaCl-driven water transport across descending thin limbs of the kidney (10King L.S. Choi M. Fernandez P.C. Cartron J.P. Agre P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and by the finding that local osmotic gradients also drive the water flux associated with sodium/glucose cotransport in oocytes expressing the high affinity intestinal and renal sodium/glucose cotransporter (11Duquette P.P. Bissonnette P. Lapointe J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3796-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the absence of an osmotic gradient across an epithelium (12Vallon V. Verkman A.S. Schnermann J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F1030-F1033PubMed Google Scholar), water movement may be mediated by a local tonicity gradient in the immediate vicinity of the membrane. An investigation of coupling between aquaporin-mediated water fluxes with solute transport is important for understanding epithelial fluid transport. There has long been a general agreement that water moves through water channels in a single file fashion, so that the water molecules cannot pass each other within the channel (13Finkelstein A. Water Movement through Lipid Bilayers, Pores, and Plasma Membranes. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). This has recently been confirmed by high resolution structural studies of AQP1 (14Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) as well as the related glycerol transport protein GlpF (15Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Whereas most aquaporins are not believed to conduct ions, some exceptions have been reported. Anion currents are found in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing AQP6 after activation with micromolar concentrations of Hg2+ or low pH (16Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Forskolin was reported to stimulate membrane water and cation permeability of X. laevis oocytes expressing AQP1 (17Yool A.J. Stamer W.D. Regan J.W. Science. 1996; 273: 1216-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), however this was not confirmed by other laboratories (18Agre P. Lee M.D. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. Sasaki S. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Fushimi K. Marumo F. Verkman A.S. Yang B. Deen P.M.T. Mulders S.M. Kansen S.M. van Os C.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1490-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It was subsequently reported that AQP1 functions as a cGMP-gated ion channel when expressed in X. laevis oocytes (19Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to investigate whether water permeation of AQP1 can be measured when the protein is reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers and to determine whether cGMP-activated ion conductance can be detected. AQP1 was purified from red cells as described previously (20Agre P. Mathai J.C. Smith B.L. Preston G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 550-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using reagents, except where noted, from Sigma. 400 ml of washed human red cells were hypotonically lysed and washed until the membranes were white in ice-cold 7.5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin. Peripheral proteins were extracted with 1 m potassium iodide, and other integral proteins were solubilized in 1% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine. The membrane vesicles containing AQP1 were solubilized in 4% (v/v) Triton X-100, adsorbed, and eluted from a POROS Q anion exchanger column, and AQP1 was adsorbed onto a 10 ml butyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with an ammonium sulfate gradient (80% descending to 0% saturation). Protein purity was established by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1). Protease-deficient (pep4) S. cerevisiae were transformed with the pYES2 plasmid (Invitrogen) in which DNA encoding human AQP1 with a C-terminal 6-histidine fusion was inserted downstream of the GAL1 promoter. Human AQP1 containing an N-terminal 10-histidine sequence (residues 2–3 were replaced with GHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIWGRH) was similarly inserted into the pYES2 plasmid, and the C-truncated construct was produced by chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) of residue 237 to a stop codon. The recombinant yeast were cultured in 4 liters of Ura−minimal media and transferred during the log phase to galactose-rich media overnight to induce protein expression. Cells were disrupted by three cycles of French press at 18,000 p.s.i. Intact cells and nuclear debris were cleared by centrifugation at 2000 × g, and the membrane fraction was harvested by centrifugation at 300,000 × g. The membrane fraction was solubilized in 200 ml of buffer A (100 mm K2HPO4, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% octylglucoside (N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, Calbiochem)) containing 20 mm imidazole loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography column (Qiagen), washed with 100 volumes of buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole, and eluted with four 500-µl volumes of buffer A containing 1 m imidazole. Elution fractions 2 and 3 each contained ∼1 mg of protein as determined by the Schaffner-Weissmann filter assay (21Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Protein purity was established by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Purified AQP1 proteins were reconstituted into proteoliposomes by dialysis. The reconstitution mixture was prepared at room temperature by sequentially adding 100 mm MOPS-Na, pH 7.5 (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), 1.25% (w/v) octylglucoside, purified AQP1 (a final concentration of 0.5–1 mg/ml), and 20–50 mg/ml of preformed Escherichia coli polar phospholipid vesicles. To prepare these vesicles, a chloroform solution of E. coli total lipid extract (acetone/ether preparation, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was added to a round bottom flask, and the solvent was removed by evaporation. The thin lipid film was vortex mixed for 3 min with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm MOPS-Na, pH 7.5. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by extrusion using the small volume apparatus LiposoFast (Avestin, Inc., Ottawa, Canada) with filters of 100 nm pore diameter (22MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.Ph. M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). The reconstitution mixture was loaded into SPECTRA/POR 2.1 dialysis tubing, molecular mass cut-off 15,000 (Spectrum Laboratories, Laguna Hills, CA), and dialyzed against 100 volumes of assay buffer (50 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 0.3 µm CaCl2 (Merck), adjusted to pH 7.5 with HCl) for 48 h at room temperature. Proteoliposomes were harvested by centrifugation (60 min at 100,000 × g) and were resuspended into assay buffer at a concentration of 5–10 mg/ml. Employing liposomes or AQP1 proteoliposomes, planar lipid bilayers were prepared without or with AQP1 protein. The technique has recently been used for the reconstitution of aquaporin Z, the water channel protein from E. coli (23Pohl, P., Saparov, S. M., Borgnia, M. J., and Agre, P. (2001)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press.Google Scholar). It is based on spontaneous monolayer formation at the air-water interface of vesicle suspensions (24Pattus F. Desnuelle P. Verger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 507: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Schindler H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 555: 316-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Two such monolayers were combined in the 150-µm-diameter aperture in a 10-µm-thick polytetrafluoroethylene septum separating the two aqueous phases of the chamber. The septum was pretreated with a hexadecane-hexane mixture (volume ratio of 1:200). By raising the water levels in both compartments above the aperture, the two monolayers covered the polytetrafluoroethylene septum forming a bilayer within the aperture (26Schindler H. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), similar to the bilayer formation from solvent-spread monolayers (27Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). The bathing assay buffer was agitated by magnetic stirrer bars. For experiments at an acidic pH, 50 mm MES was added. Transmembrane water flux leads to solute concentration changes in the immediate vicinity of the membrane. Water passing through the membrane dilutes the solution it enters and concentrates the solution it leaves (1Fettiplace R. Haydon D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 510-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The thicknessδ of the stagnant water layer responsible for the polarization effect is defined in terms of the concentration gradient at the membrane water interface (28Dainty J. House C.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1966; 182: 66-78Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in Equation 1 ‖Cs−Cb‖δ=∂Cb∂x‖x=0(Eq. 1) where x is the distance from the membrane.C b and C s denote the solute concentrations in the bulk and at the interface, respectively. Within the unstirred layer adjacent to the membrane (−δ< x < δ), the solute concentrationC is an exponential function of the distance x to the membrane (29Pohl P. Saparov S.M. Antonenko Y.N. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as seen in Equation 2 C(x)=Csexp−vxD+ax33D(Eq. 2) where D, v, and a are the diffusion coefficient, the linear velocity of the osmotic volume flow, and the stirring parameter, respectively. With the knowledge ofv, the transmembrane water permeabilityP f can be calculated as shown in Equation 3 Pf=vCosmVW(Eq. 3) where V w is the partial molar volume of water, and C osm is the near-membrane concentration of the solute used to establish the transmembrane osmotic pressure difference. If the polarization of membrane-impermeable sodium ions is used to determine water flux, the Equation 4 can be used to correct the urea bulk concentration, C b:urea, for the dilution by water flux (i.e. to obtainC osm) because the diffusion coefficients of the osmolyte urea and sodium are very close (30Pohl P. Saparov S.M. Antonenko Y.N. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1403-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cosm/Cb:urea=Cs/Cb(Eq. 4) The Na+-sensitive electrodes were made of glass capillaries containing mixture A of Sodium Ionophore II (Fluka) according to the procedure described by Amman (31Amman D. Ion-selective Microelectrodes. Principles, Design, and Application. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986Crossref Google Scholar). Their tips had a diameter of approximately 1–2 µm. Electrodes with a 90% rise time below 0.6 s were selected. Artifacts attributed to very slow electrode movements are improbable, yet the possible effects of time resolution or the distortion of the unstirred layer were tested by taking measurements while moving the microelectrode toward and away from the bilayer. Because no hysteresis was found, it can be assumed that an electrode of appropriate time resolution was driven without any effect on the unstirred layer. The osmotic gradient was induced by urea (Laborchemie Apolda, Apolda, Germany) added to thetrans-side of the membrane only. The experimental arrangement was similar to the one described previously (32Antonenko Y.N. Denisov G.A. Pohl P. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1701-1710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Pohl P. Antonenko Y.N. Rosenfeld E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Voltage sampling was performed by an electrometer (Model 617, Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio) connected to a personal computer. Continuous motion of the microelectrode perpendicular to the surface of the lipid bilayer was handled by a hydraulic microdrive manipulator (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Touching the membrane was indicated by a steep potential change. Because the velocity of the electrode motion was known (1 µm s−1), the position of the Na+ sensor relative to the membrane could be determined at any instant of the experiment. The accuracy of the distance measurements was estimated to be ± 5 µm. Under voltage clamp conditions, the transmembrane current was measured by a patch clamp amplifier (model EPC9, HEKA, Germany). To monitor the current across single ion channels, the sampling frequency of the patch clamp amplifier was fixed at 0.5 kHz. The recording filter was a 4-pole Bessel with a 3-db corner frequency of 0.1 kHz. The acquired raw data were analyzed with the help of the TAC software package (Bruxton Corporation, Seattle, WA). Gaussian filters between 7 and 37 Hz were applied to reduce noise. Planar lipid bilayers were formed from protein-free liposomes or from proteoliposomes containing purified red cell AQP1. These membranes were stable for hours permitting steady state water permeability measurements in the presence of an osmotic gradient. The determination of Na+ concentration profiles (Fig.2A) revealed that diffusion polarization adjacent to planar lipid bilayers is increased when AQP1 is present. In a representative experiment (Fig. 2 A), the coefficient of osmotic water permeability (P f) rose from 23 µm/s at a base line to 50 µm/s with AQP1. This permitted calculation of the number of water channels (n) from the measured membrane water permeability (P f) and the known single channel water permeability (p f = 6–11 × 10−14 cm3/subunit/s (34Zeidel M.L. Ambudkar S.V. Smith B.L. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar,35Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar)). n=pfA/pf=0.0035cm/s×(0.0075cm)2/(6×10−14cm3/s)=107(Eq. 5) A confirmation that the increase in water permeability occurs through AQP1 was achieved with p-chloromethylbenzenesulfonate (pCMBS), a known inhibitor of water channel proteins (36Macey R.I. Farmer R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), which reduced the membrane water permeability to base line. The planar bilayers containing AQP1 exhibited no detectable membrane currents, however, the incubation with cGMP for at least 5 min induced discrete ion conductances (Fig. 2 B). Similar conductivities were induced by the addition of 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 2 B), whereas the addition of cAMP was without effect (data not shown). The number of ion channels was apparent from the number of steps in the record of the transmembrane current. Only one ion channel was usually open at a time, approximately 1 million-fold below the number of water channels that are constitutively open. The impact of the rare ion channel opening on water permeability was demonstrated to be negligible (data not shown). Moreover, although water permeability was fully inhibited by pCMBS, ion conductance was not inhibited (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the permeation pathways for water and ions are not identical. Three different single channel conducting levels (2, 6, and 10 pS) were distinguishable in 100 mm NaCl (Fig.3). Because the conductivity sublevels of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels are believed to represent differences in the occupancy of four identical cGMP binding sites of the channel (37Miller C. Nature. 1997; 389: 328-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), it may be inferred that the ion-conducting unit is the AQP1 tetramer. Despite the huge number of functionally active AQP1 water channels in the planar bilayers, the base-line current across the membrane did not exceed one pA, even when the membrane was clamped at 100 mV and the single channel currents were linearly related to the voltage applied. The discrepancy between the tiny number of ion channels and the huge number of water channels raised the question of whether ion conductance was mediated by AQP1 itself or by a contaminant, which remained after purification from red cells. To address this question, poly-histidine-tagged AQP1 was expressed in yeast. Upon reconstitution into planar bilayers, recombinant human AQP1 with the poly-histidine tag at either the N terminus (data not shown) or the C terminus facilitated water transport as efficiently as the native water channel protein (Fig. 4A). When incubated with cGMP for 5 min, planar bilayers containing poly-histidine-tagged AQP1 exhibited ion conductances that were indistinguishable from the preparations containing the native AQP1 protein. Moreover, the cGMP-mediated ion channel activation is reversible, because competitive dose-dependent inhibition was achieved with Rp-8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 4 B). Low concentrations of the cyclic nucleotide inhibitor dramatically reduced the probability that the channel is in the open state. High concentrations of the agent completely inhibited the channel activity. The conductances observed with AQP1 were compared with conductances of known cGMP-gated channels. cGMP activated K+ and Na+ conductance equivalently in planar bilayers containing AQP1. The open time of the channel increases with the cGMP concentration and the incubation time. Within minutes of the addition of 10 µm cGMP, the channel opened for short intervals (milliseconds to a few seconds), whereas the addition of 100 µm cGMP increased the open time to nearly 1 min (Fig. 5, top). After incubation for 20–30 min, channel lifetimes of several minutes were observed (data not shown). Moreover, in 100 mm KCl, all three conducting states were observed, and their conductances were equivalent to those measured in 100 mm NaCl (compared with Fig. 3). Cation selectivity of the channel was derived from the reversal potential, −29 mV in the applied 4-fold KCl gradient (Fig. 5,bottom). Potentials are given with regard to the hyperosmotic solution kept electrically at ground. Permeability ratios (P K+ /P Cl−) can be calculated by fitting the reversal potentials to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz Equation (38Lear J.D. Schneider J.P. Kienker P.K. DeGrado W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3212-3217Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) PK+PCl−=[CCl−]ν−[CCl−]0exp(φrevF/RT)[CK+]νexp(φrevF/RT)−[CK+]0(Eq. 6) where C denotes concentrations on the applied potential (v) and ground (0) sides of the membrane, F is Faraday's constant, and RT is thermal energy. The conductivity ratioP K+ /P Cl−for all three conductance levels of planar bilayers containing AQP1 was ∼12, demonstrating cation selectivity. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels are usually activated by ligand binding to a domain at the C terminus. A sequence with similarities to the cGMP binding motif was described in the C terminus of AQP1 (19Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), so a recombinant AQP1 protein lacking the C terminus was engineered by introducing a stop codon at position 237 (39Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, the truncated protein increased the water permeability of planar membranes to 56 µm/s, equivalent to that achieved with full-length AQP1 at the same protein-to-lipid ratio (Fig.6A). In contrast, bilayers containing the truncated protein did not exhibit detectable cGMP-induced ion channel activity (Fig. 6 B). Thus, cGMP-induced ion conductance was eliminated without affecting water permeability. Our studies demonstrate that the osmotic water permeability of AQP1 can be measured when the protein is reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. Using this technique (40Pohl P. Saparov S.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2426-2434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 41Saparov S.M. Antonenko Y.N. Koeppe R.E. Pohl P. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2526-2534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it was possible to quantify water transport, because it alters the Na+concentration in the immediate vicinity of the lipid bilayer (Fig. 2). Moreover, this process is inhibited by pCMBS, a known inhibitor of AQP1 and other aquaporin water channel proteins (36Macey R.I. Farmer R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) that interacts with a specific cysteine in a pore-lining domain (42Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the known single AQP1 subunit water permeability (34Zeidel M.L. Ambudkar S.V. Smith B.L. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 35Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), it was possible to estimate that from 106 to 107 functional AQP1 proteins were reconstituted into the planar membrane of 150-µm diameter. Although this is a very large number of individual molecules, the well understood behavior of AQP1 protein isolated from human red blood cells (43Smith B.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or expressed and purified from yeast (44Coury L.A. Mathai J.C. Prasad G.R. Brodsky J.L. Agre P. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 43: F34-F42Google Scholar) has permitted detailed biophysical studies of the water permeability (34Zeidel M.L. Ambudkar S.V. Smith B.L. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and the atomic structure of the molecule (14Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Moreover, the density of AQP1 in the aperture, up to 125 AQP1 tetramers/µm2, is below the density of the protein in native red cell membranes, ∼325 AGP1 tetramers/µm2 (45Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Agre P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and is far below the maximum density achieved during preparation of AQP1 membrane crystals, ∼2 × 104 AQP1 tetramers/µm2 (46Walz T. Smith B.L. Zeidel M.L. Engel A. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1583-1586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measuring the single channel water permeability of AQP1 proteins reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers is relatively labor-intensive and only semi-quantitative, but it permits the simultaneous measurement of any membrane currents. This approach provided an opportunity to evaluate the report that AQP1 expressed in X. laevisoocytes will conduct cations when activated by cGMP (19Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our studies have qualitatively confirmed this finding and the possibility that this represents an extraneous molecule that seems improbable, because heterologously expressed human AQP1 containing either N-terminal or C-terminal poly-histidine tags yielded identical behavior. Moreover, the ion conductances were induced by cGMP, and the stable analog 8-Br-cGMP but not cAMP, and the protein failed to respond when the putative cGMP binding motif in the C terminus was deleted (Fig. 6). Several differences were noted between the ion conductances studied by patch clamp recordings of AQP1 expressed in oocytes (19Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and our studies of AQP1 in planar bilayers. The cross-sectional areas of conductance differ by an order of magnitude, 150 pS in oocytes (in 150 mm NaCl) versus 10 pS in planar bilayers (in 100 mm NaCl). The oocytes exhibited a single conductance level, whereas AQP1 in planar bilayers exhibited three conductance states, a characteristic of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (37Miller C. Nature. 1997; 389: 328-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The qualitative differences have also been reported for other proteins such as Na+ channels when studies of oocyte membranes were compared with planar bilayers. For example, some of the differences in Na+ channel behavior in oocytes and planar bilayers has been ascribed to direct associations with short actin filaments (47Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V. Ripoll P.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37845-37854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but this is unlikely to be the case for AQP1, because AQP1 was not found to be associated with the red cell membrane skeleton when analyzed biochemically (43Smith B.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the biophysical measurements of redistribution within native membranes (48Cho M.R. Knowles D.W. Smith B.L. Moulds J.J. Agre P. Mohandas N. Golan D.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1136-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Most striking is the astonishingly low number of ion channels compared with water channels. The previous report (19Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) describing cGMP-induced ion conductances of AQP1 in oocytes did not attempt to quantify the number of channels in the membrane, and it has been shown with epitope-tagged epithelial sodium channels that the open probability may range from only 0.004 to 0.014 (49Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), however to our knowledge, 1 million-fold discrepancy is unprecedented and may represent improper folding or degradation of a rare AQP1 protein. The atomic structure of human AQP1 has been determined by electron crystallography (14Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), and the structure of the E. coliprotein GlpF, a glycerol-transporting member of the aquaporin family, has been established by x-ray crystallography (15Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The structures of AQP1 and GlpF are highly related, causing the proteins to be referred to as “fraternal twins” (50Unger V.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1082-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the transmembrane pores within AQP1 and GlpF both reside in the center of the individual subunits. The site where four subunits come together always causes a finite gap among the molecules. 2P. Nollert, personal communication. Interestingly, the high resolution structural studies of GlpF revealed an unsuspected structure resembling an ion channel at the 4-fold axis of symmetry (15Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The studies of AQP1 have not yet provided the resolution necessary to discern the structure at the 4-fold axis, however, the recent success in preparing three-dimensional crystals of AQP1 may permit this resolution (51Sui H. Walian P.J. Tang G. Oh A. Jap B.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2000; 56: 1198-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 4-fold axis may provide an explanation for our studies, which indicate that the water permeability and the ion conductances do not occur through the same pathway in AQP1. Although the cGMP-induced ion conductance by AQP1 is an interesting biophysical exercise, this does not clarify the importance of the finding since the number of ion channels is more than 1 million-fold lower than the number of water channels. Even in an AQP1-rich tissue such as red cells, which contain up to 5 × 104tetramers/cell, this translates to less than one channel/cell. Thus, whereas only an extremely small subpopulation of AQP1 molecules may behave as ion channels, this contrasts with a far more durable property of AQP1, the ability to serve as water-selective channels.

https://openalex.org/W1973116749,"Using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in an external magnetic field, we have observed magnetic hysteresis on a nanometer scale in an ultrathin ferromagnetic film. An array of iron nanowires, being two atomic layers thick, was grown on a stepped tungsten (110) substrate. The microscopic sources of hysteresis in this system-domain wall motion, domain creation, and annihilation-were observed with nanometer spatial resolution. A residual domain 6.5 nanometers by 5 nanometers in size has been found which is inherently stable in saturation fields. Its stability is the consequence of a 360 degrees spin rotation.

PAR-2 is strongly activated by trypsin, tryptase, and potentially other unidentified enzymes (5Fox M.T. Harriott P. Walker B. Stone S.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is unique among the PAR family, as the newly described PAR-3 and PAR-4 are also thrombin-sensitive (6Ishihara H.

PAR-2 is strongly expressed in smooth muscle cells of the airways, vasculature, and intestine, and in cells of epithelial origin such as endothelial cells and enterocytes (8D'Andrea M.R. Derian C.K. Leturcq D. Baker S.M. Brunmark A. Ling P. Darrow A.L. Santulli R.J. Brass L.F. Andrade-Gordon P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 9Cocks T.M.

It is also highly expressed in keratinocytes (10Steinhoff M. Corvera C.U. Thoma M.S. Kong W. Caughey G.H. Ansel J.C. Bunnett N.W. Exp. Dermatol. 1999; 8: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), where it regulates a number of inflammatory linked responses such as the expression of interleukin-6 and -8 and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (11Wakita H. Furukawa F. Takigawa M. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1997; 109: 190-207PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hou L. Kapas S. Cruchley A.T. Macey M.G. Harriott P. Chinni C. Stone S.R. Howells G.L.

However, at present there is little information available regarding the role of specific cellular signaling pathways in regulating PAR-2-mediated cellular events. Studies have been limited principally to effects upon the generation of inositol trisphosphate and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, both events associated with a receptor coupled to phospholipase C activation (13Santulli R.J. Derian C.K. Darrow A.L. Tomko K.A. Eckardt A.J. Seiberg M. Scarborough R.M. Andrade-Gordon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Two significant intracellular signaling pathways potentially involved in mediating inflammatory responses in a number of cell types are the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway. The MAP kinases consist of the classical isoforms of MAP kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) and the stress-activated protein (SAP) kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase (15Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). All three kinases have been implicated in the regulation of a number of processes in keratinocytes such as involucrin expression, protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated hyperproliferation, and UV-mediated apoptosis (16Efimova T.

Previous studies have shown that, in rat aortic smooth muscle cells, trypsin stimulates p42/44 MAP kinase but does not activate JNK and p38 MAP kinase (19Belham C.L. Tate R.J. Scott P.H. Pemberton A.D. Miller H.R.P. Wadsworth R.M. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, different coupling mechanisms may exist in different target cells, particularly in keratinocytes where PAR-2 is highly expressed. The NFκB family of transcription factors is well recognized as being involved in the regulation of a number of pro-inflammatory genes (20May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). In cytokine-stimulated cells, NFκB is regulated by the activation of isoforms of inhibitory κB kinase (IKK) that regulate phosphorylation of inhibitory κB (21DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 22Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z.D. Rothe M.

IKK itself is regulated by a number of upstream regulatory kinases, including NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) and other potential intermediates such as protein kinase B and PKC (24Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 25Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B.

Although some studies have demonstrated activation of NFκB in response to thrombin, bradykinin, and other G-protein-coupled receptor agonists including trypsin (27Kravchenko V.V. Pan Z.X. Han J.H.

Since PAR-2 activation displays many features similar to cytokines regarding the activation of inflammatory mediator release, we sought to determine if the signaling events mediated by PAR-2 were similar. Thus, we examined SAP kinase and NFκB activation, pathways that are known to be strongly activated by cytokines (15Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 20May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Here we show for the first time in a transfected epithelial cell line (32Ree K. Johnsen A.S. Rugstad H.E. Bakka A. Hovig T. APMIS. 1981; 89: 73-80Google Scholar) strong activation of both SAP kinase and IKK/NFκB signaling pathways following PAR-2 activation, an effect mimicked by activation of protein kinase C. Using isoform-selective protein kinase C inhibitors (33Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grandperret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D.

J. 1998; 333: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we demonstrate the involvement of PKC-dependent and -independent mechanisms in the regulation of SAP kinase activity. We also present evidence supporting an important role for typical PKC isoforms in mediating PAR-2-stimulated IKK/NFκB signaling. All chemicals and reagents were obtained from appropriate commercial sources. Escherichia coli expression plasmids for GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 and GST-c-Jun (5–89) were kind gifts of J. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada) and C. J. Marshall (Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, United Kingdom (UK)). The plasmids encoding wild type and DN-IKKα and IKKβ were kind gifts from D. Goeddel (Tularik Inc.), whereas those encoding dominant-inhibitory PKC mutants PKCα (T/A)3 and PKCζ (T/A)4 were from P. J. Parker (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom). HA-JNK, FLAG p38 MAP kinase, and GST-ATF-2 were kind gifts from Jonathon Blank (University of Leicester, Leicester, UK). Other materials include: oligonucleotide primers (Genosys, UK); mammalian expression vectors pRc/RSV and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Netherlands); Lipofectin, LipofectAMINE, and PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK); [32P]ATP and [3H]myoinositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The λ phage DNA library, derived from TNF-α-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (TL-706), was obtained fromCLONTECH Ltd. (UK). Human PAR-2 cDNA was cloned by PCR amplification from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library. PCR primer design was based on the published human PAR-2 sequence (2Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Larsson A.K. Strombeck B. Sundelin J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The primer sequences were as follows: forward primer, 5′ AACCAAGCTTTCTCGGTGCGTCCAGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′GCTCTAGACTGCAATTCCCATCTGAGG-3′. The design also incorporated unique HindIII and XbaI sites in the forward and reverse primers respectively, to allow directional cloning. The PCR product was subcloned into a similarly digested pRc/RSV vector using T4 DNA ligase to generate the pRC/RSV-PAR-2 expression vector. The human keratinocyte cell line NCTC2544 was then transfected with pRC/RSV-PAR-2 using Lipofectin, and clonal cell lines were isolated in 800 µg/ml Geneticin. Several clones were tested for PAR-2 expression using PCR and assay of [3H]inositol phosphate ([3H]IP) accumulation (see below). One of these clones (G) was used in the study. Human skin epithelial cells NCTC2544 were maintained in M199 medium with Earl's salt supplement, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 µg of streptomycin/ml in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. NCTC2544 cells stably expressing human PAR-2 (G) were maintained in complete M199 medium containing 400 µg/ml Geneticin for selection pressure and passaged using Versene. Primary human keratinocytes were cultured from neonatal foreskins obtained from the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (Edinburgh, UK) as outlined previously (36Kondo S. Kono T. Sauder D.N. McKenzie R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 690-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in supplemented serum-free media and used at passages 3–4. Cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm2 culture dishes and the total RNA extracted by cell lysis using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen Ltd.). cDNA was produced by using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PAR-2 sequence was then amplified from the cDNA by PCR using KlenTaq polymerase mix (CLONTECH Ltd.) and the PAR-2 primers indicated above at a concentration of 10 pmol/ml. A control reaction was set up using actin forward (5′-CGTGGGCCGCCGCCCTAGGCACCA-3′) and reverse (5′-TTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGG-3′) primers (19Belham C.L. Tate R.J. Scott P.H. Pemberton A.D. Miller H.R.P. Wadsworth R.M. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a Techne Genius automatic cycler using 5 min denaturing at 96 °C followed by a step cycle. The step cycle consisted of a denaturing step at 96 °C for 1.5 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and then a product extension step at 68 °C for 2 min. A final extension step, 65 °C for 5 min, was then included. Samples were exposed to 40 cycles of the PCR conditions. Samples were resolved on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel, containing 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide. The products were run against a 1-kilobase pair DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were imaged under UV light. NCTC2544 clones expressing PAR-2 were grown to 60–70% confluence on six-well plates and transiently co-transfected with various plasmids using the LipofectAMINE Plus® transfection system, according to the manufacturer's protocol. For measuring kinase activities, 200 ng of the plasmid encoding HA-JNK1 was transfected together with 600 ng of DN-PKCα (T/A)3, PKCζ (T/A)4, or blank vector pcDNA3. For each transfection, the total amount of DNA was adjusted to 800 ng/well with blank vector. A similar procedure was carried out for FLAG-p38 MAP kinase except that 100 ng of the construct was employed. For epitope-IKK assays, wild type Myc-IKKα and FLAG-IKKβ were transfected at 900 and 100 ng/well, respectively, in the presence of either 300 ng of DN-PKC (as above) or blank vector. For the NFκB luciferase assays, 250 ng of a plasmid containing 3× NFκB DNA enhancer, linked to the firefly luciferase reporter geneluc, or blank vector were transfected together, or in conjunction with 500 ng of DN-IKKα and/or β, to give 1.25 µg/well (37Wood K.M. Roff M. Hay R.T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2131-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After a 6-h incubation period with the DNA mixture in media free of serum and antibiotics, cells were transferred into complete M199 medium for another 30 h. Cells were then rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 24 h before stimulation. Trypsin-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation was measured in cells pre-labeled overnight with [3H]2-myoinositol as outlined previously (38Plevin R. Kellock N.A. Wakelam M.J.O. Wadsworth R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For assay of JNK, pre-cleared supernatants were added to a 20-µl slurry of GST-c-Jun-(5–89)/GSH-Sepharose beads and mixed for 3 h at 4 °C, whereas for p38 MAP kinase, full-length GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 was used. The precipitates were resuspended in 25 µl of kinase buffer and the kinase reaction started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (1–2 µCi, 25 µm) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 10 µl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (11% (w/v) gel). Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography overnight (39Paul A. Torrie L.J. McLaren G.J. Kennedy C. Gould G.W. Plevin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13243-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For epitope-tagged JNK assays, agonist-stimulated cells were lysed in 400 µl of lysis buffer and supernatants incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 10 µl of protein G-Sepharose beads pre-coupled with anti-HA antibody (Y-11; Santa Cruz, 0.2 µg) for 1 h at 4 °C. HA-JNK1 activity was determined in vitro in 30 µl of kinase buffer containing 1 µm ATP, 2 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 µg of affinity-purified GST-c-Jun-(5–89) as a substrate for 20 min at 30 °C. A similar protocol was employed for FLAG-p38 MAP kinase activity except that 1 µg of anti-FLAG antibody (anti-Oct A; Santa Cruz) was employed in the immunoprecipitation step and 1 µg/tube GST-ATF-2 was used in the kinase assay. MAPKAP kinase-2 activity was assessed in immunoprecipitates using GS peptide (KKLNRTLSVSA) as substrate as described previously (39Paul A. Torrie L.J. McLaren G.J. Kennedy C. Gould G.W. Plevin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13243-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Following termination by washing in ice-cold PBS, cells were harvested and pelleted and crude nuclear extracts made as described previously (40Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). NFκB-DNA binding was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, according to the kit manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Cell lysates were incubated in 300 µl of solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1% Brij 35, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 30 min. Pre-cleared samples were then added to either IKKα or IKKβ polyclonal antibody coupled to Protein G-Sepharose beads, and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation and washed twice in solubilization buffer and once in kinase buffer (25 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Precipitates were then resuspended in 25 µl of kinase buffer and the kinase reaction initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP (5 µCi), 25 µm ATP, and 2 µg of GST-IκBN (1–70, N-terminal truncated IκB). Samples were incubated in a final volume of 30 µl, with shaking, at 30 °C for 30 min before termination of the kinase reaction by addition of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were then resolved on 11% (w/v) acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the phosphorylated protein identified by autoradiography. For Flag-IKKβ assays the same procedure was followed except 1 µg/tube anti-FLAG antibody was used in the immunoprecipitation step. NCTC2544 cells grown on six-well culture plates were transfected as described previously and were quiesced in serum-free M199 overnight. Cells were treated with appropriate agonists for 5 h and assayed as outlined previously (37Wood K.M. Roff M. Hay R.T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2131-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments we found that in NCTC2544 cells expressing PAR-2, trypsin, and the PAR-2-activating hexapeptide (SLIGKV) stimulated strong activation of [3H]IP accumulation (-fold stimulation; 30 nm trypsin = 12.6 ± 2.1), which was not observed in wild type NCTC2544 cells or in cells transfected with empty vector. This response was comparable with the stimulation observed by 50 µm UTP, a P2Y2 receptor agonist (-fold stimulation: 8.75 ± 0.76), suggesting a level of PAR-2 expression comparable with other endogenous receptors. Trypsin and SLIGKV also stimulated p42/44 MAP kinase activation, but only in cells expressing hPAR-2. The level of MAP kinase activity was also comparable to stimulation with UTP. Furthermore, a comparison of PAR-2 mRNA levels in clone G and human primary keratinocytes by RT-PCR indicated that the level of receptor mRNA expression was similar (Fig. 1). This suggests that, in clone G cells, the level of PAR-2 expression is not substantially greater than might be expected for endogenous expression in other cell types. However, in contrast to the moderate activation of p42/44 MAP kinase, trypsin strongly stimulated both the known SAP kinases JNK and p38 MAP kinase (Figs. 2and3). The activation of both kinases was rapid in onset and reached a peak between 25 and 30 min before returning to basal values by 90 min. Maximum activation was 22.3 ± 6.6- and 24.9 ± 9.3-fold for JNK and p38 MAP kinase, respectively, a level of stimulation comparable with TNF-α (∼20-fold). The PAR-2 peptide mimetic SLIGKV also stimulated both JNK and p38 MAP kinase (Figs. 2 and 3 B). However, the degree of activation of both kinases was less than that observed for trypsin and the duration of activation was much shorter. This was not due to any nonspecific effect of trypsin, since no activation of SAP kinase activity was observed in response to trypsin in non-transfected cells (Fig. 2 C). In additional experiments, trypsin was also found to stimulate strongly MAPKAP kinase-2 activity (Fig. 3 D) but not in vector control cells.Figure 3PAR-2-mediated p38 MAP kinase activation NCTC2544 keratinocytes. Clone G cells expressing PAR-2 (panels A–C) or vector controls (panel D) were stimulated with either 30 nm trypsin (panels A, C, and D) or 200 µm SLIGKV (panel B) for the times indicated (in min) and assayed for p38 MAP kinase activity (panels A–C) as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” In panel C, blots of trypsin-stimulated p38 MAP kinase activity were quantified by scanning densitometry. In panel D, samples from trypsin-stimulated clone G cells (▪) or vector controls (○) were assayed for MAPKAP kinase-2 activity as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of at least four individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In addition to activation of SAP kinase signaling, trypsin (30 nm) or SLIGKV (200 µm) stimulated a strong increase in NFκB DNA binding in NCTC2544 cells. This was observed as early as 30 min and was maximal by 60 min (Fig.4, A and B). Supershift analysis using anti-NFκB antibodies indicated that the stimulated DNA-binding complex consisted of p50 and p65 (data not shown). Activation of NFκB DNA binding was also accompanied by stimulation of NFκB luciferase reporter activity (TableI) and the loss in expression of both α and β isoforms of IκB. Furthermore, we observed strong activation of both isoforms of IKK by trypsin (Fig. 4, C andD). An increase in activity of both IKKα and IKKβ was observed as early as 10 min, with maximum stimulation by 30 min (3.7 ± 0.2- and 5.4 ± 0.1-fold, respectively;n = 3, Fig. 4E), which was again comparable to that observed with the cytokine TNF-α.Table IThe effect of dominant negative IKKα and -β on trypsin-stimulated NFκB luciferase reporter activity in NCTC2544 keratinocytesStimulation+ Luciferase reporter+ DN-IKKα+ DN-IKKβ+ DN-IKKα and DN-IKKβ-foldControl10.4 ± 0.30.2 ± 0.150.1 ± 0.1Trypsin3.9 ± 0.52.3 ± 1.31.0 ± 0.61.0 ± 0.68TNF-α7.9 ± 0.60.6 ± 0.30.4 ± 0.30.1 ± 0.1Clone G cells were transfected with NFκB reporter construct (250 ng) alone, or with either DN-IKKα or DN-IKKβ (both 500 ng) or a combination of both.

NFκB luciferase reporter activity was assayed as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represented are normalised to luciferase activity control cells. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of at least four individual experiments. Further experiments found that PAR-2 coupling to the NFκB pathway was not a result of transfection conditions. In human basal keratinocytes, trypsin stimulated both NFκB-DNA binding activity and JNK activation with kinetics similar to that observed in the transfected cells (Fig.5). The level of trypsin-stimulated NFκB-DNA binding was again comparable to that observed in response to TNF-α. We also found the known activator of protein kinase C, PMA, was also a strong activator of both SAP kinases (Fig.6). PMA strongly activated JNK and p38 MAP kinase activity with kinetics similar to that observed for trypsin. Maximal activity of ∼20–30-fold was observed within 30 min before returning to basal values within 60 min. PMA also strongly stimulated NFκB-DNA binding activity (Fig.7). Maximal DNA binding was obtained between 30 and 60 min and was accompanied by a strong increase in the activity of both IKKα and IKKβ isoforms with kinetics similar to those observed for trypsin and TNF-α (Fig. 7, B–D). In order to investigate the role of protein kinase C isoforms in the regulation of PAR-2-mediated SAP kinase and NFκB signaling, selective inhibitors of PKC isoforms and DN-PKC mutants were utilized. Pre-treatment of cells with GF109203X, which inhibits PKC isoforms α, β, δ, and ε but which shows some preference for PKCα (33Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grandperret T. Ajakane M.

In order to investigate the dynamic mechanisms associated with GPCR signaling, the intracellular translocation of a green fluorescent protein-tagged PKD was analyzed by real-time visualization in fibroblasts and epithelial cells stimulated with bombesin, a GPCR agonist. We found that bombesin induced a rapidly reversible plasma membrane translocation of green fluorescent protein-tagged PKD, an event that can be divided into two distinct mechanistic steps. The first step, which is exclusively mediated by the cysteine-rich domain in the N terminus of PKD, involved its translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. The second step, i.e. the rapid reverse translocation of PKD from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, required its catalytic domain and surprisingly PKC activity. These findings provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which PKC coordinates the translocation and activation of PKD in response to bombesin-induced GPCR activation.

Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DAG-regulated PKC isoforms all bind phorbol esters and are major cellular targets for this class of tumor promoter (11Nishizuka Y. Cancer. 1989; 63: 1892-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It is increasingly recognized that each isoform has specific functionsin vivo and that the biological activity of individual PKC isoforms is intimately regulated by their subcellular localization (12Teruel M.N.

However, the mechanisms by which PKC-mediated signals in the plasma membrane are propagated to critical downstream cytosolic targets remain largely undefined.Protein kinase D (PKD)/protein kinase Cµ is a serine/threonine protein kinase with structural, enzymological, and regulatory properties different from other PKC family members (13Valverde A.M.

Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most salient features of PKD structure include the presence of a catalytic domain distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that regulates its enzymatic activity, and a highly hydrophobic stretch of amino acids in its N-terminal region (15Rozengurt E.

The N-terminal region also contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) comprising a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich, zinc finger-like motifs, which confers high affinity binding to phorbol esters and plays a negative role in the regulation of catalytic activity of PKD (13Valverde A.M.

In all cases, PKD activation has been shown to be mediated by a PKC-dependent signal transduction pathway that involves the phosphorylation of Ser744 and Ser748 within the activation loop of the catalytic domain of PKD (1Zugaza J.L.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that treatment of COS-7 cells and lymphocytes with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate induces a striking and persistent translocation of PKD from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Antigen-receptor engagement also caused rapid PKD translocation to the plasma membrane but in contrast to the response to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, this PKD redistribution was transient, with PKD returning to the cytosol within minutes of antigen engagement (20Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,31Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that the translocation of PKD to the plasma membrane is mediated by its CRD, but the mechanism responsible for its reverse translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytosol has not been defined. Furthermore, very little is known regarding the intracellular distribution of PKD in cells stimulated by neuropeptide agonists that act through GPCRs to induce Gαq-mediated activation of phospholipase C.In the present study, we examined the temporal and spatial distribution of PKD using real-time visualization of fluorescence-tagged PKD in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and MDCK epithelial cells stimulated with bombesin, an agonist that activates PKD through a well characterized Gq-coupled heptahelical receptor (32Yuan J. Slice L. Walsh J.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2157-2164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We found that bombesin induces a striking and transient PKD translocation to the plasma membrane of fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that the intracellular redistribution of PKD in response to bombesin stimulation can be separated in two distinct mechanistic steps. The first step corresponds to the CRD-mediated plasma membrane translocation of PKD, whereas the second one corresponds to its rapid reverse translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. This last step requires the catalytic domain of PKD and PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser744 and Ser748 within the activation loop of PKD. Thus, PKC is not only required for the phosphorylation of PKD at the activation loop Ser744 and Ser748 (see Ref. 51Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) but also promotes the rapid reverse translocation of PKD. These findings provide evidence for a novel mechanism coordinating the translocation and activation of PKD in response to bombesin-induced GPCR activation in fibroblasts and epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we used real-time visualization as well as biochemical fractionation of GFP-PKD chimeras to demonstrate that agonist activation of the bombesin GPCR induces a redistribution of PKD to the plasma membrane of fibroblast and epithelial cells. PKD reverse translocated from to the plasma membrane to the cytosol within minutes of bombesin stimulation. In order to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in bombesin-induced PKD translocation, we analyzed the redistribution of a variety of PKD mutants. This analysis revealed that PKD translocation could be divided into at least two entirely different mechanistic steps: 1) PKD translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and 2) reverse translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytosol.The first step, bombesin-stimulated plasma membrane PKD translocation, is completely prevented by deletion of the CRD and severely impaired by a single amino acid substitution in the second cysteine-rich motif of the CRD (P287G), in agreement with results indicating that this motif is responsible for mediating DAG binding to PKD. Furthermore, a fusion protein consisting of GFP and the CRD of PKD rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane in response to bombesin stimulation in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. We conclude that the CRD is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the first phase of PKD translocation in response to GPCR activation. These results are consistent with previous findings using GFP-PKD in phorbol ester-stimulated COS-7 cells and antigen-stimulated T and B lymphocytes (20Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The mechanism(s) underlying the second step of PKD trafficking, namely PKD reverse translocation, has not been examined in previous studies. It is known that bombesin binding to its cognate GPCR promotes Gαq-mediated activation of β isoforms of phospholipase C to produce the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG, which can also be generated by other routes (4Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar, 6Mikoshiba K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although some reports indicated that DAG accumulation can be sustained for 30 min in Swiss 3T3 cell stimulated with bombesin (43Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it is generally thought that DAG accumulation is transient as a consequence of rapid DAG turnover in the cell. Thus, a simple model to explain the reverse translocation of PKD is that the plasma membrane pool of DAG, which binds the CRD of PKD, is removed thus enabling the return of PKD to the cytosol.Several lines of evidence produced in this study indicate that this model is not sufficient to explain the rapid reverse translocation of PKD. For example, a fusion protein of GFP and PKD lacking its catalytic domain translocated efficiently to the plasma membrane in response to bombesin but did not return to the cytosol with the same kinetics as GFP-PKD. Furthermore, a fusion protein of GFP with the CRD of PKD (GFP-PKD-CRD), which can be regarded as a DAG fluorescent label indicator (44Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), moved to the plasma membrane after bombesin stimulation but only returned to the cytosol 25–30 min later than GFP-PKD. These findings indicated, for the first time, that the rapid reverse translocation of PKD to the cytosol required its catalytic domain.We produced two independent lines of evidence to support the notion that the rapid reverse translocation of PKD is coupled to PKC-mediated PKD activation. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of PKC or mutation to alanine of Ser744 and Ser748, which are located in the activation loop of PKD, strikingly retarded the reverse translocation of fluorescence-tagged PKD after bombesin stimulation in both Swiss 3T3 and MDCK cells. The results presented in the accompanying paper (51Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) demonstrate that bombesin induces rapid phosphorylation of Ser744 and Ser748 in both Swiss 3T3 fibroblast and MDCK epithelial cells, as indicated by using novel antibodies directed against the phosphorylated state of these residues. We conclude that PKCs not only play a critical role in PKD activation but also are required to trigger the rapid reverse translocation of PKD.Recent studies demonstrated that translocation of AplysiaPKC as well as vertebrate PKCβII is regulated by autophosphorylation (40Feng X.

Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28944-28949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although these studies also concluded that phosphorylation promotes plasma membrane dissociation of these kinases, there are important differences between our results with PKD and these findings with PKCs. Although PKC autophosphorylation is thought to occur during protein maturation (46Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), PKD phosphorylation is acutely induced through a PKC-dependent pathway (1Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T.

Furthermore, phosphorylation-mediated plasma membrane dissociation of PKCs has been proposed to act as a feedback mechanism that leads to signal termination (40Feng X. Becker K.P. Stribling S.D. Peters K.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17024-17034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas PKD phosphorylation leads to its activation (26Iglesias T.

It is conceivable that the plasma membrane translocation and simultaneous activation of PKD play a role in the regulation of the above mentioned proteins or another unknown targets. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the translocation of PKD to the plasma membrane is required for PKC-mediated phosphorylation at the activation loop (as demonstrated in the accompanying article (Ref. 51Waldron R.T.

In all these cases, the activity of PKD is not longer dependent on membrane-delimited second messengers; therefore, PKD can be active in the cytosol. Indeed, our own results indicate that GFP-PKD remains active long after it returned to the cytosol in bombesin-stimulated fibroblasts and epithelial cells (see Fig.1 B). An attractive hypothesis is that PKCs coordinate PKD activation with rapid reverse translocation thus providing a novel mechanism that ensures that activated PKD moves efficiently away from the plasma membrane into the interior of the cell where it propagates DAG-PKC signals initiated at the cell surface.

Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DAG-regulated PKC isoforms all bind phorbol esters and are major cellular targets for this class of tumor promoter (11Nishizuka Y. Cancer. 1989; 63: 1892-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It is increasingly recognized that each isoform has specific functionsin vivo and that the biological activity of individual PKC isoforms is intimately regulated by their subcellular localization (12Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 103: 181-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which PKC-mediated signals in the plasma membrane are propagated to critical downstream cytosolic targets remain largely undefined. Protein kinase D (PKD)/protein kinase Cµ is a serine/threonine protein kinase with structural, enzymological, and regulatory properties different from other PKC family members (13Valverde A.M.

Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most salient features of PKD structure include the presence of a catalytic domain distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that regulates its enzymatic activity, and a highly hydrophobic stretch of amino acids in its N-terminal region (15Rozengurt E.

The N-terminal region also contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) comprising a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich, zinc finger-like motifs, which confers high affinity binding to phorbol esters and plays a negative role in the regulation of catalytic activity of PKD (13Valverde A.M.

We have recently reported that Akt negatively regulates B-Raf kinase activation by phosphorylating multiple residues within its amino-terminal regulatory domain. Here we investigated the regulation of B-Raf byserum and glucocorticoid-induciblekinase, SGK, which shares close sequence identity with the catalytic domain of Akt but lacks the pleckstrin homology domain. We observed that SGK inhibits B-Raf activity. A comparison of substrate specificity between SGK and Akt indicates that SGK is a potent negative regulator of B-Raf. In contrast to Akt, SGK negatively regulates B-Raf kinase activity by phosphorylating only a single Akt consensus site, Ser364. Under similar experimental conditions, SGK displays a measurably stronger inhibitory effect on B-Raf kinase activity than Akt, whereas Akt exhibits a more inhibitory effect on the forkhead transcription factor, FKHR. The selective substrate specificity is correlated with an enhanced association between Akt or SGK and their preferred substrates, FKHR and B-Raf, respectively. These results indicate that B-Raf kinase activity is negatively regulated by Akt and SGK, suggesting that the cross-talk between the B-Raf and other signaling pathways can be mediated by both Akt and SGK.

The Raf protein kinase plays an essential role in transmitting signals from Ras-GTP to activation of MEK (also known as MAP kinase kinase) and MAP kinase. Activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in the modulation of a wide variety of cellular responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and development (1English J.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The Ras-MAP kinase pathway is therefore subject to tight regulation in response to a combination of extracellular stimuli. Cross-talk between different signaling pathways is likely to be a critical mechanism for the proper regulation of this multifunctional pathway (5Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351 Pt 2: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 6Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar).All MAP kinase modules consist of three kinases acting in a sequence and are conserved during evolution. The regulation of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade has been studied extensively and is one of the best understood MAP kinase cascades (7Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar, 8Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). MEK directly phosphorylates ERK on a conserved TXY motif between the kinase subdomain VII and VIII and activates ERK (9Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Similarly, Raf directly phosphorylates MEK on two serine residues between kinase subdomain VII and VIII and activates MEK (10Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 11Resing K.A. Mansour S.J. Hermann A.S. Johnson R.S. Candia J.M. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G.

However, the regulation of Raf is much more complex and not fully understood.Three isoforms of Raf proteins have been found in the human genome: A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf (also known as Raf-1) (13Magnuson N.S. Beck T. Vahidi H. Hahn H. Smola U. Rapp U.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar). Both B-Raf and C-Raf have been implicated in phosphorylating and activating MEK, but the function of A-Raf has been less documented. Structurally, Raf kinases contain three conserved regions: CR1, CR2, and CR3 (14Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The CR1 region consists of a Ras binding domain and a cysteine-rich domain, both of which bind Ras and are important for Raf activation by Ras (15Gorman C. Skinner R.H. Skelly J.V. Neidle S. Lowe P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6713-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R.M. Campbell S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The CR2 region is rich in serine and threonine residues, and multiple phosphorylation sites within this region are responsible for Raf kinase activation (4Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The CR3 region is the kinase catalytic domain, and phosphorylation of residues within this region also responsible for Raf activation (4Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Deletion of the amino-terminal regulatory domains of Raf results in activation of Raf kinase activity, suggesting that the amino-terminal domain of Raf inhibits its kinase activity (19Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In fact, viral oncogenic Raf was originally isolated as an oncogene, which lacks the amino-terminal regulatory domain (20Jansen H.W. Lurz R. Bister K. Bonner T.I. Mark G.E. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1984; 307: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Raf activation by Ras is a feature conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and mammals. The interaction between Raf and active Ras is common for all Raf family kinases, and although Ras-Raf binding is necessary, it is not sufficient for Raf activation (21Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 22Stokoe D. McCormick F.

Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Studies performed with C-Raf have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser338 and Tyr341 are essential for Raf activation by Ras, growth factor, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (25Barnard D. Diaz B. Clawson D. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Using phosphospecific antibodies, Mason et al. (27Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) have shown that Ras induces predominantly Ser338 phosphorylation, whereas Src mainly stimulates Tyr341 phosphorylation. Synergistic activation of Raf was observed when both sites were phosphorylated. Recently, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Thr598 and Ser601 in B-Raf, which correspond to Thr491 and Ser494 of C-Raf, are essential for B-Raf activation (28Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these two sites is stimulated by active Ras. Simultaneous substitutions of Thr598 and Ser601by acidic residues result in a significant elevation of B-Raf activity. Interestingly, Thr598 and Ser601 of B-Raf are conserved in all Raf family kinases and are likely to be common phosphorylation sites for Raf activation (51Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).Raf kinase activity is also negatively regulated by phosphorylation. PKA phosphorylates Ser43 of C-Raf and inhibits its activity (29Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 30Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R.

Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Recently, Akt has been reported to phosphorylate Ser259, which also inhibits C-Raf kinase activity (33Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). We have shown that B-Raf kinase activity is inhibited by Akt through multiple sites within the CR2 region (34Guan K.L. Figueroa C. Brtva T.R. Zhu T. Taylor J. Barber T.D. Vojtek A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27354-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) leads to an increase in production of phosphoinositol phosphate second messages (35Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). These lipid messages regulate the activity and localization of a number of target proteins, including those containing pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. Akt, a Ser/Thr kinase, also known as protein kinase B, was identified as a viral transforming oncogene and plays an important role in promoting cell survival (36Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Akt contains a PH domain and is a major downstream target of PI3K. Akt is phosphorylated and activated by phospholipid-dependent kinase (PDK) (37Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,38Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), which is regulated by the phosphoinositol phosphate lipid messages. Several Akt targets have been identified, including GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase-3) and p70S6 kinase, transcription factor FKHR, proteins associated with apoptosis, and Raf kinase (36Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). The serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK), a novel member of the serine/threonine protein kinase gene family, shares significant sequence identity with Akt (39Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Several groups have reported that SGK could also be activated by the PI3K pathway (40Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 41Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). PDK1 is likely to directly phosphorylate and enhance SGK activity (41Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 42Prasad N. Topping R.S. Zhou D. Decker S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6929-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, physiological targets of SGK are largely unknown. Recently, Brunetet al. (43Brunet A. Park J. Tran H. Hu L.S. Hemmings B.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 952-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) reported that SGK could phosphorylate and inhibit the FKHRL1 transcription factor. Interestingly, SGK and Akt selectively phosphorylate different residues in FKHRL1, demonstrating that Akt and SGK coordinately regulate the function of FKHRL1 by phosphorylating this transcription factor on distinct sites.We investigated the role of SGK in B-Raf regulation. Our results demonstrated that SGK is potent in the phosphorylation and inactivation of B-Raf. A preferential association of SGK and B-Raf supports the effect of SGK on inhibition of B-Raf. SGK inhibits B-Raf mainly through phosphorylation of Ser364. Under similar experimental conditions, Akt displayed less ability to inhibit B-Raf. In contrast, Akt appears more effective in phosphorylating and inhibiting the FKHR transcription factor than SGK. This report demonstrates that SGK plays an important role in the negative regulation of Raf.DISCUSSIONRecently Akt has been implicated in negative regulation of B-Raf and C-Raf (33Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 34Guan K.L. Figueroa C. Brtva T.R. Zhu T. Taylor J. Barber T.D. Vojtek A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27354-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Akt is reported to phosphorylate the CR2 region and inhibit Raf activity. SGK belongs to a new family of protein kinases that is closely related to Akt (39Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). SGK recognizes the RXRXX(S/T) consensus sequence (40Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 41Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The biological function of SGK is not clear, partly because few physiological substrates of SGK have been identified. Our results demonstrate that B-Raf is a potential substrate of SGK. Active SGK mutant effectively inhibits B-Raf activation in response to serum or Ras by phosphorylation of Ser364. Mutation of Ser364 by alanine renders B-Raf resistant to inhibition by SGK, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser364 is responsible for the inhibition of B-Raf activity. In contrast, mutation of other Akt consensus sites, Ser428 and Thr439, has no effect on the ability of B-Raf to be inhibited by SGK. In contrast to Akt, SGK can phosphorylate serine phosphoacceptor sites that do not have a bulky hydrophobic amino acid residue immediately carboxyl-terminal to the phosphoacceptor residue (40Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The sequence surrounding Ser364 matches preferred SGK phosphorylation sites, including an alanine at position 365 in B-Raf.The relative specificity of SGK toward B-Raf is visible when compared with Akt and FKHR. SGK is more potent in B-Raf inhibition, whereas Akt is more effective in FKHR inhibition. Protein-protein interaction data are consistent with the inhibition results and further support the observation that B-Raf is a preferred substrate of SGK. The differential association between SGK and Raf likely contributes to the substrate selectivity of SGK toward B-Raf. Taken together, our data strongly indicate that SGK plays an important role in Raf regulation. Future quantitative analyses of phosphorylation and detailed kinetic studies are required for the further understanding of the relative substrate specificity of AKT and SGK.Akt and SGK are similarly activated by PDK1 and modulated by the PI3K pathway (40Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 41Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Despite the similarity in the kinase domains of SGK and Akt, there are key differences between the two kinases. Most notably, SGK does not have the PH domain, which is present in the amino-terminal region of Akt. The two kinases recognize similar but not identical consensus sites in peptide substrates. Akt phosphorylates B-Raf presumably on both Ser364 and Ser428, whereas SGK likely phosphorylates on Ser346, indicating that the two kinases have overlapping but not identical recognition sites in B-Raf. Similar observation has been made in FKHRL1, a transcription factor closely related to FKHR. SGK displays a preference for Ser315 in FKHRL1, whereas Akt favors Ser253(43Brunet A. Park J. Tran H. Hu L.S. Hemmings B.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 952-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In addition, SGK is regulated at both transcriptional and post-translational levels (39Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 45Buse P. Tran S.H. Luther E. Phu P.T. Aponte G.W. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7253-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The expression of SGK is rapidly induced by a variety of stimuli including serum, steroid hormones, cytokines, and osmotic stress (39Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 46Bell L.M. Leong M.L. Kim B. Wang E. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Firestone G.L. J. Biol.

We propose that both SGK and Akt play roles in the negative regulation of Raf, with SGK being a more potent inhibitor. The fact that SGK is induced by serum and growth factors indicates that SGK may constitute a negative feedback loop to suppress constitutive activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK kinase cascade.Protein kinase A is known to phosphorylate and inhibit Raf activity. In C-Raf, PKA is reported to phosphorylate Ser43 and inhibit C-Raf activation (29Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 32Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). However, recent results dispute the role of Ser43 in regulation of C-Raf by PKA and indicate that Ser43 is not required for C-Raf inhibition by PKA (49Sidovar M.F. Kozlowski P. Lee J.W. Collins M.A. He Y. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28688-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ser43 is not conserved in B-Raf, and yet B-Raf is also negatively regulated by PKA. The effect of cAMP on B-Raf regulation is rather complex, because cAMP can also induce B-Raf activation in some cells such as PC12 (50Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of Raf inhibition by cAMP is not completely understood. Interestingly, SGK is activated by intracellular cAMP (48Perrotti N. He R.A. Phillips S.A. Haft C.R. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9406-9412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, SGK may mediate the inhibitory effects of cAMP on Raf activity. The regulation of SGK by cAMP could provide an important mechanism for cross-talk between signal transductions of the trimeric G-protein-coupled serpentine receptors and the Ras-coupled tyrosine kinase receptors.The SGK phosphorylation site Ser364 in B-Raf is conserved in C-Raf, Drosophila Raf, and the C. eleganslin-45 Raf. These conservations suggest that SGK will likely play a role in the negative regulation of all members of the Raf family kinases. We have observed that the corresponding sites in lin-45 Raf indeed play a negative role in lin-45 function in vivo. Substitution of the Akt/SGK recognition site by alanine results in an active lin-45 Raf and induces multi-vulvae phenotypes (51Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Interestingly, C. elegans contains a single SGK predicted by the genome sequence. The fact that SGK is regulated by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli provides a point of signal integration. Regulation of SGK at either the transcriptional or post-translational level represents a possible mechanism of cross-talk between other signaling pathways and the Raf-ERK pathway. Diverse extracellular stimuli activate the Ras-mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase pathway, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The Raf protein kinase plays an essential role in transmitting signals from Ras-GTP to activation of MEK (also known as MAP kinase kinase) and MAP kinase. Activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in the modulation of a wide variety of cellular responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and development (1English J.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The Ras-MAP kinase pathway is therefore subject to tight regulation in response to a combination of extracellular stimuli. Cross-talk between different signaling pathways is likely to be a critical mechanism for the proper regulation of this multifunctional pathway (5Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351 Pt 2: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 6Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). All MAP kinase modules consist of three kinases acting in a sequence and are conserved during evolution. The regulation of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade has been studied extensively and is one of the best understood MAP kinase cascades (7Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar, 8Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). MEK directly phosphorylates ERK on a conserved TXY motif between the kinase subdomain VII and VIII and activates ERK (9Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Similarly, Raf directly phosphorylates MEK on two serine residues between kinase subdomain VII and VIII and activates MEK (10Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 11Resing K.A. Mansour S.J. Hermann A.S. Johnson R.S. Candia J.M. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G.

However, the regulation of Raf is much more complex and not fully understood. Three isoforms of Raf proteins have been found in the human genome: A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf (also known as Raf-1) (13Magnuson N.S. Beck T. Vahidi H. Hahn H. Smola U. Rapp U.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar). Both B-Raf and C-Raf have been implicated in phosphorylating and activating MEK, but the function of A-Raf has been less documented. Structurally, Raf kinases contain three conserved regions: CR1, CR2, and CR3 (14Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The CR1 region consists of a Ras binding domain and a cysteine-rich domain, both of which bind Ras and are important for Raf activation by Ras (15Gorman C. Skinner R.H. Skelly J.V. Neidle S. Lowe P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6713-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R.M. Campbell S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The CR2 region is rich in serine and threonine residues, and multiple phosphorylation sites within this region are responsible for Raf kinase activation (4Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The CR3 region is the kinase catalytic domain, and phosphorylation of residues within this region also responsible for Raf activation (4Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Deletion of the amino-terminal regulatory domains of Raf results in activation of Raf kinase activity, suggesting that the amino-terminal domain of Raf inhibits its kinase activity (19Cutler Jr., R.E. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In fact, viral oncogenic Raf was originally isolated as an oncogene, which lacks the amino-terminal regulatory domain (20Jansen H.W. Lurz R. Bister K. Bonner T.I. Mark G.E. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1984; 307: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Raf activation by Ras is a feature conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and mammals. The interaction between Raf and active Ras is common for all Raf family kinases, and although Ras-Raf binding is necessary, it is not sufficient for Raf activation (21Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 22Stokoe D. McCormick F.

D-type cyclins act as cell cycle sensors of growth factor stimulation, and traverse of G1 depends on the activities of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes, which function in early and late G1, respectively (7Sherr C.J.

In general, growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells leading to proliferation results in up-regulation of cyclin D and down-regulation of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 (4Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 5Huang S. Ingber D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E131-E138Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 9Roovers K.

Subsequently, p21Cip1 levels decline in response to cell adhesion in which case proliferation occurs (11Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J.

Signaling through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway plays a key role in control of the cell cycle regulatory proteins. Onset of cell proliferation and up-regulation of cyclin D1 both require sustained activation of ERK (14Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol.

In addition, cells that are attached but lack isometric tension are unable to up-regulate cyclin D1 (17Bohmer R.M. Scharf E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The interplay between isometric tension and the ERK signaling pathway remains unclear, however, since absence of isometric tension has been reported to block activation of ERK in some reports (17Bohmer R.M.

Most studies on the regulation of cell proliferation have been carried out with cells in monolayer or suspension culture. We have been interested in cell proliferation in the three-dimensional extracellular matrix environment. Fibroblasts cultured within collagen matrices reorganize the matrix into a dense, tissue-like structure (22Elsdale T. Bard J. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 54: 626-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar), a culture system that has been used as an in vitro model of wound contraction (23Bell E. Ivarsson B. Merrill C. Proc. Natl.

Nature. 1981; 290: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Cells proliferate in attached matrices but become quiescent and apoptotic in floating or released matrices (25Fluck J.

The switch from proliferation to quiescence and apoptosis is a characteristic feature of fibroblasts at the end of cutaneous repair (28Desmoulière A. Gabbiani G. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 391-423Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that fibroblasts in floating or released collagen matrices lose the ability to signal normally through the ERK pathway (27Rosenfeldt H. Grinnell F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3088-3092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We speculated that decreased ERK signaling might account for cell quiescence in floating or released matrices. In addition, we suggested that quiescence and decreased ERK pathway signaling occurred because of the absence of isometric tension in cells in floating or released matrices. In the current report, we have tested these possibilities. To determine if decreased ERK pathway signaling could account for quiescence, we measured cell cycle regulatory proteins in fibroblasts in collagen matrices under proliferating conditions in attached matrices and compared these levels to those found in cells under quiescent conditions in floating or released matrices or in cells in attached matrices in the presence of the ERK pathway inhibitor UO126. In addition, to determine the possible role of isometric tension in quiescence and decreased ERK pathway signaling, we analyzed cell cycle regulatory proteins in fibroblasts in attached matrices in the presence of the actin cytoskeletal depolymerizing agent latrunculin B. We also tested the interrelated effects of UO126 and latrunculin B on actin cytoskeleton organization and signaling through the ERK pathway. Our findings support the idea that decreased signaling through the ERK pathway is responsible for cell quiescence in floating or released collagen matrices, but this decrease could not be accounted for by the loss of isometric tension.

The cell/collagen mixture containing 106 fibroblasts/ml and 1.5 mg/ml collagen in DMEM without serum was prewarmed to 37 °C for 3–4 min, after which aliquots (0.2 ml) were polymerized in Corning 24-well culture plates for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. After polymerization, 1.0 ml of DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid was added to each well. Floating matrices were gently released from the underlying culture dish with a spatula immediately after polymerization. Attached matrices were released at the times indicated in the figure legends. Culture medium was changed at 24-h intervals. Cells in collagen matrices were incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum DMEM containing 5 µCi/ml [3H]thymidine (specific activity 5 Ci/mmol) for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and then washed three times for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 6 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2). Subsequently, the cells were harvested from matrices (26Grinnell F. Zhu M. Carlson M.A. Abrams J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 608-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and DNA was precipitated by incubating the cells with 10% trichloroacetic acid in PBS containing 125 µg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20 min at 4 °C. Precipitates were collected on Whatman 2.5-cm glass microfiber filters, washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid and 5% trichloroacetic acid, and transferred to scintillation vials containing 10 ml of Budget Solve. Radioactivity was counted using a Beckman scintillation counter (LS 6000 SC). Radioactive counts were adjusted for equal cell numbers by measuring lactate dehydrogenase activity of an aliquot of the harvested cells with the lactate dehydrogenase diagnostic kit (Sigma). All experiments were carried out in duplicate, and each experiment was carried out at least two times. Data points and error bars in the figures represent averages and S.D. values. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (27Rosenfeldt H. Grinnell F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3088-3092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cells were extracted in extraction buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm Na2MoO4, pH 7.4) (50 µl/matrix and 1 ml/60-mm tissue culture dish) by homogenization (50 strokes) using a Dounce homogenizer (pestle B; Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ). Samples were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g (Beckman Microfuge), and the supernatants were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid (final volume 10%). Trichloroacetic acid pellets were washed in acetone and then dissolved in 4× reducing sample buffer (250 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 40% glycerol, 20% mercaptoethanol, 0.04% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Equal amounts of protein (between 10 and 50 µg and determined by Coomassie binding (Bio-Rad Protein Assay)) were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using 10% acrylamide minislab gels. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, samples for cyclin D1, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 analysis were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-cyclin D1 (1:500), anti-p21Cip1(1:200), and anti-p27Kip1 (1:1000), respectively. Samples for ERK analysis were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-active ERK1/2 (1:10,000) and anti-ERK2 (1:5000). Images were collected on film, scanned, and analyzed with NIH Image or reproduced using Adobe Photoshop 5.5. Collagen matrices were fixed for 30 min at 22 °C with 3% paraformaldehyde in DPBS (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2), washed for 2 × 10 min with DPBS, blocked for 30 min with DPBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 1% glycine, and then permeabilized for 10 min with DPBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with RITC-conjugated phalloidin (8 units/ml) for 30 min at room temperature followed by six washes with DPBS. After mounting the samples on glass slides with Fluoromount G, observations were made using a Nikon Elipse 400 Fluorescent Microscope, and digital images were collected using a Photometrics SenSys camera and MetaView. Fig.1 shows that cellular DNA synthesis (measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation) was low in fibroblasts in floating (F) compared with attached (A) collagen matrices and declined markedly when attached collagen matrices (A) were released (R). Fig.2 A shows that fibroblasts in attached collagen matrices developed bipolar morphology and contained prominent actin stress fibers, indicating the presence of isometric tension. Fig. 2 B, on the other hand, shows that cells in floating collagen matrices had rounded cell bodies with numerous fine processes and diffuse staining of the actin cytoskeleton, indicating an absence of isometric tension. After the release of attached collagen matrices, fibroblasts lost their actin stress fibers (not shown).Figure 2Actin cytoskeletal organization of fibroblasts in attached and floating collagen matrices.Fibroblasts were cultured for 24 h in attached (A) or floating (B) matrices, after which the cells were fixed and stained with RITC-phalloidin to show the distribution of actin.Bar, 50 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The above experiments confirmed that cell quiescence occurred in floating and released collagen matrices in which the cells lacked actin stress fibers although the cells were attached with projections extending into the matrix. Studies then were carried out to determine the levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins in fibroblasts in the collagen matrices. Fig.3 A shows typical results in which Western blotting was used to measure the levels of cyclin D1, p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and Cdk4. Fig. 3 Bshows data from three separate experiments averaged using Cdk4 levels to normalize the results. Cdk4 is typically used as a loading control in studies on cell cycle regulatory proteins because Cdk4 levels appear to be the same in proliferating and quiescent cells (29Zhu X. Roovers K. Davey G. Assoian R.K. Guan J.-L. Signaling Through Cell Adhesion Molecules. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1999: 129-140Google Scholar). A similar pattern of differences was detected regardless whether the cells were switched from attached to released matrices or cultured in floating matrices. In either case, compared with proliferating cells, fibroblasts that became quiescent in the collagen matrices had lower levels of cyclin D1 and p21Cip1 and increased levels of p27Kip1. The above results demonstrated that quiescence of fibroblasts in released or floating collagen matrices was accompanied by down-regulation of cyclin D1 and p21Cip1 and up-regulation of p27Kip1. If cell quiescence in floating or released matrices depended upon decreased signaling through the ERK pathway, then we predicted that a pharmacologic block of signaling through the ERK pathway in cells in attached matrices should result in cell quiescence and changes in the levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins similar to those in released or floating matrices. To test this prediction, we measured the effects on cell proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins following 24-h treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor U0126 to block the ERK pathway (30Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that proliferating fibroblasts in attached collagen matrices became quiescent after 24 h in the presence of U0126 (+UO). Inhibition was completely reversible, and DNA synthesis returned to normal levels after a 24-h wash-out period. Fig. 5 A shows typical results of experiments to determine the levels of cyclin D1, p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and Cdk4 in control and treated cells. Fig. 5 B shows data from four separate experiments averaged and normalized to Cdk4 levels. Treatment of cells with U0126 to block the ERK signaling pathway resulted in down-regulation of cyclin D1 and up-regulation of p27Kip1similar to fibroblasts in floating or released collagen matrices. These findings were consistent with the idea that cell quiescence in floating or released matrices depended upon decreased signaling through the ERK pathway. If loss of signaling through the ERK pathway resulted from the absence of isometric tension, then disruption of stress fibers by depolymerizing the actin cytoskeleton should have similar consequences for cell cycle regulatory proteins as culturing cells in released or floating matrices. Therefore, we measured the effects on cell proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins following 24-h treatment with latrunculin B to depolymerize the actin cytoskeleton (31Spector I. Shochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). As an additional control, we also tested the consequences of serum deprivation, which was expected to result in cell quiescence without affecting isometric tension. Fig. 4 shows that proliferating fibroblasts in attached collagen matrices also became quiescent after 24 h in serum-free medium (−Ser) or in the presence of latrunculin B (+LB), and these effects also were reversible. Cytochalasin D treatment to disrupt actin stress fibers also was tested, since most research on the role of isometric tension in cell proliferation in monolayer culture has utilized cytochalasin D. While proliferation of cells in collagen matrices was blocked by cytochalasin D, the effect was only partly reversible (not shown) and therefore not studied further. Fig. 5, A and B, show that treatment of cells with latrunculin B caused down-regulation of cyclin D1, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1. Serum withdrawal, on the other hand, had no effect on cyclin D1 or p27Kip1, although a decrease in p21Cip1 was observed. Given the different profiles of cell cycle regulatory proteins in cells in released or floating matrices or after inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway compared with depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton or serum withdrawal, it appeared that fibroblast quiescence caused by the latter two conditions depended on different mechanisms than those involved in cells in released or floating matrices or cells in attached matrices with blocked ERK pathway signaling. The above findings were consistent with the possibility that decreased ERK pathway signaling was responsible for cell quiescence in floating or released collagen matrices. On the other hand, our findings did not support the idea that decreased ERK pathway signaling depended on the absence of stress fibers. To examine further possible interrelationships between these conditions, we tested the effects of the conditions leading to cell quiescence (serum deprivation, blocking ERK pathway signaling, and actin cytoskeleton depolymerization) on actin cytoskeletal organization and ERK pathway signaling. ERK pathway signaling was stimulated using PDGF. Fig. 6 shows that neither serum deprivation (Fig. 6 B) nor the addition of U0126 (Fig.6 C) had a detectable effect on cell shape or actin stress fibers, which were reversibly disrupted by latrunculin B (Fig. 6,D and E). Conversely, Fig.7 shows that neither serum deprivation nor latrunculin B blocked ERK activation after PDGF stimulation, which was completely prevented by U0126. In addition, as shown in Fig.8, the time course of ERK activation of fibroblasts in attached matrices following PDGF stimulation was similar in the presence or absence of latrunculin B but markedly decreased in cells in released matrices. Taken together, these findings provided additional evidence that cell quiescence caused by decreased ERK pathway signaling, actin stress fiber disruption, and serum deprivation occurred independently of each other.Figure 7Levels of ERK and phospho-ERK in fibroblasts in attached collagen matrices subjected to serum deprivation or treatment with UO126 or latrunculin B. Fibroblasts were cultured in attached collagen gels for 24 h and then for 24 h in control medium (Con), serum-free medium (−Ser), or control medium containing 100 µm UO126 (UO) or 1 µm latrunculin B as indicated.

Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 391-423Google Scholar). Previously, we proposed that the mechanism accounting for cell quiescence in floating or released matrices depended upon decreased signaling through the ERK pathway (27Rosenfeldt H. Grinnell F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3088-3092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We also suggested that this decrease resulted from the absence of isometric tension in the cells, since cells in floating or released matrices lacked actin stress fibers, which were prominent in cells in attached matrices. The present findings support the idea that decreased signaling through the ERK pathway is responsible for cell quiescence in floating or released collagen matrices, but this decrease could not be accounted for by the loss of isometric tension. Consistent with earlier studies, we found that fibroblasts in attached collagen matrices proliferated, whereas the cells in floating or released collagen matrices became quiescent. Also, fibroblasts in attached matrices had prominent actin stress fibers, indicating that they were under isometric tension, whereas stress fibers were absent from fibroblasts in floating or released matrices. Compared with proliferating fibroblasts in attached matrices, cells in floating matrices had lower levels of cyclin D1 and p21Cip1 and elevated levels of p27Kip1. Similar changes in the levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins occurred after attached matrices were released. Down-regulation of cyclin D1 and up-regulation of p27Kip1probably contribute to cell cycle arrest and quiescence of fibroblasts in floating or released collagen matrices based on monolayer culture studies (4Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 5Huang S. Ingber D.E. Nat.

Sonnenberg A. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1413-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). While cell contact with fibrillar collagen itself was reported to cause an increase in p27Kip1 (32Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar,33Henriet P. Zhong Z.D. Brooks P.C. Weinberg K.I. DeClerck Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10026-10031Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the cells in those previous studies were spread poorly. As a result, altered cell spreading rather than interaction with fibrillar collagen could have been responsible for the increased levels of p27Kip1. The observation of higher levels of p21Cip1 in fibroblasts in attached compared with floating or released collagen matrices suggests that p21Cip1 does not contribute to cell cycle arrest under the latter conditions. In monolayer culture, the level of p21Cip1 has been shown to be regulated by the timing of growth factor stimulation and cell adhesion; i.e. quiescent cells begin with low levels of p21Cip1, which increase in response to growth factor stimulation and then decrease in response to cell adhesion and integrin engagement through a Rho-dependent mechanism (10Danen E.H. Sonneveld P. Sonnenberg A. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1413-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the absence of integrin engagement, such as with cells in suspension, down-regulation of p21 does not occur, and the cells are unable to enter the cell cycle (11Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 13Bottazzi M.E. Zhu X. Bohmer R.M. Assoian R.K. J.

If p21Cip1 had contributed to cell cycle arrest in floating or released collagen matrices, then we would have expected to observe an increase in p21Cip1 levels compared with cells in attached matrices. Why p21Cip1 is actually higher in fibroblasts in attached compared with floating or released collagen matrices remains to be determined but might relate to the pattern of integrin occupancy in collagen matrices; i.e. integrin α2β1 is required for matrix contraction by cells (34Gullberg D. Tingström A. Thuresson A.C. Olsson L. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Rubin K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 35Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C.

Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 38Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). When fibroblasts in attached collagen matrices were serum-deprived or treated to block signaling through the ERK pathway or depolymerize the actin cytoskeleton, cellular DNA synthesis was reversibly inhibited. Blocking ERK pathway signaling led to a decrease in cyclin D1 and increase in p27Kip1 similar to that which occurred in floating or released matrices. An increase in p27Kip1caused by blocked ERK pathway signaling is consistent with previous studies implicating ERK in the regulation of p27Kip1(39Rivard N. Boucher M.J. Asselin C. L'Allemain G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C652-C664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depolymerizing the actin cytoskeleton, on the other hand, resulted in decreased levels of both p27Kip1 and cyclin D1. Our results differ from those reported for endothelial cells in monolayer culture in which treatment with cytochalasin resulted in an increase in p27Kip1 (18Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The explanation for this is unknown and could relate to the culture conditions, cell type, or actin cytoskeleton disrupting agents used. Taken together, the foregoing findings support the idea that cell quiescence in floating or released matrices depended upon decreased signaling through the ERK pathway but argued against our previous idea that the absence of isometric tension in cells in floating or released matrices accounted for the changes in the ERK signaling pathway and cell proliferation. The latter point was tested directly in the experiments showing the independence of the ERK signaling pathway in relation to actin stress fibers in fibroblasts in attached collagen matrices; i.e. blocking ERK pathway signaling had no effect on the actin cytoskeleton, and depolymerizing the actin cytoskeleton had no effect on ERK pathway signaling. Down-regulation of cyclin D by depolymerizing the actin cytoskeleton may depend on the ERK-independent mechanism that utilizes the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway (40Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 41Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29864-29872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The observation that loss of actin stress fibers could not account for differences in ERK signaling and cell cycle regulatory proteins in fibroblasts in released or floating versus attached collagen matrices was unexpected given the importance of isometric tension for regulation of proliferation of cells in monolayer culture (42Ingber D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 43Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4216) Google Scholar). Tension often is a reflection of cell geometry, and tension and geometry varied differently in cells in floating or released collagen matrices compared with cells in attached matrices after actin cytoskeletal depolymerization. In either case, actin stress fibers were absent, but cells in floating or released matrices were rounded with thin extensions, whereas cells in attached matrices treated with latrunculin B retained their elongated, bipolar shape. The mechanism that accounts for decreased ERK pathway signaling in released or floating matrices presents an important problem for future investigation. A variety of mechanisms are possible including physical disorganization of signaling scaffolds (44Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 45Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) or changes in cell surface signaling centers such as caveolae (46Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.G. Anderson R.G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Finally, it is important to note the novel observation that serum deprivation caused proliferating cells to become quiescent without affecting cellular levels of cyclin D1. This was surprising, since cells in monolayer culture show a close linkage between the presence of serum and cyclin D expression (7Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). Presumably, quiescence here is regulated by signaling pathways parallel to cyclin D1 (4Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). The difference in response to serum deprivation emphasizes that cell regulation in monolayer culture and the three-dimensional matrix environment differ in some respects. An attractive hypothesis for future study is that growth factor binding to the matrix occurs (50Somasundaram R. Schuppan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26884-26891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and serves as a reservoir to stimulate cells even after removal of serum, which would not be possible in monolayer culture. In summary, our studies suggest that down-regulation of cyclin D1 and up-regulation of p27Kip1 are key regulatory events linked to mechanical unloading of fibroblasts in released or floating collagen matrices. The findings support the idea that decreased signaling through the ERK pathway is responsible for cell quiescence in floating or released collagen matrices, but this decrease could not be accounted for by the loss of isometric tension.

Thus, proteolyses of the polyprotein precursors are essential events in the regulation of the replication and morphogenesis of these RNA viruses. In picornaviruses and flaviviruses, the entire RNA genome is translated as a single polyprotein, from which the structural and nonstructural proteins are processed by proteolysis. In picornavirus-infected cells, the processing is carried out by virus-encoded proteases within the polyprotein, whereas the processing of flavivirus polyprotein is assisted by host proteases (1Ryan D.M.

Cysteine 481 and histidine 558 were identified as essential residues for the autoprotease activity (12Strauss E.G. de Groot R.J. Levinson R. Strauss J.H. Virology. 1992; 191: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), supporting the view that the protease is a thiol proteinase belonging to the papain superfamily. The same conclusion was reached by sequence comparisons (13Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.-C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The respective mutation of Cys-478 in SFV nsP2 also inactivates the autocatalytic processing of P1234, P123, and P23 (14Merits A. Vasiljeva L. Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Auvinen P. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).The amino-terminal domain of SFV nsP2 (residues 1–470) has been shown to house several enzymatic activities including RNA triphosphatase (15Vasiljeva L. Merits A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17281-17287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), nucleoside triphosphatase (16Rikkonen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5804-5810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and RNA helicase (17Gomez de Cedrón M. Ehsani N. Mikkola M.L. Garcı́a J.A. Kääriäinen L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a significant amount of nsP2, synthesized during infection, is transported into the nucleus (18Peränen J. Rikkonen M. Liljeström P. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Peränen J. Rikkonen M. Kääriäinen L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The core of the nuclear localization signal was mapped to a short sequence P647RRR (20Rikkonen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1992; 189: 462-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). nsP2 mutant PRDR is not lethal for the virus in cell culture, but SFV carrying this mutation is apathogenic for mouse (21Rikkonen M. Virology. 1996; 218: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, the carboxyl-terminal domain of SFV nsP2 has been implicated in the regulation of the synthesis of the subgenomic mRNA (22Keränen S. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1979; 47: 505-515Crossref Google Scholar, 23Sawicki D.L. Sawicki S.G. Virology. 1985; 144: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Suopanki J. Sawicki D.L. Sawicki S.G. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Taken together, these data suggest that alphavirus nsP2 consists of two structurally independent domains, each possessing a distinct set of biological activities. However, direct proof that purified nsP2 or its carboxyl-terminal part has protease activity has been lacking. To this end, recombinant nsP2 and a set of its amino-terminally truncated variants were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by metal-chelate chromatography, and assayed for the presence of protease activity. Both full-length nsP2 and its soluble carboxyl-terminal fragment Pro39 (aa 458–799) catalyzed site-specific proteolysis of SFV P1234 in vitro. Furthermore, both nsP2 and Pro39 could specifically cleave purified recombinant fusion proteins containing short (∼40 aa) SFV-specific peptides, which span protease cleavage sites. Using this newly devised in vitro assay, we show that Pro39 was inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide, in accordance with the catalytic mechanism of cysteine proteases.DISCUSSIONPrevious work on Semliki Forest virus showed that early in infection the synthesis of the negative strand RNA was strictly dependent on protein synthesis and ceased in about 15 min after addition of cycloheximide (31Sawicki D.L. Sawicki S.G. J. Virol. 1980; 34: 108-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas late in infection the synthesis of positive strand RNAs could continue for several hours in the absence of protein synthesis. Solution to this dilemma came from findings with Sindbis virus, another alphavirus, where the processing intermediate P123 of the nonstructural polyprotein together with nsP4 was shown to be responsible for the synthesis of the negative strand RNA (32Lemm J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lemm J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1916-1926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Shirako Y. Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1874-1885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of P123 is essential for the synthesis of the positive RNA strands. Thus, the regulated processing of the nonstructural polyprotein controls the early events of virus infection. An overactive processing mutant of Sindbis virus nsP2 (N614D) cannot replicate, as the P123 intermediate is too short-lived to enable the necessary synthesis of the complementary RNA (35Lemm J.A. Rümenapf T. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).Our knowledge of the processing of alphavirus nonstructural polyprotein(s) is based mostly on experiments of in vitrotranslation of Sindbis virus RNA. Ingenious constructions by which the cleavage sites were mutated alone and in different combinations, together with constructs coding for enzymatically inactive polyprotein as substrates, have been used to analyze this complex process (4Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Semin. Virol. 1990; 1: 347-356Google Scholar,9ten Dam E. Flint M. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that the polyprotein P1234 itself and all its cleavage intermediates containing nsP2 to be active proteases. The cleavability of the different sites varied and was dependent on the order of removal of different nsPs from the polyprotein substrate. Particularly interesting was the finding where the cleavage of site 2/3 in P1234 or P123 was only possible after the cleavage of nsP1 (36Shirako Y. Strauss J.H. Virology. 1990; 177: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Evidently, conformational changes in P1234 and its cleavage products affect the interactions between the cleavage sites and the protease domain of nsP2 in a complex manner. To understand the processes better, we have characterized purified SFV nsP2 and its carboxyl-terminal fragment Pro39 as proteolytic enzymes. As substrates we used in vitro synthesized polyproteins P1234, P123, P23 and P34, as well as recombinant thioredoxin fusion proteins, which contain short SFV-specific fragments, spanning the polyprotein processing sites 1/2, 2/3, and 3/4.We show for the first time that purified nsP2 has proteolytic activity, which cleaves readily the 3/4 site of P1234 and P34. Deletion series of nsP2 resulted in a soluble, active carboxyl-terminal fragment consisting of amino acid residues 459–799, which was designated as Pro39. It was purified to near homogeneity by metal-affinity chromatography. The specificities of Pro39 and nsP2 were identical, indicating that the amino-terminal half of nsP2 does not affect the fidelity of the protease. According to sequence alignments with the thiol protease superfamily, Pro39 contains a conserved protease domain (459), but also almost 200 carboxyl-terminal extra amino acids (9ten Dam E. Flint M. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,13Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.-C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Our attempts to delete 40–120 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of nsP2 resulted in insoluble or inactive proteins (Fig. 1). Experiments with temperature-sensitive mutants of SIN and SFV nsP2 have shown that amino acid replacements N700K in SIN ts133, K736S in SIN ts24, and M781T in SFV ts4 result in inhibition of protease activity at 39 °C, suggesting that the extreme carboxyl terminus of nsP2 participates somehow in the protease function (24Suopanki J. Sawicki D.L. Sawicki S.G. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Establishment of a biochemical assay system consisting of isolated Pro39 and thioredoxin attached cleavage regions of the SFV nonstructural polyprotein allowed characterization of the viral protease under defined experimental conditions. Pro39 was inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide but not with pepstatin, EDTA, or PMSF. These are properties, which are in accordance with its classification as a thiol proteinase of the papain superfamily. However, Pro39 is not inhibited by E-64, which is a typical inhibitor of cysteine proteases (37Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989: 83-104Google Scholar). Sensitivity for NEM and resistance for E-64 have been previously reported for poliovirus 3C thiol proteinase (38Lawson M.A. Semler B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9919-9923Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 39Yu F.Sh. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1991; 182: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Another interesting feature of Pro39 is the inhibition by zinc ions (Fig.8).When Pro39 (or nsP2) was added to the reaction mixture, after in vitro translation of P12 or P123, almost a quantitative release of nsP1 was observed. Similarly, when P34 or P1234 were used as substrates, quantitative release of nsP4 was seen, whereas only a small amount of nsP3 was released from P23, P123, or P1234 (Fig. 3). These results suggested that sites 1/2 and 3/4 were exposed to the added protease, whereas site 2/3 was not. To study this phenomenon under controlled conditions, in which the large protein domains would not interfere sterically with the proteolysis, we constructed fusion proteins with a different number of amino acid residues around the cleavage sites.Constructs with less than 10 amino acids on both sides of the cleavage site were not digested by Pro39 or nsP2 (data not shown). We ended up using thioredoxin fusion proteins with about 40 residues of each cleavage region (Trx12, Trx23, and Trx34). Isolation of the cleavage products and their mass spectrometric analysis, as well as amino-terminal sequencing showed that Pro39 cleavage products were derived exactly from the predicted cleavage sites, determined previously by radiosequence analysis (29Kalkkinen N. Laaksonen M. Söderlund H. Jörnvall H. Virology. 1981; 113: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Kalkkinen N. Wittmann-Liebold B. Salnikow J. Erdmann V.A. Advanced Methods in Protein Microsequence Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1986: 194-206Crossref Google Scholar) (Table II). As controls we used thioredoxin fusion proteins with mutations close to the cleavage site, which were not digested by Pro39 or nsP2 (Fig. 4). Thus, we conclude that both proteases recognize specifically the three cleavage sites of the SFV nonstructural polyprotein. However, there were large differences in the sensitivity of the different cleavage sites, the 3/4 junction being most sensitive. Roughly 5000-fold more Pro39 was needed for complete cleavage of site 1/2 (Fig. 5). Under the same conditions, only a small amount of Trx23 was cleaved.The different sensitivities of the three cleavage sites may well reflect the different specificities of the protease associated with the polyproteins, in which the cleavage at site 2/3 of P123 or P1234 does not take place unless preceded by cleavage of nsP1. The fact that Pro39 can catalyze cleavage at 1/2 site of in vitro translated SFV P12, P123, and P1234, which normally undergoes cleavage incis (14Merits A. Vasiljeva L. Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Auvinen P. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), is better understood when realized that the estimated molar enzyme to substrate ratio represents an excess of 50 to 1, which is difficult to imagine to take place during virus infection. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that cleavages at sites 1/2 and 2/3 require cofactor(s), which might be derived from the other nsPs. Such a situation has been characterized thoroughly for the NS3 protease of hepatitis C virus. The site-specific proteolytic activity of NS3 protease was greatly increased by a short amino acid sequence of NS4 protein adjacently located in the polyprotein (40Failla C. Tomei L. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3753-3760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lin C. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7622-7626Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 43Love R.A. Parge H.E.

The released nsP2 exercises its role in two different forms. As a part of the RNA polymerase complex (45Kujala P. Ikäheimonen A. Ehsani N. Vihinen H. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3873-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the amino-terminal domain provides RNA triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities (15Vasiljeva L. Merits A. Auvinen P.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As “soluble nsP2,” the carboxyl-terminal domain acts as a regulator of 26 S RNA synthesis (24Suopanki J. Sawicki D.L. Sawicki S.G. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and as atrans-acting protease, which catalyzes the rapid cleavage of P1234 and P123, thus preventing the negative strand RNA synthesis late in infection. The genomes of many positive strand RNA viruses are expressed as polyproteins in order to achieve the expression of multiple proteins from a single message, unlike the mRNAs of their eukaryotic host cells, which mostly code for single proteins. Thus, proteolyses of the polyprotein precursors are essential events in the regulation of the replication and morphogenesis of these RNA viruses. In picornaviruses and flaviviruses, the entire RNA genome is translated as a single polyprotein, from which the structural and nonstructural proteins are processed by proteolysis. In picornavirus-infected cells, the processing is carried out by virus-encoded proteases within the polyprotein, whereas the processing of flavivirus polyprotein is assisted by host proteases (1Ryan D.M. Flint M. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 699-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2Ryan D.M. Monaghan S. Flint M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 947-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The large RNA genomes of coronaviruses (approximately 30 kilobases) and arteriviruses (12.7–15.7 kilobases), together classified as Nidovirales, use in addition to the polyprotein strategy also a set of subgenomic mRNAs (3Ziebuhr J. Snijder J.E. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Alphaviruses and rubella virus, members of the Togaviridae family, express two polyproteins. The nonstructural polyprotein is expressed directly from the RNA genome, whereas the structural polyprotein is synthesized from a subgenomic mRNA (4Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol.

Thus, the regulated processing of the nonstructural polyprotein controls the early events of virus infection. An overactive processing mutant of Sindbis virus nsP2 (N614D) cannot replicate, as the P123 intermediate is too short-lived to enable the necessary synthesis of the complementary RNA (35Lemm J.A.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Our attempts to delete 40–120 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of nsP2 resulted in insoluble or inactive proteins (Fig. 1). Experiments with temperature-sensitive mutants of SIN and SFV nsP2 have shown that amino acid replacements N700K in SIN ts133, K736S in SIN ts24, and M781T in SFV ts4 result in inhibition of protease activity at 39 °C, suggesting that the extreme carboxyl terminus of nsP2 participates somehow in the protease function (24Suopanki J. Sawicki D.L. Sawicki S.G. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Establishment of a biochemical assay system consisting of isolated Pro39 and thioredoxin attached cleavage regions of the SFV nonstructural polyprotein allowed characterization of the viral protease under defined experimental conditions. Pro39 was inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide but not with pepstatin, EDTA, or PMSF. These are properties, which are in accordance with its classification as a thiol proteinase of the papain superfamily. However, Pro39 is not inhibited by E-64, which is a typical inhibitor of cysteine proteases (37Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989: 83-104Google Scholar). Sensitivity for NEM and resistance for E-64 have been previously reported for poliovirus 3C thiol proteinase (38Lawson M.A. Semler B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9919-9923Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 39Yu F.Sh. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1991; 182: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Another interesting feature of Pro39 is the inhibition by zinc ions (Fig.8).When Pro39 (or nsP2) was added to the reaction mixture, after in vitro translation of P12 or P123, almost a quantitative release of nsP1 was observed. Similarly, when P34 or P1234 were used as substrates, quantitative release of nsP4 was seen, whereas only a small amount of nsP3 was released from P23, P123, or P1234 (Fig. 3). These results suggested that sites 1/2 and 3/4 were exposed to the added protease, whereas site 2/3 was not. To study this phenomenon under controlled conditions, in which the large protein domains would not interfere sterically with the proteolysis, we constructed fusion proteins with a different number of amino acid residues around the cleavage sites.Constructs with less than 10 amino acids on both sides of the cleavage site were not digested by Pro39 or nsP2 (data not shown). We ended up using thioredoxin fusion proteins with about 40 residues of each cleavage region (Trx12, Trx23, and Trx34). Isolation of the cleavage products and their mass spectrometric analysis, as well as amino-terminal sequencing showed that Pro39 cleavage products were derived exactly from the predicted cleavage sites, determined previously by radiosequence analysis (29Kalkkinen N. Laaksonen M. Söderlund H. Jörnvall H. Virology. 1981; 113: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Kalkkinen N. Wittmann-Liebold B. Salnikow J. Erdmann V.A. Advanced Methods in Protein Microsequence Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1986: 194-206Crossref Google Scholar) (Table II). As controls we used thioredoxin fusion proteins with mutations close to the cleavage site, which were not digested by Pro39 or nsP2 (Fig. 4). Thus, we conclude that both proteases recognize specifically the three cleavage sites of the SFV nonstructural polyprotein. However, there were large differences in the sensitivity of the different cleavage sites, the 3/4 junction being most sensitive. Roughly 5000-fold more Pro39 was needed for complete cleavage of site 1/2 (Fig. 5). Under the same conditions, only a small amount of Trx23 was cleaved.The different sensitivities of the three cleavage sites may well reflect the different specificities of the protease associated with the polyproteins, in which the cleavage at site 2/3 of P123 or P1234 does not take place unless preceded by cleavage of nsP1. The fact that Pro39 can catalyze cleavage at 1/2 site of in vitro translated SFV P12, P123, and P1234, which normally undergoes cleavage incis (14Merits A. Vasiljeva L. Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Auvinen P. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), is better understood when realized that the estimated molar enzyme to substrate ratio represents an excess of 50 to 1, which is difficult to imagine to take place during virus infection. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that cleavages at sites 1/2 and 2/3 require cofactor(s), which might be derived from the other nsPs. Such a situation has been characterized thoroughly for the NS3 protease of hepatitis C virus. The site-specific proteolytic activity of NS3 protease was greatly increased by a short amino acid sequence of NS4 protein adjacently located in the polyprotein (40Failla C. Tomei L. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3753-3760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lin C. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7622-7626Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 43Love R.A. Parge H.E.

The released nsP2 exercises its role in two different forms. As a part of the RNA polymerase complex (45Kujala P. Ikäheimonen A. Ehsani N. Vihinen H. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3873-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the amino-terminal domain provides RNA triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities (15Vasiljeva L. Merits A. Auvinen P.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As “soluble nsP2,” the carboxyl-terminal domain acts as a regulator of 26 S RNA synthesis (24Suopanki J. Sawicki D.L. Sawicki S.G. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and as atrans-acting protease, which catalyzes the rapid cleavage of P1234 and P123, thus preventing the negative strand RNA synthesis late in infection. Previous work on Semliki Forest virus showed that early in infection the synthesis of the negative strand RNA was strictly dependent on protein synthesis and ceased in about 15 min after addition of cycloheximide (31Sawicki D.L. Sawicki S.G. J. Virol. 1980; 34: 108-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas late in infection the synthesis of positive strand RNAs could continue for several hours in the absence of protein synthesis. Solution to this dilemma came from findings with Sindbis virus, another alphavirus, where the processing intermediate P123 of the nonstructural polyprotein together with nsP4 was shown to be responsible for the synthesis of the negative strand RNA (32Lemm J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lemm J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1916-1926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Shirako Y. Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1874-1885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of P123 is essential for the synthesis of the positive RNA strands. Thus, the regulated processing of the nonstructural polyprotein controls the early events of virus infection. An overactive processing mutant of Sindbis virus nsP2 (N614D) cannot replicate, as the P123 intermediate is too short-lived to enable the necessary synthesis of the complementary RNA (35Lemm J.A. Rümenapf T. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Our knowledge of the processing of alphavirus nonstructural polyprotein(s) is based mostly on experiments of in vitrotranslation of Sindbis virus RNA. Ingenious constructions by which the cleavage sites were mutated alone and in different combinations, together with constructs coding for enzymatically inactive polyprotein as substrates, have been used to analyze this complex process (4Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Semin. Virol. 1990; 1: 347-356Google Scholar,9ten Dam E. Flint M. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that the polyprotein P1234 itself and all its cleavage intermediates containing nsP2 to be active proteases. The cleavability of the different sites varied and was dependent on the order of removal of different nsPs from the polyprotein substrate. Particularly interesting was the finding where the cleavage of site 2/3 in P1234 or P123 was only possible after the cleavage of nsP1 (36Shirako Y. Strauss J.H. Virology. 1990; 177: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Evidently, conformational changes in P1234 and its cleavage products affect the interactions between the cleavage sites and the protease domain of nsP2 in a complex manner. To understand the processes better, we have characterized purified SFV nsP2 and its carboxyl-terminal fragment Pro39 as proteolytic enzymes. As substrates we used in vitro synthesized polyproteins P1234, P123, P23 and P34, as well as recombinant thioredoxin fusion proteins, which contain short SFV-specific fragments, spanning the polyprotein processing sites 1/2, 2/3, and 3/4. We show for the first time that purified nsP2 has proteolytic activity, which cleaves readily the 3/4 site of P1234 and P34. Deletion series of nsP2 resulted in a soluble, active carboxyl-terminal fragment consisting of amino acid residues 459–799, which was designated as Pro39. It was purified to near homogeneity by metal-affinity chromatography. The specificities of Pro39 and nsP2 were identical, indicating that the amino-terminal half of nsP2 does not affect the fidelity of the protease. According to sequence alignments with the thiol protease superfamily, Pro39 contains a conserved protease domain (459), but also almost 200 carboxyl-terminal extra amino acids (9ten Dam E. Flint M. Ryan M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,13Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.-C.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). The ATP synthase is comprised of an integral membrane component called F0 and a peripheral moiety called F1. Different organisms show variation with respect to the subunit composition of the F0 sector, while the α3β3γδε oligomeric structure of the catalytic F1 unit has been highly conserved (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). All five F1 subunits and most F0 subunits of the mammalian ATP synthase are nuclear gene products; only two F0 proteins (subunits 6 and 8) are coded for in the mitochondrial DNA (2Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). As obligate aerobes, mammals are completely dependent on the ATP synthase for life. However, while a genetic defect that leads to a complete loss of the enzyme function is lethal,partial loss of ATP synthase function can be tolerated to some extent. For example, the T8993G mutation of human mitochondrial DNA, which results in an amino acid substitution in F0subunit 6, produces either the NARP syndrome (neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa) or the more severe Leigh's syndrome depending on the mutant load (3Tatuch Y.

Nuclear mutations that might be expected to lower the amount of functional ATP synthase in human cells, without depleting the enzyme completely, are those that affect proteins involved in its biogenesis. Genetic screens of respiratory-defective mutants ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae have identified several nuclear genes (ATP10, ATP11, ATP12) whose products are required for ATP synthase assembly (5Ackerman S.H.

A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Notably, none of these “assembly factors” are structural components of the yeast ATP synthase, which is now reported to contain at least 17 different types of subunits (7Arnold I. Pfeiffer K.

Instead, Atp10p is an assembly factor that is required for proper formation of the F0 component (5Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Work in our laboratory has provided evidence that Atp11p interacts specifically with the F1 β subunit (9Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), while Atp12p binds selectively to the F1 α subunit (10Wang Z.-G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is through this binding mechanism that Atp11p and Atp12p are proposed to protect the F1 subunits from forming nonproductive (α)nand (β)n complexes during assembly of the enzyme oligomer (10Wang Z.-G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate the analysis of F1 assembly in human cells, efforts were made to determine whether functional human orthologs of the yeast Atp11p and Atp12p assembly factors exist. To this end, we have isolated a partial human cDNA for Atp11p and have shown that the encoded product interacts with the F1 β subunit. A full-length human cDNA for Atp12p was also isolated, and we report here that human Atp12p interacts with the F1 α subunit in a two-hybrid screen and complements a yeast atp12 mutant. Genomic analysis provides evidence that supports the chromosomal assignment of human ATP11 to 1p32.3-p33 and of humanATP12 to 17p11.2.

The primers used for first-strand cDNA synthesis to clone ATP11 were designed to be complementary to nucleotides 3′ to the coding region, using a contig sequence assembled from 70 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) belonging to the UniGene Cluster Hs.10964. The cDNA was dC-tailed at the 5′ end, which enabled Life Technologies' Abridged Anchor Primer to be annealed at this terminus for 5′ RACE reactions; 3′ primers for such reactions employed sequences complementary to portions of one of the longer ATP11 ESTs (GenBankTM accession number AA150795). To clone the cDNA for human ATP12, a dC-tailed first-strand cDNA was synthesized from human fetal liver mRNA using a poly(dT) primer.

All inserts were made by PCR using forward and reverse primers based on the sequence of the respective cDNA, preceded at the 5′ end by an appropriate cloning recognition site. First-strand cDNA synthesized from human fetal liver mRNA served as the template to construct plasmids pAS2-1/HUATP11(83–300) (pAS2-1 vector, CLONTECH), pACT2/ HUATP1(44–553) (pACT2 vector, CLONTECH), pACT2/HUATP2(54–539) (pACT2 vector), and pG13L/HUATP11(83–328) (pG13L vector (14Wang Z.-G.

To construct pCUPHUATP12/YEp, a fragment bearing the CUP1 promoter andATP12 cDNA was excised from pCUPHUATP12/CEN316 (described above) and subcloned in YEp352 (15Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). This YEp352 plasmid served as the template for PCR to make the insert for pAS2-1/ HUATP12(27–289) (pAS2-1 vector). This latter plasmid served as the PCR template to construct the insert for pG13L/HUATP12(33–289) (pG13L vector).

The yeast two-hybrid screen (21Fields S. Song O.-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) employed yeast vectors pACT2 and pAS2-1 and host strain Y190 (described above) as supplied in the MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System 2 from CLONTECH. Yeast were grown in SD medium omitted for leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. Qualitative assessment of expression from the lacZ reporter gene was made using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as a chromogenic substrate for β-galactosidase in a colony-lift filter assay, as described in the CLONTECH manual. Standard techniques were used for restriction endonuclease analysis of DNA, purification and ligation of DNA fragments, and transformations of and recovery of plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Yeast transformations employed the LiAc procedure (23Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). The preparation of yeast mitochondria and assay of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity were done as described previously (24Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the time this work was initiated, a TBLASTN search of the human EST data base identified the 444-base pair sequence AA150795, which upon translation in the 5′ → 3′ direction in frame 1 yields a putative peptide that shares significant sequence homology with yeast Atp11p (BLAST score:p = 3 × 10−5). AA150795 is a member of UniGene Cluster Hs.10964. A contig for human ATP11assembled with ESTs from this cluster includes a termination codon, but is incomplete at the 5′ terminus. We isolated a human ATP11cDNA clone bearing more sequence at the 5′ end than any of the 5′-read ESTs from RACE reactions that employed human fetal liver mRNA as the template (see “Experimental Procedures”). However, despite numerous attempts, the best product achieved was found to harbor 270 nucleotides proximal to the 5′ end of EST AA150795, which codes for an additional 90 amino acids but still lacks the initiator methionine. We subsequently identified the mRNA HRC06325 (GenBankTM accession number AK026004) as the complete transcript for the ATP11 gene of Homo sapiens(BLAST score: p = 3 × 10−10 versus yeast Atp11p). Efforts to clone the complete cDNA for Atp11p from human fetal liver mRNA by PCR were not successful. An alignment of the primary sequences for Atp11p deduced from the human mRNA and S. cerevisiae gene is given in Fig.1. The sequences show 44% similarity (including identical and physico-chemically similar amino acids) and 21% identity. In comparison, the human protein shows 46% similarity and 22.3% identity with Atp11p of Schizosaccharomyces pombeand 58.6% similarity and 31% identity with Atp11p of Drosophila yakuba (11Wang Z.-G. Schmid K.J. Ackerman S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The black bar in Fig. 1 highlights a stretch of nine amino acids, PXFXXXLPR (termed the “flipper sequence”), which can be considered a signature sequence for Atp11p proteins (see Ref. 11Wang Z.-G. Schmid K.J. Ackerman S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The arrowindicates the first amino acid (Lys-83) that is encoded by the partial human cDNA for Atp11p isolated in our laboratory. The primary translation product of yeast ATP11 includes a leader sequence at the amino terminus that targets the protein to mitochondria (16Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the first amino acid of the mature protein is predicted to be Glu-40 (27White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (boxed residue in S. cerevisiae Atp11p sequence, Fig. 1). As mitochondrial leader sequences are known to be rich in basic and hydroxylated residues and deficient in acidic amino acids (28Lemire B.D. Fankhauser C. Baker A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20206-20216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we predict that the amino terminus of the mature human Atp11p protein begins in the vicinity of Glu-57 (boxed residue in H. sapiens Atp11p sequence, Fig. 1). By this analysis our cDNA clone encodes a human Atp11p protein that lacks ∼25 amino acids from the mature amino terminus. Previous work has indicated that yeast Atp11p retains function following the deletion of either 72 amino acids from the amino terminus or 135 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the mature protein (24Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Hence, it was deemed worthwhile to pursue functional studies with incomplete cDNAs coding for partial human Atp11p products. In one set of studies, the yeast two-hybrid screen was used to test the putative human Atp11p assembly factor for binding interactions with the human F1 α and β subunits. TheATP11 plasmid used in this study, pAS2-1/HuATP11(83–300), bears most of the sequence for mature human Atp11p (Lys-83 through Glu-300, see Fig. 1) fused to the DNA binding domain (BD) of Gal4p. Plasmids coding for the mature portions of the human F1 α subunit (Gln-44 through Ala-553; plasmid pACT2/ HuATP1(44–553)) and of the human F1 β subunit (Arg-54 through Ser-539, plasmid pACT2/HuATP2(54–539)) harbor fusions to the transcription activation domain (AD) of Gal4p. Yeast colonies that co-produced Gal4pBD-human Atp11p and Gal4pBD-human F1β subunit fusion proteins were stained dark blue following exposure to X-gal on filter paper (see “Experimental Procedures”). Such results, which indicate a functional reconstitution of the Gal4p transcription factor in the lacZ reporter strain (Y190), provide evidence for direct binding interactions between the human Atp11p and β subunit proteins. In contrast, there was no evidence from this assay of human Atp11p binding to the human F1 α subunit, as yeast cells that co-produced Gal4pBD-human Atp11p in combination with Gal4pAD-human α subunit did not stain blue with X-gal. Of particular note is that also yeast Atp11p shows substrate specificity for the F1 β subunit (9Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The truncated human Atp11p also interacts with the β subunit ofS. cerevisiae in the two-hybrid assay, on which basis we predicted that the human cDNA clone for Atp11p might complement a yeast atp11 mutant. For these experiments, a multicopy yeast plasmid was constructed (pG13L/HuATP11(83–328)) that harbors most of the sequence for mature human Atp11p (Arg-83 through Thr-328) fused, at the 5′ end, in frame with the yeast Atp11p leader peptide sequence. By such means it was anticipated that the plasmid-borne protein would be targeted correctly to mitochondria in yeast. The chimeric gene failed to confer respiratory competence to the atp11 mutant,aW303ΔG13, following selection on nonfermentable substrates (ethanol-glycerol plates) at three different temperatures (25, 30, and 37 °C). This result may reflect species-specific features of the Atp11p mechanism that preempt the human protein from substituting effectively for the yeast assembly factor in vivo (see “Discussion”). The TBLASTN program identified the human mRNA 24418 (GenBankTM accession number AF052185) of UniGene cluster Hs.13434 as the transcript for human Atp12p (BLAST score: p = 2 × 10−7 versus yeast Atp12p). A full-length cDNA, putatively identified as coding for human Atp12p, was cloned by PCR using a template that was reverse transcribed from human fetal liver mRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). In addition to the human ortholog, data base searches with S. cerevisiae Atp12p as the query have identified four additional complete amino acid sequences that share significant sequence similarity with the protein of budding yeast. These sequences are deduced from genomic information available for Drosophila melanogaster (GenBankTM accession number AE003669, clone CG8674, 4M. D. Adams, S. E. Celniker, R. A. Gibbs, G. M.

GenBankTM submission, 1999. p = 3 × 10−32). A multiple alignment of these four sequences, along with Atp12p from S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens, is given in Fig. 2. Overall, the extent of similarity (12.7%) and identity (4.6%) between all six Atp12p sequences is low. However, pairwise analysis yields similarity values higher than 40% and identities of at least 20% in most cases (Table I). The mitochondrial leader peptide of S. cerevisiae Atp12p is estimated to span the first 30 amino acids such that mature protein starts with Gly-31 (14Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2993-3002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (boxed residue in S. cerevisiae Atp12p sequence, Fig. 2). The other four eukaryotic Atp12p proteins are likewise predicted to harbor a mitochondrial targeting sequence, while the protein of the photosynthetic bacterium should not and is accordingly much shorter at the amino terminus. The fact that Glu-289 of S. cerevisiae Atp12p aligns with an acidic amino acid in the other five sequences (see arrow, Fig. 2) is of particular significance, since work in yeast has shown that an acidic side chain is required in this position for maximal Atp12p activity (14Wang Z.-G.

The numbers at the lower left show percent identity between sequence pairs. The product encoded by the putative human cDNA for Atp12p was evaluated for function in yeast two-hybrid and genetic complementation assays. The two-hybrid screen employed plasmid pAS2-1/HUATP12(27–289), which codes for the Gal4p DNA binding domain fused to what is approximated to be the mature portion of the human Atp12p protein (Met-27 through Glu-289), and pACT2 plasmids bearing fusions between the Gal4p transcription activation domain and the sequences for the human F1 α and β subunits (see above). Yeast cells, which co-produced the Gal4p fusion proteins that paired human Atp12p with the human F1 α subunit stained dark blue with X-gal, while there was only a weak blue signal for cells in which Gal4pBD-human Atp12p was produced in combination with the Gal4pAD-human F1 β subunit. Such results are in accord with the fact that yeast Atp12p shows high selectivity for the yeast α subunit over the yeast β subunit in a two-hybrid screen (10Wang Z.-G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA cloned for human Atp12p is anticipated to encode a precursor protein that is complete with respect to mitochondrial targeting function. Hence, for complementation studies, the entire cDNA was subcloned into a multicopy yeast vector 3′ of the yeastCUP1 promoter (plasmid pCUPHUATP12/YEp), and this plasmid was used to transform the respiratory-deficient atp12 strainaW303ΔATP12. Such transformants failed to grow on ethanol-glycerol plates. On the premise that the human targeting peptide might not function correctly in yeast, a plasmid was constructed to produce a protein chimera in which the yeast Atp11p leader is fused to an approximated form of the mature human Atp12p protein (Ile-33 through Glu-289, plasmid pG13L/HUATP12(33–289)). The yeast atp12 mutant harboring this plasmid grows moderately well on ethanol-glycerol plates (Fig. 3). The level of oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase activity measured for this transformant is 2.49 units/mg, which can be compared with 0.12 unit/mg measured for the aW303ΔATP12 mutant and 4.71 units/mg measured for the respiratory competent parent, W303-1A. In contrast, pG13L/HUATP12(33–289) does not confer respiratory competence to the atp11 mutant, aW303ΔG13. The ESTs belonging to the ATP11 UniGene cluster Hs.10964 (176 homologous sequences) and those of the ATP12 UniGene cluster Hs.13434 (76 homologous sequences) were derived from a wide distribution of tissues, including brain, breast, colon, heart, kidney, lung, muscle, stomach, and whole embryo. SAGE data also indicate a wide tissue distribution for these genes, although a light tag frequency within most tissues (less than 62 tags/million tags surveyed for each gene) suggests low to moderate abundance of each transcript. Several other mammalian ESTs show strong homology to ATP11 (14 mouse, 3 rat, and 1 cow) and to ATP12 (11 mouse, 11 cow, 5 rat, 5 pig, 3 Xenopus, and 1 chicken), which suggests that Atp11p and Atp12p orthologs are present also in these species. The ATP11 cDNA sequence is collectively contained within three draft human genomic sequences (AL357392, AL136373, and AC013593). Alignment of the cDNA and genomic sequences yields nine regions of homology, which suggests a genomic structure of 9 exons. The precise exon/intron boundaries of all 9 putative exons, each of which contains consensus gt/ag splice donor/acceptor sequences, and the length of all but one intron, could be inferred from the alignment (TableII). Atp11p is predicted to span a minimum of 32.5 kilobase pairs of genomic sequence. EST-derived markerD1S3533 (SHGC-11813) representing the 3′-untranslated region of ATP11 has been localized on the GeneMap '99 RH map between D1S2843 and D1S417 (48.8–81.6 centiMorgans), and on the CompView chromosome 1 RH map betweenRH67834 and D1S197 (872.3–907 centiRays). The CompView-inferred cytogenetic position for markerD1S3533 is 1p32-p34, and the Unified data base estimates the marker to be 49.018 megabases proximal of the 1p telomere. In addition, BAC clone bA49P4, from which the ATP11-containing genomic sequence AL136373 is derived, has been mapped by fluorescencein situ hybridization to 1p32.2-p33. Therefore,ATP11 can be assigned to 1p and most likely localizes within 1p32.2-p33; this assignment is consistent with the localization of several other markers and genes also found within the threeATP11-containing genomic sequence tracts.Table IIGenomic structure of human ATP11NumberExonE/I2-aExon/Intron.interfaceIntronStartEndSizeNumberSizebpbpbpbp11308309gt/ag126822309417109gt/ag26518341846851gt/ag3497446953163gt/ag44259553258251gt/ag51188658363048gt/ag6>6519763172696gt/ag718658727834108gt/ag87228983517569222-a Exon/Intron.

In contrast to other cell types, IκBα, in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), which are osteoclast precursors, is tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src kinase. To address the role of IκBα phosphorylation in osteoclastogenesis, we generated TAT fusion proteins containing wild-type IκBα (TAT-WT-IκB), IκBα lacking its NH2-terminal 45 amino acids (TAT-IκB46–317), and IκBα in which tyrosine residue 42, the c-Src target, is mutated into phenylalanine (TAT-IκB(Y42F)). TAT-IκB efficiently enters BMMs, and the NF-κB-inhibitory protein, once intracellular, is functional. While TAT-WT-IκB only slightly inhibits osteoclastogenesis, osteoclast recruitment is diminished >80% by TAT-IκB46–317, an event mirrored by dentin resorption. The fact that TAT alone does not impact osteoclastogenesis, which also resumes following withdrawal of TAT-IκB46–317, establishes that the mutant's anti-osteoclastogenic properties do not reflect toxicity.

These inflammatory cytokine-mediated events typically involve activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. The fact that deletion of the p50 and p52 subunits of NF-κB leads to osteoporosis, due to failed osteoclastogenesis, establishes that activation of this transcription complex is essential for commitment of BMMs to the osteoclast phenotype (5Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Young Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family is composed of five members that can homo- or heterodimerize following activation (6Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar). The transcription factor resides in its inactive form in the cytoplasm avidly bound to the inhibitory protein IκBα. In a variety of cell types, extracellular signals lead to phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, thereby releasing NF-κB. The transcription factor then translocates to the nucleus, binds to DNA sequences, and activates target genes (7Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). While in most circumstances IκBα is serine-phosphorylated, it can undergo phosphorylation on tyrosine 42 (8–10). This event, in TNF-induced osteoclast precursors, also leads to NF-κB release and nuclear translocation (10Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. McHugh K.P. Livolsi A. Peyron J.F. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). While NF-κB is clearly essential for osteoclast formation, the means by which it stimulates the process is unclear. The goals of the present exercise were, therefore, 2-fold. In the first instance, we wished to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα is essential for BMM differentiation into osteoclasts. Second, we asked if osteoclastogenesis, and attendant bone resorption, can be inhibited by dominant-negative IκBα, specifically that in which Tyr42 is unavailable for phosphorylation. The planned exercise required expression of putative dominant-negative forms of IκBα in osteoclast precursors. This strategy was hampered, however, by the fact that osteoclasts, and their monocyte/macrophage progenitors, are presently impossible to efficiently transfect by traditional methods. To overcome this obstacle we took advantage of TAT, a peptide derived from the human immunodeficiency virus, type-1 transduction domain (11Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Moore C. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 12Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol.

Proteins fused to this 11-amino acid sequence, when misfolded, enter many cell types, refold, and regain function (13Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A.

Thus, our first undertaking was to determine whether a TAT-based approach would permit us to efficiently express IκBα constructs in bona fide osteoclast precursors. Our data show that TAT-fused IκBα readily enters osteoclast precursors in a dose-dependent manner and elevates NF-κB levels in the cytosol. More importantly, IκBα lacking all phosphorylation sites, inhibits osteoclastogenesis in a nontoxic reversible manner and blocks bone resorption. Polyclonal anti-IκBα and anti-NF-κB antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). 1,25-(OH)2D3 was provided by Dr. Milan Uskokovic (Hoffman La-Roche, Nutley, NJ). The ECL kit was obtained from Pierce. Wild-type and tyrosine 42-mutated IκBα cDNAs were a gift of Dr. Jean-Francois Peyron (Nice, France). IκB46–317 super-repressor mutant was generated by NH2-terminal deletion of residues 1–45 using a standard polymerase chain reaction approach. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. C3H/HeN males were purchased from Harlan Industries (Indianapolis, IN). BMMs were isolated as described previously (4Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole bone marrow of 4–6 week mice was collected and incubated in tissue culture plates, at 37 °C in 5% CO2, in the presence of 10 ng/ml macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (4Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). After 24 h in culture, the nonadherent cells were collected and layered on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. Cells at the gradient interface were collected and plated in α-minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence of 10 ng/ml macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and plated according to each experimental condition. Whole marrow cultures were plated in 48 multi-well plates at 2 × 106 cell/ml/well in the presence of 10 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3. Cultures were supplemented with 10 nm1,25-(OH)2D3 and fresh media on day 4 of culture. Osteoclasts develop on days 7–8 of culture at a point where cells are fixed and TRAP-stained BMMs were plated on multi-well coverslips in the absence or presence (1 h) of TAT-IκB. Cells were then fixed and stained with anti-HA antibody and detected with fluorescent secondary antibody. Total cell lysates were boiled in the presence of 2× SDS-sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, distilled water) for 5 min and subjected to electrophoresis on 8–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad) and incubated in blocking solution (10% skim milk prepared in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), to reduce nonspecific binding. Membranes were washed with PBS/Tween buffer and exposed to primary antibodies (1 h at room temperature), washed again four times, and incubated with the respective secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1 h at room temperature). Membranes were washed extensively (5 × 15 min), and an ECL detection assay was performed following the manufacturer's directions. Various IκBα constructs were cloned into the pTAT-HA bacterial expression vector described previously by Nagahara et al. (13Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), which contains a six-histidine tag, for easy purification, an HA tag for detection followed by the TAT transduction domain, and finally the IκB sequence. The resultant plasmid, pTAT-IκB, was transformed into the DH5α strain of Escherichia coli. The transformants were screened initially by restriction enzyme mapping. A recombinant containing the correct restriction fragments was then sequenced on both strands. This plasmid was then used to express the TAT-coupled IκBα in the BL21 (DE3) strain of E. coli. Following 4–6 h of induction, the cells were sonicated in 8 m urea, and the TAT-coupled IκBα was purified on a nickel-Sepharose column (Qiagen), then applied to an ionic exchange column (Mono Q) in 4m urea. To shock misfold the protein, the ionic exchange column was switched in one step from 4 m urea to aqueous buffer (20 mm HEPES). IκBα was eluted by stepping from 50 mm to 1 m NaCl followed by desalting on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into PBS or 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 137 mm NaCl and frozen in 10% glycerol at −80 °C. pTAT-coupled and misfolded proteins remain highly concentrated, and resistant to freeze-thaw denaturation, and readily enter the cells upon incubation. Once in hand, the coupled TAT proteins were added to cultured marrow cells without the aid of transfection agents. Osteoclast precursors were plated on whale dentin slices, in 24-well plates, and allowed to differentiate, under osteoclastic conditions, in the absence or presence of 100 nm TAT or TAT-IκB46–317. After 8 days slices were placed in 0.25 m NaOH and sonicated briefly to remove cells. Dentin slices were then rinsed in PBS and subjected to scanning electron microscopy to identify resorption pits. To test TAT-IκB transduction, we treated BMMs, for 1 h, with a TAT-IκB fusion protein containing HA tag (HA-TAT-IκB). As demonstrated by immunostaining, using anti-HA monoclonal antibody, HA-TAT-IκB transduces the vast majority of BMMs in culture (Fig. 1). To determine whether the HA-TAT-IκB enters BMMs in a concentration-dependent manner, we incubated osteoclast precursors with increasing amounts of the purified fusion protein. Lysates of 1-h-treated cells were immunoblotted with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, HA-TAT-IκB enters BMMs, dose-dependently.Figure 2TAT-IκB enters BMMs dose-dependently and retains cytosolic NF-κB. Cells were cultured for 3 days and then were treated with increasing doses of purified TAT-WT-IκB (0–100 nm) for 1 h. Cells were then lysed, and cytosolic levels of HA-TAT-IκB (A) and NF-κB (B) were assessed by immunoblots using anti-HA and anti-p65 NF-κB antibodies, respectively. The levels of TAT-IκB were further examined by immunoprecipitating the protein with anti-HA, and blotting with anti-IκB antibodies yielded similar results (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because IκBα normally binds to, and retains, NF-κB in the cytoplasm, we asked if TAT-IκB affects cellular localization of NF-κB. Attesting to the TAT fusion protein's functionality, the transduced inhibitory protein, dose-dependently, retains NF-κB in the cytosol as assessed by measuring cytosolic levels of p65 NF-κB subunit from cell lysates (Fig. 2 B). Given that NF-κB deletion blunts osteoclastogenesis, we asked whether inhibition of NF-κB activation would also block osteoclast development. We reasoned that introduction of IκBα protein, the NF-κB inhibitory protein, devoid of its functional phosphorylation sites, into osteoclast precursors might block osteoclast recruitment. To address the role of IκBα phosphorylation in osteoclastogenesis, we generated TAT fusion proteins containing wild-type IκBα, (TAT-WT-IκB) and IκBα lacking its NH2-terminal 45 amino acids (TAT-IκB46–317). Marrow, placed in osteoclastogenic conditions (4Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), was treated, on day 3 of culture, with the various TAT-IκB constructs or with TAT alone. In some cultures the inhibitory proteins were withdrawn following 48 h of exposure. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expression by these cultures indicates that TAT alone fails to impact osteoclast recruitment, indicating that the human immunodeficiency virus-derived peptide is nontoxic in these circumstances (Fig.3 A, row D). Osteoclast recruitment is, however, diminished >80% by TAT-IκB46–317 (Fig. 3 A, wells C1–C2, and B), suggesting that the functional phosphorylation sites are central to the process. The resumed osteoclast differentiation following withdrawal of the inhibitory construct establishes that the TAT fusion protein's anti-osteoclastogenic properties are reversible (Fig. 3 A,rows 3–4). In contrast to TAT-IκB46–317, TAT-WT-IκB only slightly inhibits osteoclastogenesis (Fig.3 A, wells B1–B2). As expected, inhibition of osteoclast formation by TAT-IκB46–317 is mirrored by arrested dentin resorption (Fig. 4). The number of resorption lacunae counted in 1 cm2 was 187 ± 39 in PBS + TAT compared with 20 ± 14 in TAT-IκB-treated conditions. Furthermore, lacunae in TAT-treated conditions were well defined, wide and deep tracks compared with shallow focal pits in TAT-IκB-treated conditions.Figure 4NH2-terminal-deleted-IκB46–317inhibits matrix resorption. BMMs were plated on dentin slices in 24 multi-well plates. TAT, alone, or TAT-IκB46–317 (100 nm) were added on day 5 (beginning of osteoclast formation). Three days later dentin slices were washed with PBS, fixed, and resorption pits visualized by electron microscopy scanning.Arrows indicate bone pits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having established that deletion of the functional phosphorylation sites to IκBα blunts osteoclastogenesis, we asked if mutation of tyrosine 42, which is specifically phosphorylated in osteoclast precursors, mirrors this event. To this end we generated TAT-IκB(Y42F) and examined its cellular transduction activity. First, HA-TAT-IκB(Y42F) was added to osteoclast precursors, and the presence of the protein was examined with time by immunoblots. We find that the protein is efficiently transduced in osteoclast precursors within 1 h, and its intracellular levels are further elevated in the following 8 h (Fig.5). Residual levels of TAT-IκB(Y42F) remain detectable up to 2 days in culture. Furthermore, we find that dose-dependent transduction of this mutant protein (Fig.6 A) retains NF-κB in the cytosol (Fig. 6 B) in a manner similar to effects exerted by other IκB mutants (Fig. 2). Second, we asked if TAT-IκB(Y42F) inhibits TNF-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation. To this end, cells were left untreated or treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of TAT-IκB(Y42F) for different time points. The data depicted in Fig. 7 A indicate that, while as expected, TNF reduces cytosolic levels of NF-κB (lane 2), tyrosine-mutated TAT-IκB prevents this reduction within 1 h, and levels of NF-κB in the cytosol are sustained up to 16 h. Reduced levels of NF-κB in days 2 and 3 (lanes 6 and 7) most likely reflect decay of the TNF signal and/or degradation of the TAT protein. The observations in Fig.7 A are further supported by our findings that TNF enhances nuclear levels of NF-κB (Fig. 7 B, lane 2) and that the various IκBα proteins block it (lanes 3–5). Finally, we examined whether, similar to TAT-IκB46–317, addition of TAT-IκB(Y42F) to osteoclastogenic cultures blocks osteoclastogenesis. Establishing a functional role for IκB(Y42F) in osteoclastogenesis, we find that TAT-IκB(Y42F) is as efficient as TAT-IκB46–317 in blocking osteoclast differentiation (Figs. 8 and9).Figure 6TAT-IκB(Y42F) enters cells and retains cytosolic NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner. Cells were cultured as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5 and treated with increasing doses of TAT-IκB(Y42F) as shown.

On the other hand, in inflammatory conditions such as periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and peri-prosthetic implant loosening, excessive osteoclast recruitment leads to pathological osteolysis (1Teitelbaum S.L.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 61-94Google Scholar). In fact, accelerated osteoclastogenesis is the cellular defect responsible for the most common of the metabolic bone disorders, namely post-menopausal osteoporosis. Thus, understanding the means by which monocyte/macrophage precursors differentiate into osteoclasts provides potential avenues for preventing these diseases. Experimental and spontaneous osteoporosis has yielded seminal observations regarding the molecular regulation of osteoclast differentiation and function. Among the most important information derived from these animals is the pivotal role that NF-κB plays in the osteoclastogenic process. Not only does the p50/p52 NF-κB−/− mouse lack osteoclasts, but the phenotype is cured by marrow transplantation (5Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Young Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 20Franzoso G. Carlson L.B. Xing L. Poljak L. Shores E. Brown K. Leonardi A. Tran T. Boyce B. Siebenlist U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3482-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), establishing that the transcription complex exerts its osteoclastogenic effect on the osteoclast precursor,per se, and not an accessory cell such as those of stromal lineage. Thus, understanding regulatory events of NF-κB activation in osteoclast progenitors may provide insights to manage pathologic osteoclastic activity. In most cells, phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36 prompts its dissociation from NF-κB, marking the inhibitory protein for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. NF-κB, in turn, translocates to the nucleus to function as a transcriptional complex. On the other hand, NF-κB activation, in a restricted population, is attendant upon tyrosine IκBα phosphorylation, a process mediated by Src family kinases. For example, deletion of c-Src in osteoclast precursors or p56lck in T-lymphocytes inhibits NF-κB activation and interleukin-6 secretion (8Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8549-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) find that IκB(Tyr42) is a functional phosphorylation site. In this regard, our previous studies unveiled that the tyrosine kinase c-Src, also essential for osteoclastogenesis, mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα on tyrosine residue 42, in osteoclast progenitors. This phosphorylation is followed by activation of the NF-κB transcriptional complex. Extending these observations to a possible therapeutic approach, we reasoned that nonphosphorylatable IκBα might serve as a dominant-negative inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis. Specifically, we speculated that mutating IκBα amino-terminal phosphorylation sites might preserve the IκB·NF-κB complex in osteoclast precursors. However, significant effect requires introduction of the mutated proteins in the vast majority of primary osteoclast progenitors, an unattainable goal by traditional techniques. To resolve this contingent, we utilized the TAT-mediated protein transduction method, developed and successfully used by our group to introduce a large number of proteins into a wide spectrum of cells, including primary osteoclast precursors (17Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 22Abu-Amer Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Our data show that dominant-negative forms of IκBα, delivered into osteoclast precursors, as TAT fusion proteins, prevent the cells' commitment to the osteoclast phenotype. Importantly, delivery of the mutated TAT-IκB proteins is a rapid event, which is sustained for at least 24 h. Moreover, transduced IκBα mutant proteins in osteoclast precursors, dose-dependently, retain NF-κB in the cytoplasm under basal and TNF-stimulating conditions. Thus, TAT-IκB mutants appear to act as dominant-negative proteins by displacing endogenous IκBα; the later remains susceptible for phosphorylation and processing. The biological significance of TAT-IκB delivery into osteoclast precursors is manifested by its potent anti-osteoclastogenic effect. In this regard, we document that while TAT-WT-IκB, is only slightly inhibitory, serine/serine/tyrosine-deleted and tyrosine-mutated IκBα proteins are highly effective in blocking osteoclast development. These effects correlate well with their observed effect on NF-κB inactivation. While yet to be proven, our observations suggest that the raised levels of WT-IκB, delivered as a TAT construct, are subject to phosphorylation and removal and, thus, are insufficient to block prolonged activation of NF-κB in osteoclast precursors, and hence, osteoclastogenesis continues. Additionally, the lack of impact of TAT peptide or TAT-WT-IκB on osteoclast recruitment together with reversibility of the effect underscores the nontoxic nature of these fusion proteins. The capacity of these constructs to effectively transduce osteoclasts reinforces the potential of TAT fusion proteins as therapeutic moieties. As regard to the present constructs, preventing phosphorylation of IκBα at its NH2-terminal domain, in general, and tyrosine phosphorylation on residue 42, in particular, substantially diminishes osteoclastogenesis. Taken with the restricted cell specificity of IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation, these observations raise the possibility that nonphosphorylatable TAT-IκB may be a means of averting pathological bone loss."

We report that while expression of S100A13 in NIH 3T3 cells results in the constitutive release of S100A13 into the extracellular compartment at 37 °C, co-expression of S100A13 with FGF1 represses the constitutive release of S100A13 and enables NIH 3T3 cells to release S100A13 in response to temperature stress. S100A13 release in response to stress occurs with kinetics similar to that observed for the stress-induced release of FGF1, but S100A13 expression is able to reverse the sensitivity of FGF1 release to inhibitors of transcription and translation. The release of FGF1 and S100A13 in response to heat shock results in the solubility of FGF1 at 100% (w/v) ammonium sulfate saturation, and the expression of a S100A13 deletion mutant lacking its novel basic residue-rich domain acts as a dominant negative effector of FGF1 release in vitro. Surprisingly, the expression of S100A13 also results in the stress-induced release of a Cys-free FGF1 mutant, which is normally not released from NIH 3T3 cells in response to heat shock.

Our laboratory previously demonstrated that FGF1, but not FGF2, is released as a latent homodimer by a transcription- and translation-dependent mechanism in response to a variety of cellular stresses including heat shock (3Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), hypoxia (4Carreira, C. M., Landriscina, M., Bellum, S., Prudovsky, I., and Maciag, T. (2001) Growth Factors, in Press.Google Scholar), and serum starvation (5Shin J.T. Opalenik S.R. Wehby J.N. Mahesh V.K. Jackson A. Tarantini F. Maciag T. Thompson J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Conversely, the disruption of communication between the ER and Golgi apparatus by brefeldin A does not prevent the release of FGF1 from NIH 3T3 cells, confirming that FGF1 release may occur through a nonconventional pathway (6Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).FGF1 is released in vitro as a reducing agent- and denaturant-sensitive complex, which contains the p40 extravesicular domain of the Ca2+-binding protein, p65 synaptotagmin (Syt)1 (7Tarantini F.

The release of FGF1 in response to stress is dependent on Syt1 expression, since the expression of either a deletion mutant lacking 95 amino acids from the extravesicular portion of Syt1 or an antisense-Syt1 gene is able to repress FGF1 release in NIH 3T3 cells (7Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Carreira C.M. Garfinkel S. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol.

In addition, FGF1 purified from ovine brain as a high molecular weight aggregate exists as a component of a noncovalent heparin-binding complex with p40 Syt1 and S100A13 (9Carreira C.M. LaVallee T.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1169-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Interestingly, crystallographic analysis of the FGF and IL-1 prototypes demonstrates a remarkable level of structural similarity between these seemingly disparate polypeptides (12Thomas K.A. Rios-Candelore M. Gimenez-Gallego G. DiSalvo J. Bennett C. Rodkey J. Fitzpatrick S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6409-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 13Zhang J.D. Cousens L.S. Barr P.J. Sprang S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3446-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that the pathway utilized for the release of IL-1α is quite similar yet distinct from the pathway utilized by FGF1 export, since both proteins are released in response to temperature stress with similar biochemical and pharmacologic properties (14Tarantini F. Micucci I. Bellum S. Landriscina M. Garfinkel S. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5147-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, the IL-1α release pathway requires the proteolytic processing of the 31-kDa precursor form of IL-1α to the 17-kDa mature form for IL-1α release and does not appear to utilize Syt1 for export, since a dominant negative Syt1 mutant blocks FGF1 but not IL-1α release (14Tarantini F.

Although we have not been able to eliminate the function of other Syt gene family members in the stress-induced release of IL-1α, the observation that the precursor form of IL-1α is able to block the release of FGF1 in response to temperature stress suggests that the FGF1 and IL-1α release pathways may be mechanistically linked (14Tarantini F.

Because amlexanox also induces a Src-dependent and reversible disassembly of actin stress fibers (16Landriscina M. Prudovsky I. Carreira C.M. Soldi R. Tarantini F. Maciag T. J. Biol.

S100A13 is a novel member of the S100 gene family that encodes a protein containing a positively charged carboxyl-terminal domain that may be involved in specific protein interactions (19Wicki R. Schafer B.W. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). While members of the S100 gene family, including S100A13 (20Ridinger K. Schafer B.W. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Heizmann C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8686-8694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), are expressed in a variety of tissues and organs (17Donato R. Biochim. Biophys.

Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the expression of a few members of the S100 gene family have been implicated in the regulation of human pathology including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiomyopathies, cancer, and chronic inflammation (17Donato R.

Interestingly, members of the S100 gene family have been shown to be constitutively released into the extracellular compartment (17Donato R. Biochim. Biophys.

We report that S100A13 expression facilitates the release of FGF1 into the extracellular compartment in response to temperature stress in vitro and that S100A13 expression is able to revert the dependence for both transcription and translation in the release of FGF1 in response to heat shock. We further describe the unanticipated observation that S100A13 expression is able to export a Cys-free FGF1 mutant, suggesting that S100A13 may be involved in the formation of the FGF1 homodimer, a prerequisite for export.DISCUSSIONOur data suggest that S100A13 is involved in the regulation of the stress-induced FGF1 release pathways. Thus, like the stress-induced release of FGF1 (3Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), p40 Syt1 (7Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Carreira C.M. Garfinkel S. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5147-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the stress-induced release of Myc-S100A13 is sensitive to agents that interfere with ATP biosynthesis and organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton but is insensitive to disruption of intracellular communication between the ER-Golgi apparatus. However, several observations suggest that S100A13, unlike p40 Syt1, is able to facilitate the release of FGF1. Indeed, expression of Myc-S100A13 was able to overcome the inhibitory activity of actinomycin and cycloheximide on FGF1 release and was able to induce the release of Cys-free FGF1 in response to stress, suggesting a functional role for S100A13 in the FGF1 release pathway as a potential modifier of a stress-induced post-translational event.The finding that Myc-S100A13 expression is able to overcome the requirement for transcription and translation in the release of FGF1 is consistent with the observation that some members of the S100 gene family have been characterized not only as stress-induced genes (36Andrejevic S.

Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 18Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 40Nishikawa T. Lee I.S.

It is interesting to note that S100B was independently characterized from neural tissue as an inhibitor of Cu2+-mediated l-ascorbate oxidation (40Nishikawa T. Lee I.S. Shiraishi N. Ishikawa T. Ohta Y. Nishikimi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23037-23041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, S100A4, S100A6, S100A7, and S100B are up-regulated in several human tumor cells, where they are associated with increased invasiveness of transformed cells and acquisition of metastatic phenotype (17Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The murine analog of S100A8, the CP-10 protein, has been also associated with inflammation, since it is expressed and released in macrophages and endothelial cells only after their activation by interleukin-1 and lipopolysaccharide (17Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 42Yen T. Harrison C.A. Devery J.M. Leong S. Iismaa S.E. Yoshimura T. Geczy C.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 4812-4821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the observation that the S100A13 gene is not induced in response to heat shock in NIH 3T3 cells does not eliminate the possibility that other members of the S100 gene family may participate in the release of FGF1 and that the expression of S100A13 may compensate for their function.While it is difficult to anticipate how S100A13 participates in these release pathways, we suggest that S100A13 may be able to orient FGF1 and Cys-free FGF1 in a manner that enables these polypeptides to form noncovalent homodimers. Indeed, Cu2+ oxidation is able to induce FGF1 homodimer (26Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and FGF1 IL-1α heterodimer formation (26Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence from S100 crystallographic studies demonstrates that members of the S100 gene family are able to form stable Ca2+-independent homodimers and through an alteration in their conformation enable the two EF-hands in S100 to hold polypeptides, such as annexin 2 (Anx2) (43Kang H.M. Kassam G. Jarvis S.E. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), enabling the carboxyl-terminal domain of the polypeptide to interact with other proteins (17Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 18Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In studies utilizing the interaction between S100A11 and Anx1 (44Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 45Mailliard W.S. Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) as well as between S100A10 and Anx2 (43Kang H.M. Kassam G. Jarvis S.E. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the orientation established by these conformational changes yields the formation of stable heterotetramers (S100A112·Anx12 and S100A102·Anx22). In the situations with FGF1, it is intriguing to speculate that S100A13 may be able to form similar heterotetramers with these polypeptides. Indeed, this may explain how S100A13 is able to facilitate the release of Cys-free FGF1, since it is possible that when interacting with native FGF1, S100A13 may be able to orient its conformation to expose Cys30, which is not exposed to solvent in its native conformation (46Blaber M. DiSalvo J. Thomas K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), for FGF1 homodimer oxidation. In the absence of Cys30, S100A13 may enable Cys-free FGF1 to form the noncovalent equivalent of the FGF1 Cys30 homodimer as a component of a FGF2·S100A132 heterotetramer so that it can be released in response to heat shock. This would be consistent with the observation that the stress-induced release of Cys-free FGF1 and Myc-S100A13 exhibits similar kinetics and responsiveness to pharmacological agents including amlexanox, 2-deoxyglucose, brefeldin A, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D (data not shown). In addition, the S100A13-dependent increase in the solubility of Cys-free FGF1 under conditions of 100% (w/v) ammonium sulfate saturation also supports the premise that S100A13 may be able to associate with the monomeric form of FGF1 in response to temperature stress, and this association may involve the formation of a noncovalent heterotetramer complex that may enable Cys-free FGF1 to access the release pathway. Interestingly, the ability of S100A13 to force FGF1 into the supernatant fraction under conditions of saturated ammonium sulfate fractionation would be consistent with this suggestion, since solubility in ammonium sulfate is well described as being sensitive to alterations in protein conformation (47Das B.K. Agarwal S.K. Khan M.Y. Biochem. Int. 1992; 28: 775-781PubMed Google Scholar).It is interesting that latrunculin and amlexanox, which are known to attenuate the F-actin cytoskeleton (16Landriscina M. Prudovsky I. Carreira C.M. Soldi R. Tarantini F. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Spector I. Schochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), also inhibit the heat shock-induced release of FGF1 and Myc-S100A13. Indeed, this suggests that the cytoskeleton may play an important role in the FGF1 release pathway. The premise is further supported by the association of the members of the S100 gene family with actin stress fibers, which is dependent upon the physiological status of the cell (48Mandinova A. Atar D. Schafer B.W. Spiess M. Aebi U. Heizmann C.W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, it is possible that S100A13 may act as an adaptor between FGF1 and F-actin structures. The F-actin cytoskeleton may be involved in at least two stages of the stress-induced release of FGF1 and Myc-S100A13: (i) the transport of the complex to the cell membrane proceeding along F-actin stress fibers with the potential participation of myosin molecular motors (49Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and (ii) exocytosis, which has been demonstrated to depend on the submembrane actin cortex during classical protein secretion (50Lang T. Wacker I. Wunderlich I. Rohrbach A. Giese G. Soldati T. Almers W. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2863-2877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because both actin-dependent transport and exocytosis are energy-dependent processes (50Lang T. Wacker I. Wunderlich I. Rohrbach A. Giese G. Soldati T. Almers W. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2863-2877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), this suggestion is consistent with the ability of 2-deoxyglucose to repress the stress-induced release of FGF1 and Myc-S100A13. Interestingly, unlike latrunculin (32Spector I. Schochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), amlexanox does not interfere with the stability of submembrane F-actin (16Landriscina M. Prudovsky I. Carreira C.M. Soldi R. Tarantini F. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and this further implies that the F-actin stress fibers may be involved in the regulation of the transport of FGF1, p40 Syt1, and Myc-S100A13 in the nonclassical release of these polypeptides.The observation that S100A13 is constitutively released in vitro is also noteworthy, since a similar observation has been made with the intracellular p40 fragment of p65 Syt1 (8LaVallee T.M. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Carreira C.M. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the function of the C2A domain in p40 Syt1 has been implicated in lipid bilayer penetration (51Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4001-13995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, unlike p40 Syt1, which exhibits constitutive release in FGF1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants (8LaVallee T.M. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Carreira C.M. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the expression of FGF1 in Myc-S100A13 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants represses the constitutive release of Myc-S100A13. Although it is difficult to interpret the significance of these data, it is possible that the ability of FGF1 to attenuate constitutive release of Myc-S100A13 but not the constitutive release of p40 Syt1 may reflect the ability of intracellular FGF1 to prefer an association with S100A13 rather than with p40 Syt1. Indeed, the observation that FGF1, S100A13, and p40 Syt1 are present as a noncovalent aggregate/complex in neural tissue suggests that the self-aggregration properties attributed to both the extravesicular p40 domain of p65 Syt1 (52Damer C.K. Creutz C.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1661-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and S100 gene family members (17Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 18Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) may be involved in the arrangement of a conformation-sensitive aggregate complex that may facilitate the release of FGF1. The observations that FGF1 (35Tarantini F. Gamble S. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29039-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), p40 Syt1 (53Marqueze B. Berton F. Seagar M.

Several studies have reported that the carboxyl-terminal domain of S100 proteins is involved in mediating the interaction of S100 polypeptides in their dimeric state with their target proteins (17Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 18Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Because deletion of the basic residue-rich domain at the carboxyl terminus of Myc-S100A13 results in the generation of a dominant-negative effector of FGF1 release in response to temperature stress, it is likely that this domain may be involved in the regulation of FGF1 export under heat shock conditions. However, it is unlikely that the S100A13 basic residue-rich domain is involved in mediating the ability of Myc-S100A13 to traverse the plasma membrane, since the Myc-S100A13Δ88–98 mutant is released in response to heat shock. This is consistent with the observations that members of the S100 gene family lacking a basic residue-rich domain at their carboxyl terminus are released into the extracellular compartment following expression in mammalian cells (17Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 18Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 21Rammes A.

Indeed, S100B and S100A10 do not contain a basic residue-rich domain, yet S100B is released by glial cells (55Shashoua V.E. Hesse G.W. Moore B.W. J.

When nitrogen is limiting, Gln3p and Gat1p are concentrated in the nucleus where they bind GATA sequences upstream of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)-sensitive genes and activate their transcription. Conversely, in excess nitrogen, these GATA sequences are unoccupied by Gln3p and Gat1p because these transcription activators are excluded from the nucleus. Ure2p binds to Gln3p and Gat1p and is required for NCR-sensitive transcription to be repressed and for nuclear exclusion of these transcription factors. Here we show the following. (i) Gln3p residues 344–365 are required for nuclear localization. (ii) Replacing Ser-344, Ser-347, and Ser-355 with alanines has minimal effects on GFP-Gln3p localization. However, replacing Gln3p Ser-344, Ser-347, and Ser-355 with aspartates results in significant loss of its ability to be concentrated in the nucleus. (iii) N and C termini of the Gln3p region required for it to complex with Ure2p and be excluded from the nucleus are between residues 1–103 and 301–365, respectively. (iv) N and C termini of the Ure2p region required for it to interact with Gln3p are situated between residues 101–151 and 330–346, respectively.

One of the gene families shared by S. cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes is the GATA family of DNA-binding proteins. In animal cells, GATA family proteins were originally shown to be responsible for regulating globin gene expression (1Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). However, they are now known to regulate a diverse set of developmental functions (2Kelley C. Blumberg H. Zon L.I. Evans T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, the GATA family proteins Gln3p, Gat1p/Nil1p, Dal80p, Deh1p/Gzf3p have been studied as the main regulators of nitrogen catabolic gene expression (4Cooper T.G. Marzluf G. Bambrl R.

Biotechnol. 1999; 12: 35-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and recently their regulatory functions also been shown to be far more diverse (7Cox K.H. Pinchak A.B. Cooper T.G.

Gln3p and Gat1p are transcriptional activators, whereas Dal80p and Deh1p repress transcription by competing with these activators for binding to their target GATA sequences (4Cooper T.G. Marzluf G.

Gln3p and Gat1p function is also dramatically regulated by the nitrogen supply of the cell. When nitrogen is limiting, Gln3p and Gat1p are concentrated in the nucleus, bind to the GATA sequences of their target promoters, and activate transcription (8Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F.G. Tong J.K.

On the other hand, when nitrogen is in excess, Gln3p and Gat1p are excluded from the nucleus, and nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)1-sensitive gene expression is repressed. Nuclear exclusion of Gln3p and Gat1p requires Ure2p, the first NCR regulator identified (16Drillen R. Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 203-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Drillen R. Aigle M.

The mechanistic details of the signal transduction pathway associated with Gln3p and Gat1p controls, however, are not fully understood. Some investigators (12Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) report Sit4p phosphatase is required for dephosphorylation of Gln3p, its nuclear entry, and NCR-sensitive gene expression, whereas others (8Hardwick J.S.

Di Como C.J. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) cannot demonstrate Sit4p participation in Gln3p phosphorylation, localization, and control. Similarly, Cardenas et al. (14Cardenas M.E. Cutler N.S. Lorenz M.C. Di Como C.J. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and Hardwicket al.

Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Although all in the field agree that Ure2p complexes with Gln3p and Gat1p, the cause-effect relationships of Gln3p phosphorylation, Ure2p-Gln3p complex formation, and the preeminent determinant of Gln3p nuclear exclusion remain to be established. Establishing the cause-effect relationships associated with Ure2p control of Gln3p and Gat1p localization require a more detailed understanding of these proteins. Ure2p structure has been studied in detail (26Umland T.C. Taylor K.L. Rhee S. Wickner R.B. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The N-terminal asparagine-rich prion domain (amino acids 1–65) is primarily, although not exclusively, required for prion formation, whereas the C-terminal region (amino acids 66–354) complements a ure2 null mutation for growth requiring ureidosuccinate uptake by an NCR-sensitive permease (19Masison D.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1995; 270: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). For Gln3p, three functional regions have been identified as follows: a C2 X 17C2 zinc finger motif (residues 306–330) that binds to GATA sequences (29Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), a predicted α-helical motif that mediates transcriptional activation (residues 126–138) (30Svetlov V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7644-7652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a large C-terminal region (residues 510–720) that associates with Tor1p (13Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C.

Our purpose here is to identify sequences required: (i) for nuclear-import of Gln3p, i.e. the nuclear localization signal (NLS); (ii) for Gln3p to interact with Ure2p; and (iii) for Ure2p to interact with Gln3p. The strains we used are listed in Table I.

Auxotrophic requirements were supplemented as necessary. Transformants of GYC86 were induced by adding galactose (final concentration, 4%). Transformants of TCY57 were induced by transferring washed cells to YNB galactose (4%), ammonia (0.5%) medium. Cultures were induced for 3 or more hours. For β-galactosidase assays YNB (0.17% YNB without casamino acids, 2% glucose, and 0.1% appropriate nitrogen source) medium was used.Table IStrains and plasmids used in this workStrainGenotypeS. cerevisiaeGYC86MATahis3 leu2 trp1 ura3/MATα his3 leu2 trp1 ura3TCY57Matα lys2 ura3 trp1::hisG leu2::hisG GAL1,10-URE2RR912Matα lys2 ura3 gln3Δ::hisG trp1Δ::hisG his3Δ::hisGSTCY32MATa lys5 ura3 trp1Δ::hisG his3Δ::hisGBY4742MATα his3D1 leu2D0 lys2D0 ura3D0E. coliDH5α[F/endA1 hsdr17(rK−mK+) supE44 thi1 recA1 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169 (m80lacZΔ1M15)]PlasmidCharacteristicspKA10GFP-Gln3p-(1–301)pKA14GFP-Gln3p-(1–365)pKA42GFP-Gln3p-(1–487)pKA17GFP-Gln3p-(1–542)pKA24GFP-Gln3p-(1–680)PKA 21GFP-Gln3p-(1–710)pRR482GFP-Gln3p-(1–730) (full length) (15)pKA26GFP-Gln3p-(103–493)pKA27GFP-Gln3p-(187–493)pKA30GFP-Gln3p-(256–493)pKA34GFP-Gln3p-(297–493)pKA36GFP-Gln3p-(344–493)pKA38GFP-Gln3p-(384–493)pKA52GFP-Gln3p-(344–493) S344A, S347A, S355ApKA56GFP-Gln3p-(344–493) S344D, S347D, S355DpKA53GFP-Gln3p-(344–493) K352E, R353E, K357E, R358EpRR312Containing coding region of Gln3p, AmpRpNVS2GAL1,10 promoter eGFP, URA3, AmpR (33)pHS18–34LexA-lacZ reporter plasmid (33, 44)pEG202LexA 2 µm plasmid, HIS3, AmpR (33, 44)pAA15LexA-Ure2p-(1–354) (full length)pAA107LexA-Ure2p-(1–346)pAA113LexA-Ure2p-(1–330)pAA112LexA-Ure2p-(1–315)pAA106LexA-Ure2p-(1–300)pAA105LexA-Ure2p-(1–275)pAA104LexA-Ure2p-(1–250)pAA103LexA-Ure2p-(1–200)pAA102LexA-Ure2p-(1–150)pAA101LexA-Ure2p-(1–100)pAA100LexA-Ure2p-(1–65)pAA110LexA-Ure2p-(66–354)pAA114LexA-Ure2p-(101–354)pAA115LexA-Ure2p-(151–354)pAA116LexA-Ure2p-(201–354)pAA117LexA-Ure2p-(201–354)pAA118LexA-Ure2p-(276–354)pRD17Containing upstream sequence and coding region of Ure2p (53Coffman J.A.

Images were irradiated with a combination of white and/or epi-fluorescent light, viewed using the 63× objective of a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a GFP filter set and collected with a Zeiss Axiocam digital camera using AxioVision 2.0.5.3 software. Photographs were imported into Photoshop 4.0. Transformants were prepared and assayed, including numbers of independent transformants assayed and variation in observed results, as described (34Smart W.C. Coffman J.A. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5876-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared (11Daugherty J.R. Rai R. El Berry H.M. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 64-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and hybridization reactions were performed as described (11Daugherty J.R. Rai R. El Berry H.M. Cooper T.G. J.

Yeast. 1999; 15: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Intracellular localization is the preeminent control of Gln3p activity. To identify the Gln3p NLS, we constructed GFP-Gln3 C-terminal truncation proteins (Fig. 1,upper portion). To ensure GFP-Gln3p retained normal function, a gln3Δ was transformed with GFP-GLN3pRR482. Complementation of the gln3Δ, measured as the ability to support DAL5 expression, was efficient even when Gln3p was expressed at very low levels (Fig.2, lane A). A minor species migrates just ahead of the DAL5 transcript. We don't know its identity for sure, but its presence in both lanes eliminates the possibility that it is DAL5 mRNA because DAL5expression does not occur in a gln3Δ (35Cooper T.G. Ferguson D. Rai R. Bysani N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2,lane B).Figure 2Complementation of a gln3Δby EGFP-GLN3. Cultures of strain RR912 (gln3Δ), transformed with either vector pNVS2 or GFP-GLN3 pRR482, were grown in minimal glucose/proline medium. Total RNA from these cultures was prepared and resolved in a Northern blot. A full-length DAL5 gene was used as probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) GFP-Gln3p truncation plasmids were transformed into wild type strain GYC86, and their intracellular distribution was evaluated using epifluorescence microscopy. GFP-Gln3 truncation proteins containing 365 or more N-terminal amino acids were concentrated in the nucleus (Fig.3, left two columns). The transformants did not, however, behave identically. Greater cytoplasmic localization occurred with truncations GFP-Gln3p-(1–710) (pKA21) and GFP-Gln3p-(1–680) (pKA24) than with GFP-Gln3p-(1–542) (pKA17) and GFP-Gln3p-(1–487) (pKA42). The extent of cytoplasmic localization increased again with GFP-Gln3p-(1–365) (pKA14) even though nuclear concentration of GFP-Gln3p was clearly visible in all of the transformants just mentioned. Nuclear concentration of GFP-Gln3p was lost when residues between 301 (pKA10) and 365 (pKA14) were removed (Fig. 3, left two columns). In fact, fluorescent material can clearly be seen to be excluded from nuclei in cells where DNA is situated in the neck between mother and daughter (Fig. 3, left two columns, pKA10 arrows). These data argue the NLS C terminus is between Gln3p residues 301 and 365. A similar approach localized the N terminus of the Gln3p NLS (Fig. 1, lower portion). Fluorescent material was largely nuclear in Gln3p N-terminal truncations to residues 102 (pKA26), 186 (pKA27), 255 (pKA30), 296 (pKA34), and 343 (pKA36) (Fig.4, left two columns). However, truncation to amino acid 383 (pKA38) resulted in loss of nuclear localization (Fig. 4, left two columns), localizing the N terminus of the Gln3p NLS between residues 344 and 384.Figure 4Intracellular localization of N-terminally truncated EGFP-Gln3 proteins. GAL1,10-EGFP-GLN3deletion plasmids (Fig. 1) were transformed into WT GCY86 (left two columns of images) and TCY57 (right two columns of images), which expresses GAL1,10-URE2 at high levels. Transformants were assayed as in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The most likely NLS candidate in Gln3p region 301–384 is 343LSLKSDVIKKRISKKRAK360which possesses significant similarity to other documented NLSs (36Cokol M. Nair R. Rost B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar,37Young M.R. Suzuki K. Yan H. Gibson S. Tye B.K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To establish whether this region was responsible for Gln3p nuclear localization, we assayed a peptide (344–493, pKA36) in which basic residues Lys-352, Arg-353, Lys-357, and Arg-358 were changed to glutamate (pKA53). Fluorescent material concentrates in the nuclei of wild type (pKA36) transformants, whereas it is cytoplasmic with mutant pKA53 (Fig. 5). Work in several well studied nuclear transport systems suggests NLS function can be regulated by phosphorylation (38Azuma Y. Takio K. Tabb M.M. Vu L. Nomura M.

Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Since increased Gln3p phosphorylation correlates with its nuclear exclusion, and Gln3p-(344–365) contains a potential PKA-modification site, we first determined whether Ser-344, Ser-347, and Ser-355 were themselves required for nuclear localization by changing them to alanine (pKA52). Nuclear localization of Gln3pS344A,S347A,S355A is diminished minimally if at all (Fig. 5). If, on the other hand, these serines are changed to negatively charged aspartates (pKA56), nuclear localization is barely detectable (Fig. 5). It is well established that Gln3p/Gat1p and Ure2p form a complex in vivo and in vitro (8Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F.G. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, overproduction of Ure2p results in loss of NCR-sensitive gene expression, nuclear exclusion of GFP-Gln3p and GFP-Gat1p, with the concomitant formation of highly punctate fluorescent foci identical to those seen with GFP-Ure2p (9Cunningham T.S.

We transformed C-terminal GFP-Gln3p deletion plasmids described in the left two columns of Fig. 3 intoGAL1,10-URE2 strain TCY57 (9Cunningham T.S. Andhare R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol.

In contrast to data obtained with the wild type strain, none of the truncated GFP-Gln3 proteins were concentrated in the nucleus; all localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, right two columns). In fact, GFP-Gln3p was clearly excluded from many nuclei situated in the neck between mother and daughter cells (Fig. 3, right two columns, arrows). Furthermore, punctate foci similar to those previously seen with GFP-Ure2p or GFP-Gln3p in the presence of highURE2 expression (9Cunningham T.S. Andhare R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol.

To localize further the Ure2p interaction site of Gln3p, we transformed TCY57 with the N-terminal Gln3p deletion plasmids described in theleft two columns of Fig. 4 (Fig. 4, right two columns). GFP-Gln3p was nuclear in all cases except pKA38 which lacked the NLS. Therefore, N terminus of the Gln3p region required for its interaction with Ure2p is between amino acids 1 and 103 and the C terminus is N-terminal to 301. To identify the Ure2p residues required for interaction with Gln3p, we set-up a two-hybrid assay (Fig. 6A) withNLS-lexA-URE2 pAA15,lexAoperator-lacZ pHS18–34, and aGLN3-B42 plasmid (33Scott S.

To our initial surprise, transformants of wild type cells, containing only the bait and reporter plasmids (pAA15 plus pHS18–34) produce high level β-galactosidase (Fig.7).

PKCθ was shown to co-localize selectively with the TCR to the T cell synapse when antigen-specific T cells are engaged by their physiological ligand (2Monks C.R. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N.

Functional studies of PKCθ revealed an early and essential role in the TCR/CD28-induced stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/AP-1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells but also the IKKβ/I-κB/NF-κB signaling cascade (for review see Ref. 6Altman A. Isakov N. Baier G. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Consistently, PKCθ was found to associate with an activated IKK complex in GM1-enriched lipid rafts during TCR/CD28-mediated T cell activation (7Khoshnan A. Bae D. Tindell C.A. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6933-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mouse genetic evidence (employing PKCθ-KO mice (8Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L.

Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar)) identified the TCR/CD3-induced activation of NF-κB in the IL-2 gene promoter as the major physiological function of PKCθ; however, its biochemical relevance as well as the manner in which PKCθ becomes coupled to the TCR during antigen stimulation have been largely undefined. Similarly to PKCθ, the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) has been shown to contribute to NF-κB (9Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). In peripheral mouse T cells, Akt could be activated in response to TCR stimulation and led to enhanced NF-κB activation via accelerated degradation of the NF-κB inhibitory protein I-κBα (10Jones R.G. Parsons M. Bonnard M. Chan V.S. Yeh W.C. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1721-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, Akt was shown to be activated enzymatically in TCR/CD3 signal transduction involving Rac and PI3K function (11Genot E.M. Arrieumerlou C. Ku G. Burgering B.M. Weiss A. Kramer I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5469-5478Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Additionally, CD28 ligation has been reported to result in the strong association with, and activation of, PI3K, subsequently recruiting and enzymatically activating Akt in both the leukemic T cell line Jurkat and freshly isolated human peripheral blood-derived normal T lymphocytes (12Parry R.V. Reif K. Smith G. Sansom D.M. Hemmings B.A. Ward S.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Consistently, Akt function was recently shown to provide the CD28 co-stimulatory signal in T cells (13Kane L.P. Andres P.G. Howland K.C. Abbas A.K. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, Akt was not sufficient by itself to induce cytokine promoter and NF-κB reporters in Jurkat T cells, since signals from other pathways, in particular phorbol ester, the pleiotropic PKC activator, were shown to be required (9Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), implicating a functional Akt-PKC connection. PKCθ has been implicated as the prime candidate for PKC function (6Altman A. Isakov N. Baier G. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), including Akt cooperation (13Kane L.P. Andres P.G. Howland K.C. Abbas A.K. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) in T cells; however, the biochemical basis has not been resolved. Here we addressed the detailed relationship between PKCθ and PI3K/Akt in TCR/CD28-mediated signal transduction. Our observations indicate the Akt/PKCθ cooperation as a critical process in TCR/CD28-induced signaling. Consistently, plasma membrane targeting of both PKCθ and Akt (e.g. by recombinant NH2-terminal myristoylation motifs) is sufficient to bypass TCR/CD28 ligation in order to start the IKKβ/Iκ-B/NF-κB-signaling cascade. The results provide evidence for a model of a direct cross-talk between PKCθ and Akt, downstream of TCR/CD3 and CD28 co-receptor, respectively, in the critical NF-κB signaling pathway.

Jurkat T cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transient transfection of cells was performed by electroporation in a BTX T820 ElectroSquarePorator (ITC, Biotech, Heidelberg, Germany) apparatus using predetermined optimal conditions: 2 × 107 cells at 450 V/cm and 5 pulses of 99 ms. Optimix medium (Equibio, Kent, UK) was used for studies of promoter reporter gene expression. 1 × 107 Jurkat T cells per assay point were transfected with 5–20 µg of the various cDNA expression plasmids, encoding CD28 receptor, wild-type or mutant Myr PKCθ, or empty vector controls, as indicated, for subcellular fractionation experiments of PKCθ. After incubation for 21 h the cells were stimulated with solid-phase antibodies against CD3/TCR and/or CD28 for 15 min at 37 °C or left unstimulated. Cell fractionation was performed by subsequent lysis in equivalent amounts of different buffers (without detergent-soluble, s fraction; containing 1% Nonidet P-40-particulate, pt fraction; containing 2% SDS-nonsoluble, ns fraction), as described (15Bauer B. Krumbock N. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Kampfer S. Villunger A. Wilda M. Hameister H. Utermann G. Leitges M. Uberall F. Baier G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE (4–12%) was performed under reducing conditions on BisTris-buffered gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by semi-dry blotting (90 mA, 80 min, 4 °C). The primary Abs were diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat dry milk for incubation. Peroxidase-conjugated Abs (Pierce) served as secondary Abs (1:5,000). For antigen detection enhanced chemiluminescence was used (SuperSignal, Pierce). Reporter gene expression was measured in co-transfection assays using 5 µg of pSRα-CD28, 15 µg of the expression vector, and 15 µg of the relevant promoter firefly luciferase reporter (RLU1) as described (15Bauer B. Krumbock N. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Kampfer S. Villunger A. Wilda M. Hameister H. Utermann G. Leitges M. Uberall F. Baier G. Eur. J.

After 24 h cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDBu and 1 µg/ml ionomycin or soluble anti-CD28 and anti-TCR IgM (10 µg/ml each) for 16 h or left unstimulated, as indicated. Treatment of synthetic inhibitor compounds, as indicated, has been done at concentrations of 2.5 (MG132) and 25 µm (LY294002) and 50 nm (Gö6850), respectively. 1 × 107Jurkat T cells were co-transfected with 5 µg of pSRα-CD28 and Akt-wt expression vector. After 24 h cells were stimulated with solid-phase antibodies against CD3/TCR and/or CD28 for 15 min at 37 °C or left unstimulated, and subsequently were lysed in 1 ml of 5 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 µg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin. For in vitroco-immunoprecipitation analysis, 4 µg of baculo-expressed proteins were incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer (5 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 µg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were precleared for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of PKCθ or Akt, respectively, was performed at 4 °C overnight using relevant antibodies. Thereafter incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C, extensive washing in lysis buffer, SDS-PAGE, and immunostaining for the relevant protein were done. PKCθ and Akt phosphorylation was measured by incorporation of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP incubating 200 ng of the highly purified baculovirus-expressed recombinant proteins in 20 µl (final volume) of reaction mixture (16 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.3 mmMnCl2, 13 mm MgCl2, 10 µm ATP, 0.5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 nm Gö6850, as indicated) for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5× SDS sample buffer (0.3125m Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, and 25% β-mercaptoethanol), and phosphorylation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. Initially, the distinct role(s) of TCR/CD3 and/or CD28 in engagement of endogenous PKCθ in Jurkat as well as peripheral T cells were investigated. As a first result, ligation of TCR/CD3 was shown to be sufficient to result in maximal plasma membrane recruitment of PKCθ in Jurkat T cells (using both IgG as well as IgM-agonistic antibody clones coupled to beads). CD28 co-cross-linking did not significantly enhance TCR/CD3-induced PKCθ membrane translocation (Fig. 1), even after recombinant CD28 overexpression (not shown). However, and in part consistent with a previous report (17Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar), soluble anti-CD3 antibodies proved less effective in inducing PKCθ plasma membrane recruitment (not shown). Next, and more importantly, PKCθ in situ activity was monitored, employing anti-phospho-(p)PKCθ immunoblotting of endogenous PKCθ immunoprecipitates derived from whole cell extracts. The PKCθ autophosphorylation-specific antibody used and characterized in this study selectively recognized PKCθ in its active state. Phorbol ester stimulation induced a marked immunoreactivity of endogenous PKCθ in isolated human PBMCs (Fig.2A). Consistently, phorbol ester induced rapid immunoreactivity of highly purified recombinant enzyme preparations in in vitro autophosphorylation assays (Fig. 2 B). This activation-induced phospho-status of PKCθ was shown to be dependent on the catalytic activity of PKCθ; only immunoprecipitates of transiently overexpressed and phorbol ester activated wild-type (wt) but not kinase-dead mutant PKCθK409R enzyme were recognized by this phosphospecific PKCθ antibody (Fig.2 C). Finally, the established CA mutant PKCθA148E (14Baier-Bitterlich G. Uberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) exhibited a constitutive high level of phosphorylation, as detected by this anti-(p)PKCθ antibody, independent of any activation stimulus (Fig. 2 C). Employing this anti-active-(p)PKCθ antibody, the distinct role(s) of TCR/CD3 and/or CD28 engagement in the phosphorylation status of endogenous PKCθ in T cells were investigated. Although, Jurkat T cells exhibited some basal levels of endogenous PKCθ phosphorylation, it was significantly induced upon TCR/CD3 or PDBu control stimulation (Fig. 2 D). However, and consistent to data in Fig. 1, PKCθ phosphorylation did not show any significant dependence on CD28 co-stimulation in these cells, even after recombinant CD28 overexpression (not shown). Similarly, ligation of CD3 (but not CD28) significantly induced phosphorylation of endogenous PKCθ in human PBMCs (not shown). Taken together, stimulation via the TCR/CD3 receptor, similar to PDBu stimulation, results in the marked cytosol-to-membrane translocation and in situ catalytic activation, as determined by the autophosphorylation status of PKCθ in T cells. As reported previously, only PKCθA148E by itself (but none of other CA mutants of T cell-expressed PKC isoforms) was sufficient to stimulate the NF-κB reporter in Jurkat T cells (15Bauer B.

Grunicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since among those cells, only Jurkat T cells demonstrate complete loss-of-function in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (19Shan X. Czar M.J. Bunnell S.C. Liu P. Liu Y. Schwartzberg P.L. Wange R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6945-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), an established negative regulator of PI3K signaling (20Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar), we next investigated potential functional interaction of PKCθA148E and PI3K signal transduction. Additionally, PI3K is an established major signaling molecule downstream of the CD28 (21Ward S.G. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 1999; 47: 69-75PubMed Google Scholar), the co-receptor shown to be functionally required for maximal NF-κB transactivation (for review see Ref. 6Altman A. Isakov N. Baier G. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). By using two independent approaches, i.e. PTEN functional reconstitution of PTEN-deficient Jurkat T cells and pharmacological PI3K inhibition, we demonstrated that endogenous PI3K activity is required for PKCθ-mediated NF-κB transactivation. First, PKCθA148E function was markedly inhibited by PTEN expression as compared with an inert protein expression control (Fig.3A). Second, treatment of LY294002, a selective PI3K inhibitor, abrogated NF-κB transactivation (Fig. 3 A) as well as the established PKCθA148E/CaN-induced IL-2 promoter induction (Fig. 3 B), (22Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 23Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Bauer B. Villunger A. Baier-Bitterlich G. Altman A. Utermann G. Uberall F. Baier G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In order to define the PH-containing signaling protein acting downstream of PI3K, Akt wt and Akt mutants have been employed to investigate the NF-κB signaling cascade(s) induced by PKCθ. As shown in Fig. 3 C, kinase-active Akt overexpression enhanced the effect of PKCθ. In this respect, the Akt PH domain appears indispensable for PKCθ cooperation, since a PH deletion mutant of Akt completely failed to enhance PKCθ-mediated NF-κB induction (Fig. 3 C). This may indicate the Akt PH domain is critical for the PKCθ interaction, similar to a reported Akt-PKCδ interaction (24Konishi H. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Conversely, DN mutants of Akt inhibited PKCθA148E-induced NF-κB activity. The biological relevance of this inhibition is confirmed by the finding that a DN-Akt also significantly reduced the activation-induced NF-κB signal (Fig.4B). Expression of combinations of CA mutant PKCθA148E and defined wild-type and mutant IKKβ proteins, the established downstream effector of PKCθ (7Khoshnan A. Bae D. Tindell C.A. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6933-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lin X. O'Mahony A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), demonstrated comparable results in parallel experiments (Fig. 3 D). Overexpression of IKKβ wt enhanced the effect of PKCθ. Consistently, the DN mutants IKKβK/M and (as a positive control) PKCθK409R inhibited PKCθA148E action, respectively. An involvement of Rac1 GTPase function in the PKCθA148E-mediated NF-κB induction has also been found (Fig.3 B and see Ref. 5Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixeiro E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Combined, PKCθ action appeared to be functionally mediated via Akt and IKKβ induction, the latter also shown by IKKβ kinase complex assays (17Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lin X. O'Mahony A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Additionally and to define further PKC subfamily involved in Akt-mediated NF-κB induction, Jurkat T cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding Akt as well as representative CA-PKC mutant isoforms, e.g. PKCα, -ε, -θ, and -ζ. These experiments identify predominantly PKCθ but also at a reduced level PKCε (but not PKCα & ζ) as PKC isoenzymes capable to cooperate with Akt in Jurkat T cells (not shown). In this regard, a role of PKCε in NF-κB signal induction has been described previously (25Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Next, overexpression experiments of wt and DN mutants of PKCθ and Akt in phorbol ester/ionomycin-stimulated Jurkat T cells identified both PKCθ and Akt as predominant mediators of NF-κB activation. Overexpression of wt enzymes of PKCθ or Akt led to 4-fold increase of activation-induced NF-κB activity over that obtained in vector controls (Fig. 4 A). Consistently, expression of kinase-dead PKCθ K409R or Akt triple mutant K179A,T308A,S473A, both shown to act in a dominant negative fashion in intact cells (9Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 14Baier-Bitterlich G. Uberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), significantly reduced the activation-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, reduced effects were obtained under more physiological conditions, since expression of DN mutants of Akt and PKCθ were able to decrease the CD3/CD28-induced NF-κB signal. However, no complete inhibition could be achieved most likely due to multiple converging signals. Consistently, co-expression of both PKCθ wt and Akt wt did further enhance the CD3/CD28-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 4 B). As a next step, we investigated whether Akt is a potential downstream substrate of PKCθ.In vitro complex kinase assays showed that the phosphorylation status of neither PKCθ nor Akt was prominently affected by each other (Fig.5A). PKC transphosphorylation-specific inhibitor Gö6850 (which does not affect PKCθ-autophosphorylation) 2B. Bauer, unpublished observations. did not decrease (but rather increased) Akt phosphorylation status, excluding PKCθ as a prominent protein kinase of Akt. More importantly, no increase of Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation could be observed in PKCθA148E-transfected cells compared with the control (Fig. 5 B). Vice versa, in vitrophosphorylation of PKCθ was not modulated by Akt (both preactivated or not by PDK1 at Thr308) (Fig. 5 A). Co-expression of neither Myr-Akt nor DN-Akt mutants in Jurkat T cells showed any modulation of phosphorylation of Myr-PKCθ (Fig.5 C). Consistently, phorbol ester-induced autophosphorylation of endogenous PKCθ protein was unaffected by DN-Akt expression (Fig.5 D). Activation of PI3K frequently involves the PIP3-mediated recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane, similar to the TCR/CD3-induced translocation of PKCθ (see Fig. 1). Thus, it was tempting to speculate that a physical interaction may underlie the observed functional cooperation of these two protein kinases. To assess this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation of PKCθ and Aktin vitro as well as in intact cells. As a result, purified recombinant Akt (both preactivated or not by PDK1 at Thr308) was found to associate with purified recombinant PKCθ in vitro indicating a direct physical PKCθ-Akt interaction (Fig. 6A). Consistently, reverse co-immunoprecipitation confirmed this association (Fig. 6 B); however, a minor nonspecific PKCθ fraction has been repeatedly found to stick to the beads independently of immunoprecipitated Akt (Fig. 6 B, compare the 3rd lane to the 1st and 2nd lanes). In Jurkat T cells the association of Akt with endogenous PKCθ was found to be constitutive (Fig. 6 C). Identically, no modulation of this constitutive Akt/PKCθ interaction by TCR/CD28 or PDBu stimulation was observed in reverse immunoprecipitation results (not shown). Combined, these observations demonstrate that PKCθ and Akt associate in preformed complexes in vivo; however, enzymatic activities of neither Akt nor PKCθ appear to be significantly modulated by each other. We therefore speculated that the observed PKCθ-Akt interaction may specify cellular location and impose integration with other signaling systems, e.g. local substrate availability as well as exposure to allosteric activators. To examine further the role of plasma membrane recruitment of PKCθ in the TCR/CD3 signal transduction pathway, we prepared a constitutively membrane-bound PKCθ derivative, Myr-PKCθ, containing an NH2-terminal myristoylation signal (Fig.7A). Similar myristoylation signal protein modifications have been made successfully for PKCα (26James G. Olson E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and -ζ isoenzymes (27Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression in Jurkat T cells revealed substantial plasma membrane targeting but also accumulation in the detergent- ns fraction of Myr-PKCθ shown by cellular fractionation (Fig. 7 B) as well as immunofluorescence analysis in ectopic expression studies (not shown). In contrast, CA-PKCθA149E mutant was found to reside predominantly in the ns fraction (Fig. 7 B). This subcellular location indicated its different nature of activation, as observed by its high transactivation capability (Fig. 7 C). Additionally, accumulation of activat"

This is accomplished in a two-step process. In the first step, the cognate amino acid is activated with ATP to form the aminoacyl-adenylate. In the second step, the amino acid is transferred to the 3′-end of the cognate tRNA (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases must ensure that the relationship between anticodon and amino acid is faithfully maintained (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). It is expected that the selection of the correct amino acid is more error-prone than the selection of the cognate tRNA isoacceptor group, because the amino acid is a much smaller molecule with fewer distinguishing features (2Fersht A.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1981; 212: 351-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Misactivation of amino acids can be corrected in several ways. In pretransfer editing, the noncognate aminoacyl-adenylate is hydrolyzed by the synthetase in an ATP-dependent manner, and in many cases this activity is stimulated by the presence of the cognate tRNA (3Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In post-transfer editing, a mischarged tRNA is deacylated in an ATP-independent manner (3Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetases may possess one or both types of editing activities and, in some cases, lack an editing function altogether. In general, amino acid editing has been less well characterized than tRNA recognition. However, there are several well studied editing systems, especially among class I synthetases. For example, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS)1 misactivates valine and hydrolyzes misactivated Val-AMP as well as mischarged Val-tRNAIle (4Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol.

The CP1 domain of both of these enzymes has been shown to be responsible for editing threonine in the case of ValRS and isoleucine and methionine in the case of LeuRS (8Lin L. Hale S.P. Schimmel P.

Recent structural and biochemical work showed that the N-terminal domain of E. coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) is responsible for editing mischarged Ser-tRNAThr(23Dock-Bregeon A. Sankaranarayanan R. Romby P. Caillet J. Springer M. Rees B. Francklyn C. Ehresmann C. Moras D. Cell. 2000; 103: 877-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This class II synthetase uses an active site Zn2+ ion to prevent misactivation of isosteric, but hydrophobic, valine (24Sankaranarayanan R. Dock-Bregeon A.-C. Rees B. Bovee M. Caillet J. Romby P. Francklyn C.S. Moras D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, this Zn2+ ion cannot prevent the activation of serine, whose hydroxyl group is able to bind to the metal ion. Thus, in the absence of the N-terminal editing domain, the misactivated seryl-adenylate is charged onto tRNAThr (24Sankaranarayanan R. Dock-Bregeon A.-C. Rees B. Bovee M. Caillet J. Romby P. Francklyn C.S. Moras D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is highly conserved among ThrRSs from all species except archaebacteria, and to date, ThrRSs from both E. coliand yeast have been shown to edit serine (23Dock-Bregeon A.

Sternbach H. Cramer F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We recently showed that another class II synthetase, E. coli prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS), misactivates noncognate amino acids, including alanine (26Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The side chain of alanine is smaller than that of proline and could easily be accommodated in the amino acid binding pocket of ProRS. Indeed, this enzyme possesses both pre- and post-transfer editing activity against alanine, because it has been shown to hydrolyze misactivated Ala-AMP in a tRNA-independent fashion and to rapidly deacylate a mischarged Ala-tRNAPro variant (26Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The family of ProRSs can be sorted into two phylogenetically distinct groups based on their primary structures (27Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Krikliviy I. Tukalo M. Structure. 1998; 6: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The “prokaryotic-like” group, consisting of prokaryotic and putative eukaryotic mitochondrial enzymes, is characterized by a large insertion domain (185 amino acids in the case of E. coli ProRS) between motifs 2 and 3. In contrast, the “eukaryotic-like” group, consisting of ProRSs from eukarya, archaea, and a few bacteria, lacks the prokaryotic insertion domain but instead has a C-terminal extension that is missing in the prokaryotic-like group. Thus, the sorting of ProRSs into two distinct groups does not conform to the canonical phylogenetic division of bacterial and archaeal/eukaryal synthetases (28Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A recent structure-based phylogeny of ProRSs reinforced the notion that there are major differences between the canonical universal tree and ProRS (29Ribas de Pouplana, L., Brown, J. R., and Schimmel, P. (2001)J. Mol. Evol., in press.Google Scholar). In particular, a mixture of ProRS types is found even among closely related species of eubacteria, and lateral transfer within a canonical three-kingdom structure cannot account for the unusual positions of eubacterial and eukaryotic sequences. Using representative ProRSs from all three domains of life, we previously demonstrated species-specific differences in tRNA recognition (28Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Burke B. Yang F., F., C. Stehlin C. Chan B. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15540-15547Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Burke, B., Lipman, R. S. A., Shiba, K., Musier-Forsyth, K., and Hou, Y.-M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., 276.Google Scholar). In particular, whereas anticodon recognition is important for ProRSs from both the prokaryotic-like and eukaryotic-like groups, base-specific acceptor stem recognition is critical only for the prokaryotic-like E. coli enzyme (32Liu H. Peterson R. Kessler J. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, base-specific acceptor stem discrimination is not an important feature of human ProRS, and similarly, the eukaryotic-likeMethanococcus jannaschii ProRS has only modest acceptor stem recognition (31Burke, B., Lipman, R. S. A., Shiba, K., Musier-Forsyth, K., and Hou, Y.-M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., 276.Google Scholar). Thus, the segregation of ProRSs into two evolutionarily divergent groups is reflected in differences in tRNA acceptor stem recognition. Although the editing function of a prokaryotic ProRS has been described (26Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether this function is conserved throughout evolution. The prokaryotic-like insertion domain is similar in size to the CP1 editing domain present in class I IleRS and is a good candidate for an editing domain. However, this domain is missing in the eukaryotic-like group, and the unique C-terminal extension present only in the latter group bears little resemblance to the prokaryotic insertion. Thus, in this work, we chose to study both the human and the archaebacterial M. jannaschii ProRSs as representative eukaryotic-like enzymes. We show that only the archaebacterial synthetase, like the E. coli enzyme, possesses hydrolytic editing activity. Thus, the division of ProRSs into two distinct groups is not strictly correlated with the presence or the absence of amino acid editing functions. All amino acids were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest quality commercially available. Creation of mutant tRNA genes was accomplished using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). RNA was transcribed fromBstN1-linearized plasmid using T7 RNA polymerase as described (28Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Liu H. Yap L.-P. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2523-2524Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Transcripts were gel purified on denaturing 12% polyacrylamide-TBE gels, eluted, and desalted using published conditions (34Liu H. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12708-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Bulk native E. coli tRNA was purchased from Sigma. Bulk native tRNA from M. jannaschii was a gift from Prof. Ya-Ming Hou (Thomas Jefferson University). Overexpression and purification of histidine-tagged E. coli, human, andM. jannaschii ProRS from E. coli cells were performed as described previously (31Burke, B., Lipman, R. S. A., Shiba, K., Musier-Forsyth, K., and Hou, Y.-M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., 276.Google Scholar, 35Heacock D. Forsyth C.J. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Bioorganic Chem. 1996; 24: 273-289Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ATP-PPiexchange reaction was performed according to the published conditions (35Heacock D. Forsyth C.J. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Bioorganic Chem. 1996; 24: 273-289Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For E. coli and human ProRS, the concentration of proline ranged from 0.05–2 mm, whereas with M. jannaschii ProRS the proline range was 0.001–0.5 mm. The alanine concentrations for all three enzymes ranged from 25 to 500 mm. The concentrations of cysteine assayed ranged from 10 to 100 mm. M. jannaschii ProRS concentrations were 1 nm for activation of proline and cysteine, and 61.5 nm for activation of other noncognate amino acids. Human ProRS concentrations were 1 nm for proline and 20 nm for noncognate amino acids. Assays with the E. coli and human enzymes were performed at 37 °C, whereas those with M. jannaschii ProRS were carried out at 60 °C. Kinetic parameters were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots and represent the average of at least three determinations. ATP hydrolysis reactions were performed according to the published procedure (26Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Those reactions with tRNA contained 3–10 µm cognate tRNA. The reactions were initiated with enzyme to give the following final concentrations of ProRS: 0.9 µm (human), 0.5 µm (M. jannaschii), and 1–2 µm (E. coli). The assays with E. coli and human ProRS were performed either at room temperature or at 37 °C, whereas those with M. jannaschii ProRS were carried out at 60 °C. Aminoacylation assays were performed at room temperature according to published conditions (36Musier-Forsyth K. Scaringe S. Usman N. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When charged tRNA was isolated for deacylation assays, all of the amino acid present in the reaction was from a tritiated stock (55 Ci/mmol Ala or 90 Ci/mmol Pro). In some cases, inorganic pyrophosphatase (2 units/ml) was added to increase the extent of mischarging. The assays were first performed to determine the required time to reach plateau levels of aminoacylation. At the desired time, acetic acid was added to 1% final concentration to quench the reaction. The charged tRNA was purified by repeated phenol:CHCl3:isoamyl alcohol (50:48:2) extractions, followed by ethanol precipitation. Phenol was equilibrated against diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Charged tRNA was quantified by scintillation counting and stored at −20 °C in 50 mm KPO4, pH 5.0. Mischarging assays were carried out using the standard conditions, with the exception of the enzyme and tRNA concentrations. In these experiments, 5.0 µm tRNA was used along with the following concentrations of ProRS: 4.4 µm (M. jannaschii), 2.0 µm (human), and 5.3 µm (E. coli). Assays with E. coliand human ProRS were performed at room temperature, whereas assays withM. jannaschii ProRS were carried out at 60 °C. The deacylation reactions were performed as described (26Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and contained 0.1–1.0 µm charged tRNA in a final reaction volume of 70 µl. The reactions were carried out at 24 °C and were initiated with human ProRS (2.0 µm) or with NaOH (0.12 n) as a positive control. Negative controls were identical to these reactions except with enzyme omitted. The reactions with M. jannaschii ProRS (4.4 µm) were performed at 37 °C. At each time point, 10-µl aliquots were removed, and the reactions were quenched on Whatman 3MM filter pads, which had been presoaked with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The pads were immediately dropped into ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and washed as described for aminoacylation assays (36Musier-Forsyth K. Scaringe S. Usman N. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All 20 amino acids were tested in the ATP-PPi exchange reaction for activation byE. coli, M. jannaschii, and human ProRS. All three enzymes activate select noncognate amino acids to varying extents. We previously found that E. coli ProRS activates alanine, with significantly decreased k cat and elevated K m (26Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The overall reduction in efficiency of activation of alanine relative to proline by the E. coli enzyme is ∼104-fold. Similary, human andM. jannaschii ProRSs activate alanine, albeit with ∼105-fold reduced efficiency relative to cognate proline (Table I). Therefore, based solely on the relative catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of alanine activation, both eukaryotic-like ProRSs examined in this study are approximately 1 order of magnitude more accurate in the initial selection of cognate amino acid than E. coli ProRS. All three enzymes activate other amino acids, most notably glycine, to a measurable extent (data not shown).Table IKinetic parameters for activation of proline and alanine by E. coli, M. jannaschii, and human ProRSProRS speciesAmino acidk catK mk cat/K mk cat/K m(relative)1-akcat/K mis relative to proline in each set, which was set at 1.0.

Bioorganic Chem. 1996; 24: 273-289Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar. Open table in a new tab Cysteine was also activated quite well by all three enzymes, a phenomenon that has been observed in other systems (37Freist W. Sternbach H. Pardowitz I. Cramer F. J. Theor. Biol. 1998; 193: 19-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Based on initial rates of cysteine activation, we estimated that the ProRSs examined here activate cysteine with the following relativek cat/K m: 0.23 (E. coli), 0.026 (M. jannaschii), and 0.064 (human). These numbers are relative to proline activation by the respective ProRS. Thus, reductions in catalytic efficiency for cysteine activation by these three enzymes, assayed under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” range from only ∼4-fold for theE. coli enzyme to ∼38-fold for the M. jannaschii enzyme. That M. jannaschii ProRS can activate cysteine either in a tRNA-independent (38Lipman R.S.A. Sowers K.R. Hou Y.-M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7792-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or tRNA-dependent fashion (39Stathopoulos C. Li T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H.D. Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 2000; 287: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) has been previously noted. All kinetic parameters for amino acid activation reported here were determined in the absence of tRNA. Attempts to mischarge wild-type E. coli tRNAPro with alanine using E. coli ProRS were unsuccessful (Fig.1) (26Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In fact, we estimate that aminoacylation with alanine is at least 3.2 × 105-fold reduced compared with charging with cognate proline. This may be due to efficient pre- and post-transfer editing of alanine by E. coli ProRS (26Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Human ProRS is able to mischarge alanine onto tRNAPro detectably but at a level that is over 2.9 × 104-fold reduced compared with cognate charging. Interestingly, M. jannaschii ProRS mischarges tRNAPro with alanine at a rate that is only 6,800-fold reduced relative to charging with proline (Fig. 1). We also detected mischarging with cysteine of a tRNAPro transcript with M. jannaschii ProRS (TableII). The latter activity is examined in more detail in a separate report. 2R. S. A. Lipman, J. Wang, and Y.-M. Hou, submitted for publication.

ND is “not determined”. ATP hydrolysis is diagnostic of pretransfer hydrolytic editing (3Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the E. colienzyme (26Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), M. jannaschii ProRS stimulates ATP hydrolysis activity with the noncognate amino acid alanine (Fig.2 A) but, as expected, not in the presence of proline. As we previously determined for the E. coli enzyme, M. jannaschii ProRS also stimulates ATP hydrolysis in the presence of the proline analogs cis- andtrans-4-hydroxyproline. Only a very low level of ATP hydrolysis is observed in the presence of the four-membered ring analog of proline, azetidine-4-carboxylic acid, similar to the result obtained with E. coli ProRS (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the M. jannaschii enzyme parallels the E. coli enzyme in its pretransfer editing activity. M. jannaschii ProRS has been reported to possess dual specificity, activating cysteine and aminoacylating tRNACys, in addition to its normal proline-specific activity (38Lipman R.S.A. Sowers K.R. Hou Y.-M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7792-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 39Stathopoulos C. Li T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H.D. Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 2000; 287: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In accordance with this dual specificity and in agreement with a recent independent report,2 we do not detect significant pretransfer editing against cysteine by M. jannaschii ProRS (Fig. 2 A). Human ProRS was also tested for its ability to stimulate ATP hydrolysis in the presence of noncognate amino acids. With the exception of very weak activity in the presence of cysteine, no significant stimulation was observed with any of the amino acids tested (Fig. 2 B). In particular, in contrast to the results obtained with the E. coli and M. jannaschii ProRSs, alanine is not edited by the human enzyme. As we had previously reported for E. coli ProRS (26Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar"
https://openalex.org/W2062473966,"Apoptosis is a physiological counterbalance to mitosis and plays important roles in tissue development and homeostasis. Cytosolic Ca2+ has been implicated as a proapoptotic second messenger involved in both triggering apoptosis and regulating cell death-specific enzymes. A critical early event in apoptosis is associated with the redistribution of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes; however, the molecular mechanism of Bax translocation and its relationship to Ca2+ is largely unknown. Here we provide functional evidence for a synergistic interaction between the movements of intracellular Ca2+ and cytosolic Bax in the induction of apoptosis. Overexpression of Bax in cultured cells causes a loss of ER Ca2+ content. Depletion of ER Ca2+through activation of the ryanodine receptor enhances the participation of Bax into the mitochondrial membrane. Neither Bax translocation nor Bax-induced apoptosis is affected by buffering of cytosolic Ca2+ with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, suggesting that depletion of ER Ca2+ rather than elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ is the signal for cell apoptosis. This dynamic interplay of Ca2+ and Bax movements may serve as an amplifying factor in the initial signaling steps of apoptosis.

The Bcl-2 family members are active mediators of apoptosis that either inhibit (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) or facilitate (e.g. Bax, Bad, Bak, Bid, Bik/Nbk, and Bim) apoptotic cell death (3Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 4Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). The proapoptotic Bax proteins are largely cytosolic or loosely associate with intracellular membranes (5Hsu Y.-T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). After an appropriate death signal, Bax targets and integrates into intracellular membranes, especially the mitochondrial outer membrane, which induces opening of the permeability transition pore, release of cytochrome c, and activation of downstream caspase pathways (6Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5991-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Pawlowski J.

Recent studies have shown that this process may involve Bax dimerization or oligomerization and conformational changes (9Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanism by which Bax is activated to translocate from cytosol to the intracellular membrane has not been elucidated. Several studies have suggested that changes in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis play an important role in the modulation of apoptosis. Many cell death stimuli including growth factor withdrawal, hormonal stimulation, and drug treatment are known to alter the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytosol and the storage of Ca2+ in the intracellular organelles (12Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kaiser N. Edelman I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Compounds that directly affect the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and capacitative Ca2+ entry such as Ca2+ ionophores and thapsigargin (TG)1 have been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cells (15Wei H. Wei W. Bredesen D.E. Perry D.C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Reynolds J.E. Li J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Ca2+-release channels in the ER, i.e. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and ryanodine receptor (RyR), seem to participate in the signal transduction pathway of apoptosis (17Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 18Guo G. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Matson M.P. J.

Furthermore, recent evidence shows that Bcl-2 may suppress apoptosis via a mechanism that is linked to intracellular Ca2+ compartmentalization (20Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E. Cortopassi G. Wang E. Fiskum G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9893-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 21Ichimiya M. Chang S.H. Liu H. Berezesky I.K. Trump B.F. Amstad P.A. Am. J.

Our previous study demonstrated that depletion of ER Ca2+by caffeine and ryanodine through the activation of RyR/Ca2+-release channels induces apoptosis in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with RyR, and Bcl-xL prevents cell death at a stage downstream of ER Ca2+ release and capacitative Ca2+ entry (23Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.-L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the functional interplay between Ca2+ and proapoptotic Bcl-2 members in apoptosis, e.g. Bax, has not been studied. Here we report that overexpression of Bax affected the ER Ca2+homeostasis, and perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ could feed back to the translocation process of Bax. Our data suggest a synergistic action between the movements of Bax and Ca2+ in the initiation of apoptosis. Stable clones of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells permanently expressing RyR and Bcl-xL proteins were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (23Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.-L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To eliminate possible bias caused by antibiotic selection, the control cells (CHO-WT) and cells stably expressing RyR (CHO-RyR) were transfected with mock pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) and subjected to double selection with G418 (0.5 mg/ml) and hygromycin (0.26 mg/ml) in the same way as cells co-expressing RyR and Bcl-xL (RyR-xL). The cDNA of the mouseBax gene was cloned into the pCMS-EGFP expression vector (CLONTECH) with transcription driven by the CMV promoter. The pCMS-EGFP plasmid also contains a separate SV40-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence, providing a convenient way of selecting cells transiently transfected withBax and GFP genes. The GFP-Bax fusion construct was cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector. Plasmids carrying Bax or GFP-Bax cDNAs were introduced into CHO cells using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagents following manufacturer instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The plasmid containing GFP alone was used as control. Transient expressions of Bax and GFP-Bax proteins were assayed 10–36 h after gene transfection by confocal microscopy and Western blot. For subcellular localization of transiently expressed GFP-Bax, CHO cells were grown on glass-bottomed ΔTC3 dishes (Bioptechs, Inc., Butler, PA) and visualized with a Zeiss LSM-510 laser scanning microscope using a Plan-Apochromat ×63 oil or C-Apochromat ×40 water immersion objective (24Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.W. Ma J. Nieminen A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) was used to label the mitochondria. 18 h after transfection with GFP-Bax, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were incubated for 1 h with PBS containing 2% normal goat serum, 2 h with the anti-COX IV monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:100 in PBS + 5% normal goat serum), and developed with tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, 1:1000 dilution). Relative green and red channels of the LSM-510 were used to observe the fluorescence of GFP-Bax and mitochondrial marker protein. The cell death process was monitored by Hoechst 33442 staining of the cell nucleus as described (23Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.-L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown in ΔTC3 dishes and loaded with 2 µm Fura-2 AM fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. The changes in intracellular Ca2+ were measured with a dual wavelength excitation (340 and 380 nm, emission at 510 nm) spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Inc.). The release of intracellular Ca2+ in individual cells was measured after exposure to caffeine, ryanodine, ATP, or thapsigargin in a Ca2+-free balanced salt solution (140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.2) by rapid solution exchange. A separate set of fluorescein isothiocyanate filters was used to select CHO cells transiently transfected with the pcDNA3.1 (GFP-Bax) or pCMS-EGFP (Bax) plasmids to test the effect of GFP-Bax and Bax on intracellular Ca2+ release. CHO cells transfected with GFP-Bax were visualized under a confocal microscope. The cells were grouped according to the pattern of GFP-Bax distribution: healthy cells with a diffuse pattern of green fluorescence, indicating cytosolic distribution of GFP-Bax, and preapoptotic cells with a punctate pattern of green fluorescence, indicating integration of GFP-Bax into intracellular membranes. At different time points, cells with punctate and diffused patterns of GFP-Bax were counted from at least 20 fields, which were randomly selected. The percentage of transfected cells with membrane-bound Bax was defined as the number of cells with a punctated pattern of GFP-Bax divided by the total number of green fluorescent cells (in both punctated and diffused patterns). The data are from 4–10 independent experiments. The detailed procedure of quantitative assay of cell apoptosis upon treatment of cells with caffeine/ryanodine or after transient transfection with Bax has been described elsewhere (23Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.-L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 172-173Google Scholar). Briefly, the differential uptake of fluorescent DNA binding dyes acridine orange (4 µg/ml) and ethidium bromide (8 µg/ml) was used to measure viable and nonviable cells in a given population. A viable cell will have a red cytoplasm with bright green nucleus because of the intercalation of acridine orange into the DNA. Ethidium bromide is only taken up in nonviable cells after disruption of the plasma membrane, and this dye also intercalates into DNA, making it appear orange. Thus, a dying cell will have a bright nucleus (the ethidium overwhelms the acridine), and its cytoplasm will appear dark red. To study the effect of Bcl-2-related proteins on the Ca2+ signaling of apoptosis, we derived several clones of CHO cells stably transfected with RyR alone (CHO-RyR) or together with Bcl-xL (RyR-xL), an antiapoptotic protein (Fig.1a, lanes 2 and4) (23Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.-L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The ryanodine receptors are located in the ER membrane and provide the conduction pore of Ca2+-release channels (26Bhat M.B. Zhao J.Y. Zang W. Balke C.W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Activation of these Ca2+-release channels by caffeine and ryanodine leads to sustained depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores (27Hayek S.M. Zhu X. Bhat M.B. Takeshima H. Valdivia H. Ma J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Ma J. Fill M. Knudson C.M. Campbell K.P. Coronado R. Science. 1988; 242: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 b), indicated by the lack of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release even after prolonged incubation with 2 mm Ca2+in the bath solution. The endogenous Bax proteins in CHO cells were not detectable with Western blot (data not shown). To study the interaction of Bax with Bcl-xL and Ca2+ in the apoptosis of CHO cells, we have used a transient expression system. 10 h after transfection with eitherBax or GFP-Bax gene into CHO-RyR cells, an ample amount of Bax proteins could be detected, as revealed by the distinct band of the 21-kDa protein recognized by the anti-Bax antibody (Fig. 1 a, lane 3) or a band of the 46-kDa protein recognized by the anti-GFP antibody (lane 5). Under identical transfection conditions, the expression levels of Bax or GFP-Bax were similar in CHO-RyR and RyR-xL cells (data not shown), suggesting that the presence of Bcl-xL does not affect the transient expression of Bax in CHO cells. In Fig. 2, we show that overexpression of Bax in CHO-RyR and RyR-xL cells can induce apoptotic cell death based on the following features of apoptosis: genomic DNA laddering, nuclear chromatin condensation, and mitochondrial membrane clustering. As shown in Fig. 2 a, DNA laddering was clearly visible in CHO-RyR cells 24 h after transfection with either Bax or GFP-Bax (lanes 4 and 5) but not in control cells transfected with GFP only (lane 1). As described in our previous study (Ref. 23Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.-L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), depletion of ER Ca2+stores via activation of the RyR/Ca2+-release channel induced apoptosis in CHO-RyR cells but not in RyR-xL cells (Fig.2 a, lanes 2and 3), whereas genomic DNA isolated from RyR-xL cells overexpressing GFP-Bax showed a typical laddering pattern, although the nucleus fragmentation process was delayed compared with that in CHO-RyR cells. This result indicates that Bxl-xL cannot prevent apoptosis completely when Bax is active. More obvious condensation of the nucleus in individual transfected cells is revealed in Fig. 2 b by using Hoechst 33342 dye staining. Clearly, most cells with a punctate pattern of GFP-Bax distribution showed condensed nuclei with fragmented chromatin structures, a characteristic feature of cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 2 b, indicated by arrows). And the translocation of Bax from cytosol to intracellular membranes seems essential for Bax-induced apoptosis, because only cells with a diffuse pattern of GFP-Bax distribution remained healthy and morphologically intact and with normal nuclear structure, consistent with previous studies (5Hsu Y.-T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 7Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5991-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is also accompanied with rearrangement of mitochondria from an organized membrane network in cells with a diffuse distribution of GFB-Bax into a clustered vesicular pattern in cells with a punctate pattern of GFP-Bax. Fig. 2 c shows the immunohistochemical structure of mitochondria labeled with the monoclonal antibody against COX IV (a mitochondria marker protein). A similar phenomenon was also reported by Margineantu et al. (29Margineantu D. Capaldi R.A. Marcus A.H. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1833-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The punctated GFP-Bax was mostly in the peri-nuclear region and co-localized with mitochondria (yellow spots in Fig. 2 c overlay) but did not exclude ER or other intracellular membranes. In the transient expression assays, we observed that GFP-Bax was predominantly distributed in the cytosol with a diffuse pattern of green fluorescence 4–10 h after gene transfection. By 24–36 h, most of the transfected cells showed a punctate distribution of GFP-Bax. Interestingly, close to 60% of the cells expressing RyR (CHO-RyR) exhibited a punctate distribution of GFP-Bax as early as 6 h after gene transfection, a number that is significantly higher than in control CHO cells (CHO-WT) (Fig.3b, left panel). Thus, it seems that the presence of RyR in the ER membrane may serve as an intrinsic factor for the translocation of Bax from cytosol to intracellular membranes. We have exercised separate assays with CHO cells permanently transfected with a nonconducting mutant of RyR, theE4032A-RyR1 mutant (Ref. 23Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.-L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and found no difference between CHO-WT and CHO-E4032A cells in the initial distribution of GFP-Bax. Thus, it is likely that the intrinsic Ca2+-release function of RyR may play a role in the movement of GFP-Bax. Consistent with the antiapoptotic effect of Bcl-xL, the RyR-xL cells transfected with GFP-Bax maintained a cytosolic distribution of GFP-Bax for as long as 24–36 h with delayed induction of apoptosis (see Fig. 3 b,right panel). The application of caffeine and ryanodine to CHO-RyR and RyR-xL cells, which led to the depletion of ER Ca2+ (see Fig.1 b), caused significant redistribution of GFP-Bax (Fig.3 a). The percentage of cells with punctate distribution of GFP-Bax, a measure of the membrane-bound Bax, was increased significantly within 6 h after depletion of ER Ca2+. This enhanced movement of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria and ER could be seen clearly with the RyR-xL cells, which appeared to maintain the cytosolic distribution of GFP-Bax under control conditions (Fig.3 b). 24 h after transfection of GFP-Bax into RyR-xL cells, the addition of caffeine and ryanodine caused a redistribution of GFP-Bax from mostly cytosolic (22 ± 3%) to mostly membrane-bound (63% ± 9%). Thus, the combined activation of ER Ca2+ release and Bax overexpression overcame the antiapoptotic effect of Bcl-xL and led to eventual cell death. The integration of Bax into intracellular membranes might have a reciprocal effect on the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and contribute to the overall apoptotic cell death process. Therefore, we measured the ability of ATP, caffeine, or thapsigargin to release Ca2+ from intracellular membranes in individual CHO-RyR cells after transient transfection with either GFP-Bax or Bax; in the latter case, the Bax cDNA was cloned into the pCMS-EGFP vector, allowing selection of transfected cells with GFP fluorescence. ATP is an agonist of the purinergic receptor on the plasma membrane, which activates IP3Rs on the ER membrane via generation of IP3(30Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin is a specific inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump, which permits the direct assessment of the ER Ca2+ pool (15Wei H. Wei W. Bredesen D.E. Perry D.C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Reynolds J.E. Li J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 31Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4a, CHO-RyR cells transfected with GFP alone respond to the rapid release of Ca2+ from ER upon application of caffeine and ATP, indicating that functional RyR and IP3R are present in the ER membrane and share a common pool of releasable Ca2+. A striking difference was observed with CHO-RyR cells transfected with Bax, in which the amount of ATP- and caffeine-induced Ca2+release was significantly smaller as a result of Bax overexpression (Fig. 4 b). To further correlate the subcellular localization of Bax with its effect on ER Ca2+ homeostasis, we selected the CHO-RyR cells on the basis of their pattern of GFP-Bax distribution. CHO-RyR cells with GFP-Bax present in the cytosol contain an ER Ca2+ pool that is significantly smaller than in control cells (compare Fig. 4 c with 4a); those cells with GFP-Bax localized to the intracellular membranes appeared to have an empty ER Ca2+ pool, because they lost response to caffeine, ATP, and thapsigargin (Fig. 4 d). Based on transmission images, these cells could have normal morphology with intact plasma membrane even with a punctate distribution of GFP-Bax and thus are likely to be in the preapoptotic stages. Similar results,i.e. reduced or even empty ER Ca2+ stores, were observed in CHO-WT and CHO-E4032A (mutant RyR protein lacking Ca2+ channel activation) cells transfected with GFP-Bax by using ATP and thapsigargin stimulation (data not shown). Interestingly, RyR-xL cells with diffuse distribution pattern of GFP-Bax are capable of releasing intracellular Ca2+ upon stimulation with caffeine in a manner similar to the CHO-RyR cells (compare Fig.4 e with 4a); but the extent of ER Ca2+ release is significantly reduced in response to a second application of ATP. The results with separate cells in multiple transfections are summarized in Fig. 5and TableI. Overexpression of Bax led to a significant reduction in the ER Ca2+ content, because ∼70% of the CHO-RyR cells transfected with GFP-Bax contained an empty ER Ca2+ pool, whereas only a small population of cells transfected with GFP alone (∼18%) appeared to have lost their ER Ca2+ content likely because of the toxic effect of the LipofectAMINE reagent. Interestingly, the resting [Ca2+] in CHO-RyR and RyR-xL cells did not appear to be affected by the transfection with either Bax or GFP-Bax genes (TableI), suggesting that the overexpressed Bax, in addition to affecting the intracellular Ca2+-release process, may also interfere with the extracellular Ca2+ entry pathway. 2Z.

Caffeine- (10 mm) and ATP- (0.2 mm) induced Ca2+ release from ER was performed in Ca2+-free balanced salt solution (+0.5 mm EGTA). The depletion of intracellular Ca2+ results in transient elevation of cytosolic Ca2+, which may directly activate caspase-like enzymes or indirectly influence the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and trigger the apoptotic cascade (32Nakagawa T.

It is not clear whether the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ per se or the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ store serves as the primary trigger for apoptosis (20Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E. Cortopassi G.

To further test the effect of cytosolic Ca2+ on Bax translocation and Bax-mediated apoptosis, we pretreated the cells with BAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator. As shown in Fig.6a, in cells pretreated with BAPTA-AM, the caffeine/ryanodine-induced rapid cytosolic Ca2+ elevation was reduced dramatically (comparetrace ii with trace i). The buffering of cytosolic Ca2+ by BAPTA had no effect on the movement of GFP-Bax in both CHO-RyR and RyR-xL cells, because neither the pattern of GFB-Bax distribution (Fig. 6 b) nor the time course of spontaneous GFP-Bax translocation changed with or without the addition of BAPTA-AM (Fig. 7a). In addition, Hoechst dye staining of the cell nucleus did not reveal a visible difference between control and BAPTA-treated cells (Fig.6 b). Notice that the untransfected CHO-RyR and RyR-xL cells are not affected by the pretreatment with BAPTA-AM; in other words, buffering of cytosolic Ca2+ does not appear to interfere with the apoptotic process of CHO cells. Furthermore, quantitative assays of cell apoptosis using differential uptake of fluorescent DNA binding dyes acridine orange and ethidium bromide give similar cell death indices irrespective of treatment with BAPTA, either 6 or 24 h after transfection with GFP-Bax (Fig. 7 b). Together, these data suggest that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ store rather than elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ serves as the signal in Bax-mediated apoptosis.Figure 7Effects of BAPTA on Bax translocation and Bax-mediated apoptosis. a, the time course of GFP-Bax translocation from cytosol to intracellular membranes (defined as the membrane-bound Bax) was not affected by BAPTA treatment (open symbols) in either CHO-RyR (filled squares) or RyR-xL (filled circles) cells. b, quantitative assays of Bax-induced apoptosis.

We show that the overexpression of Bax can affect the storage of Ca2+ in the intracellular membranes, and changes in intracellular Ca2+ storage can feed back to the translocation of Bax from cytosol to intracellular membranes. The spontaneous Bax redistribution between cytosol and membrane association appears to be accelerated by the release of Ca2+ from the ER, whereas it is not affected by the resting Ca2+ level, because buffering of cytosolic Ca2+ by BAPTA does not influence the movement of Bax. These data add further insights into the cellular and molecular mechanism of Ca2+ signaling in apoptosis. ER as a multifaceted organelle participates in protein synthesis and trafficking, cellular responses to stress, and intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Accumulating evidence shows that the ER plays important roles not only in cell proliferation but also in apoptosis (35Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 36Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). It has been shown that changes in ER luminal environment by overexpression of calreticulin affect cell sensitivity to apoptosis (37Nakamura K. Bossy-Wetzel E Burns K. Fadel M.P. Lozyk M. Goping I.S. Opas M. Bleackley R.C. Green D.R. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The activation of caspase-12 by ER stress induces apoptosis in a mitochondria-independent pathway (32Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). In the initial stage of apoptosis, although a majority of Bax distributes to the mitochondrial outer membrane, a portion of Bax also participates in other intracellular membranes such as the ER (38Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Presumably, that ER-bound Bax may affect apoptosis by interfering with the ionic homeostasis of the ER and introducing cellular stress to the intracellular organelles. The Bax-induced depletion of ER Ca2+ storage may represent one of the functional effects of Bax in apoptosis. Alternatively, the Bax-mediated reduction of ER Ca2+ may represent a secondary effect of cells entering the apoptotic cycle. In any event, the combined effects of Ca2+and Bax movements add an amplifying factor in triggering the fast execution of apoptotic cell death. Exactly how Bax affects the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is presently unknown, and understanding its molecular and cellular mechanisms will require extensive studies. Several possibilities can be proposed here. First, the membrane-bound Bax may oligomerize and create a nonselective ion pore across the ER membrane and may therefore cause leakage of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores (39Basanez G. Nechushtan A. Drozhinin O. Chanturiya A. Choe E. Tutt S. Wood K.A. Hsu Y. Zimmerberg J. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5492-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Second, Bax may interact directly or indirectly with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump similar to Bcl-2 (40Kuo T.H. Kim H.R. Zhu L., Yu, Y. Lin H.M. Tsang W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the IP3R, or the RyR Ca2+-release channels and thus may affect the overall Ca2+ transport across the ER membrane. Another intriguing possibility could be that Bax can affect the communication between ER and mitochondria in the movement of Ca2+. With the presence of Bax in both mitochondria and ER membranes, a toxic loading of Ca2+ into the mitochondria matrix may cause morphological changes in the mitochondria network, thus leading to apoptotic cell death. The antiapoptotic effects of Bcl-2 have been implicated in changes of intracellular Ca2+homeostasis. It is not surprising, therefore, that the balancing effect of Bax and Bcl-2 on ER Ca2+ homeostasis could play a role in determining the fate of the cells to either undergo proliferation or apoptosis (41Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C.

J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Calcium can function either as a promitotic or proapoptotic messenger, depending on its localization, cytosolic concentration, or oscillating pattern (23Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.-L. Bhat M.B.

Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). One of the interesting results from this study is that Ca2+ movement across the ER membrane accelerated Bax movement from cytosol to intracellular membrane and therefore accelerated apoptosis. The balance between mitosis and apoptosis is essential for tissue development and homeostasis. Abnormal cell growth or cell death has been implicated as the primary cause for cancer or degenerative diseases, respectively (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar, 2Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar, 3Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Proper control of apoptosis requires rigorous signaling communication and ordered function of regulatory molecules, which provide a rapid and effective response to diverse extracellular and intracellular apoptotic triggers. Ca2+- and Bcl-2-related proteins affect the morphology and function of the ER and mitochondria, two of the key intracellular organelles participating in apoptosis. Our data establish the concept that the dynamic interplay between the movements of Ca2+and Bax may provide an important feedback mechanism for the rapid execution of apoptosis. We thank Drs. D. Danielpour and G. Dubyak for helpful discussions, D. Damron for help with the intracellular Ca2+ measurement, and C. Distelhorst for providing the Bax cDNA. We also appreciate the generous support from the Charlotte Geyer Foundation."

The dominant mode of signal transduction in bacteria utilizes two-component systems where histidine kinases phosphorylate response regulators that control gene expression, chemotaxis, antibiotic resistance, and many other processes (1Hoch J. Silhavy T. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). CheY is the regulator of the chemotaxis response in Escherichia coli. The normal signaling form of CheY requires phosphorylation of the aspartyl group at position 57 (2Sanders D.A. Gillece-Castro B.L. Stock A.M. Burlingame A.L. Koshland D.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8348-8354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another intramolecular event involved in the signaling of CheY is the rotation of the tyrosine group at position 106. The side chain of Tyr106 was first shown to be a rotamer in the unactivated CheY structure, equally occupying a solvent-exposed and a solvent-inaccessible position (4Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15511-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation mechanism of CheY was subsequently explored through structure/function studies of signaling mutants. The structure of an inactivating CheY mutant revealed that the Tyr106 side chain exclusively occupied the external position, so it was hypothesized that the side chain may undergo a conformational change during CheY activation (5Ganguli S. Wang H. Matsumura P. Volz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17386-17393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Five additional activating and inactivating CheY mutants were prepared as tests of this hypothesis, and their structural results were consistently in agreement (6Zhu X.-Y. Amsler C.D. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4208-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhu X.-Y. Rebello J. Matsumura P. Volz K. J. Biol.

The aggregate work suggested a model where the Tyr106 side chain assumed the inside position when CheY was signaling and the outside position when it was not. It was further argued that conformational shifts in the β4–α4 loop assisted in the selection of either of these two rotameric positions for Tyr106 (7Zhu X.-Y. Rebello J. Matsumura P. Volz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5000-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,8Zhu X.-Y. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23758-23764Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Other structural facts supporting this model were as follows: 1) the location of the Tyr106 side chain on the CheY molecule correlated with the signaling surface of CheY as defined through allele-specific suppression analysis (10Roman S.J. Meyers M. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6247-6255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2) the CheZ-binding surface of CheY overlapped with the CheA and FliM-binding surfaces in the same region as the signaling surface of CheY (8Zhu X.-Y. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23758-23764Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and 3) the 1.9-Å resolution structure of a phosphonate analogue of activated CheY showed the Tyr106 side chain exclusively occupying the internal position (11Halkides C., J. McEvoy M.M. Casper E. Matsumura P. Volz K. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5280-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, results from the phosphonate analogue were in agreement with earlier x-ray structures of activation models for two other response regulators, Spo0A·PO3−·Ca2+ (12Lewis R.J. Brannigan J.A. Muchová K. Barák I. Wilkinson A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and FixJ·PO3− (13Birck C. Mourey L. Gouet P. Fabry B. Schumacher J. Rouseau P. Kahn D. Samama J.-P. Structure. 1999; 7: 1505-1515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Most recently, the x-ray structure of a BeF3− mimic of activated CheY·Mg2+ in complex with the cognate peptide of the target protein FliM confirmed the signaling region of CheY as the α4–β5–α5 surface, with the Tyr106 side chain exclusively occupying the internal position (14Lee S.Y. Cho H.S. Pelton J.G. Yan D. Henderson R.K. King D.S. Huang L.-S. Kustu S. Berry E.A. Wemmer D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This structure was the definitive presentation of the active conformation of CheY, revealing the hydrogen bonding network that stabilized the β4–α4 loop in its new conformation. However, the process of activation still remains obscure. The old model of a phosphorylation-induced transformation of apoCheY into the activated form slowly gave way to the concept of a population shift, where a subpopulation of apoCheY molecules assumes an active conformation and becomes stabilized by the phosphoryl group. The population shift mode was first applied to response regulators to explain the activity of the non-phosphorylatable CheY mutant D13K (15Jiang M. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Volz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11850-11855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Compelling support for the population shift model for activation of response regulators came in recent NMR studies on CheY and its homologues Spo0F and NtrC (16Feher V. Cavanagh J. Nature. 1999; 400: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 17Kern D. Volkman B.F. Luginbühl P. Nohaile M.J. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E.

Despite all of the convincing data for the population shift model, there is little evidence regarding the nature of a response regulator being active in its apo-form. Here we present the atomic resolution structure of wild-type apoCheY refined to an R-factor of 11.4% at 1.08-Å resolution. The details of this structure reveal that the signaling region of unphosphorylated CheY exists in two conformational states, one of which we term the meta-active conformation. Wild-type E. coli CheY was isolated, purified, and crystallized as described previously (4Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15511-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the crystallization being at room temperature in 2.2 m(NH4)2SO4, buffered in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen after brief soaks in the original mother liquor plus up to 20% v/v glycerol. Diffraction data were measured at the BioCARS facility at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. A single crystal of dimensions 0.1 × 0.15 × 0.4 mm was used for collection of the entire data set. Two scans were collected, the first was a 180° ω scan at χ0, and the second was a 90° ω scan at a χ offset of 60°. A total of 327,373 observations were made of 42,174 unique reflections to a nominal resolution of 1.08 Å. Initial phases were obtained using the room temperature, 1.7-Å wild-type structure as a model (PDB accession code3CHY). Initial refinement including data to 1.7 Å resolution was done using the program PROFFT (20Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 252-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 21Finzel B.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 53-55Crossref Google Scholar). Final refinement using all 42,174 data to 1.08 Å was done with the program SHELXL (22Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar), interspersed with ten cycles of manual rebuilding on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 using the program QUANTA.

Open table in a new tab The final model of CheY refined at 1.08 Å contains 1,052 protein atoms, three SO42− ions, two glycerol molecules, and 197 spherical solvent molecules. The electron density is clear for all modeled atoms. The final R cryst is 11.4%, with an accompanying R free of 14.4%. Other refinement statistics are given in TableI. The average uncertainty in atomic positions is <0.06 Å (23Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar). Most of the backbone structure is almost identical to the room temperature, 1.7-Å wild-type structure, with a root mean square difference of 0.28 Å for 123 α-carbon positions. There are ten amino acid side chains with interpretable rotational disorder, whereas the backbone of residues 88–91 (the β4–α4 loop) adopts two discrete conformations. The most significant results from this structure are the details of the conformational heterogeneity in two regions of the signaling surface of CheY, the β4–α4 loop and the Tyr106 side chain. In the original room temperature, 1.7-Å resolution wild-typeE. coli CheY structure, the β4–α4 loop was described as a long and relatively weak link of extended β-conformation, with comparatively little supportive hydrogen-bonding structure (24Volz K. Hoch J.A. Silhary T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 53-64Google Scholar). The electron density then was fairly good, suggesting nothing more than a single conformation of the loop. In striking contrast, the electron density of this atomic resolution structure shows that the backbone of the β4–α4 loop adopts two different conformations (Fig. 1). For residue Ala90, the conformations are so distinct that the electron density for the two Cα atoms (separated by 1.4 Å) is completely resolved. The two conformations have relatively minor differences in bond angles; the largest differences are 54 and 77° for ϕ of Ala90 and φ of Lys91 (TableII). The atomic occupancies are ∼50% for both conformations, so presumably their energetic differences are small. We will refer to the conformation of the loop away from the Tyr106 residue as up and the other as down. For the Tyr106 side chain, its two widely separated rotameric positions (g +, inside; andg −, outside) have excellent agreement with their equivalents in the original 1.7-Å structure (4Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15511-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The occupancies for each of the two positions also refined to ∼50%. We will refer to the internal position of the Tyr106 side chain as in and the external position as out.Table IIBackbone angles for β4-α4 loop of 1.7- and 1.1-Å structures of CheYResidue1.7-Å Structure1.1-Å StructureABφψφψφψThr87−142154−144150−144152Ala88−80−23−78−18−72−28Glu89−155131−159122−159111Ala90−74137−69140−9086Lys91−137130−143130−66143Lys92−45−47−49−49−40−49 Open table in a new tab As shown schematically in Fig. 2, the conformational heterogeneities of the β4–α4 loop (up or down) and the Tyr106 side chain (in or out) give four possible combinations. Are all combinations possible, or do their positions correlate? The first and simplest case to consider is the down position of the β4–α4 loop combined with the in position of the Tyr106 side chain (Fig. 2 A). The electron density clearly shows that these atoms do indeed occupy these positions (Fig. 1), but it is sterically impossible for them to do so simultaneously; the distance from the Tyr106 hydroxyl oxygen to the Ala90 Cα carbon would be 2.15 Å. Thus, this combination does not occur. For the next two cases, it readily follows that when the β4–α4 loop is down, the Tyr106 side chain must be out (Fig. 2 B), and when Tyr106 is in, the β4–α4loop must be up (Fig. 2 C). Hence these second and third combinations can and do exist, exclusive of each other. The only problematic interpretation is with the fourth and last combination, where the β4–α4 loop is up while the Tyr106 side chain is out (Fig. 2 D). This combination could possibly occur, but there is no structural evidence for or against it. We propose that in the absence of the steric barrier of the β4–α4 loop, the Tyr106side chain would adopt the internal position, as in Fig. 2 C, and the fourth combination would not be functionally relevant. The end result for the four possible combinations is two meaningful apoCheY conformations, inactive (β4–α4 loop down and Tyr106 out) and a state we will call meta-active (β4–α4 loop up and Tyr106 side chain in). The two states are conformationally distinct. How does the meta-active conformation of apoCheY compare with the phosphorylated, completely active molecule? Two models of the active form of CheY exist in the literature, a phosphonate modification of CheY at Asp57 (see Ref. 11Halkides C., J. McEvoy M.M. Casper E. Matsumura P. Volz K. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5280-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar; PDB accession code 1C4W) and a BeF3− adduct of CheY·Mg2+complexed with the N-terminal peptide of its target protein, FliM (see Ref. 14Lee S.Y. Cho H.S. Pelton J.G. Yan D. Henderson R.K. King D.S. Huang L.-S. Kustu S. Berry E.A. Wemmer D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar; PDB accession code 1F4V). These two models exhibited similar coordinate changes, which presumably are the changes that occur during true activation. The phosphonate·CheY structure lacked a divalent cation, so it is possible that its transformation to the active form was not complete. Still, its conformation more closely resembles that of the meta-active apoCheY presented here; its β4–α4 loop is in the up position, and Tyr106 is exclusively internal. The other activation model, the CheY·Mg2+·BeF3−·peptide complex, exhibited larger conformational changes in the β4–α4 loop than the first and had a more stable hydrogen bonding pattern, especially including the important bonds from the invariant Thr87 Oγ and the amide nitrogen of Ala88 to the fluorine atoms of the BeF3− moiety (14Lee S.Y. Cho H.S. Pelton J.G. Yan D. Henderson R.K. King D.S. Huang L.-S. Kustu S. Berry E.A. Wemmer D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These bonds caused a backbone rotation of the β4-strand, which resulted in a large displacement of the β4–α4 loop. The displacement, combined with an ∼90° rotation of the peptide unit between Ala88 and Glu89, enabled formation of a new hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of Tyr106 and the carbonyl oxygen of Glu89 (14Lee S.Y. Cho H.S. Pelton J.G. Yan D. Henderson R.K. King D.S. Huang L.-S. Kustu S. Berry E.A. Wemmer D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These hydrogen bonds are the significant stabilizing forces in the model of completely activated CheY and of course are not present in our unphosphorylated, meta-active conformation of apoCheY. Results from NMR experiments on the response regulators Spo0F (16Feher V. Cavanagh J. Nature. 1999; 400: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and NtrC (19Volkman B.F. Lipson D. Wemmer D.E. Kern D. Science. 2001; 23: 2429-2433Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar) convincingly showed that the apo-forms of the molecules can be divided into subpopulations having different conformations. Borrowing from the general two-state model for allostery (25Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar), the NMR results were interpreted as indicating two conformational states of apoCheY, inactive and active, in dynamic equilibrium. It was proposed that activation is achieved by stabilizing the active conformation through phosphorylation, resulting in a population shift to an increased size of the active population. However, the NMR results were unable to provide details of the conformation of the unphosphorylated active population and only suggested that the conformation was the same as the phosphorylated, fully active form. Our present results provide an important extension of this model, where we propose that the conformation of apoCheY in the second population of the two-state mechanism is not the active state but the meta-active state determined here. It is tempting to speculate that in the activation pathway this meta-active conformation is the immediate antecedent to the fully active, phosphorylated CheY, but details of the CheA-mediated phosphorylation reaction must be taken into account. Importantly, what is the conformation of CheY when bound to CheA? Three structural reports of CheY in complex with the CheY-binding domain of CheA show the Tyr106 side chain out in the external, inactive conformation (26Welch M. Chinardet N. Mourey L. Birck C.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), indicating that this is the preferred conformation of CheY for CheA, for recognition or mechanistic purposes or both. It makes sense that the binding domain would have preferential affinity for its substrate over its product. This strongly suggests that the meta-active state is not an intermediate on the activation pathway but a more isolated population in equilibrium only with the unactive form. These observations have direct implications for the population shift model. As applied to response regulators, the population shift model invokes a phosphorylation-based stabilization of a pre-existing active conformation. In contrast, interpretation of these results calls for retention of some aspects of the old model of a phosphorylation-induced transformation of the inactive CheY conformation. The meta-active conformation of CheY should show activity. This would be difficult to test, but the fact is that the signaling surface of the meta-active molecule is more similar to the active models than the inactive form. We propose that the meta-active conformation of CheY, and not an unphosphorylated, active conformation, is responsible for the residual activity seen for apoCheY (9Barak R. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The meta-active conformation would be active, but it would be unstable. If a protein exists in multiple conformations in solution, could the conformations be found in the crystalline state? These results say yes, at least for these two conformations. It is important to note that the NMR results on NtrC also showed that the response regulator interconverted between just two conformations and not among a large number of random substates (19Volkman B.F. Lipson D. Wemmer D.E. Kern D. Science. 2001; 23: 2429-2433Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). More often, crystallographic results for a protein suspected to have multiple states reveal only a single conformation, and the results are usually presented with the attending explanation that the crystallization process selects just one population. Such an explanation is difficult to disprove, but the results here clearly show that determining multiple conformations in the crystalline state is possible. In the unsuccessful cases the structural differences may have been so subtle that they were not detectable at the resolution limits employed. The results presented here encourage investigation of other signaling proteins at very high resolution to search for conformational substates related to their activation pathways. In this model of CheY activation, flexibility of the β4–α4 loop and rotation of the Tyr106 side chain play key roles. In the inactive state, the backbone of the β4–α4 loop interconverts between two distinct conformations, whereas the Tyr106 side chain rotates accordingly. The β4–α4 loop and Tyr106 side chain alternately exchange occupation of the internal position. The absence of the phosphoryl group means a lack of stabilizing hydrogen bonds for the β4–α4loop. This is the condition of apoCheY, flipping back and forth between the two populations of the completely inactive state and the meta-active state. The meta-active state is responsible for the active characteristics of apoCheY. In phosphorylation-dependent activation, the phosphoryl group provides the stabilizing bonds to Thr87 Oγ and the Ala88 amide nitrogen, which moves the β4–α4 loop up and in, which then gives the Tyr106 side chain clear access to the interior, which finally results in the stabilizing bond between the Tyr106 hydroxyl and the Glu89 carbonyl oxygen. In conclusion, these structural results provide a useful addition to the general model of two-state activation as applied to response regulators, introducing the meta-active conformation as the subpopulation of molecules that exhibit properties of the active molecule.

The P0 glycoprotein, expressed by myelinating Schwann cells, plays an important role during the formation and maintenance of myelin, and it is the most abundant constituent of myelin. Using monoclonal antibodies, the homophilic binding of the P0 glycoprotein was shown to be mediated via the human natural keller cell (HNK)-1 epitope (3-O-SO3H-GlcUA(β1–3)Gal(β1–4)GlcNAc) present on the N-glycans. We recently described the structure of the N-glycan carrying the HNK-1 epitope, present on bovine peripheral myelin P0 (Voshol, H., van Zuylen, C. W. E. M., Orberger, G., Vliegenthart, J. F. G., and Schachner, M. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 22957–22960). In this study, we report on the structural characterization of the detectable glycoforms, present on the singleN-glycosylation site, using state-of-the-art NMR and mass spectrometry techniques. Even though all structures belong to the hybrid- or biantennary complex-type structures, the variety of epitopes is remarkable. In addition to the 3-O-sulfate present on the HNK-1-carrying structures, most of the glycans contain a 6-O-sulfated N-acetylglucosamine residue. This indicates the activity of a 6-O-sulfo-GlcNAc-transferase, which has not been described before in peripheral nervous tissue. The presence of the disialo-, galactosyl-, and 6-O-sulfosialyl-Lewis X epitopes provides evidence for glycosyltransferase activities not detected until now. The finding of such an epitope diversity triggers questions related to their function and whether events, previously attributed merely to the HNK-1 epitope, could be mediated by the structures described here.

P0 appears at the initial stage of myelination and contributes to the formation and maintenance of myelin compaction as an adhesion molecule (5Giese K.P. Martini R. Lemke G. Soriano P. Schachner M. Cell. 1992; 71: 565-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The essential functional role of P0 in the processes of myelination has been demonstrated by creating P0 knockout mice, which show severe hypomyelination and myelin degeneration (5Giese K.P.

In humans, several neurological disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Dejerine-Sottas disease, and congenital hypomyelination have been associated with mutations in the P0 gene (7Warner L.E. Hilz M.J. Appel S.H. Killian J.M. Kolodny E.H. Karpati G. Carpenter S. Watters G.V. Wheeler C. Witt D. Bodell A. Nellis E. Van Broeckhoven C. Lupski J.R.

This homophilic binding has been mapped to the SDNGT sequence composing amino acids 91–95, which harbors the single N-glycosylation site on P0 (8Yoshida M. Colman D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1115-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, it was observed that this glycopeptide fragment inhibits cell adhesion to a greater extent than the corresponding peptide without glycan (9Yazaki T. Miura M. Asou H. Kitamura K. Toya S. Uyemura K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Non-glycosylated P0, produced by site-directed mutagenesis, does not show homophilic adhesion (10Filbin M.T. Tennekoon G.I. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, amino acids 43–50 and 74–82 may also contribute to the homophilic binding in a non-carbohydrate-dependent manner (11Zhang K. Merazga Y. Filbin M.T. J. Neurosci.

Only recently have we described the detailed structural analysis of a major HNK-1-reactive oligosaccharide of the bovine peripheral myelin P0 glycoprotein (17Voshol H. van Zuylen C.W.E.M. Orberger G.

The core structure of the carbohydrates and several epitopes, including HNK-1 (17Voshol H. van Zuylen C.W.E.M. Orberger G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachner M. J. Biol.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), were identified using highly sensitive techniques for carbohydrate analysis such as high resolution magic angle spinning (MAS)11H NMR spectroscopy in a nano probe in combination with both MALDI-TOF and ESI mass spectrometry.RESULTSThe carbohydrate pool released from P0 was fractionated into three fractions by anion-exchange chromatography on Mono-Q: QN (15 ± 5% of the total), Q1 (45 ± 5% of the total), and Q2 (40 ± 5% of the total), eluting at starting buffer without NaCl, starting buffer with a gradient of NaCl from 30 to 100 mm, and starting buffer with a gradient of NaCl from 100 to 400 mm, respectively. Since the Mono-Q pattern varied slightly from run to run, due to the remaining SDS in the mixture, we did not attempt to obtain a better resolution at this stage. Further fractionation by high pH anion-exchange chromatography (19Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) resulted in three main fractions for QN (QN.1–3), four main fractions for Q1 (Q1.4–7), and three main fractions for Q2 (Q2.8–10) (data not shown). Due to variations in the pulsed amperometric detection response, no estimation of the percentages for the individual fractions could be made. These combined fractions accounted for >90% of all glycans on P0. At this stage of purification, only three fractions were homogeneous according to one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry; nevertheless, no further purification was carried out in order to prevent any loss of material. Instead, the fractions were analyzed by a combination of mass spectrometry and state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy. A description is given below of the characteristic features of each fraction, and the deduced structures are summarized in Fig.1.QN.1 and QN.2The negative-ion mode MALDI-TOF mass spectra of QN.1 and QN.2 (data not shown) after sialidase treatment and permethylation showed two peaks at m/z 1985.0 and 2346.2 corresponding to permethylated Hex4-dHex-HexNAc3 [M − H]−and Hex5-dHex-HexNAc3 [M − H]−, respectively, and several other pseudo-molecular ions corresponding to the same structures, but with different degrees of methylation. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of QN.1 and QN.2 (Fig. 2) revealed the structural reporter group signals (Table I) of a monosialylated hybrid-type structure as described previously (28Weisshaar G. Hiyama J. Renwick A.G.C. Glycobiolgy. 1991; 1: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For QN.1, two methyl doublets were observed at δ 1.207 and 1.220 (TableI) belonging to the fucose residue α1,6-linked to the Asn-linked GlcNAc-1. The core fucosylation resulted in a downfield shift (∼0.043 ppm) of the GlcNAc-2 H-1, which was linked to the GlcNAc-1 α-anomer. The two methyl doublets indicated the presence or absence of a Man-A residue, respectively (29Stroop C.J.M. Weber W. Nimtz M. Gutiérrez Gallego R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The observation of two GlcNAc-2N-acetyl singlets at δ 2.096 and 2.078 (Fig. 2, QN.1) corroborated this finding. These structural features were also observed in most of the other heterogeneous fractions, confining the structures present in those fractions (Fig. 1) to the hybrid-type category. In the case of QN.2, the main constituent was a hybrid-type structure containing N-glycolylneuraminic acid, as evidenced by the presence of the N-glycolyl singlet at δ 4.116. In addition, the low intensity signal for N-acetyl at δ 2.028 (Fig. 2, QN.2) indicated that fraction QN.2 was contaminated with fraction QN.1. Also in this fraction, part of the structures carried the Man-A residue.Figure 2One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra at 500 MHz of the bovine peripheral glycoprotein P0 glycans.

Open table in a new tab QN.3The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of QN.3 (Fig.3) in the negative-ion mode revealed four pseudo-molecular ions at m/z 1500.7, 1662.7, 1824.7, and 1986.7 corresponding to Hex4-dHex-HexNAc3(SO3) [M − H]− and the Hex5, Hex6, and Hex7 analogs, respectively. The structures containing Hex4 and Hex7 were the minor constituents of this fraction, and the latter structure indicated the existence of a terminal Hex-Hex sequence. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of QN.3 (Fig. 2) showed the reporter group signals of an asialo hybrid-type structure (30Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. Van Halbeek H. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 209-374Crossref Scopus (793) Google Scholar), and the observed chemical shifts are summarized in Table I. The observation of the downfield shift of the GlcNAc-5 H-6a and H-6b resonances to δ 4.405 and 4.348 (Fig. 2, QN.3) revealed the sulfation of this residue as observed by De Waard et al. (31De Waard P. Koorevaar A. Kamerling J.P Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4237-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two additional α-anomeric signals were observed with respect to QN.1 in the NMR spectrum recorded at 300 K (data not shown) at δ 4.912 and 5.146. The resonance at δ 4.912 corresponded to H-1 of Man-B (28Weisshaar G. Hiyama J. Renwick A.G.C. Glycobiolgy. 1991; 1: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the signal at δ 5.146 originated from H-1 of the Hex(α1-)Gal structure (32Seppo A. Pentilla L. Leppanen A. Maaheimo H. Niemela R. Helin J. Wieruszeski J.-M. Rekonen O. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 33Dasgupta S. Hogan E.L. Glushka J Van Halbeek H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the TOCSY spectrum (Fig.4, QN.3), the α-anomeric spin system at δ 5.146 displayed a typical set of three cross-peaks of a Gal residue (Gal-7). Two anomeric resonances were observed for Gal-6 at δ 4.600 and 4.542. The set of cross-peaks on the anomeric track at δ 4.600 revealed the substitution at OH-3 of this Gal-6 with Gal-7 (32Seppo A. Pentilla L. Leppanen A. Maaheimo H. Niemela R. Helin J. Wieruszeski J.-M. Rekonen O. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the three cross-peaks observed on the anomeric track of Gal-6 at δ 4.542 clearly indicated that this residue was not substituted (32Seppo A. Pentilla L. Leppanen A. Maaheimo H. Niemela R. Helin J. Wieruszeski J.-M. Rekonen O. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In summary, fraction QN.3 consists of four hybrid-type structures differing in mass. The Hex4- and Hex7-containing structures represented a single compound, whereas the other two could each be present in different glycoforms (Fig. 1).Figure 3MALDI-TOF (QN.3, Q1.4, Q1.6, Q1.7 and Q2.9) and ESI (Q1.5 and Q2.10) mass spectra of the underivatized bovine peripheral glycoprotein P0 glycans.

In addition, the sodiated ([M + Na − 2H]−,m/z 2121.7) and potasiated ([M + K − 2H]−, m/z 2137.7) pseudo-molecular ions were observed, as well as low intensity signals at m/z 2283.8 ([M + Na − 2H]−) and 1959.7 ([M + Na − 2H]−), which corresponded to the structures containing one Hex residue more or less, respectively. The peaks observed belowm/z 1959.7 were identified as metastable ions based on the characteristic isotope patterns. The NMR data derived from one-dimensional 1H NMR and two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY experiments, as summarized in Table I, showed two major differences when compared with those of QN.1. In the one-dimensional spectrum (Fig. 2, Q1.4), the α-anomeric proton at δ 5.112 in combination with the CH3 doublet at δ 1.166 evidenced the presence of α1,3-fucosylation of GlcNAc-5 (34Michalski J.C. Wieruszeski J.-M. Alonso C. Cache P. Montreuil J. Strecker G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 439-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, the observation of the downfield-shifted resonances of the GlcNAc-5 H-6a and H-6b atoms, as in QN.3, demonstrated the 6-O-sulfation of this residue (31De Waard P. Koorevaar A. Kamerling J.P Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4237-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The combined data pointed toward the presence of a 6-O-sulfosialyl-Lewis X structure in this fraction (Fig.2). The downfield shift of H-3 on the TOCSY track of Gal-6 H-1 (Fig. 4, Q1.4) indicated that Neu5Ac-7 was α2,3-linked to Gal-6. The two-dimensional NOESY NMR spectrum (data not shown) recorded using nano probe MAS NMR spectroscopy, showed NOEs, between Fuc-5′ H-1 and Gal-6 H-1 and between Gal-6 H-1 and GlcNAc-5 H-2/3/4, providing evidence for the existence of this structure.Q1.5 and Q1.6The negative-ion mode ESI mass spectrum of fraction Q1.5 (Fig. 3) showed one high intensity peak at m/z976.2 ([M − 2H]2−) and two low intensity peaks atm/z 895.2 and 1057.2 ([M − 2H]2−). After spectral deconvolution, the pseudo-molecular masses corresponded to Neu5Ac-Hex5-dHex-HexNAc3(SO3) and the Hex4 and Hex6 analogs, respectively. CID mass spectrometric analysis (data not shown) of m/z976.2 yielded several fragments ions. The most important ions could be assigned to [M − dHex-HexNAc]− (m/z801.56) and [M − Neu5Ac-Hex2(SO3)-HexNAc-CH6O3]−(m/z 977.12). The negative-ion mode MALDI-TOF spectrum of fraction Q1.6 (Fig. 3) revealed only one intense peak at m/z1991.68 corresponding to the [M + Na −2H]−pseudo-molecular ion of Neu5Gc-Hex5-dHex-HexNAc3(SO3). The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of fraction Q1.5 (Fig. 2) was similar to that of QN.1, and the chemical shifts are summarized in Table I. The main difference was the downfield shift of the GlcNAc-5 H-6a and H-6b resonances as observed for fractions Q1.3 and Q1.4, indicating 6-O-sulfation at this residue (31De Waard P. Koorevaar A. Kamerling J.P Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4237-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sulfation of GlcNAc-5 induced a 0.07-ppm downfield shift of Gal-6 H-1. The absence of fucosylation at GlcNAc-5, when compared with fraction Q1.4, resulted in a 0.01-ppm upfield shift of the GlcNAc-5 H-1 resonance and the slightly downfield shift of the GlcNAc-5 N-acetyl signal of this residue. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of fraction Q1.6 (Fig. 2) was similar to that of Q1.5, and the chemical shifts are summarized in Table I. The peak at δ 4.113 and the absence of the N-acetyl resonance at δ 2.028 in the one-dimensional NMR spectrum of Q1.6, when compared with that of Q1.5, demonstrated that in Q1.6, Neu5Gc was present instead of Neu5Ac.Q1.7The negative-ion mode MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of Q1.7 (Fig. 3) showed two pseudo-molecular ions at m/z 2082.81 and 2104.77 ([M − H]− and [M + Na − 2H]−, respectively) belonging to Neu5Ac2-Hex4-dHex-HexNAc3(SO3). The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of this structure (Fig.2) showed reporter group signals as observed for fraction Q1.5 (TableI) with the following differences. An additional N-acetyl signal at δ 2.064 and additional H-3e (δ 2.630) and H-3a (δ 1.738) peaks revealed the presence of two Neu5Ac residues, supporting the mass spectrometric observation and demonstrating the presence of the Neu5Ac(α2–8)Neu5Ac(α2–3)Gal structure (35Dorland L. Van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schaurer R. Wiegandt H. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 151: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The presence of signals at δ 4.117 and 4.139 stemming from Neu5Ac-7 H-8 and H-9, respectively, as observed previously for Neu5Ac(α2–8)Neu5Ac(α2-)-containing structures (36Michou F. Brisson J.-R. Jennings H.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8399-8405Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), confirmed the aforementioned structure. Since no H-3e signal was observed at δ 1.666 (37Kitajima K. Nomoto H. Inoue Y. Iwasaki M. Inoue S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the presence of a Neu5Ac(α2–8)Neu5Ac(α2–6)Gal structure could be excluded.Q2.8Fraction Q2.8 was described extensively by Vosholet al. (17Voshol H. van Zuylen C.W.E.M. Orberger G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22957-22960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this fraction contained only one structure, which carried the HNK-1 epitope at the Man-4′ branch, as evidenced by the NMR data (Table I).Figure 5Summary of the structures of the PO glycans, divided into core region, and non-reducing termini of the Man-α 1,6- and Man-α 1,3-branches.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Q2.9The negative-ion mode MALDI-TOF spectrum of Q2.9 (Fig.3) revealed the presence of a heterogeneous mixture by the observation of peaks at m/z 1500.00, 1662.84, 1838.73, 2041.80, 2082.78, and 2260.79. The assignments of the peaks to [M − H]− pseudo-molecular ions was corroborated by the observation of their [M + Na −2H]− analogs. The peak atm/z 2260.79 corresponded to Neu5Gc-Neu5Ac-Hex5-dHex- HexNAc3(SO3). The two peaks at m/z 1500.0 and 1662.84 corresponded to Hex4-dHex-HexNAc3(SO3) and Hex5-dHex-HexNAc3(SO3), respectively, similar to the structures found in fraction QN.3 (Fig.2), and originated from degradation of Neu5Gc-Neu5Ac-Hex5-dHex-HexNAc3(SO3) upon storage.

This did not result from a protective effect of Na+ but rather from a Li+-specific increase in the reactivity of Cys-109 in the first external loop of the transporter. Li+ alone of the alkali cations caused this increase in reactivity. Replacing Na+ withN-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+) did not reduce the affinity of cocaine for SERT, as measured by displacement of a high affinity cocaine analog, but replacement of Na+ with Li+ led to a 2-fold increase in theK D for cocaine. The addition of either cocaine or serotonin (5-HT) protected SERT against MTSET inactivation. When SERT was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, inward currents were elicited by superfusing the cell with 5-HT (in the presence of Na+) or by replacing Na+ with Li+but not NMDG+. MTSET treatment of oocytes in Li+ but not in Na+ decreased both 5-HT and Li+ induced currents, although 5-HT-induced currents were inhibited to a greater extent. Na+ antagonized the effects of Li+ on both inactivation and current. These results are consistent with Li+ inducing a conformational change that exposes Cys-109, decreases cocaine affinity, and increases the uncoupled inward current.

Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The reactivity of a cysteine at position 179 (in SERT mutant I179C) toward [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) was also increased by the presence of Na+ (5Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This residue may be part of an external gate that must be open for 5-HT to bind from the cell exterior and that closes to prevent dissociation to the outside when bound 5-HT is released to the cytoplasm. SERT contains eighteen cysteine residues, three of which are predicted to be extracellular. Of these, two (Cys-200 and Cys-209) were proposed to be in a disulfide bond, whereas the third, Cys-109, reacted with externally added (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) and MTSET (6Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Inactivation at Cys-109 was extremely slow in normal Na+-containing medium but was much faster when Li+ replaced Na+ (6Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The corresponding residue in DAT, Cys-90, also reacts with MTSEA (7Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); however, the consequence of modifying this residue in SERT and DAT were quite different. In SERT, MTSEA modification of Cys-109 inactivated transport (6Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), but in DAT, MTSEA modification of Cys-90 did not inactivate but rather stimulated binding of a cocaine analog. Moreover, cocaine actually potentiated the effects of MTSEA and MTSET, as if ligand binding increased the accessibility or reactivity of Cys-90 (7Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition to Na+-coupled substrate transport, SERT, norepinephrine transporter, and DAT were all found to catalyze uncoupled ion fluxes in the presence and the absence of substrate (8Mager S. Min C. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Hoffman B.J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 845-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Galli A. Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. Proc. Natl.

Neuroscience. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of SERT, these currents were induced by both 5-HT in the presence of Na+ or by replacing Na+ with Li+ (8Mager S. Min C. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Hoffman B.J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 845-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The effect of Li+ seemed to result from an increase in the frequency with which the transporter opens as an ion channel and not from changes in single channel conductance or open time (11Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that rather than permeating faster than Na+, Li+ changed the properties of SERT to increase the probability of channel opening. The Li+ current was also studied in SERT from Drosophila melanogaster (dSERT) and found to be antagonized by Na+ relative to an inert cation such asN-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+) (12Petersen C.I. DeFelice L.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that 5-HT at high concentrations could inhibit the current in a manner consistent with its permeation through the SERT ion channel. Given the apparently direct effects of Li+, it is reasonable to question whether the effects of replacing Na+ with Li+ (4Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Talvenheimo J. Fishkes H. Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were due to decreased Na+ or increased Li+. We considered the possibility that Li+ caused a conformational change in SERT that affected multiple functions of the transporter. In this study we examined the effect of Li+ on exposure of Cys-109, cocaine binding, and SERT-mediated currents. The results are consistent with a conformational change that affects all of these properties. Rat SERT was expressed in HeLa cells as described previously (15Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this method, HeLa cells were infected with recombinant vTF-7 vaccinia virus and transfected with plasmid DNA encoding rSERT under control of the T7 promoter. The cells were assayed 16–24 h post-transfection. Transport was assayed in intact cells in 48-well culture plates. 5-HT uptake was initiated by the addition of 23 nm [3H]5-HT (21.8 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 200 µl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS/CM). The reactions were terminated after 10 min by aspiration of the substrate followed by three rapid washes with ice-cold PBS/CM. The cells were lysed with 200 µl of 1% SDS and transferred to scintillation vials for counting. Binding of the high affinity cocaine analog, 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-[125I]iodophenyl)tropane (β-CIT) was measured as described previously (16Wall S.C. Innis R.B. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 264-270PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).K D values for cocaine were determined by displacement of [125I]β-CIT. Transfected cells in 48-well plates were washed once with PBS/CM and once with incubation buffer, and then 200 µl of incubation buffer was added as specified in text. Freshly made MTSET or MTSEA stock solutions in water (20×) were added immediately to the incubation as a 20-fold dilution. After 10 min of incubation at 22 °C, the cells were washed three times with PBS/CM prior to the initiation of uptake. For reactivation experiments, the cells were first treated with MTSET in PBS/CM with all Na+ substituted with Li+ as described above and were then incubated with 10 mm cysteine in PBS/CM for 5 min. The cysteine was removed by two washes with PBS/CM. For the protection experiments, transfected cells in 24-well plates were treated with MTSET in Li+medium in the presence of different concentrations of 5-HT or cocaine as given in the text. 5-HT or cocaine were added to the medium prior to the addition of MTSET. The cells were then washed extensively (six to nine times) with PBS/CM prior to assaying transport to ensure that there was no residual 5-HT or cocaine. All inactivation, reactivation, transport, and binding experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C). A plasmid containing SERT cDNA following alfalfa mosaic virus sequence (8Mager S. Min C.

Bradely C. Nature. 1991; 354: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) was linearized withNotI; rSERT cRNA was transcribed with the mMessage mMachine T7 In Vitro Transcription Kit (Ambion). Stage V or VI oocytes were defolliculated, injected with 50 ng of rSERT cRNA, and kept in normal frog Ringer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) supplemented with 5% dialyzed horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 18 °C. The oocytes were incubated for 6–14 days after injection. The resting potentials of oocytes used in these experiments ranged from −25 to −55 mV. Two-electrode voltage-clamp was performed using Oocyte Clamp OC-725C (Warner Instrument Corp). Glass microelectrodes were filled with 1 m KCl, and the tip resistances were between 0.3 and 2 MΩ. The oocyte plasma membrane potential was clamped at −60 mV. The oocytes were superfused with a low Ca2+ frog Ringer (Na+ Ringer, 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.6 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.6) at a rate of ∼2 ml/min. In some experiments, where indicated, Na+ in the low Ca2+ Ringer was replaced by Li+ or NMDG+ (Li+ or NMDG Ringers). Data acquisition and analysis were conducted digitally using pClamp8 (Axon Instruments Inc.). Current signals were initially low pass filtered at 1 kHz and were subsequently further filtered at 25 Hz with an external Bessel filter. The currents were digitized with sampling interval of 150 ms. Oocytes were treated with MTSET by the addition of 2 mmMTSET in Na+ or Li+ Ringer directly into the recording chamber while the oocytes were still under voltage clamp but without superfusion. The oocytes were incubated with MTSET for 10 min and washed with Na+ Ringer for 10 min before recording. For the reactivation experiments, the oocytes were first treated with 2 mm MTSET in Li+ Ringer, washed, recorded, then incubated with 10 mm cysteine in normal Na+Ringer for 5 min, and washed again for 5 min with Na+Ringer before recording. For protection experiments, the oocytes were treated with 2 mm MTSET in Li+ Ringer with and without 20 µm 5-HT. All recordings were made at room temperature (22 °C). Nonlinear regression fits of experimental and calculated data were performed with Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA), which uses the Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares curve fitting algorithm. Each figure shows a representative experiment that was performed at least twice. The statistical analysis given in text was from multiple experiments. The data with error bars represent the means ± S.D. for duplicate or triplicate samples. As previously reported (6Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), SERT is sensitive to inactivation by methanethiosulfonate reagents in lithium medium but not in normal sodium medium. Fig. 1 Ademonstrates that this inactivation results from the presence of lithium rather than the absence of sodium. The cells expressing SERT retain the ability to concentrate 5-HT after treatment with MTSET in PBS or in medium in which Na+ was replaced by NMDG+. However, when Na+ was replaced with Li+, MTSET inactivated SERT. In each of these experiments, Na+ was replaced with Li+ or NMDG+only during the preincubation with MTSET. In the absence of MTSET, preincubation in Li+ or NMDG+ medium had no effect on activity. As described previously (6Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), inactivation of SERT by external methanethiosulfonate reagents did not occur, even in Li+, in a mutant containing alanine in place of cysteine at position 109. Similar results were obtained when MTSEA or (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate was used instead of MTSET (data not shown). MTSET reaction with a cysteine sulfhydryl yields a mixed disulfide as its product (19Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). As previously demonstrated (5Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the inactivation of SERT was readily reversed by reducing MTSET-treated cells with thiols. Under conditions where 83 ± 10% of the transport activity in the cells was inactivated by MTSET, 5 min of treatment with 10 mm free cysteine restored ∼85 ± 10% of the original activity. In contrast to inactivation, however, reactivation with cysteine was equally effective in Na+ and Li+ media (data not shown). To further investigate the nature of the inactivation, we examined the effect of Cys-109 modification by MTSET on binding of the cocaine analog β-CIT. Under conditions where ∼65% of the transport activity was inactivated, less than 25% of β-CIT binding activity was affected by MTSET treatment (TableI). Furthermore, both cocaine and 5-HT were able to displace β-CIT after MTSET modification. These results suggest that modification of Cys-109 does not affect substrate binding but rather a subsequent step in the catalytic cycle of SERT. To investigate the selectivity of the Li+ effect, we tested the ability of other alkali cations to increase the reactivity of Cys-109. Table II shows that, relative to Na+, MTSET induced inactivation was enhanced only by Li+ and not by K+, Rb+, or Cs+.Table IEffect of Cys-109 modification on transport and bindingβ-CIT bound5-HT influxfmol/mgfmol/mg/minNo MTSETControl110 ± 2.6924 ± 64.410 µm 5-HT26.3 ± 1.662.7 ± 7.0100 µm 5-HT4.47 ± 0.1916.0 ± 20.210 µm cocaine10.1 ± 0.298.3 ± 9.6100 µm cocaine1.21 ± 0.0764.1 ± 59.7+ 1 mm MTSETControl83.8 ± 5.9324 ± 1810 µm 5-HT22.1 ± 1.457.7 ± 34100 µm 5-HT3.41 ± 0.714.6 ± 4.310 µm cocaine7.98 ± 0.4142.4 ± 5.2100 µmcocaine0.887 ± 0.05329.1 ± 18.3The cells were transfected with SERT mutant C357I, which removes an intracellular determinant of MTSET sensitivity.

Intact cells or membranes from cells expressing SERT C357I were incubated 10 min in the presence or the absence of 1 mm MTSET, washed, and assayed for 5-HT transport (cells) or β-CIT binding (membranes) in the presence or the absence of 5-HT or cocaine as indicated.

Inactivation of this mutant was due only to modification of Cys-109, either in intact cells or in membrane preparations (A. Androutsellis-Theotokis and G. Rudnick, manuscript in preparation). Intact cells or membranes from cells expressing SERT C357I were incubated 10 min in the presence or the absence of 1 mm MTSET, washed, and assayed for 5-HT transport (cells) or β-CIT binding (membranes) in the presence or the absence of 5-HT or cocaine as indicated.

Following this incubation, the cells were washed with PBS/CM and assayed for 5-HT influx as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The ability of Li+ to stimulate Cys-109 modification depended on the presence of Na+ in the medium. In the absence of Na+ (replaced by NMDG) the amount of inactivation increased almost linearly with [Li+] up to 150 mm, the highest concentration tested. However, in the presence of Na+, Li+ replacement increased the rate of inactivation less at low [Li+] and more at higher concentrations (Fig. 1 B). This behavior might be expected if multiple Li+ ions interacted with SERT in a cooperative manner to expose Cys-109 to reaction with MTSET. However, the same cooperativity was not observed when Li+ replaced NMDG. Other possibilities are that Li+ and Na+competed for binding at the same site or that Li+ and Na+ binding at separate sites induced mutually exclusive conformational changes. Although Cys-109 was predicted to lie in an extracellular loop (18Blakely R. Berson H. Fremeau R. Caron M. Peek M. Prince H. Bradely C. Nature. 1991; 354: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar,20Hoffman B.J. Mezey E. Brownstein M.J. Science. 1991; 254: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), the variable reactivity of this residue to modification with MTSET suggested that its accessibility might be influenced by conformational changes, such as those induced by substrate or inhibitor binding. Fig.2 A shows that the amount of inactivation by MTSET was decreased in the presence of either cocaine or 5-HT. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2 A, SERT-expressing cells were treated with 0.1 mm MTSET for 10 min in PBS/CM with Li+ replacing Na+ in the presence of the indicated concentrations of either 5-HT or cocaine. The cells were then washed extensively to remove unreacted MTSET and then assayed for transport activity in PBS. As shown in Fig. 2 A, MTSET in the absence of 5-HT or cocaine inactivated transport to ∼40% of the original level, but the presence of a sufficient concentration of either ligand completely blocked SERT inactivation. The concentration required for half-maximal protection was 0.76 ± 0.12 µm for 5-HT and 0.89 ± 0.21 µm for cocaine. It is unlikely that this protection represents direct occlusion of Cys-109, because cocaine and 5-HT bound to the transporter after modification (Table I). We previously demonstrated that binding of β-CIT to platelet plasma membrane vesicles containing SERT was weaker when Li+replaced Na+ (4Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows that the same is true for cocaine itself and that the decrease in affinity results not from a lack of Na+ but from the presence of Li+. In this experiment, the membranes from cells expressing SERT were incubated with a low, subsaturating amount of labeled β-CIT in the presence of the indicated concentrations of cocaine. When Na+ was substituted with NMDG+, cocaine binding was actually slightly enhanced, as demonstrated by its ability to displace β-CIT from the membranes. Replacement of Na+ with Li+, however, increased by almost 2-fold the concentration of cocaine required to displace half of the bound β-CIT from 1.10 ± 0.19 µm (0.70 ± 0.08 µm in NMDG+) to 1.92 ± 0.10 µm in Li+. Although the shifts in KI for cocaine are not large, they were very reproducible. The same order was observed in three separate experiments, and the experiment shown was closest to the average values for the three conditions. An unexpected difference was observed between β-CIT and cocaine in that cocaine affinity was highest in NMDG+medium (Fig. 2), but β-CIT affinity was highest in Na+(Fig. 2 legend). Thus, both the increased susceptibility of Cys-109 and the decrease in cocaine affinity were due to the presence of Li+ and not the absence of Na+. Lithium is known to increase uncoupled ionic currents mediated by SERT (8Mager S. Min C. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Hoffman B.J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 845-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Petersen C.I. DeFelice L.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Petersen and DeFelice (12Petersen C.I. DeFelice L.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that dSERT conducted inward currents in Li+ Ringer and that these currents were inhibited in mixtures of Li+ and Na+. Because this behavior was mirrored by the inactivation of rSERT by MTSET (Fig.1 B), we verified that the currents conducted by rSERT, like dSERT, were affected similarly by Na+ and Li+. Fig. 3 shows currents elicited by 5-HT and Li+ in Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA encoding rat SERT. The inset of Fig. 3 demonstrates the relative magnitude and time course of inward currents measured when 3 µm 5-HT was added (insert left) or when the medium was changed to one containing Li+ instead of Na+ (inset right). The initial peak and subsequent decrease in magnitude in the current elicited by Li+ was frequently observed. By measuring the sustained inward current elicited in media containing mixtures of Li+and Na+ or Li+ and NMDG+, we obtained the data shown in Fig. 3. As with inactivation by MTSET (Fig.1 B), high Na+ concentrations decreased the magnitude of the Li+ effect. Although the current increased linearly when Li+ was used to replace NMDG+, when Li+ gradually replaced Na+, there was essentially no effect of Li+ until about half of the Na+ was replaced. These results basically reproduce those of Petersen and DeFelice (12Petersen C.I. DeFelice L.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that rSERT and dSERT respond similarly to Li+. The SERT currents elicited by 5-HT and Li+ were sensitive to inhibition by MTSET (Fig. 4). As with inhibition of transport, the inactivation was not observed in Na+ Ringer (Fig. 4 B) but only when Na+ was replaced by Li+ (Fig. 4 C). The presence of 5-HT during the incubation with MTSET in Li+ Ringer protected against inactivation (data not shown) just as it did for inactivation of transport (Fig. 2 A). The extent to which MTSET decreased the 5-HT elicited current varied. Inhibition always occurred, and in some cases the current was completely inactivated. By comparison, inactivation of the Li+ elicited current was never complete and was always less than inactivation of the 5-HT elicited current in the same experiment. The combined results from eight oocytes are summarized in Fig.4 D. These results demonstrate that inactivation of the currents occurred only when MTSET was incubated with the oocytes in Li+ Ringer and that 5-HT elicited currents were more sensitive to inactivation by MTSET than were Li+ elicited currents. The expected product of MTSET reaction with Cys-109 is a disulfide (19Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), and consequently treatment with 10 mm free cysteine reduced the disulfide and regenerated native SERT with normal response to 5-HT and Li+ (data not shown). In contrast to inactivation, this reactivation, which also restored transport activity (5Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), was the same whether the reaction mixture contained Na+ or Li+ (data not shown). The results presented above suggest that Li+ has a direct effect on SERT structure that increases reactivity of Cys-109, decreases cocaine affinity, and increases an inward current carried by the transporter. It had not previously been appreciated that these disparate effects (6Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Mager S. Min C. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Hoffman B.J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 845-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 21Humphreys C.J. Beidler D. Rudnick G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were all due to Li+ rather than the absence of Na+. We also show here that the effect of Li+ on both SERT current and reactivity of Cys-109 is antagonized in the same way by Na+, lending support to the possibility that a single Li+-induced conformational change is responsible for each of these effects. Evidence from external loop chimeras suggests that these loops are important for the conformational changes that follow binding (22Smicun Y. Campbell S.D. Chen M.A. Gu H. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36058-36064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the structural basis for our observations lies in the conformational changes in the first external loop, which contains Cys-109, that accompany ligand and ion binding to SERT. Changes in the conformation of external loops under the influence of Li+may favor an alternate conformation with greater accessibility of Cys-109 and lower affinity for cocaine and β-CIT. In contrast, the conformational changes induced by Na+ (5Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which are essential for completion of the reaction cycle, may favor a more compact conformation of this loop in which Cys-109 is not exposed. Modification of Cys-109 with MTSET places a highly charged and bulky substituent on the loop, possibly restricting it from adopting the conformation in which the cysteine sulfhydryl is sequestered from solution. Such a restriction would prevent the conformational transitions required for the transport cycle. The accessibility of Cys-109 in unmodified SERT depended on the presence of Li+ (Fig. 1), but after modification with MTSET, Li+ did not change the reactivity of this residue. We previously showed that reactivation of MTSET-inactivated SERT cysteine mutants could be used as a measure of the conformation around the modified residue (5Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For example, the reactivation of MTSET-inactivated SERT I179C was increased by Na+ and 5-HT. The observation that SERT modified with MTSET at Cys-109 was reactivated by free cysteine equally well in Na+ and Li+ medium suggests that this residue, once modified, does not change its accessibility in response to Li+ like unmodified SERT. This change in the response to Li+suggests that modification with MTSET restricted the conformational mobility of the first external loop, consistent with inhibition of transport. The altered loop conformation in Li+ containing solutions may be responsible also for the increased likelihood of SERT conducting as an ion channel. However, it is unlikely that the conformation that exposes Cys-109 and binds cocaine with lower affinity is identical to the conducting state of SERT responsible for increased current in Li+ Ringer. Lin et al. (11Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showed that single channel conductances underlie the currents carried by SERT and the N177G mutant of SERT. Li+ increased the open probability of the channel but did not change the single channel conductance, consistent with a Li+ induced conformational change rather than an increased permeation of Li+ relative to Na+ (11Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). From their work (11Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the transporter, even in Li+, spends only a small fraction of its time in a conductive state, too small to effect a 2-fold change in cocaine affinity. It is more likely that the conformational disruption induced by Li+ increases the probability for entering a short-lived conductive state. The effects of Li+ on inactivation and current were antagonized by Na+ as shown in Figs. 1 B and 3. Such antagonism could result from a direct competition between Li+ and Na+ at the Na+ binding site. However, in other experiments, Li+ does not act like a competitive antagonist of Na+ in 5-HT transport (23Gu H.H. Wall S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6911-6916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 2M. M. Stephan, K. M. Y. Penado, and G. Rudnick, unpublished results. We consider it more likely that Na+ and Li+, acting at different sites, both induce conformational changes in the transporter and that these changes are mutually exclusive. Recent results with the F380Y mutant of SERT indicates the opposing effects of Na+ and Li+ on the reactivity of Cys-109 (24Kamdar G. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4038-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Another indication of this phenomenon is that Na+ and Li+ had opposite effects on β-CIT binding to SERT (Fig. 2 legend). That only Li+ of all the alkali cations has this effect (Table I) raises the possibility that the conformational change induced by Li+ represents a “salting in” phenomenon by agents that cause protein denaturation at much higher concentrations (25Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. McGraw-Hill, New York1969: 358-364Google Scholar). The ability of Na+ to induce conformational changes has been documented in many transporters (5Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J.

Together with data from the F380Y mutant of SERT (24Kamdar G. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4038-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the present data suggest that for SERT also, Na+ induces a conformational change or stabilizes the native conformation of SERT to oppose the conformational change induced by Li+. In previous studies Li+has been used as an inert replacement for Na+ (4Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Talvenheimo J. Fishkes H. Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

Determinations of the effect of Na+ on ligand association and dissociation rates and affinity assumed that Li+ had no effect of its own on SERT (4Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These earlier studies obviously need to be re-evaluated in light of the current findings. The requirement for Na+ in 5-HT transport, however, has firmer support, because other ions have been shown not to replace Na+ (13Talvenheimo J. Fishkes H. Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6115-6119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of SERT transport activity by MTSET modification of Cys-109 was paralleled by inhibition of 5-HT- and Li+-induced currents (Fig. 4). We repeatedly observed greater inhibition of 5-HT-induced current than Li+-induced current, suggesting that these two conductance levels may result from different states of the transporter. This conclusion is consistent with data from single channel recordings showing that the unitary conductance in 5-HT and Na+ was smaller than the conductance in Li+ (11Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). MTSET blockade of the 5-HT-induced current is consistent with the inactivation of transport under the same conditions. However, this block did not result from a blockade of 5-HT binding, because binding was substantially intact after MTSET treatment (Table I). There are important ways in which these results with SERT contrast with similar experiments performed with DAT. DAT Cys-90 corresponds to SERT Cys-109, and it also reacts with methanethiosulfonate reagents. Modification of DAT Cys-90 by MTSEA increased the binding of a high affinity cocaine analog (7Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and did not inhibit transport (29Chen N. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Justice Jr., J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1608-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but modification of the corresponding Cys-109 in SERT by MTSEA or MTSET inactivated transport activity (6Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). In membranes from cells expressing DAT, modification of Cys-90 was potentiated by binding of cocaine, but in cells expressing SERT, cocaine protected against the inhibition of transport (Fig. 2 A). Despite these seeming differences, there are similarities between the two proteins. In cells expressing SERT, Li+ potentiated the modification of Cys-109, presumably by an increase in the rate of reaction (Fig.1 A), and Li+ potentiated the modification also of Cys-90 in cells expressing DAT. 3J. Javitch, personal communication. Furthermore, both in DAT and SERT, cocaine binding caused a change in accessibility of Cys-109. Apparently that change decreased the cysteine accessibility in SERT and increased it in membranes from cells expressing DAT. Because of the potentiation in DAT, it is unlikely that Cys-90 is in the cocaine binding site. This is consistent with the present results showing that SERT Cys-109 still bound 5-HT and cocaine after MTSET modification (Table I). Rather, it is likely that DAT Cys-90 and SERT Cys-109 are in a conformationally flexible region that is affected allosterically by ligand binding. In summary, Cys-109 in SERT seems to be part of a conformationally flexible first external loop that is influenced by ligand binding and Li+. Binding of cocaine, 5-HT, or Na+ favors a conformation where Cys-109 is less accessible to modification by MTSET. Li+ causes a different conformation change that increases both the accessibility of Cys-109 and also the open probability of the SERT ion channel. Modification of Cys-109 in SERT inactivates transport, presumably by blocking conformational flexibility in that region. The modification blocks the 5-HT-induced current much more than it does the Li+-elicited current, consistent with the proposal (11Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that the conducting states of SERT in 5-HT and Li+ are not identical."

Recently, the involvement of the calmodulin-binding and microtubule-associated proteins STOP in these aspects of microtubule stabilization has become evident. STOP proteins were initially characterized as microtubule cold-stabilizing factors whose activity was inhibited by interaction with Ca2+-calmodulin (14Job D. Fischer E.H. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4679-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Job D. Rauch C.T. Fischer E.H. Margolis R.L.

There are several STOP variants whose expression varies among tissues and during development. Neurons contain two major variants of STOP, N-STOP1 and E-STOP (18Bosc C. Cronk J.D. Pirollet F.

Pirollet F. Lafanechère L. Job D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In mice, fibroblasts express one major STOP variant, F-STOP (13Denarier E.

When expressed in cells, the neuronal N- or E-STOP associate with cytoplasmic microtubules at physiological temperature and induce microtubule resistance to both the cold and nocodazole (18Bosc C. Cronk J.D. Pirollet F. Watterson D.M. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2125-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Guillaud L. Bosc C. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Denarier E. Pirollet F. Lafanechère L. Job D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, in similar conditions, the fibroblastic F-STOP associates with interphase polymers only during cold exposure, being almost entirely diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm in interphase cells at physiological temperature (13Denarier E. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Bosc C. Pirollet F. Chapel A. Margolis R.L. Job D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6055-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consequently, F-STOP induces extensive microtubule cold stability without any detectable effects on microtubule behavior at physiological temperature, including microtubule sensitivity to nocodazole. Injection of STOP neutralizing antibodies suppresses the microtubule resistance to both the cold and nocodazole normally observed in neuronal cells (12Guillaud L. Bosc C. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Denarier E. Pirollet F. Lafanechère L. Job D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the cold stability of cytoplasmic microtubules in fibroblastic cells (13Denarier E. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Bosc C. Pirollet F. Chapel A. Margolis R.L. Job D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6055-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, STOP proteins are key factors responsible for the different patterns of microtubule stabilization observed in cells. Although the behavior and stabilizing activity of STOP proteins in cells are now firmly established, very little is known concerning the STOP domain structure. In particular, information concerning the number and location of calmodulin- and microtubule-binding sites on the proteins has been lacking. Consequently, the molecular basis for the different activities of the various STOP variants and the mechanism of STOP regulation by calmodulin are unknown. In this study we have combined new methods of detection of protein-protein interactions (immobilized peptide arrays) with biochemical and cellular assays of STOP activity to probe the STOP domain structure. We demonstrate that STOP has multiple calmodulin-binding sites which partially overlap with two distinct sets of microtubule-stabilizing motifs. The motif composition of STOP variants determines the type of microtubule stabilization which these variants generate in cells. Furthermore, the presence of STOP motifs in apparently unrelated proteins indicates that they may be functional components shared by several diverse cell effectors. cDNAs coding for a series of STOP mutants were constructed, using standard molecular biology techniques. Using aa numbering as in rat N-STOP protein (18Bosc C. Cronk J.D. Pirollet F. Watterson D.M. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Δ1, Δ2, Δ3, and Δ5 correspond to the deletion of calmodulin-binding peptides Cam1, Cam2, Cam3, and Cam5 as described in the text. Δ1 results to the deletion of aa 2–19. Δ2 results to the replacement of aa 124–138 by Ala. Δ3 results to the deletion of aa 162–171 or to the replacement of aa 162–174 by Ile-Gln, in mutants derived from LNt and from other STOP fragments, respectively. Δ5 results in the deletion of aa 481–495. The constructs were derived from plasmidspSG5-STOP (18Bosc C. Cronk J.D. Pirollet F. Watterson D.M. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The overlapping peptides were synthesized spotwise as an array on a specially manufactured cellulose membrane (AIMS Scientific Products GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany). The peptides are permanently linked to the membrane through their carboxyl-terminal aa via a polyethylene glycol spacer. The synthesis procedure followed exactly that of Ref.21Frank R. Overwin H.

Briefly, peptide membrane was washed three times (7 min each) with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and saturated with blocking buffer (TBS-T plus 10% fetal calf serum) overnight at 4 °C.

Relative binding values were determined by scanning the membrane with a PhosphorImager with the ImageQuant and MultiQuant softwares (Molecular Dynamics, Bondoufle, France). Assay was performed as described in Ref. 18Bosc C. Cronk J.D. Pirollet F. Watterson D.M. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting plasmid pBacHt-F-STOP was transformed in DH10Bac bacteria (Life Technologies) to produce recombinant bacmid DNA. Recombinant protein was obtained according to the manufacturers instructions by infection of High 5 cells for 60 h. The recombinant protein was purified on a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) using Tris buffer and according to the manufacturers instructions. The protein in elution buffer was desalted on Bio-Gel P6 column (Bio-Rad, Marne-la-Coquette, France) equilibrated with MEM buffer (100 mm Mes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.75) supplemented with 0.1 m NaCl. We assayed the interaction between dansylated calmodulin (CaM-D) and F-STOP using fluorescence emission anisotropy measurements and a SLM-8000 spectrofluorimeter, modified for full computer control with Bio-kine software and controller (Bio-Logic, Claix, France). CaM-D was from Sigma and calmodulin from Calbiotech (San Diego, CA). Measurements were performed at room temperature in a 1 × 1-cm fluorescence cuvette under continuous stirring. Excitation was provided using a xenon-mercury arc lamp (150 W) and a monochromator fixed at 330 nm. Emitted light was detected at 90°, at 495 nm. Binding assays were performed in MEM buffer containing 0.1m NaCl and 2 mm CaCl2. For each experimental point, we measured ΔF as the difference between the observed fluorescence and the baseline fluorescence determined in the presence of CaM-D alone. Two concentrations of CaM-D were used in the present study, 200 and 400 nm. Maximum ΔF, ΔF Max200, and ΔF Max400, corresponding to Cam-D saturation with F-STOP, were determined from the plateaus of titration curves run at 200 and 400 nm CaM-D, respectively. For analysis of calmodulin binding to F-STOP, F-STOP (0.6 µm) was mixed with CaM-D (0.4 µm) in a total volume of 1.5 ml. Then calmodulin (1–3 µl of stock solutions) was added stepwise to increasing concentrations (total added volume of 30 µl). For Scatchard representation, the bound calmodulin concentration was calculated at each calmodulin concentration as ΔF/ΔF Max400 × [total calmodulin]. The free calmodulin concentration was calculated as [total calmodulin] − [bound calmodulin]. For analysis of F-STOP binding to calmodulin, CaM-D (0.2 µm) was mixed with increasing concentrations of F-STOP (0.5 to 3.1 µm) as above. These F-STOP concentrations corresponded to excess yet nonsaturating concentrations of F-STOP compared with calmodulin. In this condition of molar excess of F-STOP compared with calmodulin, the possibility of binding several calmodulin molecules to single F-STOP molecules was minimized and the concentration of bound F-STOP was equal to the concentration of bound calmodulin. Therefore, for Scatchard representation, bound F-STOP was calculated as ΔF/ΔF Max200 × [total calmodulin]. The free F-STOP concentration was calculated as [total F-STOP ] − [bound F-STOP]. For F-STOP, protein concentration was determined using both the Micro-BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL) and the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Results were similar for both assays. The concentration of calmodulin was determined using ultraviolet spectroscopy and an extinction coefficient ε276 = 3300m−1 cm−1. Exponentially growing HeLa cells were transfected with cDNAs coding for either N-STOP or the STOP mutants described above, using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) as a transfection reagent, according to the manufacturers instructions. For control of transfection, efficiency cells were co-transfected with plasmid pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Transfected cells were either exposed to cold temperature (30 min on ice) or to nocodazole (20 µm for 30 min). Cells were then permeabilized in lysis buffer (80 mm Pipes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 6.75) and fixed for 6 min at −20 °C in methanol. Microtubules were stained with β-tubulin mAb TUB2.1 (1:100, Sigma) and anti-mouse Cy3-coupled secondary antibody (1:1000, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Images were digitalized using a Princeton RTE-CCD-1317-K/1 camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) and IPLab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). Accession numbers for known STOP sequences are: CAA63762for rat N-STOP, JC5963 for mouse N-STOP, CAA75989 for mouse F-STOP, andAAC79958 for chicken E-STOP (cNau). Mouse E-STOP protein sequence was deduced from mouse genomic sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers Y14754 and Y14755). Searches for novel STOP proteins or analogs were performed using the BLAST program available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. The human N-STOP protein sequence was deduced from human genomic sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AP001922). Fugu STOP protein sequence was deduced from the Fugu GenBankTM genomic sequences (accession numbers AL018984, AL019006, AL019013, AL019018, andAL020541) and from the UK HGMP-RC Fugu Project (fugu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk) genomic sequence 169C21bA1. Tetraodon STOP protein sequence was deduced from Tetraodon genomic sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AL233485, AL250780, AL253833, AL283813, and AL299238). STOP proteins have two salient properties: they behave asbona fide calmodulin-binding proteins in vitro, being absorbed on Ca2+-calmodulin columns at high ionic strength; they have the capacity to induce microtubule stabilization in cells. To localize the STOP sequences responsible for these biochemical and functional properties of the protein, we assayed a series of STOP deletion mutants for capacity to bind to immobilized calmodulin and to stabilize cellular microtubules. As a preliminary step to facilitate the search for STOP sequences interacting with calmodulin, we used immobilized peptide arrays to detect candidate calmodulin-binding peptides in N-STOP. Immobilized peptide arrays have been initially used for epitope mapping in studies of antibody-antigen interactions (23Darji A. Niebuhr K. Hense M. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Weiss S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2356-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, immobilized peptides have been used successfully for the mapping of the binding domains involved in other types of protein-protein interactions (24Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R.

Biol. 2000; 304: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A basic condition for successful use of the technique is that the interaction under study involves linear peptide stretches on at least one of the partners. This seemed to be the case for calmodulin interaction with target proteins. Known calmodulin-binding sites on proteins comprise linear aa stretches of about 15–30 aa in length, with a core domain of about 14 aa (27Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). As a preliminary test of the method, we assayed calmodulin binding to immobilized peptides corresponding to the calmodulin-binding site of CaM-kinase II (28Hanley R.M. Means A.R. Ono T. Kemp B.E. Burgin K.E. Waxham N. Kelly P.T. Science. 1987; 237: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and its flanking sequences. A single cluster of positive spots was detected, corresponding to the known calmodulin-binding domain of CaM-kinase II (Fig.1 A). Applied to N-STOP which is the largest variant of STOP and which contains all known STOP sequences, the same method yielded at least 12 clusters of overlapping peptides (Fig. 1 B), corresponding to 12 peaks of radioactivity upon quantitative analysis (Fig. 1 C). As a control for the Ca2+ dependence of the calmodulin interaction with STOP peptides, an N-STOP peptide-membrane was incubated with 35S-labeled calmodulin in the presence of excess EGTA. No detectable binding of 35S-labeled calmodulin to STOP peptides was observed in this condition (not shown). The position of the 12 35S-radioactive peaks in the N-STOP sequence is shown in Fig. 1 D and TableI shows the aa sequences of the 12 putative N-STOP calmodulin-binding peptides (corresponding to the maximum of the radioactivity peaks shown in Fig. 1 C). N-STOP contains two distinct repeat domains, a central repeat domain containing 5 tandem repeats of 46 aa and a carboxyl-terminal repeat domain containing 28 repeats of an 11-aa motif (18Bosc C. Cronk J.D. Pirollet F. Watterson D.M. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2125-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Four calmodulin-binding peptides were located upstream of the central repeats. Each central repeat contained a calmodulin-binding peptide. Three calmodulin-binding peptides were located between the central repeats and the carboxyl-terminal repeat domain. Only weak signals were observed in this latter STOP domain.Table IAmino acid sequence of the STOP calmodulin-binding peptidesPeptideSequenceAmino acid positionCam1MAWPCITRACCIARF1–15Cam2RAWKVQRPEPSCRPR124–138Cam3AWPLPRRGDHPWIPK160–174Cam4PVLGMPKRRPQSQER187–201CamR1TRRKAGPAWMVTRTE235–249CamR2DTRRKAGPAWMVTRT280–294CamR3RDTRRKAGPAWMVTR325–339CamR4TRRKAGPAWMVTRTE373–387CamR5RKAGPAWMVRRSEGH421–435Cam5RAWTDIKPVKPIKAK481–495Cam6RRRIRSLYSEPFKES532–546Cam7PKKTSTSQKPLRKAK559–573The sequences are given for the peptides corresponding to the maximum of the radioactivity peaks shown in Fig. 1 B.

These results suggested the presence of multiple and specific Ca2+-calmodulin-binding sites on N-STOP. However, this multiplicity of sites was not completely expected and we tested whether multiple calmodulin-binding sites were indeed accessible in STOPs. We used F-STOP for test because we have succeeded in producing this STOP variant using a baculovirus expression system. According to immobilized peptide analysis of N-STOP, F-STOP is predicted to contain six calmodulin-binding peptides (CamR1, CamR2, CamR4, CamR5, Cam5, and Cam6, Fig. 2 A). Scatchard analysis of calmodulin binding to F-STOP showed a biphasic graph, compatible with the presence of three to four binding sites with aK d of 1.7 µm and of additional binding sites with a K d of 8.1 µm (Fig.2 B) on each F-STOP molecule. Within the scope of the present paper, the important finding was that the Scatchard plot yielded an estimate of a total of about 7 calmodulin-binding sites per F-STOP molecule, in reasonable agreement with the number of calmodulin-binding peptides detected using immobilized peptide analysis (six). As a control of our analysis and of the reliability of our binding site concentration estimates, we assayed F-STOP binding to calmodulin in conditions in which the probability of binding several calmodulin molecules on each F-STOP molecule was minimized (see methods, Fig.2 C). In such conditions, a linear Scatchard plot was observed and yielded a calculated binding site concentration of 178 nm in good agreement with the actual concentration of calmodulin in the assay, i.e. 200 nm (Fig.2 B). Taken together, these results indicate the presence of multiple calmodulin-binding sequences in STOP proteins and yield an identification of candidate calmodulin-binding sequences in STOP. This information proved to be most useful for mutant analysis, as shown below. N-STOP binds to immobilized calmodulin columns in the presence of 0.4 m NaCl and 1 mmfree Ca2+ (18Bosc C. Cronk J.D. Pirollet F. Watterson D.M. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2125-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We wished to identify the N-STOP sequences responsible for this solid interaction of the protein with immobilized calmodulin. To do this we tested STOP fragments and deletion mutants for capacity to bind to immobilized calmodulin at high ionic strength, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. STOP fragments and mutants were produced by in vitro translation of the corresponding cDNAs in reticulocyte lysates containing35S-labeled methionine. Fig.3 shows typical chromatography profiles corresponding to a positive (A to C) and a negative result (D). In experiments scored as positive, translation products were retained on calmodulin affinity columns in the presence of Ca2+ and 0.4 m NaCl (Fig.3 A, compare lanes L and F), whereas the bulk of lysate proteins were eluted in the column flow-through (Fig. 3 B). The bound translation products could be eluted from the column in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2–6). Additionally, the same translation products failed to bind to control columns run in the presence of EGTA (Fig.3 C). In experiments scored as negative, translation products failed to bind to immobilized calmodulin, even in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3 D). Thus, differences between positives and negatives were clear-cut. For mapping of the sequences responsible for N-STOP binding to immobilized calmodulin, we first applied the column assay described above to large protein subdomains, then to subdomains deleted for the putative calmodulin-binding peptides identified on immobilized peptide arrays. The protein was subdivided into three subdomains corresponding to the amino-terminal domain located upstream of the central repeats (LNt), the central repeats (5R), and the carboxyl-terminal domain located downstream of the central repeats (LCt), respectively (Fig.4 A). The STOP domains containing either the amino-terminal domain of the protein (LNt) or the central repeats (5R) bound to immobilized calmodulin columns. In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein (LCt) did not bind to immobilized calmodulin. Subdomains LNt and 5R were subjected to further deletion mutant analysis.

This raises a critical question as to whether Axin-based differential molecular assemblies exist and how these may act to coordinate the two separate pathways. Here we show that both wild-type glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and kinase-dead GSK-3β-Y216F (capable of binding to Axin), but not GSK-3β-K85M (incapable of binding to Axin in mammalian cells), prevented MEKK1 binding to the Axin complex, thereby inhibiting JNK activation. We further show that casein kinase Iε also inhibited Axin-mediated JNK activation by competing against MEKK1 binding. In contrast, β-catenin and adenomatous polyposis coli binding did not affect MEKK1 binding to the same Axin complex. This suggests that even when Axin is “switched” to activate the JNK pathway, it is still capable of sequestering free β-catenin, which is a critical aspect for cellular homeostasis. Our results clearly demonstrate that differential molecular assemblies underlie the duality of Axin functions in the negative regulation of Wnt signaling and activation of the JNK MAPK pathway.

Intensive studies of Wnt signaling in a variety of organisms have provided a general understanding of the molecular machinery of the signaling pathway. Regulation of Wnt signaling is achieved at least in part by intracellular levels of β-catenin. In the absence of Wnt signals, there forms a large multimeric protein complex comprising Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC),1 glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and β-catenin, which enhances GSK-3β phosphorylation of β-catenin. Phosphorylation targets β-catenin for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by a proteasome pathway, keeping the cytoplasmic levels of free β-catenin low (5Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J.

A serine/threonine kinase, GSK-3β phosphorylates one or more conserved serine/threonine residues in the N-terminal region of β-catenin. Phosphorylation at tyrosine 216 of GSK-3β is critical for its kinase activity (14Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GSK-3β kinase activity can be inhibited through phosphorylation of its serine 9 residue by Akt or protein kinase A (15van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. van Lint J.

Overexpression of a kinase-dead GSK-3β mutant (GSK-3β-K85M) in which the conserved lysine residue in its ATP-binding domain is altered has been shown to stabilize and promote nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and to induce an ectopic axis in Xenopus (17He X.

Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is one of the major targets for GSK-3β phosphorylation (20Ikeda S.

Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Mutation or deletion of the putative GSK-3β phosphorylation sites in β-catenin results in constitutively active forms of β-catenin that are highly stable (22Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V.

However, GSK-3β does not bind β-catenin directly and requires Axin and APC to facilitate its interaction with β-catenin (25Hedgepeth C.M. Deardorff M.A. Rankin K. Klein P.S. Mol. Cell.

Axin, which was first identified as the product of the fused locus in mice, strongly promotes the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β (27Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry W.L.

Axin hence serves as a scaffold protein, binding directly to APC, GSK-3β, β-catenin, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and casein kinase to coordinate the regulation of β-catenin levels for Wnt signaling (20Ikeda S.

Consistent with its role in preventing tumorigenesis, reintroduction of Axin into primary hepatocellular carcinoma cells or overexpression in Chinese hamster ovary cells leads to apoptosis (32Satoh S.

The regulation of β-catenin signaling can also be achieved by the binding of the B56 subunit of protein phosphatase 2A to APC (37Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In the Wnt pathway, the role of APC has recently been shown to be required for both degradation and β-catenin export out of the nucleus (38Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar,39Kawahara K. Morishita T. Nakamura T. Hamada F. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8369-8374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Casein kinase Iε (CKIε) has recently been found to be an activator of Wnt signaling in that microinjection of CKIε intoXenopus induces a secondary axis (29Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 40Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CKIε mimics Wnt signaling by stabilizing β-catenin, thereby increasing the expression of β-catenin-dependent genes. Inhibition of CKIε in Caenorhabditis elegans produced worms with a mom phenotype, which is indicative of a loss of Wnt signals. In addition, CKIε can be detected in the Axin·GSK-3β complex (29Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It binds to and increases the phosphorylation of Dishevelled, a known component of the Wnt pathway. However, the mechanism of CKIε in regulating the stability of β-catenin as well as the JNK pathway remains elusive. The multimeric nature of Axin complexes suggests that Axin may also be an important player in other cell signaling pathways, in addition to its role in Wnt signaling. In particular, we have demonstrated that Axin overexpression stimulates JNK/SAPK signaling (41Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 42Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although structural analysis of Axin indicates that the binding domains for APC, GSK-3β, and β-catenin are not required for JNK activation, it is not known whether binding of these Wnt component proteins with Axin functionally affects the ability of Axin to activate JNK. Structurally, it is also not known whether there exist differential molecular assemblies based on Axin dual functions. Here we show that Axin activation of JNK in mammalian cells is inhibited by both GSK-3β and CKIε, but not by β-catenin or APC. Whereas GSK-3β-K85M did not bind to Axin in mammalian cells and had no effect on Axin activation of JNK, GSK-3β-Y216F was capable of binding to Axin and inhibited Axin-mediated JNK activation as effectively as wild-type GSK-3β. This suggests that the inhibition of Axin-mediated JNK activation by GSK-3β depends on GSK-3β binding to Axin, but not its kinase activity. We further demonstrate that CKIε also inhibits JNK activation by competing against MEKK1 binding to Axin. These observations indicate the existence of differential assemblies: a Wnt pathway Axin complex that includes GSK-3β and CKIε and a JNK pathway Axin complex that includes MEKK1. On the other hand, β-catenin and APC do not affect the affinity of Axin for MEKK1, and they can exist in either of the complexes. Our results demonstrate that differential Axin-based molecular complexes underlie the dual function of the scaffold protein Axin to down-regulate Wnt signaling or to facilitate JNK activation. The Axin, AxinΔRGS, AxinΔMID, and MEKK1-C constructs were as previously described (41Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). AxinΔGSK-3β was generated by replacing theBamHI/SalI C-terminal portion of wild-type Axin with a polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment. The oligonucleotides used for the polymerase chain reaction were 5′-GGATCCACAAGCTGCCTTCTGTCC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACTCAGTCCACCTTTTCCACC-3′. AxinΔβ-catenin was generated by deletion of the AxinNcoI/PstI fragment for β-catenin binding. Wild-type GSK-3β and β-catenin constructs were as previously described (17He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The GSK-3β mutants GSK-3β-K85M and GSK-3β-Y216F were generated by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used to create the GSK-3β-K85M mutant were 5′-CTGGTCGCCATCAtGAAAGTATTGCAGGACAAG-3′ and 5′-GTCCTGCAATACTTTCaTGATGGCGACCAGTTC-3′, whereas the oligonucleotides used to create the GSK-3β-Y216F mutant were 5′-CCCAATGTTTCGTtTATCTGTTCTCGGTACTATAG-3′ and 5′-CCGAGAACAGATAaACGAAACATTGGGTTC-3′. β-cateninΔN was created by deletion of the NcoI/SacI N-terminal fragment of β-catenin. The LEF reporter plasmid pGL3-fos-7LEF-luciferase was from L. T. William (Chiron). The expression plasmid for APC was from P. Polakis (Onyx Pharmaceuticals). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU of penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Transfections were performed in 60-mm dishes using SuperfectTM (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 4 µg with the empty vector pCMV5 where necessary. Cells were harvested at 40 h post-transfection and lysed in lysis buffer as described (41Zhang Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), sonicated three times for 5 s each, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. For JNK kinase assays, FLAG-tagged JNK1 was immunoprecipitated using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma), and JNK activity was determined as described previously using 1 µg of GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79; Stratagene) as substrate (41Zhang Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). -Fold activation of JNK was determined by an imaging analyzer (Molecular Dynamics Model 425E) and normalized to the respective expression levels. Data are expressed as -fold kinase activation compared with vector-transfected cells, and the values represent the means ± S.E. from three separate experiments. Transiently transfected 293T cells in 60-mm dishes were lysed in lysis buffer, sonicated three times for 5 s each, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. HA- or Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-Myc (9E10), anti-MEKK1 (C-22) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-APC (Pharmingen), anti-GSK-3β, or anti-β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories) antibodies and protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as indicated. Immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. The boiled samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, the membranes were probed with anti-HA, anti-Myc (9E10), anti-MEKK1 (C-22), anti-β-catenin, or anti-APC antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. 293T cells were transfected with 0.1 µg of pGL3-fos-7LEF-luciferase, 0.1 µg of pCMV-β-galactosidase, 0.2 µg of β-catenin or β-cateninΔN, and 0.2 µg of APC or MEKK1 together with either 0.2 µg of vector or each of the Axin constructs using DOSPER (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activities were measured as previously described (33Neo S.Y. Zhang Y. Yaw L.P. Li P. Lin S.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At 32 h post-transfection, cells were lysed, divided into two portions, and measured for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities (Promega). The ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity varied by <10% among the samples. Data are presented as means from three separate experiments performed in triplicate. The scaffold protein Axin exerts a dual function in attenuating Wnt signaling by down-regulating the levels of β-catenin (20Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 27Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Constantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) as well as activating the JNK MAPK pathway by binding to MEKK1 (33Neo S.Y. Zhang Y. Yaw L.P. Li P. Lin S.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 41Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism of how this dual role is achieved and regulated, we tested for the effects on Axin activation of JNK and changes in Axin complex formation exerted by molecules that are known to interact with Axin, including GSK-3β, CKIε, β-catenin, APC, and MEKK1. We began by examining the effect of GSK-3β on Axin activation of JNK. 293T cells were transfected with JNK1 and Axin in the presence or absence of GSK-3β and assayed for JNK activation. Fig. 1(left panel) shows that in the absence of GSK-3β, Axin induced JNK activity. Although expression of GSK-3β alone had virtually no effect on the basal JNK activity, coexpression of Axin with wild-type GSK-3β resulted in a dramatic decrease in Axin activation of JNK. In a control experiment, we used AxinΔGSK, which is truncated for the GSK-3β-binding site. As shown in Fig. 1 (right panel), AxinΔGSK strongly activated JNK, and neither wild-type GSK-3β nor the GSK-3β mutants altered JNK activity induced by AxinΔGSK, indicating that GSK-3β inhibition acts through Axin binding. To determine whether GSK-3β inhibition of Axin JNK activity was due to the kinase activity of GSK-3β, we assayed the level of JNK activation by Axin in the presence of either one of the kinase-dead GSK-3β mutants, GSK-3β-K85M and GSK-3β-Y216F. These GSK-3β mutants exhibited decreased GSK-3β kinase activity compared with wild-type GSK-3β (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 (left panel), coexpression of Axin with GSK-3β-K85M had no effect on Axin JNK activity. However, GSK-3β-Y216F inhibited JNK activation by Axin as effectively as wild-type GSK-3β, suggesting that GSK-3β inhibition of JNK activation is irrespective of its kinase activity. To further elucidate whether the inhibition is due to the binding of GSK-3β to Axin, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay of Axin with wild-type GSK-3β, mutant GSK-3β-Y216F, or GSK-3β-K85M. As shown in Fig. 2(A and C), Myc-Axin coprecipitated with wild-type HA-GSK-3β and HA-GSK-3β-Y216F, but not with HA-GSK-3β-K85M. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed a similar result. Wild-type HA-GSK-3β and HA-GSK-3β-Y216F were detected in Myc-Axin immunoprecipitates, whereas HA-GSK-3β-K85M was not detected. These results suggest that inhibition of Axin-mediated JNK activation by GSK-3β depends on GSK-3β binding to Axin, but not its kinase activity. To examine this point further, we cotransfected Axin and GSK-3β with Akt, which can phosphorylate and inhibit GSK-3β (15van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Although coexpression of Akt reduced the activity of GSK-3β to phosphorylate its substrate peptide in an immunokinase assay, Akt had virtually no effect on the Axin·GSK-3β assembly and did not affect Axin-mediated JNK activation (data not shown). We have previously reported that binding of Axin with MEKK1 is critical for activating JNK (41Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since wild-type GSK-3β inhibited Axin activation of JNK (Fig. 1), we asked if wild-type GSK-3β would affect the binding of MEKK1 with Axin. To address this, we transfected cells with full-length Myc-Axin and MEKK1-C in the presence or absence of HA-GSK-3β and performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. As expected, when Myc-Axin was expressed with either HA-GSK-3β or MEKK1-C, Myc-Axin was detected in the HA-GSK-3β and MEKK1-C immunoprecipitates, respectively (Fig. 2 A). In reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments, similar results were obtained. However, when HA-GSK-3β was coexpressed with Myc-Axin and MEKK1-C, we noted a significant reduction of Myc-Axin in the MEKK1-C immunoprecipitate. This suggests that binding of Axin with MEKK1-C and with GSK-3β is mutually exclusive and that Axin preferentially binds GSK-3β over MEKK1-C. In a control experiment using Myc-AxinΔGSK, which has lost its ability to bind HA-GSK-3β, MEKK1-C was detected in the immunoprecipitate even in the presence of HA-GSK-3β (Fig.2 B). We further proved that GSK-3β binding to Axin is an event prior to the inhibition of Axin activation of JNK in the experiments using two kinase-dead GSK-3β mutants, GSK-3β-K85M and GSK-3β-Y216F, which exhibit different characteristics in Axin binding. We took advantage of the finding that GSK-3β-Y216F is capable of binding to Axin, whereas GSK-3β-K85M loses its ability to interact with Axin in mammalian cells. We tested if these two mutants would affect the Axin-MEKK1 interaction by performing similar co-immunoprecipitation assays. Fig.2 C shows that in the absence of MEKK1-C, Myc-Axin coprecipitated with HA-GSK-3β-Y216F, but not with HA-GSK-3β-K85M. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed a similar result. In the presence of MEKK1-C, GSK-3β-Y216F could be detected in the Axin immunoprecipitate. In contrast, MEKK1-C was detected in the Axin immunoprecipitate even in the presence of GSK-3β-K85M, which could not bind to Axin. These data confirm that Axin·GSK-3β and Axin·MEKK1-C are separate complexes. Axin preferentially binds GSK-3β over MEKK1-C. The observation that GSK-3β and MEKK1 are mutually exclusive in the complex formation with Axin prompted us to further investigate if CKIε, a Wnt signaling activator, can modulate the differential assemblies of the Axin complex. It has been shown that CKIε is in the Dvl·Axin complex; however, it is not clear if CKIε directly interacts with Axin independent of Dvl. As shown in Fig.3A, in 293T cells cotransfected with Myc-tagged CKIε together with HA-tagged Axin, we found that CKIε was present in the Axin immunoprecipitate. Reciprocally, in the CKIε immunoprecipitate, Axin was similarly detected. Although Axin was detected in the MEKK1 precipitate in the absence of CKIε, when CKIε was cotransfected with Axin and MEKK1, MEKK1 was no longer co-immunoprecipitated with Axin (Fig.3 B). In accordance with the binding results, CKIε significantly inhibited Axin-induced JNK activation in the immunokinase assay (Fig. 3 C). A critical aspect of Axin function is to regulate free β-catenin at proper levels. We therefore examined if Axin still binds to β-catenin when it is engaged in MEKK1 binding. We used the degradation-resistant N-terminal deleted form of β-catenin, β-cateninΔN, in the co-immunoprecipitation and immunokinase assays. 293T cells were transfected with different combinations of Myc-Axin, MEKK1-C, and HA-tagged β-cateninΔN. As shown in Fig. 4B, when Myc-Axin was coexpressed with HA-β-cateninΔN in the absence of MEKK1-C, Myc-Axin was detected in the HA-β-cateninΔN immunoprecipitate and vice versa. MEKK1-C itself did not bind to HA-β-cateninΔN in the absence of Axin. When all three proteins were expressed together, MEKK1-C was coprecipitated in the β-cateninΔN immunoprecipitate as well as in the Axin immunoprecipitate. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that HA-β-cateninΔN was coprecipitated with MEKK1-C and Myc-Axin, suggesting that binding of Axin with β-catenin does not disrupt Axin·MEKK1 complex formation. We next examined the effect of β-catenin on Axin activation of JNK. 293T cells were transfected with JNK1 and Axin in the presence or absence of HA-β-cateninΔN and assayed for JNK activation. Fig.4 A shows that expression of β-cateninΔN alone had no effect on JNK activity. The JNK activity induced by Axin was unaltered even in the presence of degradation-resistant β-cateninΔN (Fig.4 A), in contrast to the inhibition by wild-type GSK-3β observed earlier (Figs. 1 and 4 A). Similar results were obtained in the experiments using full-length β-catenin, although its protein levels became much lower in those samples coexpressed with wild-type Axin (data not shown). APC is a critical modulator of β-catenin function in that APC is needed for ubiquitin-mediated degradation as well as for shuffling β-catenin between the cytoplasmic components and the nucleus. We then asked if APC is with Axin when MEKK1 is bound. As shown in Fig. 5B, when Myc-Axin was coexpressed with APC in the absence of MEKK1-C, Myc-Axin was detected in the APC immunoprecipitate; and reciprocally, APC was present in the Axin complex. When MEKK1-C was coexpressed, it did not change the Axin·APC complex formation. APC is therefore co-present in the Axin·MEKK1 complex (Fig. 5 B). We next examined the effect of APC on Axin activation of JNK. 293T cells were transfected with JNK1 and Axin in the presence or absence of APC and assayed for JNK activation. Fig. 5 A shows that the high level o"

The protein plays a common functional role in different RNA viruses by enwrapping the viral genomic RNA in an RNase-resistant form. Upon expression of the nucleocapsid protein alone in COS cells and in bacteria, it forms large insoluble aggregates. In this work, we have reported for the first time the full-length cloning of the N gene of Chandipura virus and its expression in Escherichia coli in a soluble monomeric form and purification using nonionic detergents. The biological activity of the soluble recombinant protein has been tested, and it was found to possess efficient RNA-binding ability. The state of aggregation of the recombinant protein was monitored using light scattering. In the absence of nonionic detergents, it formed large aggregates. Aggregation was significantly reduced in the presence of osmolytes such asd-sorbitol. Aggregate formation was suppressed in the presence of another viral product, phosphoprotein P, in a chaperone-like manner. Both the osmolyte and phosphoprotein P also suppressed aggregation to a great extent during refolding from a guanidine hydrochloride-denatured form. The function of the phosphoprotein and osmolyte appears to be synergistic to keep the N-protein in a soluble biologically competent form in virus-infected cells.

Chandipura virus vesicular stomatitis virus 5-(2-iodoacetylaminoethyl)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid polymerase chain reaction isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) dynamic light scattering 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) The (−)-strand RNA viruses (rhabdovirus, influenza, rabies, measles, and Ebola) consist of important human pathogens, including Chandipura virus (CHPV),1 a member of the Rhabdoviridae family (1Bhatt P.N. Rodrigues F.M. J. Med. Res. 1967; 55: 1295-1305Google Scholar). The structure, function, and genetic makeup of this negative sense RNA virus resemble those of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Still, it can be distinguished from two other members of the rhabdovirus family, VSV New Jersey serotype and VSV Indiana serotype, not only in its host species origin and serology (2Dragunova J. Zavada J. Acta Virol. (Prague) (Engl. Ed.). 1979; 23: 319-328PubMed Google Scholar), but also in nucleotide sequences of genes and amino acid sequences of proteins (3Masters P.M. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1987; 157: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Upon infection by members of the rhabdovirus family, five major viral proteins, N (nucleocapsid), P (phosphoprotein), L (large), M (matrix), and G (glycoprotein), are synthesized. The N-protein encapsidates genomic RNA in a precise structure that can be compared with histone-mediated enwrapping of a DNA molecule into a nucleosome structure. Only this encapsidated form of the genome can be recognized by viral polymerase as its template during both transcription and replication (4Banerjee A.K. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 66-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleocapsid proteins not only protect the viral genome from RNase action, but are also thought to play some vital regulatory roles in the transition from transcription to replication in the viral life cycle, referred to as the transcription-replication switch. Previous studies have indicated that the N-protein has a common tendency to form large aggregates that are biologically inactive. In VSV, it was observed that interaction of the N-protein with the P-protein keeps the N-protein in a soluble form in vivo that is capable of enwrapping the de novo synthesized genomic RNA. N-protein/P-protein interaction also may confer specificity for RNA-binding activity (5Masters P.S. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2658-2664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the N-protein where it channels the N-protein pool to viral RNA sequences only. This regulatory importance of N-protein/P-protein interaction makes it an important biological event in the viral life cycle. In influenza virus, the nucleoprotein was found to interact with viral RNA polymerase, directly modulating its activity (6Biswas S.K. Boutz L.P. Nayak P.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5493-5501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In VSV, it has been proposed that the P-protein in its phosphorylated multimeric state forms a complex with the L-protein to produce functional transcriptase, whereas in its unphosphorylated state, it complexes with the L-protein to form replicase. The N-protein has been suggested to be an integral member of the replicase complex (7Pattnaik A.K. Hwang L. Li T. Englund N. Mathur M. Das T. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8167-8175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The multifunctional nature of the N-protein and its interaction with different targets make this viral product an attractive model for a detailed structure-function analysis in the CHPV system so that its precise role in different stages of the viral life cycle can be elucidated. One of the important aspects of N-protein function is the maintenance of its active and soluble form. As mentioned before, in its free form, the protein has a tendency to form aggregates in vitro and perhaps in vivo (8Hsu C.H. Kingsbury D.W. Murti K.G. J. Virol. 1979; 32: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How the cellular environment maintains a soluble and active pool of the N-protein is crucial to understanding the roles played by various cellular factors in the viral life cycle. Clearly, the P-protein increases the solubility of the N-proteinin vivo through formation of complexes. However, the structural nature of the N-protein in these complexes is not known. Thus, the possibility is raised that the P-protein may be interacting with a disordered N-protein in a chaperone-like fashion. Protein folding studies in vivo have elucidated the crucial roles of osmolytes (9Baskakov I. Bolen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 273: 4831-4834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and chaperone systems in suppressing aggregation and shifting the distribution toward the folded state, thereby enhancing the activity and solubility of the proteins. A central point in this study is to understand the roles of the P-protein and intracellular osmolytes in maintaining and enhancing the solubility of the N-protein, thereby ensuring a steady supply for encapsidation of progeny viruses. Pfu DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Tripure reagentTM and Superscript II reverse transcriptase were from Life Technologies, Inc. Klenow polymerase, SP6 RNA polymerase, DNase, 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The gel extraction kit was from QIAGEN Inc. The Mono-Q column was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Sigma. I-EDANS was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Prestained molecular mass markers and Bio-Beads SM-2 adsorbent were from Bio-Rad. Other common reagents were of analytical grade. The viral genomic RNA was isolated from CHPV (strain 1653514) using Tripure reagentTMaccording to the manufacturer's protocol. Isolated RNA was estimated qualitatively and quantitatively by running 1% MOPS gel and by spectrophotometric analysis at 260 and 280 nm, respectively. Two terminal primers (DJC1 and DJC2) were designed to clone the N gene by reverse transcription-PCR. Primer DJC1 (5′-TTTATA CATATG AGTTCTCAAGTA-3′) included a hexameric anchor followed by anNdeI restriction enzyme site. The rest of the sequence corresponds to the 5′ terminus of the N gene. In primer DJC2 (5′-TTTATA GGATCC TCATGCAAAGAG-3′), the hexameric anchor was followed by a BamHI restriction enzyme site, and the rest of the sequence was complementary to the 3′-end of the N gene (3Masters P.M. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1987; 157: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with primer DJC1 and viral genomic RNA as template using Superscript II reverse transcriptase, and PCR was done with Pfu polymerase according to the instructions given by the manufacturer. The PCR product was run on a 1% agarose gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA (Fig. 1). The PCR product purified from the 1% agarose gel using QIAGEN gel extraction resin was blunt-ended with Klenow polymerase and cloned intoSmaI-digested pUC18 vector using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue, and positive clones were confirmed by restriction digestion, followed by direct sequencing of the recombinant DNA (Fig. 1). The full-length N gene of CHPV was digested in the pUC18-NC clone withNdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes, and the released DNA fragment was subcloned intoNdeI/BamHI-cut pET-3a vector under the control of the T7 promoter. The recombinant DNA was digested with different restriction enzymes for further confirmation (Fig. 1). Competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pET-3a-NC plasmid DNA, and transformed cells were inoculated in 100 ml of Luria broth supplemented with 20 mm glucose containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C under shaking conditions until A600 = 0.3. Cells were then induced with 500 µm IPTG for 4 h at 37 °C (10Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dum J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). After harvesting, the cell pellet was suspended in 2 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. For lysis, lysozyme was added at a concentration of 250 µg/ml to buffer A, and the suspension was kept on ice for 1 h. The cells were then sonicated to reduce the viscosity due to chromosomal DNA, and lysates were clarified by spinning at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble supernatant was separated from the inclusion body pellet. The inclusion body pellet obtained after centrifugation was denatured and taken into 2 ml of a solution of 8 m urea in buffer A. The soluble and urea fractions were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Different parameters such as IPTG concentration, temperature, and duration of induction were varied to maximize expression of the N-protein in soluble form. The N-protein expressed in soluble form was purified from bacterial lysate through a Mono-Q anion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography column. The column was pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl, and proteins were eluted with a gradient of NaCl from 200 to 700 mm in a total volume of 25 ml of buffer A. The flow rate and fraction size were 0.25 ml/min and 1 ml, respectively. Fractions were analyzed on 10% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 30:0.8), followed by Coomassie Blue staining to test the homogeneity of the purified protein. The purified N-protein was stored in buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol at −20 °C Proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting was performed with mouse polyclonal anti-CHPV antibody as the primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. This was followed by color reaction with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. A 49-nucleotide leader RNA gene of CHVP was cloned under the control of the SP6 promoter in the pGEM-4Z vector. DNA template was linearized with the HindIII restriction enzyme. Radiolabeled positive sense leader RNA was synthesized in vitro in a 40-ml reaction with [α-32P]UTP and SP6 RNA polymerase essentially as described by the manufacturer. DNA template was removed by RQ1 DNase treatment, and the leader RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated twice with ethanol. The product was analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gel (29:1) containing 8 murea in 1× TAE (40 mm Tris-acetate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). To study the encapsidation reaction, 32P-labeled leader RNA (200 ng) was incubated with increasing amounts of N-protein (0.3–4.5 µm). The binding reaction was carried out in a total volume of 15 ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl containing 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol at 37 °C for 30 min. In the presence and absence of UV cross-linking (Appligene UV crosslinker), the RNA-protein complex was treated with RNase A at a final concentration of 60 mg/ml for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10× loading dye containing 30% Ficoll, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol. The reaction mixture was run on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 5% glycerol at 4 °C in TAE (40 mm Tris-acetate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) (acrylamide/bisacrylamide of 30:0.8). The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. The P-protein of CHPV was expressed in bacteria, and only the soluble fraction was purified as described earlier (11Raha T. Chattopadhyay D. Chattopadhyay D. Roy S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2110-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To determine the number of reactive sulfhydryl groups by DTNB titration, 10 µm CHPV N-protein was incubated with 0.5 mm DTNB in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) at 25 °C. The reaction was monitored at 412 nm in a Hitachi UV-2000 spectrophotometer after an appropriate base-line correction. A molar extinction coefficient of 1.36 × 104m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate the number of reactive sulfhydryl groups. The purified CHPV N-protein (10 µm) was reacted with 5 mmI-EDANS at 37 °C for 2 h. After incubation, the protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 150 mm NaCl to remove the unreacted I-EDANS. The absorbance at 337 nm was measured to check the incorporation of I-EDANS into the protein with the buffer from the previous dialysis being used for the base line. Circular dichroism spectra were measured in a Jasco J-700 spectropolarimeter. Measurements were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 150 mm NaCl at ambient temperature. An average of four scans was taken. A time constant of 2 s and a scan speed of 50 nm/min were used for spectral scanning. The protein concentration was 10 µm. Proper base-line corrections were made. Anisotropy experiments were performed using a Hitachi polarization accessory. The fluorescence intensity componentsI vv, I vh,I hv, and I hh (where the subscripts refer to the horizontal (h) and vertical (v) positioning of the excitation and emission polarizers, respectively) were used to calculate the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (A) according to the following equation: A = (I vv −GI vh)/(I vv + 2GI vh), where G is the grating factor that corrects for the wavelength-dependent distortions of the polarizing system. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded in a Hitachi F-3010 spectrofluorometer with spectrum addition and subtraction facility. The fluorescence experiments were carried out at 37 °C, and the temperature was maintained by a circulating water bath attached to the spectrofluorometer. The excitation and emission band passes were maintained at 5 nm, and all readings were taken in a cuvette with a 1-cm path length. Light scattering experiments were done to check the state of aggregation of the soluble CHPV N-protein and to monitor the roles of osmolytes and the CHPV P-protein in this aggregation process. The CHPV N-protein at a high concentration was first treated with Bio-Beads SM-2 adsorbent to remove Triton X-100, filtered three times through a Millipore filter, and added to a Millipore filtered buffer under suitable dust-free conditions to a final protein concentration of 50 µm. All additions were made in the cuvette, and light scattering was measured with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 340 nm. To determine the effect of osmolytes, the same experiment was carried out, but a 250 mm concentration of the osmolyte d-sorbitol was added during detergent removal from a high concentration of CHPV N-protein. To determine the effect of the CHPV P-protein on aggregation, the concentrated stock of detergent-removed CHPV N-protein was denatured with 8 m urea. The denatured protein was diluted in a native buffer in the fluorometer cuvette, and scattering intensities were monitored in the presence of varying concentrations of CHPV P-protein and osmolytes. Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed using an Otsuka Electronics DLS700 instrument. For DLS experiments, the concentration of CHPV N-protein was kept at 1 mg/ml, and the concentration of d-sorbitol was kept at 250 mm. In this experiment, the sample was illuminated with a 638.8 helium-neon solid-state laser, and the intensity of light scattered at an angle of 90° was measured. An auto-correlation function was used to determine the translational diffusion coefficient (D T) of the sample particles in the solution by measuring the fluctuations in the intensity of the scattered light. The hydrodynamic radius (R H) of the sample particles was derived from D T using Stokes-Einstein's equation: D T =k B T/6πηR H, where k B is the Boltzmann constant, Tis the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin, and η is the solvent viscosity. To understand the conformation of the N-protein and its role in the aggregation process, we felt the need to isolate the soluble N-protein, but not a refolded, which may differ in conformation. We observed that when overproduced in bacteria by inducing cells with 500 µm IPTG at 37 °C for 4 h, the N-protein composed more than 50% of the total cellular proteins. However, the majority of the overexpressed protein formed inclusion bodies, posing a problem for its purification (data not shown). We observed that BL21(DE3) cells induced at A 600 = 0.3 with 100 µmIPTG for 14 h at 16 °C produced the majority of the N-protein in a soluble form. To maximize the amount of N-protein in a soluble form during purification, we introduced 200 mm NaCl in buffer A and washed the inclusion pellet several times with the same buffer. We found that the above protocol successfully produces >80% of the overexpressed protein in soluble form (Fig.2, A and B,lane 5). Western blotting was performed to further verify the above results (Fig. 2 B). The major biological role of the nucleocapsid protein is to bind with the viral genome and to encapsidate it in an RNase-resistant form. We tested the affinity of the recombinant protein for viral leader RNA sequence corresponding to the 5′-end of the viral anti-genome by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In vitro transcribed leader RNA was incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant N-protein, and the complex was resolved on 6% native polyacrylamide (see “Experimental Procedures”). We observed the appearance of a shifted band upon the addition of protein, and the intensity of the shifted band increased sharply with increasing protein concentrations, indicating a high affinity of the recombinant protein for leader RNA (Fig. 3 A, firstthrough ninth lanes). We next examined the ability of the recombinant protein to protect viral RNA from RNase action in vitro. To demonstrate that we have treated the complex formed between leader RNA and the N-protein with RNase in another set, the complex was UV-cross-linked and treated with RNase (Fig.3 A, tenth and eleventh lanes). The intensity of the shifted band remained the same as that of the RNase-untreated complex (Fig. 3 A, ninth lane), indicating a true encapsidation of viral leader RNA by the N-protein. CD spectra have been widely used as to monitor secondary structure. Fig.4 shows the far-UV CD spectrum of the solubilized N-protein after removal of Triton X-100. An attempt was made to extract relative amounts of secondary structure present in the protein from the CD spectra. Although the quality of fit was not excellent, it indicated a large amount of random-coil form present. From the work of Baskakov and Bolen (9Baskakov I. Bolen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 273: 4831-4834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (318) Google Scholar), it is clear that physiological concentrations of osmolytes can drive the folding equilibrium toward the native state. If the random-coil conformations present in the soluble N-protein reflect partial denaturation, a significant secondary structure alteration of the N-protein is anticipated upon addition of an osmolyte. So, far-UV CD spectra were measured in the presence of an osmolyte (d-sorbitol), and secondary structure formation was monitored. The addition of d-sorbitol led to some enhancement of the CD spectrum and hence secondary structure contents. We also attempted to measure the effect of osmolytes on N-protein structure by the use of steady-state fluorescence anisotropy. Fluorescence anisotropy is a function of probe motion. In the absence of internal probe motions, fluorescence anisotropy is a function of rotational tumbling of the whole molecule. Rapid internal motions, typical of partially or fully disordered states, reduce the anisotropy values. An increase in order generally should increase the fluorescence anisotropy value of a probe covalently attached to the protein. Sulfhydryl groups are selective attachment points for fluorescent probes. The DTNB reaction was used for determining the number of titrable sulfhydryl groups. 2.99 ± 0.1 groups reacted with DTNB, indicating that these sulfhydryl groups are available for attachment of covalent probes. 2.93 ± 0.19 I-EDANS molecules were incorporated into the protein using the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” This I-EDANS-labeled N-protein showed full biological activity with respect to RNA-binding ability as shown in Fig. 3 B. Table I reports the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy values of the I-EDANS-labeled soluble recombinant N-protein in the presence and absence of the osmolyted-sorbitol. The anisotropy value in the absence ofd-sorbitol is very low compared with the expected value for a typical globular protein of 48 kDa. For example, when attached to the λ-repressor dimer (molecular mass of 52 kDa), a dansyl chloride probe gave an anisotropy value of ∼0.1 and a rotational correlation time of ∼20 ns under similar conditions (12Banik U. Mandal N.C. Bhattacharya B. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3938-3943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We measured the lifetimes of the attached I-EDANS probe in the presence and absence ofd-sorbitol. The lifetimes were 15.1 and 15.3 ns in the absence and presence of d-sorbitol, respectively. If one calculates the rotational correlation time from the Perrin equation assuming a limiting anisotropy value of 0.4, the values are 0.8 and 2.2 ns without and with d-sorbitol, respectively. These rotational correlation times clearly indicate that there are very significant internal motions indicative of disorder. The addition ofd-sorbitol led to a significant increase in the fluorescence anisotropy and rotational correlation time, indicating that the addition of osmolytes leads to a decrease in internal motions. This is consistent with the modest enhancement of the CD spectrum in the presence of osmolytes.Table ISteady-state fluorescence anisotropy of the I-EDANS-labeled N protein in the presence and absence of osmolytesd-Sorbitol concFluorescence anisotropy values00.02250 mm0.05A concentrated stock of the soluble recombinant N-protein was labeled with I-EDANS and diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 100 mm NaCl in the fluorometer cuvette to a final concentration of 0.5 µm.

Open table in a new tab A concentrated stock of the soluble recombinant N-protein was labeled with I-EDANS and diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 100 mm NaCl in the fluorometer cuvette to a final concentration of 0.5 µm. The fluorescence anisotropy of this protein sample was measured in the presence and absence of 250 mmd-sorbitol. The spectroscopic studies reported above indicate that the soluble N-protein is partially denatured and disordered. It is generally believed that such partially denatured and disordered proteins are often prone to aggregation. To investigate the self-aggregating tendency of the soluble recombinant N-protein, dynamic light scattering measurements were performed. For this experiment, Triton X-100 was removed, and aggregation was monitored using dynamic light scattering. DLS studies showed that the CHPV N-protein formed large aggregates and that the change in aggregate size occurred with time. While monitoring the aggregation process of the N-protein, it was seen that 15 min after the removal of Triton X-100, the protein started to form aggregates (seen from the increasing value of the Stokes radius). Fig.5 A shows the DLS results after ∼60 min, when the protein formed particles with an average Stokes radius of 8.8 nm (a monomer of the size of the N-protein should have a Stokes radius of ∼2–3 nm). After 18 h, it reached the saturation of the aggregation process and formed particles with an average Stokes radius of 16.05 nm (Fig. 5 B). The standard error of these measurements was ∼5% based on three independent measurements. Clearly, the soluble N-protein has a tendency to aggregate, which is reduced in the presence of nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100. Fluorescence anisotropy indicated that the osmolyted-sorbitol increased the local order in the N-protein. The reduction of disorder, even a local one, may have an influence on the solubility and aggregation of proteins. So we investigated the roles of osmolytes present in the cells in solubilization of the N-protein; and for this purpose, static light scattering experiments were performed. The static light scattering technique is widely used to study protein aggregation and disaggregation (13Bandyopadhyay S. Mukhopadhyay C. Roy S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5033-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Aggregation of proteins gives rise to high light scattering values, which reduce upon disaggregation. In this experiment, first Triton X-100 was removed from a very high concentration of soluble recombinant N-protein using Bio-Beads SM-2 adsorbent. The protein was then diluted to a final concentration of 50 µm in a fluorometer cuvette, and scattering values were monitored as a function of time. This same experiment was repeated, butd-sorbitol (250 mm) was included in the buffer during detergent removal and light scattering measurements. TableII reports the light scattering intensities after 30 min of 50 µm N-protein in the presence and absence of osmolytes. The light scattering value was reduced by severalfold in the presence of osmolytes. Clearly, the presence of 250 mmd-sorbitol inhibited aggregation, suggesting that even an increase in the local order leads to inhibition of self-aggregation of the N-protein.Table IIAggregation of Triton X-100-C removed soluble recombinant N-protein in the presence and absence of osmolytes using static light scatteringConditionsScattering intensities50 µm CHPV N-protein876.9750 µm CHPV N-protein + 250 mmd-sorbitol259.3A concentrated stock of the soluble recombinant N-protein was taken and from it was removed Triton X-100 using Bio-Beads SM-2 adsorbent.

https://openalex.org/W1992924089,"Defensins comprise a family of cationic antimicrobial peptides that is characterized by the conserved 6 cysteine residues. They are expressed in the epithelial cells of various organs and are identified as key elements in the host defense system at the mucosal surface. We isolated a novel mouse β-defensin gene from the bacterial artificial chromosome DNA containing the mouse β-defensin-3 gene. The full-length cDNA was cloned from skeletal muscle cDNA and called mouse β-defensin-6 (mBD-6). The predicted peptide conserved the 6-cysteine motif and had 59% amino acid sequence identity with mouse β-defensin-3 and 59% identity with mouse β-defensin-4. We demonstrated the expression of mBD-6 in skeletal muscle in addition to the esophagus, tongue, and trachea. In animal models of endotoxemia, mBD-6 expression was also induced in the lung. mBD-6 showed potent antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and would play an important role in host defense in the esophagus, airways, and skeletal muscle. mBD-6 is the first reported β-defensin predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. This unique tissue specificity suggests some novel physiological roles of this peptide family."

Several lines of evidence suggest that the Dyrk homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yak1, functions as a negative regulator of the cell cycle (5Garrett S. Broach J.

Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). More recently, at least seven mammalian Dyrk proteins have been described that vary in their tissue expression patterns and subcellular localization, suggesting that members of the Dyrk family have a variety of cellular roles (12Becker W.

We have isolated a member of the Dyrk family from the amoebaDictyostelium discoideum in a genetic screen for mutants that phenotypically resemble cells that lack functional heterotrimeric guanosine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins). G-proteins consist of an α-subunit and a βγ-dimer, which dissociate upon ligand activation of heptahelical membrane receptors. Eleven Gα subunits, one Gβ subunit, and one Gγ subunit have been isolated from D. discoideum (13van Es S. Devreotes P.N. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Wu L. Valkema R. Van. Haastert P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). 2N. Zhang et al., unpublished results. Signaling through G-proteins is essential for chemotaxis toward the chemoattractant cAMP, and absence of functional G-proteins prevents aggregation into multicellular structures. Folic acid and cAMP receptors interact with G-proteins comprised of different Gα subunits. The pathways appear to converge at the level of the G-protein βγ subunits, since gβ-null mutants are unresponsive to both folic acid and cAMP (14Wu L. Valkema R. Van. Haastert P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 15Kumagai A. Hadwiger J.A. Pupillo M. Firtel R.A. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 10566-10570Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Gβ mutants also display reduced growth rates on bacterial substrates due to a failure to carry out chemotaxis toward bacterial secretion products such as folic acid as well as a reduced rate of phagocytosis (14Wu L. Valkema R. Van. Haastert P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Peracino B. Borleis J. Jin T. Westphal M. Schwartz J.M. Wu L. Bracco E. Gerisch G. Devreotes P. Bozzaro S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). How are the signals transmitted to the different effector molecules downstream of the G-protein? Both Gα and Gβγ subunits are able to transduce signals from receptors to downstream effectors. Although evidence suggests that in Dictyostelium most of the signaling is mediated by Gβγ subunits (18Lilly P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) they may not directly interact with effector enzymes. In the case of adenylyl cyclase activation, an intermediate step involves the transient membrane localization of the PH-domain containing cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase (Crac) (19Insall R. Kuspa A. Lilly P.J. Shaulsky G. Levin L.R. Loomis W.F. Devreotes P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similar intermediates may transduce signals from the G-protein to other effector enzymes or proteins involved in actin polymerization and guanylyl cyclase. To isolate novel genes that mediate chemotactic responses downstream of Gβγ, we mutagenized amoebae using restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) and isolated mutants with phenotypes similar to that of gβ-null cells. Large numbers of individual cells were plated clonally on bacterial lawns and analyzed for developmental phenotypes as well as plaque size, both of which are impaired ingβ-null cells. Mutants that formed small aggregation-minus plaques on bacterial lawns were selected and further screened for defects in chemoattractant-induced actin polymerization. One of these mutants has an insertion in the YakA gene, a member of the Dyrk family. The mutant forms small plaques on bacteria and cells do not enter development. In addition to a failure to aggregate, the mutant expresses only low levels of aggregation-specific genes, such as cAMP receptor (cAR1), adenylyl cyclase (ACA), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that YakA regulates the transition from growth to development. In addition, Souza et al. (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar) previously isolated YakA in a different REMI screen, proposing that it plays a role in cell cycle control because overexpression of YakA causes cells to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Our goal was to investigate the role of YakA during development and in particular in G-protein linked signaling pathways. The strong phenotypic resemblance between yakA-null andgβ-null mutants suggests that YakA and Gβγ operate in similar pathways. We created a temperature-sensitive YakAmutant and showed that YakA is not only required at the onset of development but also during aggregation and postaggregative development. To address its role in G-protein-mediated signaling, we focused on the role of YakA in folic acid signal transduction, which does not require development. Our results show that YakA is a cytosolic protein that functions downstream of the G-protein to activate a number of signal transduction responses including actin polymerization and cGMP accumulation. cAMP and G418 were from Sigma. Blasticidin S was from CalBiochem. Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was from Babco Covance (Berkeley). D. discoideum strains were grown in axenic medium (21Ashworth J.M. Watts D.J. Biochem.

Cells were developed on Development Buffer-agar plates (10 mmNaKPO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1.5% agar) at 1.5 × 106 cells/cm2. Mutant clones were selected by plating 50–100 cells with 200 µl of an overnight culture ofKlebsiella aerogenes on SM-agar plates (22Sussman M. Molecular Biology in Dictyostelium: Tools and Applications. Methods in Cell Biology. 28. Academic Press Inc, 1987: 67-100Google Scholar). After 5 days at 22 °C, plaques were analyzed for mutant phenotypes and photographed. REMI mutagenesis was performed according to Adachi et al. (23Adachi H. Hasebe T. Yoshinaga K. Ohta T. Sutoh K.

Loomis), linearized with BamHI. 5 units of DpnII/ml were added during electroporation. The plasmid, along with the 4-kb flanking genomic sequence, was rescued from the yakA mutant as an 8-kbBglII fragment, which was then ligated and transformed toEscherichia coli (XL1Blue). Colonies carrying the rescued plasmid were selected on ampicillin plates. The genomic sequences flanking the pBSR3 construct were ∼2 kb on each side. For each assay cells were grown on SM plates in association with K. aerogenes(22Sussman M. Molecular Biology in Dictyostelium: Tools and Applications. Methods in Cell Biology. 28.

Cells were washed once in DB and 5 × 106 cells (cGMP response) or 2 × 106 cells (F-actin) were stimulated with 100 µm folic acid or 10% HL5 medium from an overnight 22 °C culture of K. aerogenes. cGMP levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay, [3H]GMP detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). F-actin measurements were performed as described (17Peracino B. Borleis J. Jin T. Westphal M. Schwartz J.M. Wu L. Bracco E. Gerisch G. Devreotes P. Bozzaro S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The P375S mutation that created the tsYakA construct was made using a Morph site-directed mutagenesis kit (5′-3′) using a primer with the desired point mutation (TTATAGATCATCTGAAAATAT) using the Act6-YakAexpression construct (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. Cells were developed for 5 h in DB with 100 µm additions of 10−7m cAMP pulses delivered every 6 min. Then cells were treated with 2.5 mm caffeine for 20 min, washed twice in cold DB and resuspended to 108 cells/ml in 40 mm Hepes, 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mmEDTA, pH 7.7. Cells were lysed through 5 µm filters (Nucleopore) and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in PB at a density of 108 cell equivalents/ml. Binding of 2 nm [3H]cAMP in the presence or absence of 100 µm GTPγS was measured as described (23Adachi H. Hasebe T. Yoshinaga K. Ohta T. Sutoh K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1808-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy on live cells was performed on a Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 135 TV as described in Ref. 24Parent C.A.

To isolate novel mutants with defects in chemotaxis we used REMI to generate 25,000 transformants with random insertions in the genome. We clonally seeded ∼100,000 cells on bacterial lawns and selected mutants that grew slowly under these conditions. We choose 65 “small plaque” mutants and tested each for defects in cAMP-induced actin polymerization. Five mutants were defective in this response and also failed to aggregate when plated on non-nutrient agar. We cloned a portion of the affected gene from one of these mutants and identified the sequence that flanked the insertion as the previously identifiedYakA gene (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar). The insertion was in the protein kinase domain at amino acid 257. We further examined whether the newly identified small plaque phenotype, which was not reported previously, was caused by the YakA mutation. We re-created the phenotype through homologous recombination by transforming the linearized rescued plasmid, which contained the YakA flanking sequences, in wild-type cells. Fig. 1 shows that the fresh disruptant displayed the small plaque phenotype and the previously reported aggregation defect on bacterial lawns (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar). The plaques of yakA − cells were slightly larger than those of gβ− cells. Expression ofYakA from the Act-6 promoter in theyakA − mutant restored the wild-type phenotype (data not shown), indicating that the phenotype was indeed caused by disruption of the YakA gene. In addition, mutants lacking the Gα subunit, Gα4, displayed plaque sizes that were similar toyakA − plaques, suggesting that mutants lacking responsiveness to folic acid display a small plaque phenotype. The phenotypic similarity between the yakA − andgβ− cells suggested that YakA has a role in G-protein-mediated signaling pathways. Since chemoattractant receptor signaling is required for development, such a defect would block development. Indeed, yakA − cells do not enter development when starved on non-nutrient agar and fail to express early developmental genes (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that, like Gβ,YakA plays a role throughout development, not only during the transition from growth to development as was proposed earlier (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar).yakA − cells express wild-type amounts of Gβ protein, so the yakA − phenotype cannot be explained by failure to express Gβ (data not shown). In order to study the role of YakA during development, we made point mutations in the protein kinase domain that were previously shown to confer temperature sensitivity to homologous map kinase kinases (25Ma H. Gamper M. Parent C. Firtel R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4317-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,26Hsu J.C. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2176-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One of these mutations, P375S, caused a temperature-sensitive phenotype when the gene was expressed in yakA −cells. Cells expressing this tsYakA gene failed to develop at restrictive temperature but formed normal fruiting bodies at permissive temperature (Fig.2 A). Expression oftsYakA does not cause growth inhibition at the permissive temperature, as is the case for overexpression of wtYakA(data not shown). To study the role of YakA during development,tsYakA/yakA − cells were allowed to enter development at the permissive temperature for different periods of time and then shifted to the non-permissive temperature. When shifted to restrictive temperature at 4 h of development, the cells formed loose mounds but did not develop further, and eventually dispersed (Fig. 2 B). When shifted at 7 h, cells formed tight mounds, then arrested, and the structures disintegrated (Fig.2 C). These results indicate that YakA protein kinase activity is required not only at the onset but also during development. Both folic acid and cAMP trigger similar chemotactic responses, but the responsiveness to each of these chemoattractants depends on the developmental stage. Vegetative cells respond with chemotaxis to folic acid but lose their responsiveness during the first few hours of development. As cells lose sensitivity to folic acid they acquire sensitivity to cAMP. TheyakA − cells do not enter development and do not express cAMP receptors (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar). In order to separate the effects of theYakA deletion on signal transduction from those on development, we measured responses to folic acid in growingyakA −cells. 3We have used the tsyakA mutant to analyze cAMP-mediated signal transduction responses at permissive and restrictive temperatures. However, we were unable to draw conclusions from these experiments, because at the restrictive temperature the results varied greatly in wild-type and mutant strains. In wild-type cells, folic acid stimulation triggers rapid accumulation of intracellular cGMP and transient polymerization of F-actin. These responses were essentially absent in several independent yakA −strains (Fig. 3). We also tested bacterial-conditioned medium for its ability to trigger signal transduction responses in yakA − cells. This medium triggers robust F-actin and cGMP responses in growth stage wild-type cells and likely contains other chemoattractants besides folic acid. As shown in Fig. 3 B, bacterial-conditioned medium triggers only weak cGMP responses inyakA −, suggesting that the mutant has a general defect in transducing chemoattractant signals. Mutants lacking the Gα subunit Gα4 have been shown to be specifically defective in mediating the chemotactic response to folic acid (16Hadwiger J.A. Lee S. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10566-10570Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We found that these mutants displayed reduced growth rates on bacteria, resulting in plaque sizes similar to those of yakA − (Fig. 1). This suggests that the inability to respond to folic acid or other bacterial secretion products results in slow plaque expansion rates on bacteria. YakA might act downstream of G-proteins or regulate the coupling of G-proteins to receptors. In wild-type cells, in vitro activation of G-proteins with GTPγS results in a >70% loss of agonist binding, reflecting the shift of the receptor to a low affinity state (27van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since yakA − cells express low levels of cAMP receptors we transformed bothyakA − and wild-type cells with an Act15-cAR1 construct and measured GTPγS inhibition of [3H]cAMP binding in growth stage cells. Fig. 4shows that the percentage inhibition of cAMP binding by GTPγS is the same for both wild-type and yakA − cells, indicating that YakA does not affect the coupling of receptors to G-proteins. Expression of cAR1 did not restore development in yakA − cells (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that, when overexpressed, YakA causes a growth arrest (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine whether YakA is downstream of Gβ, we overexpressed the gene under an inducible (Act-6) promoter in gβ− cells. YakAoverexpression caused a growth arrest in gβ−cells as was shown previously for wild-type cells. This observation suggests that YakA operates downstream of Gβγ (Fig. 4). In order to determine the subcellular localization of YakA, we fused GFP to the C terminus of YakA, which was truncated by deleting the 190 C-terminal amino acids. Using fluorescence microscopy we showed that the GFP signal was entirely cytoplasmic and excluded from the nucleus (Fig.5 A). Expression of this construct restored development ofyakA − cells, showing that, despite the truncation and GFP fusion, the protein was functional (Fig.5 B) This localization was independent of the developmental stage (data not shown). No relocalization of Yak-GFP was observed when appropriately differentiated cells were stimulated with cAMP even after longer periods of stimulation (data not shown). The strictly cytosolic localization of YakA and its absence from the nucleus favors a role of this kinase as a downstream regulator of G-proteins in a cytoplasmic signaling pathway. Heterotrimeric G-proteins mediate a number of chemotactic responses in phagocytic cells such as amoebae and neutrophils. InDictyostelium, chemotaxis is mediated by both cAMP and folic acid, which trigger a similar set of biochemical responses including polymerization of actin and the accumulation of cGMP. Interestingly, biochemical responses to folic acid and cAMP are transduced by separate Gα subunits, which share the unique Gβ subunit. This suggests that similar pathways mediated by different chemoattractants converge at the level of Gβγ. We have identified YakA in a screen for mutants that phenocopy the gβ-null cells. BothyakA − and gβ− cells form small plaques on bacterial lawns and fail to enter development. Besides their identical morphology, gβ-null andyakA-null cells show striking biochemical similarities: both mutants fail to express early developmental genes and show strongly reduced biochemical responses to folic acid or bacterial secretion products. cAMP signaling is required for chemotaxis and postaggregative development, and YakA may regulate these responses. If YakA regulates G-protein-mediated signaling it is expected to have a role during development. Previous studies using a temperature-sensitive Gβ mutant indicate that functional G-proteins are essential during development (28Jin T. Soede R.D. Liu J. Kimmel A.R. Devreotes P.N. Schaap P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5076-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our experiments using the temperature sensitive YakA mutant show that YakA activity is not only required at the onset of development, as was proposed previously by Souza et al. (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar), but also during the aggregation process and postaggregative development. Further support for a role of YakA during development is the so-called rapid-development phenotype that cells acquire when YakA is overexpressed (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar). The small plaque phenotype and absence of development ofgβ-null and also yakA-null mutants can be explained by failure to signal through the G-protein subunits α4 and α2, respectively. Mutants that lack one of the Gα subunits, Gα4, are specifically defective in folic acid-mediated signaling and chemotaxis. Interestingly, these mutants do enter development, but likeyakA and gβ mutants, form small plaques on bacterial lawns. Unlike gβ mutants (17Peracino B. Borleis J. Jin T. Westphal M. Schwartz J.M. Wu L. Bracco E. Gerisch G. Devreotes P. Bozzaro S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), yakAand gα4 mutants display wild-type phagocytosis rates (data not shown), suggesting that a failure to respond with chemotaxis to bacterial secretion products leads to reduced growth rates on bacteria. The developmental defect in gβ-null andyakA-null mutants can be explained by the failure to transduce external cAMP signals through Gα2. This α-subunit couples to the cAMP receptor and transduces chemotactic signals during chemotaxis and is therefore essential for the early developmental processes. In the gβ mutant, none of the 11 known Gα subunits can form heterotrimers, but the absence of Gα4 and Gα2 is sufficient to explain the gβ-null phenotype. Mutants, likeyakA − that both form small plaques and fail to enter development are therefore good candidates for having general defects in G-protein signaling. It has been suggested that YakA can regulate the activity or expression level of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA is only expressed at low levels in a yakA-null mutant and expression of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-CAT) can restore development in yakA-null cells (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PKA restores development is unclear, but it has been shown that PKA is required for the expression of late developmental genes (29Williams J.G. Harwood A.J. Hopper N.A. Simon M.N. Bouzid S. Veron M. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1993; 340: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of PKA-CAT has been shown to restore development in mutants that lack G-protein signaling, such as mutants that lack cAMP receptors 4C. D. Reymond, personal communication. or adenylyl cyclase A. Regulation of PKA activity is clearly not the only function of YakA, since the G1 arrest caused by overexpression of YakA also occurs in cells lacking the PKA catalytic subunit (20Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar). The homology between Dyrk, minibrain, and Yak proteins is restricted to the protein kinase and Dyrk homology domains, making it difficult to assign functional mammalian homologs of YakA. YakA localizes to the cytoplasm, suggesting that it is most homologous to the putative cytosolic members of the mammalian Dyrk family. Candidates are the Dyrk2 and Dyrk3 isoforms, which lack the putative nuclear localization signals that are present in Drosophila minibrain and Dyrk1 sequences. GFP fusion proteins of the N-terminal region of Dyrk2 remain cytoplasmic, whereas the N-terminal sequences of Dyrk1A targets to the nucleus (12Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Dyrk1A andDrosophila minibrain have a role in brain development, but little is known about the role of Dyrk2 and Dyrk3. Dyrk2 and Dyrk3 are expressed in a variety of tissues, including brain, but their mRNAs are most abundant in testes (4Becker W. Joost H.G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It remains to be investigated whether Dyrk2 and Dyrk3 have a role in G-protein-linked signaling pathways. The exact function of YakA in G-protein-linked signaling pathways is unknown. YakA may function as an effector of Gβγ to transduce the chemotactic signal to downstream effectors, for example by regulating their phosphorylation state. Tyrosine kinases have been implicated as effectors of G-proteins, such as members of the c-Src family. These tyrosine kinases have been shown to interact with mammalian Gαs and Gαi and are activated by these Gα subunits in vitro (30Ma Y. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Like c-Src, YakA may interact with Gα, but it is more likely that YakA interacts with, or is regulated by Gβγ subunits, because cAMP-induced responses are mediated by Gβγ rather than Gα subunits (18Lilly P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Gβ subunit is unique and thus far only one Gγ has been identified, so there may be less structural diversity between the Gβγ subunits than Gα subunits. This would make it more likely that Gβγ-mediated responses are transmitted through a single effector pathway, which may involve YakA. We are currently investigating the binding partners of YakA to address these important questions. We thank Dr. A. Kuspa for the Act6-YakA expression plasmid, Dr. W. F. Loomis for the pBSR3 plasmid and Dr. R. A. Firtel for the Gα4-null strain."
https://openalex.org/W2005178153,"This paper describes the functional characterization of the xyloside transporter, XylP, ofLactobacillus pentosus with the aid of a spectroscopy-based assay system. In order to monitor the transport reaction, the natural xyloside isoprimeverose, a building block of hemicellulose, and the analogue methyl-isoprimeverose were chemically synthesized by a new and efficient procedure. The XylP protein was purified by metal affinity chromatography, following high level expression in Lactococcus lactis from the nisin-inducible promoter. The purified XylP protein was incorporated into liposomes, in which the glucose dehydrogenase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (sGDH) was entrapped. sGDH can oxidize aldose sugars in the presence of dichlorophenol-indophenol as electron acceptor. The coupled assay thus involves XylP-mediated isoprimeverose uptake followed by internal oxidation of the sugar by sGDH, which can be monitored from the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol at 600 nm. The uptake of isoprimeverose was stimulated by the presence of the non-oxidizable methyl-isoprimeverose on the trans-side of the membrane, indicating that exchange transport is faster than unidirectional downhill uptake. Unlike other members of the galactoside-pentoside-hexuronide family, XylP does not transport monosaccharides (xylose) but requires a glycosidic linkage at the anomeric carbon position. Consistent with a proton motive force-driven mechanism, the uptake was stimulated by a membrane potential (inside negative relative to outside) and inhibited by a pH gradient (inside acidic relative to outside). The advantages of the here-described transport assay for studies of carbohydrate transport are discussed.

The gene encoding the XylP protein is clustered with those of a xylose isomerase (xylA), a xylulose kinase (xylB), a regulator protein (xylR), and a xylosidase (xylQ) (2Chaillou S. Lokman B.C.

Microbiol. 1991; 57: 2764-2766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the xylP gene forms part of the xyl operon and is induced in the presence of xylose, the XylP protein was initially thought to be involved in the transport of xylose (4Lokman B.C. Heerikhuisen M. Leer R.J. van den B.A. Borsboom Y. Chaillou S. Postma P.W. Pouwels P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5391-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The discovery that another gene (xylQ) of the xyloperon encoded an intracellular xylosidase provided first evidence that XylP is a xyloside transporter (6Chaillou S. Postma P.W. Pouwels P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4011-4014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many microorganisms, homologues of the xylP and xylQ genes are clustered together and the corresponding proteins are likely to have a role in the uptake and metabolism of xylosides. Xylosides form the building blocks of different hemicelluloses, which are sugar polymers in the cell walls of plants, e.g. xylobiose in xylans and isoprimeverose in xyloglucans. Although abundant in nature, the fate of these disaccharides in bacterial metabolism is poorly documented. Isoprimeverose is a disaccharide of xylose α-1,6 linked to glucose (Fig. 1). It is not readily isolated from cell wall material since the enzymatic degradation of xyloglucan is inefficient due to its low solubility in water, and the separation of the different degradation products is difficult. Helferich and Rauch first reported the synthesis of primeverose in 1927 (7Helferich B. Rauch H. Ann. Chem. (Justus Liebigs). 1927; 455: 168-172Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Later, Zemplén and Bognár reported a modified procedure for the preparation of primeverose and isoprimeverose (8Zemplén G. Bognár R. Berichte Dentschen Chem. Gesellschaft. 1939; 72: 1160-1167Crossref Google Scholar). In this paper a new and more efficient procedure for the synthesis of large amounts of isoprimeverose and methyl-isoprimeverose (Fig. 1) is described. Despite the successful synthesis of isoprimeverose, this non-radioactive substrate could not be used in the conventional transport assays. This inspired us to invent a spectroscopic assay for the analysis of carbohydrate transport reactions without the need of radiolabeled substrates (9Heuberger E.H.M.L. Poolman B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The method makes use of a membrane system bearing the sugar transporter of interest and containing a PQQ-dependent carbohydrate dehydrogenase (sGDH) internally. sGDH, originating from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, has a high affinity for glucose but the enzyme also oxidizes a wide variety of mono- and disaccharides, including isoprimeverose and xylobiose, in the presence of the artificial electron acceptor dichlorophenol-indophenol (Cl2Ind) (10Duine J.A.

Cl2Ind has a high extinction coefficient with absorption maximum at 600 nm, which enables one to follow its reduction spectrophotometrically with high sensitivity even in the presence of membranes. The method had to be modified in order to decrease the sGDH background activity. In this study, we report on the amplified expression and purification of XylP, the membrane reconstitution of the transporter, and the functional analysis of XylP-mediated translocation by a spectroscopy-based transport assay.

The final concentration of nisin was about 4 ng/ml. After 1 h of induction, cells were harvested and inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared. For the cloning of the xylPgene into the nisin inducible expression system of L. lactis, the plasmid pLPA1 (6Chaillou S. Postma P.W. Pouwels P.H. J.

These restriction sites were used to replace the oppA gene in the plasmid pNZ8048oppah (15Picon A. Kunji E.R. Lanfermeijer F.C. Konings W.N. Poolman B. J.

Herewith, thexylP gene was placed in frame with a sequence (already present in the pNZ8048oppah plasmid) that specifies a 6-histidine tag at the C terminus of the XylP protein. The resulting plasmid, pNZ8048xylP, was transformed into L. lactis NZ9000. For the isolation of inside-out membrane vesicles of L. lactis, cells (0.5 g/ml protein) were lysed by passage through a LAB 2000 homogenizer (Kindler Maschinen AG, Zürich, Switzerland) (15,000 p.s.i.), following (partial) digestion of the cell wall with 10 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 30 °C (16Poolman B. Konings W.N. Robillard G.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The membrane preparations were stored in liquid nitrogen. The protein concentration of the membranes was determined with the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay according to their instructions (Bio-Rad). The relative concentrations of XylP protein were determined by immunodetection with antibodies raised against the 6-histidine tag (Dianova GmbH). The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry electrophoretic blotting. Detection, using Western-Light™ chemiluminescence detection kit with CSPD™ as a substrate, was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Tropic Inc.) The solubilization and purification of the XylP protein was performed as described (17Knol J. Veenhoff L.M. Liang W.J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with the following modifications; membranes were solubilized in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) supplemented with 1%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) (w/v). The column was washed successively with 20 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.05% DDM and 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 25 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 0.05% DDM. XylP was eluted from the column in buffer B (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 200 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) plus 0.05% DDM. For determination of the stability of XylP in detergent solution, the protein was dialyzed overnight against buffers of different composition. When the effect of detergent on protein stability was tested, DDM was replaced on the column after the second wash step by equilibrating the nitrilotriacetic acid resin with 10 column volumes buffer A and eluting XylP in buffer B, both containing the appropriate detergent. To determine the degree of aggregation of XylP in detergent-solution, protein spectra were taken with a Carry 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) from 240 to 340 nm. The concentration of purified XylP was determined by measurement of the absorption at 280 nm (ε280 = 100,800m−1 cm−1). For membrane reconstitution of XylP by detergent dilution, DDM was replaced by n-octyl-β-d-glucoside (OG) by washing the column with 10 column volumes of buffer C (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8, 10 mmimidazole, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 1.25% OG (w/v)). The protein was eluted from the column in buffer C at pH 7.0, containing 200 mm imidazole. After purification, 2 ml of purified XylP protein (0.1 mg/ml) was mixed with 400 μl of liposomes (20 mg/ml) resulting in a 1:40 protein to lipid ratio (w/w). This mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min, after which it was diluted rapidly into 80 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation (3 h, 180,000 × g, 4 °C) and stored in liquid nitrogen with or without sGDH (see below) until use. Membrane reconstitution protocols involving Triton X-100- or DDM-destabilized liposomes and detergent removal by adsorption onto polystyrene beads (Biobeads) were in essence similar to those described previously for the lactose transporter of Streptococcus thermophilus (17Knol J. Veenhoff L.M. Liang W.J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Knol J. Sjollema K. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16410-16415Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Liposomes were prepared from acetone/ether washed E. colilipids and l-α-phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk in a ratio of 3:1 (w/w), and dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, to a final phospholipid concentration of 20 mg/ml. For the preparation of freeze-fracture replicas, XylP proteoliposomes went through two cycles of freeze-thawing in order to generate large vesicle structures. The replicas were generated as described (19Friesen R.H. Knol J. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For particle density measurements, images were enlarged at a final magnification of ×250,000, and intramembrane particles from both convex and concave proteoliposomes were counted from known areas of the membrane. sGDH was prepared as described (20Olsthoorn A.J.J. Duine J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), using a 1.5-fold excess of PQQ over apo-sGDH. Briefly, sGDH and PQQ were mixed at final concentrations of 25 and 37.5 μm, respectively, in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, plus 3 mm CaCl2. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and, subsequently, used in the enzymatic assays or for enclosure in proteoliposomes. Enzyme assays were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, supplemented with 50 μm Cl2Ind (2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol) and varying concentrations of substrate. The reactions were started by the addition of 78 ng/ml sGDH (enzyme samples were diluted with 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 3 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and the enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 25 °C by following the reduction of Cl2Ind at 600 nm (20Olsthoorn A.J.J. Duine J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All measurements were performed on a Carry 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) spectrophotometer. sGDH was enclosed in XylP proteoliposomes as described (9Heuberger E.H.M.L. Poolman B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), with some modifications. The concentration of enclosed sGDH was 65 μg/ml, unless indicated otherwise. To remove external sGDH, the proteoliposomes were washed by centrifugation (15 min, 185,000 × g, 10 °C) using 3 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, in the first wash and 3 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 4 mm EDTA, in the second wash. The proteoliposomes were resuspended in 400 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, supplemented with 4 mm EDTA and incubated for 30 min at 50 °C. After 30 min of incubation, they were washed two times by centrifugation with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, plus 4 mm EDTA. Finally, the proteoliposomes were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, supplemented with 4 mm EDTA, to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml XylP, which corresponds to 80 mg/ml phospholipid. When proteoliposomes were used for counterflow-type experiments, the membranes were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, supplemented with 25 mm methyl-isoprimeverose and incubated overnight. To impose an artificial membrane potential, the enclosure of sGDH was performed in buffer D (100 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.0, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mmMgSO4) or in buffer E (50 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.0, 50 mm methylamine, pH 7.0, 20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mm MgSO4). The proteoliposomes were washed and resuspended in these buffers supplemented with 4 mm EDTA. The final protein concentration was 2 mg/ml XylP. Transport of sugars was determined from the decrease in absorption of Cl2Ind at 600 nm and at a temperature of 25 °C (ε600 = 20.6 mm−1cm−1). The reaction mixture consisted of 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, supplemented with 50 μmCl2Ind and varying concentrations of sugar, unless indicated otherwise. The reaction was started by the addition of sGDH-containing proteoliposomes. A membrane potential was generated by diluting proteoliposomes, which were prepared in buffer D or E plus 4 mm EDTA, into buffer F (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mmMgSO4) or buffer G (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 50 mm methylamine, pH 7.0, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm MgSO4), respectively. For analysis of the data, the assumption was made that the α- and β-anomer of isoprimeverose are present in solution in a 2:3 ratio. Because sGDH is β-anomer-specific and the spontaneous mutarotation is slow compared with the transport rates, oxidation rates were multiplied by 1.66 to obtain the actual transport rates. The magnitude of the membrane potential (Δψ) and ΔpH were analyzed by fluorescence measurements, using diSC3(5) and pyranine as probes, respectively. For the Δψ measurements, 2 μl of proteoliposomes (2 mg/ml XylP protein and 80 mg/ml lipids) were diluted into 800 μl of buffer D, E, F, or G containing 1.25 μmdiSC3(5). The Δψ was generated by the addition of 0.25 μm valinomycin from a 200 μm stock solution in ethanol. The membrane potential was dissipated after 3 min by the addition of 0.125 μm nigericin from a 100 μm stock solution in ethanol. The final ethanol concentration never exceeded 0.5%. The excitation and emission wavelengths used for the diSC3(5) measurements were 643 and 666 nm, respectively. The changes in ΔpH, following the generation of a Δψ, were measured using proteoliposomes that were preloaded with 0.5 mm pyranine; 4.8 μl of proteoliposomes (2 mg/ml XylP protein and 80 mg/ml lipids) were diluted into 800 μl of buffer D, E, F, or G. The excitation and emission wavelengths used for the pyranine measurements were 461 and 511 nm, respectively. All measurements were performed at a constant temperature of 25 °C. The nisin-inducible expression system of L. lactis was used for the amplification of XylP (13de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Alen-Boerrigter I. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3434-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The xylP gene was placed under control of the strong and tight nisA promoter. Immunoblots showed that XylP was not detectable in the absence of the inducer, whereas maximal amplification was obtained after 1 h of incubation with 4 ng/ml nisin (Fig. 2 A). The level of expression was ∼10% of total membrane protein. Like most other integral membrane proteins, XylP migrated at a lower molecular mass than predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence,i.e. ∼42 instead of 54 kDa (including the 6-histidine tag). As starting material for the solubilization and purification of XylP, inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from L. lactisNZ9000/pNZ8048xylP. Various detergents at different concentrations were tested for the solubilization of XylP, of which DDM turned out to be the most effective. Nearly all XylP protein was present in the solubilizate when DDM was present at a final concentration of 1% (w/v) and at a membrane vesicle concentration of 4 mg/ml (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2 and 3). The His-tagged protein was purified to near homogeneity in a single step, using nickel affinity chromatography. Most contaminants were removed by washing the column with 20 column volumes of 10 mm imidazole wash buffer, pH 8. The remaining minor impurities were removed by washing the column with 10 column volumes of 25 mm imidazole wash buffer, pH 8.0. The protein was eluted from the column by raising the imidazole concentration to 200 mm and lowering of the pH to 7.0 (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). The stability of purified XylP in detergent solution was studied spectroscopically by analyzing the protein spectrum in the 310–340-nm region,i.e. a flat line in this region indicates that higher order aggregates are not present. Of the various detergents tested,n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside proved to be superior in terms of extent of solubilization of the membrane vesicles and retention of the native structure of the purified XylP protein. The optimization of the isolation/purification procedure also included the systematic variation of pH, lipid concentration, and glycerol. Under optimal conditions, i.e. 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, and 100 mmNaCl, the protein was stable for at least 4 days at 4 °C. Although the highest stability was achieved in DDM, for reconstitution experiments n-octyl-β-d-glucoside had to be used as will be described below. It was observed that XylP was stable in this detergent for at least a few hours, which is within the period of time needed for the membrane reconstitution. The synthesis and characterization of isoprimeverose and methyl-α-d-isoprimeverose is described in the on-line supplement. sGDH oxidizes a wide variety of mono- and disaccharides, including the disaccharide isoprimeverose. sGDH has an absolute preference for the β-anomer of aldoses (21Olsthoorn A.J.J. Otsuki T. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since the disaccharide maltose is not a substrate of XylP, it was used to obtain an estimate of sGDH associated with the outer surface of the membranes. In order to be able to make the appropriate corrections for isoprimeverose oxidation not associated with XylP-mediated transport, the kinetics of oxidation of isoprimeverose and maltose was determined first (Fig. 3). The apparentKm and Vmax of sGDH for isoprimeverose and maltose were 3 ± 0.3 mm and 345 ± 20 μmol mg−1 min−1, and 0.57 ± 0.03 mm and 383 ± 4 μmol mg−1 min−1, respectively; the ± values reflect the standard error of the experiments. Importantly, when the anomeric carbon of isoprimeverose was methylated, the sugar could no longer be oxidized. Due to its high isoelectric point of 9.5, sGDH has the tendency to tightly associate with membranes containing anionic lipids. Since the turnover of sGDH is at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of XylP, even a small amount of externally located sGDH will give rise to high background activity (9Heuberger E.H.M.L. Poolman B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We succeeded in lowering the external sGDH activity by dissociating Ca2+ from sGDH in the presence of EDTA and at temperatures above 35 °C (22Geiger O. Gorisch H. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Since EDTA is membrane-impermeable, the internal Ca2+ was not complexed, and internal sGDH was reconstituted and fully active again after the temperature was lowered to 25 °C. Control experiments indicated that the membrane-embedded transporter was not affected by the heat treatment. Although XylP was most stable in DDM, the functional membrane reconstitution of XylP from DDM or Triton X-100 extracts turned out to be problematic. In our hands, this methodology, involving preformed liposomes and polystyrene beads (Biobeads) for detergent removal, is generally superior over detergent (OG) dilution- or dialysis-based reconstitution procedures (17Knol J. Veenhoff L.M. Liang W.J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Knol J. Sjollema K. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16410-16415Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Analysis of the proteoliposomes by freeze-fracture electron microscopy revealed a very low protein density and a large size distribution when DDM or Triton X-100 was used in combination with Biobeads (data not shown). The failure of this reconstitution procedure most probably lies in the tendency of XylP to form higher oligomeric structures upon slow removal of detergent. Membrane reconstitution based on n-octyl-β-d-glucoside dilution is much faster and proved to be more successful. The particle density increased about 5 times, and the particle size was much more homogeneous than with DDM- or Triton X-100-mediated reconstitution into preformed liposomes (Fig. 4). For the analysis of the particle density, 1994 intramembrane particles were counted in 24 different proteoliposomes, resulting in a density of 160 ± 10 particles/μm2. This corresponds to a reconstitution efficiency of ∼50%, when using a value of 0.6 nm2 for the surface area of the lipid molecule and an initial protein to lipid ratio of 1:40 (w/w). For this calculation, the assumption was made that freeze-fracturing yields protein particles in either of the two lipid monolayers. The transport of isoprimeverose by the XylP protein was assayed in the presence of 50 μm electron acceptor Cl2Ind. Since Cl2Ind is freely membrane-permeable, it was not necessary to preload the proteoliposomes with this compound. Upon addition of isoprimeverose, the absorbance at 600 nm decreased immediately (Fig. 5, trace b). To demonstrate that the decrease in absorbance required isoprimeverose transport, maltose was used as a control substrate (Fig.5, trace a). Since the affinity of sGDH for maltose is about 5 times higher than for isoprimeverose, a maltose concentration of 5 mm was used instead of 12.5 mm for isoprimeverose. Although at these concentrations the oxidation rates for both substrates are approximately the same with free sGDH, following the transport of the substrate into the proteoliposomes the oxidation of isoprimeverose greatly exceeded that of maltose. The data clearly indicate that the XylP protein has been functionally reconstituted and that transport of xylosides can be measured with this assay. Traces c andd in Fig. 5 demonstrate that at the used substrate concentrations of 5 mm maltose and 12.5 mmisoprimeverose, the sGDH activity was almost equal when the internalized sGDH was released. Measurements were highly reproducible. From six independent experiments, the transport rate in the presence of 3.2 mm isoprimeverose was 420 ± 22 nmol mg−1min−1. For the kinetic analysis of the transport reaction, it was important to establish that the transport reaction and not the isoprimeverose oxidation is rate-determining. Kinetic analysis of XylP-mediated uptake in proteoliposomes preloaded with sGDH concentrations ranging from 16.25 to 130 μg/ml demonstrated that the Km andVmax values did not change any further above 65 μg/ml sGDH (Fig. 6). At saturating sGDH concentration, the apparent Km andVmax for isoprimeverose transport were 4.5 ± 0.5 mm and 870 ± 45 nmol mg−1min−1, respectively. The presence or absence of Na+ ions did not affect the rate of transport of isoprimeverose (data not shown). Other members of the GPH family are capable of catalyzing an exchange reaction of two substrates in opposite direction. This mode of transport is faster than the proton-symport reaction in case of the LacS protein of S. thermophilus. The chemical synthesis of methyl-isoprimeverose enabled us to investigate the influence of internalized methyl-isoprimeverose on the uptake of isoprimeverose. Methyl-isoprimeverose is not oxidized by sGDH due to the methyl group at the C1 position of the sugar. When comparing the isoprimeverose oxidation rates of methyl-isoprimeverose loaded with unloaded XylP proteoliposomes, the transport rate, based on two independent experiments, increased from 420 ± 22 to 823 ± 70 nmol mg−1 min−1 (Fig.7, trace b versus trace a). It should be noted that, although methyl-isoprimeverose cannot be oxidized by sGDH, the high concentration present in the proteoliposomes somewhat inhibited the sGDH activity as was observed in the control experiments with maltose as substrate (Fig. 7, trace b′ versus a′). To test whether XylP-mediated uptake is stimulated by the membrane potential, proteoliposomes prepared in potassium-containing media were diluted into the same buffer (no gradient) or in sodium-containing buffer (Δψ). From measurements of the fluorescence of the Δψ-indicator probe diSC3(5), we could show that 0.25 μm valinomycin was sufficient to rapidly generate a Δψ and that this potential was stably maintained for several minutes. The Δψ could be dissipated by the addition of 0.1 μm nigericin (data not shown). As shown in Fig.8 A, transport of isoprimeverose was initially stimulated upon addition of 0.25 μm K+ ionophore valinomycin, but the rate of uptake gradually decreased (compare traces a andb). This inhibitory effect was immediate and even bigger when the proteoliposomes were incubated with valinomycin for 30 s prior to the addition of substrate (Fig. 8 B, comparetraces a and b). These observations were reproduced in five independent experiments. Since generation of a Δψ provides a driving force for the passive influx of protons, a pH gradient (inside acidic relative to outside) could be formed. Such a reversed pH gradient will inhibit the uptake of a proton motive force-driven system, as it will lower the total driving force for the uptake reaction. To test this hypothesis, the proteoliposomes were prepared and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mmmethylamine. Methylamine can diffuse across the membrane in the dissociated form and becomes protonated in the vesicle lumen, thereby counteracting a drop in internal pH. Indeed, methylamine was capable of relieving the inhibitory effect of the reversed ΔpH that develops when a Δψ (inside negative relative to outside) is generated (Fig.8, A and B, trace d). The presence of 50 mm methylamine did not have any effect on the transport of isoprimeverose in the absence of a Δψ (Fig. 8,A and B, trace c versus trace a). These results showed that changes in the internal pH were responsible for the inhibitory effects. An activity assay system for a membrane transport system requires the incorporation of the protein(s) into lipid membranes as most transporters only catalyze a vectorial translocation reaction and not a conversion of the substrate. Transport reactions are routinely analyzed by following the distribution of isotopically labeled substrates across the membranes, i.e. between the outer and inner compartment of a membrane system. Since isotopically labeled xylosides are not available, we devised an alternative transport assay that is generally applicable for the study of carbohydrate reactions. This paper describes the first characterization of an isoprimeverose transporter and a new and more efficient procedure for the synthesis of isoprimeverose and methyl-isoprimeverose. This new transport assay makes use of a liposomal system with the XylP protein incorporated in the membrane and a PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (sGDH) enclosed in the liposomal interior. sGDH is readily purified from recombinant E. coli cells that overexpress the gene for sGDH (20Olsthoorn A.J.J. Duine J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In general, the standard error within an experiment is negligible, and even between different experiments the standard error is less than 10%. The XylP protein of L. pentosus has been amplified up to 10% of total membrane protein using the nisin expression system ofL. lactis. This unique expression system allowed us to growL. lactis to high density without any detectable expression of XylP. Addition of nisin did not slow down the growth and yielded large amounts of XylP within 1 h. In our experience the nisin expression system is superior over any other promoter system for the heterologous (or homologous) overexpression of integral membrane proteins, encoded by genes with a low GC content. For a detailed characterization of XylP, the protein was purified and functionally reconstituted into proteoliposomes. In view of the fact that highest protein stability was achieved in DDM, a non-ionic detergent with a low critical micelle concentration, the first reconstitution trials were performed by a method based on the insertion of purified protein into preformed, detergent-destabilized liposomes and the use of Biobeads for efficient detergent removal (17Knol J. Veenhoff L.M. Liang W.J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Rigaud J.L. Paternostre M.T. Bluzat A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2677-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 24Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Philliiot J.R. Schuber F. Liposomes as Tools in Basic Research and Industry. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 71-88Google Scholar). However, proteoliposomes obtained via this method were not active, and freeze-fracture electron microscopic analysis of the membranes showed a very low protein density and a heterogeneous size distribution. Most likely, XylP forms higher oligomeric structures upon the slow detergent removal, which are difficult to insert properly into the liposomes. In order to speed up the reconstitution process, the high critical micelle concentration detergent OG was used. OG can be removed rapidly upon dilution of a protein-detergent-lipid mixture to detergent concentrations below the critical micelle concentration (25Baron C. Thompson T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 382: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). According to Rigaud et al. (26Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), OG is a very efficient detergent in terms of oligomer dissociation and monomer insertion. Although XylP is less stable in OG than in DDM or Triton X-100, the short time course of this method had a positive effect on the reconstitution efficiency. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy studies showed indeed that the particle density in these proteoliposomes is much higher and that the particle size is much more homogeneous. We could show that XylP is specific for isoprimeverose, and that the carrier does not show any affinity for the monosaccharide xylose. This finding is surprising as the LacS and MelB members of the GPH family do transport galactosides as well as free galactose. Specificity studies with the LacS transporter have indicated that the inward and outward facing binding sites of the protein tolerate large substitutions at the C1 hydroxyl in both the α- and β-configuration (27Veenhoff L.M. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33244-33250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of the transport reaction yielded an affinity constant of 4.5 ± 0.5 mm and a maximal transport rate of 870 ± 45 nmol mg−1 min−1. Preloading the XylP proteoliposomes with the non-oxidizable isoprimeverose analogue methyl-isoprimeverose resulted in a stimulation of the oxidation rate, which is indicative for isoprimeverose/methyl-isoprimeverose exchange transport. Consistent with a proton motive force-driven mechanism, the uptake of isoprimeverose was stimulated by a membrane potential (inside negative relative to outside). Since the membrane potential imposes a force on protons, allowing them to enter the proteoliposomes passively, a pH gradient (inside acidic relative to outside) is anticipated. Such a pH gradient is expected to inhibit a proton motive force-driven uptake mechanism, which was indeed observed for isoprimeverose transport. Strong support for inhibition by a reversed pH gradient came from the experiments in which the membrane potential was generated in the presence of methylamine. This weak base diffuses passively across the membrane, thereby dissipating any pH gradient formed. The uptake of isoprimeverose only displayed the membrane-potential-stimulated phase under these conditions. Although the melibiose transporters (MelB) of the GPH family are stimulated by sodium ions (1Poolman B. Knol J. van der D.C. Henderson P.J.F. Liang W.J. Leblanc G. Pourcher T. Mus-Veteau I. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), Na+ had no effect on the uptake of isoprimeverose by XylP. We thus conclude that the proton rather than the sodium motive force most likely drives the uptake. Finally, the experiments indicate that effects of a membrane potential or a pH gradient on sugar transport are readily observed with the here presented spectroscopic assay. Since the uptake is not measured via radio-isotope distribution, but via downhill influx of sugars, rates can be measured very accurately. This clearly has advantages in the analysis of mutants in which the transport of sugar and cation (proton) are uncoupled. Such mutants are readily isolated, and they have been instrumental in the understanding of the energetics and kinetics of various secondary membrane transport proteins (28Brooker R.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1986192898,"Rhp14 of <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> is homologous to human XPA and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>Rad14, which act in nucleotide excision repair of DNA damages induced by ultraviolet light and chemical agents. Cells with disrupted<i>rhp14</i> were highly sensitive to ultraviolet light, and epistasis analysis with <i>swi10</i> (nucleotide excision repair) and <i>rad2</i> (Uve1-dependent ultraviolet light damage repair pathway) revealed that Rhp14 is an important component of nucleotide excision repair for ultraviolet light-induced damages. Moreover, defective <i>rhp14</i> caused instability of a GT repeat, similar to <i>swi10</i> and synergistically with<i>msh2</i> and <i>exo1</i>. Recombinant Rhp14 with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was purified from <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Complementation studies with a <i>rhp14</i> mutant demonstrated that the tagged Rhp14 is functional in repair of ultraviolet radiation-induced damages and in mitotic mutation avoidance. In bandshift assays, Rhp14 showed a preference to substrates with mismatched and unpaired nucleotides. Similarly, XPA bound more efficiently to C/C, A/C, and T/C mismatches than to homoduplex DNA. Our data show that mismatches and loops in DNA are substrates of nucleotide excision repair. Rhp14 is likely part of the recognition complex but alone is not sufficient for the high discrimination of nucleotide excision repair for modified DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2071585776,"Every radio-loud quasar may have blazar activities, according to a unified scheme where the differences in both optical and radio observations of radio-loud quasars are the result of different viewing angles. We have predicted that blazars may be detected using emission line ratio variations caused by variable illumination of gas clouds in the broad emission line region. In a spectroscopic search of 62 quasars at a redshift of about 2, we have discovered large (>20%) variations of the emission line ratios, CIV/CIII] or CIV/Lyalpha, when compared with data taken more than 10 years ago. This result is consistent with our prediction and supports the unification scheme for radio-loud quasars."
