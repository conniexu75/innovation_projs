https://openalex.org/W2135254713,"In humans, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) receptor deficiency leads to a predisposition to mycobacterial infections and impairs the formation of mature granulomas. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) receptor deficiency was found in otherwise healthy individuals with mycobacterial infections. Mature granulomas were seen, surrounded by T cells and centered with epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells, yet reduced IFN-gamma concentrations were found to be secreted by activated natural killer and T cells. Thus, IL-12-dependent IFN-gamma secretion in humans seems essential in the control of mycobacterial infections, despite the formation of mature granulomas due to IL-12-independent IFN-gamma secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2154218327,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine that promotes cell-mediated immunity to intracellular pathogens by inducing type 1 helper T cell (T H 1) responses and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production. IL-12 binds to high-affinity β1/β2 heterodimeric IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) complexes on T cell and natural killer cells. Three unrelated individuals with severe, idiopathic mycobacterial and S almonella infections were found to lack IL-12Rβ1 chain expression. Their cells were deficient in IL-12R signaling and IFN-γ production, and their remaining T cell responses were independent of endogenous IL-12. IL-12Rβ1 sequence analysis revealed genetic mutations that resulted in premature stop codons in the extracellular domain. The lack of IL-12Rβ1 expression results in a human immunodeficiency and shows the essential role of IL-12 in resistance to infections due to intracellular bacteria."

Murine Noggin is expressed in condensing cartilage and immature chondrocytes, as are many BMPs. In mice lacking Noggin, cartilage condensations initiated normally but developed hyperplasia, and initiation of joint development failed as measured by the expression of growth and differentiation factor–5. The maturation of cartilage and Hoxd expression were unaffected. Excess BMP activity in the absence of Noggin antagonism may enhance the recruitment of cells into cartilage, resulting in oversized growth plates; chondrocytes are also refractory to joint-inducing positional cues."
https://openalex.org/W2083681888,"Amphiphilic block copolymers containing a poly(styrene) tail and a charged helical poly(isocyanide) headgroup derived from isocyano- l -alanine- l -alanine and isocyano- l -alanine- l -histidine were prepared. Analogous to low–molecular mass surfactants, these block copolymers self-assembled in aqueous systems to form micelles, vesicles, and bilayer aggregates. The morphology of these aggregates can be controlled by variation of the length of the poly(isocyanide) block, the pH, and the anion-headgroup interactions. The chirality of the macromolecules results in the formation of helical superstructures that have a helical sense opposite to that of the constituent block copolymers. The great variety of morphologies displayed by these block copolymers and the fact that they are easily accessible from poly(styrene) and different types of peptides open new opportunities for applications in the fields of life and materials sciences."
https://openalex.org/W2147119735,"The brain's cerebral cortex decomposes visual images into information about oriented edges, direction and velocity information, and color. How does the cortex decompose perceived sounds? A reverse correlation technique demonstrates that neurons in the primary auditory cortex of the awake primate have complex patterns of sound-feature selectivity that indicate sensitivity to stimulus edges in frequency or in time, stimulus transitions in frequency or intensity, and feature conjunctions. This allows the creation of classes of stimuli matched to the processing characteristics of auditory cortical neurons. Stimuli designed for a particular neuron's preferred feature pattern can drive that neuron with higher sustained firing rates than have typically been recorded with simple stimuli. These data suggest that the cortex decomposes an auditory scene into component parts using a feature-processing system reminiscent of that used for the cortical decomposition of visual images."
https://openalex.org/W2046585679,"To distinguish continuous from discontinuous evolutionary change, a relation of nearness between phenotypes is needed. Such a relation is based on the probability of one phenotype being accessible from another through changes in the genotype. This nearness relation is exemplified by calculating the shape neighborhood of a transfer RNA secondary structure and provides a characterization of discontinuous shape transformations in RNA. The simulation of replicating and mutating RNA populations under selection shows that sudden adaptive progress coincides mostly, but not always, with discontinuous shape transformations. The nature of these transformations illuminates the key role of neutral genetic drift in their realization."

However, little has been reported on the structural basis of the inactivation reaction. This study proposes that nitration of a specific tyrosine residue is responsible for inactivation of recombinant human mitochondrial manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) by peroxynitrite. Mass spectroscopic analysis of the peroxynitrite-inactivated Mn-SOD showed an increased molecular mass because of a single nitro group substituted onto a tyrosine residue. Single peptides that had different elution positions between samples from the native and peroxynitrite-inactivated Mn-SOD on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography were isolated after successive digestion of the samples by staphylococcal serine protease and lysylendopeptidase and subjected to amino acid sequence and molecular mass analyses. We found that tyrosine 34 of the enzyme was exclusively nitrated to 3-nitrotyrosine by peroxynitrite. This residue is located near manganese and in a substrate O⨪2 gateway in Mn-SOD.

Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite has been demonstrated to readily oxidize or nitrate various enzymes such as metalloproteinase-1 inhibitor (2Frears E.R. Zhang Z. Blake D.R. O'Connell J.P. Winyard P.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), alcohol dehydrogenase (3Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), aconitase (4Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glutamine synthetase (5Berlett B.S. Friguet B. Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular basis of the nitration or oxidation of these enzymes. Peroxynitrite is produced by the reaction of superoxide (O⨪2) and NO with a very rapid reaction rate (4 ∼ 6.7 × 109m−1s−1) (7Huie R.E. Podmain S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar, 8Kobayashi K. Miki M. Tagawa S. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1995; : 2885-2889Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, various cell types, such as macrophages (9Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), Kuppfer cells (10Wang J.F. Komorov P. Sies H. deGroot H. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and endothelial cells (11Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), that simultaneously produce and release O⨪2 and NO could produce peroxynitrite. Mammalian mitochondria are one of the most important targets of the cytotoxicity of peroxynitrite. Recently, a mechanism for peroxynitrite-mediated dysfunction of mitochondria has been proposed as follows. When mitochondria are exposed to NO, NO diffuses easily through the membranes and reversibly inhibits cytochrome oxidase. This inhibition causes inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and as a consequence increases mitochondrial O⨪2release, leading to peroxynitrite formation (12Poderoso J.J. Carreras M.C. Lisdero C. Riobo N. Schopfer F. Boveris A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 13Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite then irreversibly inhibits complexes I and II in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (13Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, accumulation of O⨪2 results in production of a large amount of peroxynitrite. Mitochondrial Mn-SOD 2The abbreviations used are; SOD, superoxide dismutase; Mn-SOD, manganese-SOD; Cu,Zn-SOD, copper,zinc-SOD; Fe-SOD, iron-SOD; PTH, phenylthiohydantion; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are; SOD, superoxide dismutase; Mn-SOD, manganese-SOD; Cu,Zn-SOD, copper,zinc-SOD; Fe-SOD, iron-SOD; PTH, phenylthiohydantion; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. has a function to eliminate O⨪2 from the mitochondrial matrix space. However, O⨪2 can react with NO more than three times faster than with mitochondrial Mn-SOD (14Hsu J.-L. Hsieh Y. Tu C. O'Connor D. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17687-17691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, if mitochondria are exposed to a relatively large amount of NO, a sufficient amount of peroxynitrite could be formed even in the presence of Mn-SOD. In this context, a clear understanding of the reactivity of mitochondrial Mn-SOD with peroxynitrite is necessary to clarify the mechanism of mitochondrial respiratory damage caused by NO. Ischiropoulos et al. (6Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tasi M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) and Smith et al. (15Smith C.D. Carson M. van der Woerd M. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reported that bovine Cu,Zn-SOD reacts with peroxynitrite to form nitrotyrosine at Tyr-108 without inactivation of enzymatic activity. In contrast, Mn- and Fe-SOD from Escherichia coli are inactivated by peroxynitrite (6Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tasi M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Nitration of tyrosine residues was also observed. MacMillan-Crow et al. (16MacMillan-Crow L.A. Crow J.P. Kerby J.D. Beckman J.S. Thompson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11853-11858Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) reported inactivation of Mn-SOD activity and concomitant increase of 3-nitrotyrosine in a tissue homogenate of transplanted allogripha during chronic rejection. They also reported that recombinant human Mn-SOD was inactivated by peroxynitrite with an IC50 of 10 μm and concomitant increase of nitration of tyrosine residues. However, the number of nitrated residues and an exact correlation between the nitration of tyrosine residue(s) and inactivation of human Mn-SOD has not been confirmed. Recently, we showed that nitration of one tyrosine residue of human Mn-SOD by peroxynitrite was linearly related to inactivation of human Mn-SOD by monitoring the absorption increase at 428 nm (17Yamakura F. Moncad S. Toda N. Maeda H. Higgs E.A. The Biology of Nitric Oxide. Portland Press, London1998: 34Google Scholar). In this study, we report that exclusive nitration of Tyr-34 is responsible for the inactivation of human Mn-SOD by peroxynitrite. This is the first example of peroxynitrite-mediated enzyme inactivation that is caused by nitration of a single specific amino acid. Peroxynitrite, synthesized by the reaction of sodium nitrite and hydrogen peroxide, was purchased from Dojindo Laboratory Co., Japan. Staphylococcal serine protease (EC 3.4.21.19) and lysylendopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.50) were purchased from Pierce and Wako Chemical Co., Japan, respectively. Human Mn-SOD was generously provided by Bio-Technology General (Israel) Ltd. The SOD preparation showed a specific activity of 2,684 ± 296 units/mg/mol of manganese/mol of subunit and metal contents of 0.81 ± 0.028 and 0.036 ± 0.02 g atom/mol of subunit for manganese and iron, respectively. This preparation lacked two amino acids from the N terminus (Lys-His-) and therefore had a calculated molecular weight of 21,939 (18Borgstahl G.E. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer Jr., W.F. Hallewell Z.A. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The reaction of peroxynitrite with SOD for structural studies was carried out as follows. 0.1-ml reaction mixtures containing 1 mg/ml of SODs in 150 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.1 mm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid and peroxynitrite at a concentration of 1 mm were incubated at 25 °C. For control experiments, peroxynitrite was added 1 min before the addition of SOD. The reaction mixtures were analyzed after a 2-min incubation. Superoxide dismutase activity was measured by the inhibition of cytochrome c reduction by xanthine oxidase (19McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (20Yamakura F. Rardin R.L. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Hiraoka B.Y. Nakayama K. Fujimura T. Taka H. Kimie M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Metal contents were determined by using atomic absorption spectrometry with a Hitachi Z-9000 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Amino acid analyses were performed with a Hitachi L-8500 amino acid analyzer, and the samples were hydrolyzed with 6m hydrochloric acid containing 2% thioglycolic acid for 10, 15, and 20 min at 165 °C. Native and peroxynitrite-inactivated Mn-SOD (5.8 nmol) were denatured in 150 μl of 67 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, at 95 °C for 10 min and then digested with staphylococcal serine protease (substrate:enzyme = 1:50, mol/mol) at 37 °C for 18 h. After freeze-drying the digested sample, 100 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution was added. The peptides were separated on a Jasco HPLC system with a ultraviolet/visible monitor (Tokyo, Japan). An octadecyl silica gel reverse-phase column, 4.6 × 250 mm (120T, TOHSO Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), was used. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in ultra pure water (Milli-Q), and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile. The gradient program of the solvent was linear from 0–30% B in 7 min, 30–80% B in 60 min, and 80–100% B in 6 min with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The ultraviolet-visible detector was used at 230 and 428 nm, respectively. The nine major peptides were collected and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis and molecular mass determination on a mass spectrometer. The amount of these peptides was estimated by the absorption at 210 nm (21Webster G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 207: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The single peptides from each sample that had different elution positions were further digested with lysylendopeptidase (S:E = 150:1, mol/mol) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 9.5 at 35 °C for 14 h. The peptides resulting from this digestion were separated by the same method as above except that the gradient program of the solvent was linear from 0 to 100% B in 60 min. The single peptides from each sample that had different elution positions were collected and subjected to amino acid sequence and molecular mass analysis. The molecular weights of the native and peroxynitrite-inactivated Mn-SOD and protease-digested peptides were determined with a TSQ 700 electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (Thermo-Quest Finnigan Mat Co., Ltd., San Jose, CA). The analytical conditions were as follows; spray voltage, 4.5 kV; electron multiplier, 1500 V; manifold vacuum, 7.0 × 10−6; manifold temperature, 70 °C; capillary temperature, 150 °C; scan range, m/z500–3000; scan time, 5 s. Mn-SOD and the peptides were dissolved in a mixture of methanol and 0.5% acetic acid (1:1 v/v) to a final concentration of 10 pmol/μl and infused into the ion source of the TSQ 700 with a pump. Amino acid sequences of the peptides derived from Mn-SOD were determined by using an Applied Biosystems 477A gas liquid phase protein sequencer equipped with an on-line 120A PTH amino acid analyzer. PTH-3-nitrotyrosine was obtained by application of 3-nitrotyrosine into the PTH analyzer. Inactivation of recombinant human Mn-SOD by peroxynitrite shows different IC50 values dependent on the enzyme concentration, that is 0.43, 2.28, and 11.8 μmMn-SOD exhibits IC50 values of 6, 30, and 170 μm peroxynitrite, respectively, at pH 7.4 (17Yamakura F. Moncad S. Toda N. Maeda H. Higgs E.A. The Biology of Nitric Oxide. Portland Press, London1998: 34Google Scholar). For this structural analysis study, we used 11.8 μm Mn-SOD and 1 mm peroxynitrite at pH 7.4. Under these conditions, more than 90% of the activity was lost after a 2-min incubation. The inactivated enzyme still contained over 75% of the original content of manganese in the native enzyme and showed two bands that migrated a little faster than those of the native enzyme in acrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Fig. 1shows the results of mass spectrometry of the native and peroxynitrite-inactivated Mn-SOD. Deconvolution of the protein mass spectra (Fig. 1, A and B, insets) revealed that the molecular mass of the enzyme had increased by 46 Da (21,939 Da to 21,985 Da) after inactivation, consistent with the addition of a single nitro group into the inactivated enzyme. Deconvolution of the spectra also showed subpeaks corresponding to a molecular mass of 21,977 Da for the native enzyme and 22,023 Da for the inactivated enzyme. Each subpeak had an increase in molecular mass (38 Da) compared with the respective main peaks that corresponds to binding of potassium ion to each enzyme preparation. Amino acid analyses of the native and the inactivated enzymes showed a decrease of 0.81 ± 0.15 mol of tyrosine residue/mol of subunit in the inactivated Mn-SOD (average of three measurements). No significant differences in the composition of the other amino acids was observed between the two samples. From this evidence, we conclude that a single nitro group was introduced onto a tyrosine residue specifically by the reaction of peroxynitrite with Mn-SOD. After digestion of the native and peroxynitrite-inactivated Mn-SOD by staphylococcal serine protease, we separated nine major peptides by reverse-phase HPLC. Fig.2 shows a chromatogram of the peptides from the native (A) and peroxynitrite-inactivated (B) Mn-SOD. Among the nine major peptides separated, peptides 5 and 5′ had different elution positions between the two samples, which suggested that peptide 5′ was nitrated by peroxynitrite. A minor peak that has the same elution position as peak 5 in Fig.2 A also appears in Fig. 2 B. The ratio of the area between this peak and peak 5′ in Fig. 2 B is 17:83, which suggests that 83% of the intact peptide was converted to the modified peptide by the peroxynitrite treatment. Fig. 2 C shows the elution pattern of the peptides from the peroxynitrite-inactivated enzyme monitoring the absorption at 428 nm, which arises from 3-nitrotyrosine. Although a few very small peaks were observed other than the major peak in Fig. 2 C, the elution position of the major peak coincided with the position of peak 5′ in Fig.2 B. Molecular masses of 4,681 and 4,727 Da were obtained for the peptides from the native and inactivated enzymes, respectively. The difference in molecular mass (45 Da) corresponds to the molecular mass of a nitro group substituted onto a tyrosine residue. The same sequence of 23 amino acids from the N terminus was obtained for both peptides as Ser-Leu-Pro-Ala-Leu-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Tyr-Gly-Ala-Leu-Glu-Pro-His-Ile-Asn-Ala-Gln-Ile-Met-Gln-Leu-, which are the same as the reported sequence from Ser-3 to Leu-25. These results suggest that the fifth peptide in both HPLC elutants corresponds to a peptide of 41 amino acids at Ser-3 to Glu-43 (S3LPALPYD10YGALEPHINA20QIMQLHHSKH30HAAYVNN L NV40TEE). The calculated molecular mass of the peptide from the native Mn-SOD (4,681 Da) was exactly the same as that obtained from the mass spectrometry of the peptide. Because each peak in Fig.2 B had the same molecular mass as corresponding peaks in Fig. 2 A (except for peaks 5 and 5′) and the whole amino acid sequence of the enzyme was covered by the peptides of the peak 1 (Lys-44–Glu-47, 567 Da), peak 6 (Ala-48–Glu-95, 4,969 Da), peak 7 (Ala-96–Glu-131, 3,963 Da), peak 9 (dimer of Arg-132–Glu-191, 13,897 Da), and peak 8 (heterodimer between Arg-132–Glu-191 and Arg-192–Lys-198, 7,847 Da), we conclude that no other amino acid was modified by peroxynitrite. The peak 3 in Fig. 2 (A andB) corresponded to the peptide Ala-96–Gln-109, which might be caused by the conversion of glutamine109 to glutamic acid during the course of the protease digestion or purification of the enzyme. To clarify the position of the modified tyrosine and identify the product of the modification, we further digested the peptide with lysylendopeptidase. The two peptides obtained from digestion of native and peroxynitrite-inactivated Mn-SOD were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (data not shown). The second peptides eluted at the same elution position, whereas the first peptides eluted at different elution positions. When the elution was monitored at 428 nm for the peroxynitrite-inactivated Mn-SOD sample, a single peak that had the same elution position as the first peptide of the same sample was obtained. The molecular masses of the first peptides of the samples from the native Mn-SOD and the peroxynitrite-inactivated Mn-SOD were 1,610 and 1,655 Da, respectively. The difference in molecular mass (45 Da) again corresponds to the mass of a nitro group substituted onto tyrosine. The same sequence from the N terminus was obtained for each peptide except for the fifth amino acid, that is His-His-Ala-Ala-(Tyr/Xaa)-Val-Asn-Asn-Leu-Asn-Val-Thr-Glu-Glu. This sequence corresponds to the peptide at His-30 to Glu-43, which has a calculated molecular mass of 1,610 Da. A tyrosine was obtained as the fifth amino acid for the peptide from the native Mn-SOD (Fig.3 A); however, a new peak that eluted at the same position as authentic 3-nitrotyrosine was found as the fifth amino acid from the N terminus for the peptide from the peroxynitrite-inactivated Mn-SOD as shown in Fig. 3 (B andC). From this evidence, we conclude that the single nitrated tyrosine in peroxynitrite-inactivated human Mn-SOD is Tyr-34. Peroxynitrite is known to attack many amino acids including cysteine (22Radi R.

Although human Mn-SOD contains one methionine residue, two cysteine residues, six tryptophan residues, six phenylalanine residues, and nine tyrosine residues (18Borgstahl G.E. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J.

Chem. 1996; 1: 532-541Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), show that Tyr-34 is conserved in all these SODs and that the phenolic oxygen atom of Tyr-34 is located 5.4 Å from manganese (18Borgstahl G.E.

Fee J.A. Ludwig M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1646-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). These funnels are proposed to lead the substrate, O⨪2, from the bulk solvent toward the metal ions by an electrostatic guidance mechanism (35Stalling W.C. Metzger A.L. Pattridge K.A. Fee J.A. Ludwig M.L. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 12–13: 259-268Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite may be introduced to manganese through the position of Tyr-34 by the same mechanism as O⨪2. Although we cannot clarify whether the active site manganese participates in the nitration reaction of Tyr-34 or not, we are in favor of the mechanism of a manganese-catalyzed nitration for the following reason: the proportion of nitrated tyrosine residue, which was estimated by the decrease of tyrosine contents in the amino acid analysis of the peroxynitrite-inactivated Mn-SOD (−0.80 mol/mol of subunit) and by the proportion of the new peak in the first HPLC (83%, Fig. 2 B), closely coincides with the manganese content of the native Mn-SOD (0.81 g atom/mol of subunit). Therefore, peroxynitrite may react with manganese to form an active nitrating species, probably nitronium ion (NO2+), similar to the case of Cu,Zn-SOD (6Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tasi M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 26Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). This cation then reacts with the adjacent tyrosine residue directly. We cannot rule out the possibility that the nitration of tyrosine 34 could take place without metal catalysis, because tyrosine 34 is located in the gateway of O⨪2 and may have a chance to react directly with peroxynitrite. Ramezanian et al. (25Ramezanian M.S. Padmaja S. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 93: 232-240Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar) reported that peroxynitrite could nitrate tyrosine by the reactions catalyzed by metals or without metals. Recently Gow et al.

Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) or at low concentrations such as an amount achieved by equilibrating with air in an aqueous reaction solution for nitration (38Lemercier J.-N. Padmaja S. Cueto R. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Further study is required to elucidate the mechanism of the nitration of Tyr-34 in human Mn-SOD. Because the nitrated enzyme gave only a slightly faster protein band compared with that of the native enzyme in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown) and retained over 75% of the original manganese contents, the nitrated enzyme may still have the same gross structure as the native enzyme. Therefore, a change in Tyr-34 function may more likely cause the inactivation of Mn-SOD than a change in the gross protein structure. Recent mutational studies on Tyr-34 ofE. coli Mn-SOD (39Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8923-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and Fe-SOD (40Hunter T. Ikebukuro K. Bannister W.H. Bannister J.V. Hunter G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4925-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Sorkin D.L. Duong D.K. Miller A.-F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8202-8208Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) proposed three major functions of Tyr-34 as follows. 1) Tyr-34 may not be essential for catalysis and may function to maintain the appropriate protonation state of the proton cluster, which is required to supply a proton in the second cycle of the dismutation reaction of the enzyme, consisting of Tyr-34, Gln-143, and coordinated solvent (Fig.4) (39Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8923-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 40Hunter T. Ikebukuro K. Bannister W.H. Bannister J.V. Hunter G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4925-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Sorkin D.L. Duong D.K. Miller A.-F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8202-8208Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 2) Tyr-34 may be required to make a proper active site environment by forming a hydrogen bond network through Tyr-34, Gln-143, and the coordinated solvent (Fig. 4) (41Sorkin D.L. Duong D.K. Miller A.-F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8202-8208Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 3) Tyr-34 may control the accessibility of both substrate and inhibitor molecule to the active site metal. Nitration of the Tyr-34 residue may result in a change of the pK a of the phenol group of the residue from around 10 to 7.5, which may cause deprotonation of the phenol group of the tyrosine residue and break the hydrogen bonding network of coordinated solvent Gln-143–Tyr-34 at physiological pH (Fig. 4). Because the substrate is believed to bind the active site metal through a position between His-30 and Tyr-34, the nitro group of the modified tyrosine could have a steric hindrance effect for access of the substrate to the active site. A combination of these effects originating from nitration of Tyr-34 may result in the loss of the enzymatic activity of human Mn-SOD by peroxynitrite. Finally, we can suggest a pathophysiological significance of the nitration of Tyr-34 of human Mn-SOD. Although physiological concentrations (<1 μm) of NO reversibly inhibit cytochrome oxidase in an oxygen concentration-dependent manner and therefore NO was proposed as a regulator of mitochondrial respiration under these conditions (12Poderoso J.J.

Yoshioka T. Inoue M. Horton A.A. Utsumi K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a higher concentration of NO (5–200 μm) is proposed to cause mitochondrial dysfunction (13Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In the latter case, NO will compete with Mn-SOD for mitochondrially produced O⨪2, production of which may be enhanced by the inhibition of cytochrome oxidase with NO, to form peroxynitrite (13Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Nitration and inactivation of Mn-SOD by peroxynitrite could be a turning point in this mitochondrial dysfunction, because inactivation of Mn-SOD leads to accumulation of O⨪2 and as a consequence more accumulation of peroxynitrite. Both accumulated O⨪2 and peroxynitrite may cause oxidative damage of mitochondrial components. Nitration and inactivation of Mn-SOD was observed in a tissue homogenate of transplanted allogripha during chronic rejection (16MacMillan-Crow L.A. Crow J.P. Kerby J.D. Beckman J.S. Thompson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11853-11858Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of Tyr-34-nitrated Mn-SOD could be a marker for NO- and/or peroxynitrite-induced mitochondrial dysfunction under some pathological conditions such as inflammation. To evaluate this possibility, a study of the exact correlation between the NO concentration-dependent nitration of Tyr-34 of Mn-SOD and dysfunction of mitochondrial respiration by using isolated mitochondria is progressing in our laboratory.

Quite remarkably, we found that both of them form, when incubated with their substrate, a phosphoenzyme that is extremely labile in the presence of alkali or hydroxylamine and that most likely corresponds to a phosphoaspartate or a phosphoglutamate residue.

PSP was assayed at 30 °C by the release of l-[14C]serine froml-3-[14C]phosphoserine in an assay mixture (100 μl) containing 25 mm Mes (pH 6.5), 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mml-3-phosphoserine for the human recombinant protein or 1 mm for the bacterial enzyme, 15,000 cpm ofl-3-[14C]phosphoserine, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were stopped by addition of 100 μl of 10% HClO4. After centrifugation of the samples, the supernatants were neutralized with KHCO3 and processed as described in Ref. 14Jaeken J. Detheux M. Van Maldergem L. Foulon M. Carchon H. Van Schaftingen E. Arch. Dis. Child. 1996; 74: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar. PMM was assayed as described (13Pirard M. Collet J.F. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) except that the pH was 7.5 for the bacterial enzyme and 6.5 for the human recombinant protein. β-Phosphoglucomutase was assayed spectrometrically at 340 nm and 30 °C through the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. The assay mixture contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.25 mm NADP+, 50 μm glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, 500 μmβ-glucose 1-phosphate, and 10 μg/ml yeast glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. One unit of enzyme is the amount catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol of product per minute under the assay conditions described above. Protein was measured according to Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) with bovine gamma globulin as a standard. Phosphoaspartyl and phosphoglutamyl residues are too labile to resist the procedure commonly used to identify phosphorylated residues, which involves digestion of the phosphorylated protein with trypsin, separation of the resulting peptides by HPLC, and sequencing of the phosphorylated peptide. We therefore used the method of Degani and Boyer (20Degani C. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8222-8226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which the carboxyl-phosphate group is reduced with tritiated borohydride to a hydroxymethyl group before further processing of the protein. Radioactivity screening allows the detection of fractions containing the modified peptide. Furthermore, the replacement of a carboxyl group by a hydroxymethyl group results in a 14-dalton decrease of the molecular mass that allows the localization of the modified residue by mass spectrometry (21Sanders D.A. Gillece-Castro B.L. Stock A.M. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21770-21778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human PMM1, incubated with (phosphorylated) or without (control) mannose 1,6-bisphosphate, was reduced by [3H]NaBH4 and submitted to digestion with trypsin. The peptides were separated by HPLC. As shown in Fig.1, two peaks of radioactivity were found both with the control (C) and the phosphorylated (P) enzymes. The first one was significantly broader in the case of the column loaded with the phosphorylated reduced enzyme, due to the presence of much more radioactivity in fractions P-20 and P-21 than in the corresponding fractions (C-20 and C-21) of the control column. When analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, fraction P-21 was found to contain two peptides that differed by 14 amu and appeared in positive mode as [M+H]+ ions of m/z 1044.2 and 1030.2 in a 3:1 ratio (approximate) and in negative mode as ions of m/z1042.3 and 1028.4 (not shown). Only the heavier of the two peptides was found in the corresponding fraction of the control column (C-21). From the sequence of PMM1 (12Matthijs G. Schollen E. Pirard M. Budarf M.L. Van Schaftingen E. Cassiman J.J. Genomics. 1997; 40: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), only two peptides (DVDGTLTPAR and LLSKQTIQN) have calculated monoisotopic masses in agreement with the measured mass of 1044.2 amu, and only the first one is compatible with the cleavage specificity of trypsin and chymotrypsin, a common contaminant of trypsin preparations. It is indeed preceded by a phenylalanine and ends with an arginine. Fragmentation of this 1044m/z peptide by tandem mass spectrometry (not shown) confirmed its identity, the most abundant ions obtained (m/z929, 830, and 715) corresponding to fragments y9, y8, and y7 (by convention, amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments resulting from cleavage of the peptide bond are symbolized by b and y, respectively (22Biemann K. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 16: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar)). Fragmentation of the 1030 m/z peptide yielded y fragments of the same size as cleavage of the 1044 m/z peptide, indicating that the two peptides differed from each other by the replacement of the amino-terminal aspartate by homoserine (Fig.2) and, therefore, that the phosphorylated residue in PMM1 is Asp19. This residue is the first in a completely conserved DVDGT motif present in eukaryotic PMMs (Ref. 12Matthijs G. Schollen E. Pirard M. Budarf M.L. Van Schaftingen E. Cassiman J.J. Genomics. 1997; 40: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; see also below). The fact that no ions withm/z 915 or 816 were found among fragments of the reduced peptide indicates that the second aspartate was not phosphorylated. Fraction 22 of both columns contained two peptides (with m/z1609.6 and 1595.7) that differed by 14 amu (not shown). The mass of the peptide with m/z 1609.6 indicated that it corresponded to a tryptic peptide of PMM1 with sequence TVGHSVVSPQDTVQR. Its most abundant fragment ions (m/z 1409, 1215, 1029, 930, and 503, corresponding to y13, y11, y9, y8, and y4) confirmed this interpretation. Fragmentation of the 1595.7 m/z peptide yielded a series of y ions with the same m/z as listed above, indicating that the structural difference between the two peptides resided at the level of the first three residues (not shown). This difference could possibly result from reduction of a peptide bond to a secondary amine. The second peak of radioactivity of both columns was also analyzed. In both cases, it contained 1483.5 and 1469.5 m/z ions, which yielded fragments of m/z 1318, 1205, 929, and 814 and 1304, 1191, 915, and 800, respectively. Thus, the m/z 1483.5 peptide was the one with sequence GNETSPGGNDFEIF, the fragments corresponding to b13, b12, b10, and b9. This peptide is preceded by a phenylalanine in the sequence of PMM1 and results therefore from chymotryptic digestion. The 1469.5 m/z peptide is reduced in its first nine amino acids. To confirm the conclusion of the mass spectrometry analysis, we constructed PMM1 mutants in which we replaced separately the two aspartates of the conserved motif DVDGT by either glutamate or asparagine. Preliminary experiments indicated that the mutant proteins were insoluble when expressed at 37 °C. Expression was therefore carried out at 18 °C, not only for the mutated proteins but also for the human wild-type enzyme. Extracts prepared 13 h after addition of isopropylthiogalactoside to the culture contained activities (0.003–0.006 units/mg protein) that were much lower in the case of the mutated proteins than in that of the human wild-type enzyme (1.8 units/mg protein) and in fact comparable with the activity observed in a control culture without translatable insert (0.006 unit/mg protein). All of these extracts were chromatographed on DEAE-Sepharose. When extracts containing the human wild-type enzyme were applied on the column, the elution profile of the PMM activity (Fig.3 A) coincided with that of the overexpressed 30-kDa polypeptide (not shown), as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. When bacterial extracts containing the mutant proteins were chromatographed, the peak of PMM activity was about 500-fold lower, as in columns performed with control E. coli extracts. Furthermore, it did not correspond with the peak of recombinant protein, the amount of which was comparable with that of wild-type PMM. These results are exemplified for mutant Asp19 → Glu in Fig. 3, A and B. Thus, the enzymic activity measured in these cases corresponded to the E. coli enzyme. This was confirmed by the finding that this small enzymic activity had always a pH optimum (7.5), a K m for mannose 1-phosphate (50 μm), and a K a for mannose 1,6-bisphosphate (1 μm) similar to those of the bacterial enzyme and distinctly different from those of human wild-type PMM (pH 6.5, 3 and 5 μm, respectively). We attempted to determine the phosphorylation site of PSP by using the same approach as described above for PMM1. The enzyme was phosphorylated by incubation with a saturating concentration (20 mm) of its substrate, in the presence of 20 mml-serine, to slow down the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, reduced with tritiated borohydride, and digested with trypsin. However, no distinct narrow peak of radioactivity could be found in the eluate of the column, presumably because of the low stoichiometry of phosphate incorporation into the enzyme (11Collet J.F. Gerin I. Rider M.H. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have previously noticed (11Collet J.F. Gerin I. Rider M.H. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that PSPs contain close to their amino terminus a conserved DXDST motif. As this motif is similar to the DVDGT sequence found in PMM, it was likely to contain the phosphorylation site of PSP. To investigate this possibility, we mutated the two aspartate residues of the DXDST motif to asparagine and glutamate, as described above for PMM1. Expression was carried out at 37 °C for 18 h. PSP activity was measured in cell extracts. For three of the four mutants (Asp20 → Glu, Asp20 → Asn, Asp22 → Asn), an activity of only about ≈0.015 unit/mg protein was found, comparable with the activity present in control E. coli extracts (0.014 unit/mg) and well below the activity found with a culture harboring a plasmid encoding the wild-type enzyme (0.53 unit/mg protein). For the fourth mutant, in which the second aspartate is replaced by a glutamate, the activity (0.33 unit/mg protein) was about 60% that of the wild-type extract. All of these extracts were chromatographed on DEAE-Sepharose columns. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and PSP activity was assayed (not shown). For the wild-type enzyme and mutant Asp22 → Glu, there was a perfect coincidence between the elution profile of the activity and that of the overexpressed 28-kDa protein. In contrast, for mutants Asp20 → Glu, Asp20 → Asn, and Asp22 → Asn, the elution profile of the recombinant polypeptide was similar to that of the wild-type human enzyme and did not correspond with that of the low residual activity, indicating that the latter was contributed by the bacterial enzyme. Furthermore, the enzyme assayed in these three cases had a K m forl-3-phosphoserine of 100 μm and, when assayed by the release of l-[14C]serine froml-3-[14C]phosphoserine, was not inhibited byl-serine; these two properties correspond to those of the bacterial enzyme. These results indicate that the Asp20 → Glu, Asp20 → Asn, and Asp22 → Asn mutants are devoid of activity. The Asp22 → Glu mutant and the wild-type enzymes were further purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. At this stage, they were nearly homogeneous, as judged by SDS-PAGE, and their specific activity was ≈3 units/mg protein for the Asp22 → Glu mutant and ≈6.5 units/mg protein for the wild-type enzyme. The results mentioned above showed that a region containing a DXDXT motif was important for the function of PSP and of PMM. To find other enzymes with the same or a related motif, we performed a BLAST search (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70338) Google Scholar) in the GenBank and EMBL data banks using the sequence of both enzymes, and we performed additional searches with the sequences of the homologous enzymes that were found. For all enzymes identified in this way, we aligned sequences from different species to check the conservation of the motifs. As shown in Fig. 4, several enzymes were indeed found to possess a motif related to that found in PMM and PSP. Several of these enzymes were previously identified (23Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) as belonging to a large family of hydrolases comprising phosphatases (PSP, trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase, phosphoglycolate phosphatase, histidinol phosphatase, and paranitrophenylphosphatase) as well as 2-l-haloacid dehalogenase and epoxide hydrolase. We added to this list two mutases (PMM and β-phosphoglucomutase), glycerol 3-phosphate phosphatase, and P-ATPases, and we removed epoxide hydrolase because the amino-terminal motif (DLDGV) found in the human and rodent enzymes (24Beetham J.K. Tian T. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Knehr M. Thomas H. Arand M. Gebel T. Zeller H.D. Oesch F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17623-17627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is actually not conserved in this protein family (see “Discussion”). In all sequences shown in Fig. 4, the first aspartate is strictly conserved and is preceded most often by four hydrophobic residues. The second aspartate is found in all phosphotransferases and phosphatases acting on phosphomonoesters shown in Fig. 4 but is replaced by a threonine in ATPases and by a tyrosine in dehalogenases. The threonine found in position +4 with respect to the phosphorylated aspartate is conserved in all enzymes except β-phosphoglucomutases and paranitrophenylphosphatases. The results mentioned above imply that all phosphotransferases shown in Fig. 4 should form, when incubated with their substrate, an aspartyl-phosphoenzyme. Evidence for this formation has been provided for ATPases, as well as for several of the phosphotransferases possessing the DXDXT motif, i.e. PMM, PSP, and 2-phosphoglycolate phosphatase (26Seal S.N. Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13496-13500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was of interest to confirm this for β-phosphoglucomutase, in which the conserved threonine is replaced by a valine. β-Phosphoglucomutase was partially purified from L. lactis by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and was completely separated from α-phosphoglucomutase. Incubation of the enzyme with [32P]glucose 6-phosphate in the presence of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate resulted in the incorporation of radioactivity into protein. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the labeled peptide had a M r of 25,000, in good agreement with the molecular mass calculated from the sequence (24,210 Da). The phosphoenzyme bond was completely hydrolyzed after 10 min of incubation in 1 m NaOH at 0 °C or in 0.2 mNH2OH (pH 5.3) at 20 °C and about 40% hydrolyzed after 15 min of incubation at 37 °C in m HCl (results not shown), in agreement with an acyl-phosphate bond (27Hokin L.E. Sastry P.S. Galsworthy P.R. Yoda A. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The residue phosphorylated in PMM1 was hypothesized (13Pirard M. Collet J.F. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to be an aspartate or a glutamate on the basis of the stability of the phosphoenzyme linkage (27Hokin L.E. Sastry P.S. Galsworthy P.R. Yoda A. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Its location in the sequence could be identified after reduction of phosphoaspartate to homoserine with radiolabeled borohydride, proteolytic digestion, and separation of the peptides by HPLC. The elution profile of the tryptic/chymotryptic peptides derived from the phosphorylated enzyme showed indeed an additional reduced peptide that could be unambiguously identified based on its molecular mass, the size of its fragments, and the known sequence of PMM1. The fragmentation results showed additionally that the phosphorylated residue was the first aspartate in the a DVDGT motif. Two other reduced peptides could be detected in the digests of both control and phosphorylated enzymes. Both peptides could be identified by mass spectrometry, and the position of the reduced bond could be assigned to one of the first three residues of the peptide withm/z 1595.7 and to one of the first nine residues of the peptide with m/z 1469.5. In the case of the first peptide, this excludes reduction of a carboxyl-phosphate group, as the implicated sequence does not contain an aspartate or a glutamate residue. We speculate that the 14-amu loss is due to reduction of a peptide bond to a secondary amine due to a local effect of the amino acid sequence. The fact that both peptides were found with the control and the phosphorylated enzymes indicates that the underlying modifications are probably not related to the catalytic mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of the two aspartate residues in the DVDGT motif of PMM; their rather conservative replacement by a glutamate or by an asparagine resulted in a complete loss of activity. The fact that the mutated proteins had conserved the same behavior upon chromatography indicated that the loss of activity was not due to a gross folding problem (28Plapp B.V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We could not detect the modified residue in PSP with the same methodology as applied for PMM, probably because the phosphorylation stoichiometry of this enzyme is about 10 times lower than that of the mutase (11Collet J.F. Gerin I. Rider M.H. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Pirard M. Collet J.F. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis studies showed, however, that the first of the two aspartate in the conserved DXDST motif could not be replaced by glutamate or by asparagine without total loss of activity, whereas the second aspartate could be replaced by glutamate, although not by asparagine, with conservation of substantial activity. This result indicates that the carboxylic group of the first aspartate is much more position sensitive for its function than that of the second aspartate, which fits very well with the notion that it would participate in catalysis as a nucleophile, the second aspartate playing possibly a role as an acid-base catalyst (see below). These considerations, as well as the analogy with PMM, indicate that the first of the two aspartates is the phosphorylated residue. Sequence comparisons indicate that at least nine phosphatases or phosphomutases contain a similar, totally conserved DXDX(T/V) motif, which is located in the amino-terminal region of the protein, or in the case of the bifunctional enzyme, trehalose 6-phosphate synthase/trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase, in the amino-terminal region of the trehalose 6-phosphatase domain. This motif is particularly striking in the case of some enzymes like phosphoglycolate phosphatase, trehalose 6-phosphatase, PSP, and paranitrophenylphosphatase, in which only 8–14% of the residues are strictly conserved (not shown). For four of these enzymes (phosphoglycolate phosphatase (26Seal S.N. Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13496-13500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PSP (11Collet J.F. Gerin I. Rider M.H. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), PMM (13Pirard M. Collet J.F. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), β-phosphoglucomutase (this paper)), evidence for a phosphoenzyme intermediate with the characteristics of a carboxyl-phosphate bond has been provided. For one of them (PMM), the phosphorylated residue could be definitely identified as the first of the two aspartates; for a second one (PSP), site-directed mutagenesis is highly suggestive of this (see above). We speculate that the same aspartate is phosphorylated in the other members of this protein family. With at least nine members, this new family of phosphotransferases seems to be slightly larger than the bisphosphoglycerate mutase family, which comprises two mutases and three phosphatases and in which the phosphorylated residue is a histidine in a conserved RHG motif (29Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Pilkis S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9642-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,30O'Toole G.A. Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26503-26511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several of the members of the new phosphotransferase family were previously identified by Koonin and Tatusov (23Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) as belonging to a large hydrolase family comprising several phosphatases,l-2-haloacid dehalogenases, and epoxide hydrolase. This family is characterized by the presence of a conserved aspartate in the amino-terminal region and by two less well conserved motifs further in the sequence. This aspartate, which aligns with the first one of the DXDX(T/V) motif, was shown in the case ofl-2-haloacid dehalogenase to participate in catalysis by attacking the second carbon of l-2-haloacids to form a dehalogenated ester (31Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Miyagi M. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18309-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Koonin and Tatusov correctly pointed out that, by analogy with the dehalogenases, the aspartate of the phosphatases must covalently bind the phosphate group of their substrate. Their protein family does, however, not comprise the two phosphomutases studied here but includes mammalian epoxide hydrolase. This enzyme contains a DLDGV sequence (24Beetham J.K. Tian T. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Knehr M. Thomas H. Arand M. Gebel T. Zeller H.D. Oesch F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17623-17627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is, however, not conserved in other homologous epoxide hydrolases such as the enzymes from soybean (EMBL D63780) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis(EMBL Z95557). Furthermore, murine epoxide hydrolase was shown to form a covalent adduct with its substrate at the level of Asp333(32Borhan B. Jones A.D. Pinot F. Grant D.F. Kurth M.J. Hammock B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26923-26930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) in a sequence that is unrelated to our motif. Therefore, we speculate that the conserved DXDX(T/V) motif is a characteristic of the phosphatases/phosphomutases acting on phosphate esters (as opposed to phosphoanhydrides). Sequence comparisons indicate that a third group of enzymes,i.e. P-ATPases, contains an extremely conserved, related motif (DKTGT), in which again the first aspartate is phosphorylated in the course of catalysis (8Post R.L. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6993-7000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the residue in third position is an aspartate in the phosphoesterase/phosphomutase family, a threonine in the ATPase family, and a tyrosine in the dehalogenase family. On the basis of its position in the crystal structure of 2-l-haloacid dehalogenase and of site-directed mutagenesis studies, this tyrosine was proposed to play a role in attracting the leaving halide ion during attack of C2 of l-2-haloacids by the aspartate (33Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20322-20330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We speculate that the second aspartate of the phosphomonoesterases/mutases plays the role of an acid that donates the proton to the leaving hydroxyl group. This role is not needed in the case of ATPases because the leaving group is a dissociated acid. Accordingly, the second aspartate is replaced by a much weaker acid in ATPases. Aravind and Koonin (34Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 17-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) recently identified a new phosphoesterase family with a DXD motif, comprising Drosophila prune protein and bacterial RecJ exonuclease as well as numerous proteins with unidentified function. This family differs from the one described here by at least two characteristics: (a) the presence of another conserved DHH motif, which is found in none of the sequence reported here, and (b) the fact that the DXD motif is not preceded by a stretch of four hydrophobic residues. It would be most interesting to know if these enzymes also form a phosphoaspartate intermediate. We thank H. G. Hers and M. Rider for helpful comments, E. de Hoffmann (Laboratoire de Spectrométrie de Masse, UCL) for giving access to mass spectrometry equipment, and G. Berghenouse for technical assistance."

GLUT4 protein is localized to the interior of the cell and moves to the plasma membrane in response to insulin receptor activation (7Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have shown that the effect of insulin on glucose uptake in these tissues results directly from the recruitment of GLUT4 from an intracellular vesicle pool to the plasma membrane (for recent reviews see Refs. 9Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar and 10Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 529-546PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin-mediated glucose homeostasis is extremely sensitive to the overall GLUT4 protein pool size in the major insulin responsive tissues that include heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. In rodent models of insulin deficiency (fasting- or streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes), the expression of GLUT4 protein and mRNA is markedly reduced and accounts for the insulin resistance of glucose transport under these conditions (11Berger J.

Genetic studies strengthen the relationship between insulin-mediated glucose homeostasis and the cellular levels of GLUT4 protein. Mice engineered to express only one allele of the GLUT4 gene were shown to have diminished GLUT4 protein levels resulting in a progressive diabetic phenotype characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis (18Stenbit A.E. Tsao T.-S. Li J. Burcelin R. Grenen D.L. Factor S.M. Houseknicht K. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an increase in GLUT4 protein pool size enhances insulin-sensitive glucose uptake. Transgenic mice expressing the human GLUT4gene specifically in adipose tissue or in both adipose and muscle tissues displayed a marked increase in basal glucose disposal and insulin-sensitive glucose uptake (19Liu M.-L.

In STZ diabetic mice, overexpression of GLUT4 in either fat or skeletal muscle under the control of heterologous tissue-specific promoters improves glucose homeostasis (26Leturque A. Loizeau M.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1604-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Finally, expression of the human GLUT4gene in the genetically diabetic db/db strain of mice improved glycemic control and insulin sensitivity (28Gibbs E.M. Stock J.L. McCoid S.C. Stukenbrok H.A.

The close association of GLUT4 protein pool size with physiologic changes in glucose homeostasis makes physiologic manipulation of GLUT4gene expression an attractive target for therapeutic interventions designed to treat the insulin resistance associated with diabetes. To achieve this goal, a detailed molecular understanding of the regulation of GLUT4 gene expression in a natural physiologic context is required. By using transgenic mice, we have previously reported that regions regulating expression of the humanGLUT4 gene are found within 1154 bp of DNA located 5′ to the major transcription initiation site (29Liu M.-L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23491-23495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 1154-bp fragment regulatory DNA supported a pattern of gene expression that mimics the mouse GLUT4 gene both in terms of tissue-specific and regulated expression in both fasting and STZ-induced models of insulin deficiency (31Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23491-23495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have determined an essential role for an MEF2 DNA-binding domain in regulation of the humanGLUT4 gene promoter. In addition, we have begun to characterize the nuclear proteins that interact with this binding domain in the major GLUT4 expressing tissues. The cDNA constructs used to generate transgenic mice were derived from the plasmid hGLUT4(2.4)CAT containing 2400 bp of GLUT4 5′-flanking DNA (29Liu M.-L. Olson A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Buse J.B. Bell G.I. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11673-11676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid was used to generate 895-hG4-CAT by digestion of the parental plasmid with AvrII and SacI. An internal deletion in hGLUT4(2.4)CAT was made by digestion with RsrII andBssHII, followed by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of nucleotides to fill in the remaining nucleotide overhangs. The plasmid was then religated to form hGLUT4(2.4ΔRB)CAT. This plasmid was used to generate 1154Δ730/412-hG4-CAT by digestion withBclI and HindIII and 895Δ730/412-hG4-CAT by digestion with AvrII and HindIII. A third plasmid was generated in which the MEF2-binding site of hGLUT4(2.4)CAT (CTAAAAATAG) was mutated to form an ApaI site (CTGGGCCCAG). This plasmid hGLUT4(2.4apa)CAT was used to generate 895APA-hG4-CAT by digestion with AvrII and HindIII. The DNA fragments were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and injected into the pronucleus of fertilized mouse embryos at the University of Iowa Transgenic Animal Facility (Iowa City, IA). Transgenic animals carrying the appropriate constructs were identified by slot blot analysis of isolated tail DNA using the 4.6-kilobase pairSacI/HindIII fragment of hGLUT4(2.4)CAT as a probe. Insulin-deficient diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (200 mg/kg body weight) following an overnight fast as described previously (32LeMarchand-Brustel Y. Olichon-Berthe C. Gremeaux T. Tant J.F. Rochet N. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Seventy-two hours after injection, tail vein blood samples were assayed for glucose concentration using chemstrips (Boehringer Mannheim). Animals with blood glucose levels greater than 400 mg/dl were considered diabetic. The diabetic animals were either left untreated or treated with 1 unit of regular insulin per day for 2 days. The mice were killed 5 days after STZ injection, and the tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until prepared for analysis. Total cellular RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tissues using the guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction followed by purification on a CsCl gradient (33Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar) as described previously (34Olson A.L. Perlman S. Robillard J.E. Pediatr. Res. 1990; 28: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 260 nm and stored as an ethanol precipitate at −70 °C. An 890-bpSalI/EcoRI fragment of the mouse GLUT4-CAT plasmid, p469GLUT4.CAT (obtained from Dr. M. D. Lane, Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore, MD) (35Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), was subcloned into theSalI/EcoRI site of pIBI30 (IBI). This plasmid was linearized with Bsu36I and was used as a template to generate a 616-nucleotide antisense RNA probe that is able to anneal to either the 5′ end of mouse GLUT4 sequences or the 5′ end of CAT mRNA. The antisense RNA was labeled with [α-32P]UTP using T3 polymerase in an in vitro transcription assay (Promega). Ten μg of total RNA was hybridized with 5 × 105 cpm of labeled probe in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 0.4 m NaCl, 40 mmPipes, pH 6.4, and 1 mm EDTA). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 50 °C, and the non-hybridized RNA was digested for 30 min at room temperature in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm sodium acetate, and 5 mm EDTA containing 50 units of RNase T1/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). The protected fragments were analyzed using 6% acrylamide, 7.5 m urea gel electrophoresis exposed to Hyperfilm MP film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −70 °C. Ten μg of total RNA was fractionated by 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to nylon filters (Zeta-Probe GT, Bio-Rad), and filters were prehybridized with a solution of 50% deionized formamide, 0.12 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, 0.25 m NaCl, and 7% SDS for 1 h at 50 °C. Blots were then hybridized overnight in fresh prehybridization buffer containing 2 × 106cpm/ml random primed cDNA probes corresponding to full-lengthMEF2C and MEF2A mRNA (kindly provided by Dr. Eric N. Olson, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). The filters were washed according to manufacturer's specifications including a high stringency, low salt wash at 65 °C for 15 min. The washed filters were exposed to Hyperfilm MP film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −70 °C. Aliquots of 30 μg of total nuclear extract protein were solubilized in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (120 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 200 mm DTT) and were fractionated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% acrylamide gels. The fractionated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) in buffer (25 mm Tris and 190 mm glycine, pH 8.5) overnight at 0.2 A at 4 °C. The membranes were blocked 1 h at room temperature with a solution of Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 7% dried milk (Carnation). The membranes were probed with the αMEF2A rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce) following incubation of the blot with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Tissues were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissues were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, and 6 μg/ml each l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone) with 10 strokes of a Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged 10 min at 3900 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of homogenization buffer A and homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer with tight-fitting pestle. The homogenate was layered over one-half volume of buffer B (1 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mmspermidine, 0.1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, and 6 μg/ml eachl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone) and centrifuged at 3900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A/glycerol (9:1, w/w) and layered over one-third volume of buffer B/glycerol (9:1, w/w). The gradient was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The semi-purified nuclear pellet was resuspended in 1 volume of nuclear extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 400 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF) and 1/10 volume of 4 m KCl. Nuclear proteins were then extracted on ice for 30 min, and the particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer C (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, and 6 μg/ml each l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone) for 3 to 4 h. The dialysate was assayed for total protein (Bradford) and stored at −70 °C. To generate in vitrotranslation products, cDNAs corresponding to human MEF2A and mouse MEF2C isoforms were subcloned into expression vectors, linearized,in vitro transcribed, and quantitated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. Equivalent amounts of RNA were used to program rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence and absence of radiolabeled [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled in vitro translation products were analyzed and quantitated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and by immunoblotting with the αMEF2A antibody (data not shown). The human GLUT4 MEF2 DNA-binding site double-stranded oligonucleotide (GGGAGCTAAAAATAGCAG) was made from custom-synthesized primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). The MCK MEF2 and OCT1 DNA-binding site oligonucleotides were commercially prepared (Santa Cruz). The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. The probes (0.5 ng) were incubated with up to 14 μg of nuclear extracts in a 10-μl reaction containing 2 μg poly(dI-dC), 40 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol for 20 min at room temperature. For competition studies, the extracts were preincubated with various concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotides for 5 min before addition of the radiolabeled probe. Similarly, electrophoretic gel supershift studies were carried out by preincubating the nuclear extracts with 1 μg of either the αMEF2 antibody (Santa Cruz) or rabbit IgG (Pierce) for 1 h on ice before addition of the radiolabeled probe. The samples were then analyzed on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel buffered with Tris borate/EDTA (TBE, 22 mm Tris, 22 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA) and run at 300 V for 2 h 4 °C. The dried gels were then exposed to Hyperfilm MP at −70 °C. To identify the DNA sequences responsible for tissue-specific expression of the human GLUT4 gene, we have generated multiple lines of transgenic mice carrying CATreporter gene constructs containing various deletions in the 5′-flanking DNA. In a previous report, we demonstrated that the smallest construct capable of supporting full promoter function required 1154 bp of the human GLUT4 5′-flanking DNA (31Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23491-23495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To localize further functional elements within this region, we created transgenic mice carrying 895 bp of DNA fused to the CATreporter gene (895-hG4-CAT). RNase protection analysis of these mice displayed a pattern of CAT expression that paralleled the expression of the endogenous murine GLUT4 mRNA (Fig.1, A and B). The transgenic CAT and endogenous murine GLUT4mRNAs were expressed at highest levels in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle with slightly lower levels in cardiac muscle followed by white adipose tissue. This protein is identical to transgene expression observed for larger segments of regulatory DNA (30Olson A.L. Liu M.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Buse J.B. Bell G.I. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9839-9846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, there was no measurable expression of the 895-hG4-CAT transgenic mRNA in liver or brain, tissues which normally do not express GLUT4. Since expression of reporter genes in transgenic animals may be affected by the location of genomic integration and copy number, we analyzed five independent founder lines with essentially identical results (TableI). From these data we conclude that at least 895 bp of 5′-flanking DNA are required for expression of theGLUT4 gene.Table INumber of founder mice that expressed detectable transgenic mRNA in each construct used to generate transgenic miceConstructNumber of founders testedNumber of founders that express transgenic mRNA1-aTransgenic mRNA expression was measured by RNase protection assay.hGLUT4 [2.4] CAT1-bExpression of this transgenic construct was originally reported in Ref. 28.221975-hG4-CAT1-cExpression of this transgenic construct was originally reported in Ref. 30.441639-hG4-CAT1-cExpression of this transgenic construct was originally reported in Ref. 30.641154-hG4-CAT1-cExpression of this transgenic construct was originally reported in Ref. 30.33730-hG4-CAT1-cExpression of this transgenic construct was originally reported in Ref. 30.66412-hG4-CAT1-cExpression of this transgenic construct was originally reported in Ref. 30.55895-hG4-CAT1-cExpression of this transgenic construct was originally reported in Ref. 30.551154Δ730/412-hG4-CAT30895Δ730/412-hG4-CAT20895[APA]hG4-CAT601-a Transgenic mRNA expression was measured by RNase protection assay.1-b Expression of this transgenic construct was originally reported in Ref. 28Gibbs E.M.

Open table in a new tab In a previous study we reported that a deletion in the humanGLUT4 promoter to position −730 relative to the transcription initiation site was only partially functional (31Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23491-23495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This construct supported an unrestricted pattern of transgene expression that was quite high in skeletal muscle but low in heart and adipose tissue and did not display any hormonal/metabolic regulatory properties. Furthermore, deletion to position −412 supported only a basal level of transgene expression that was not restricted to any major GLUT4-expressing tissues (31Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23491-23495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These data implied that a regulatory element important for skeletal muscle-specific expression of GLUT4 resides within bp −730 and −412. To examine the contribution of this region for human GLUT4promoter function, we prepared two constructs in which the DNA sequences between positions −730 and −412 were deleted (Fig. 1 A). This internal deletion was created in two different plasmids with 5′ boundaries at either position −1154 (1154Δ730/412-hG4-CAT) or −895 (895Δ730/412-hG4-CAT). Deletion of these internal sequences ablated transgene irrespective of their precise 5′ boundaries in all of five independent transgenic lines (Fig. 1 A, Table I). Inspection of the −730 to −412 sequences revealed the presence of a consensus (CTAAAAATAG) myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2)-binding site located from −473 to −464. To determine if this potential MEF2-binding site contributed to GLUT4 promoter function, we mutated this site in 895-hG4-CAT to produce an ApaI site in its place (895[APA]-hG4-CAT) by replacement of the core AAAAAT sequence with GGGCCC. Analysis of six independent founder lines demonstrated that 895[APA]-hG4-CAT was not significantly expressed in any tissues (Fig. 1 A, Table I). These data indicate that the putative MEF2-binding site located within the region −730 to −412 is required for GLUT4 gene expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. However, since 730 bp of theGLUT4 5′-flanking DNA, which encompasses this MEF2-binding site, do not support the full pattern of gene expression, this indicates that the MEF2 site is necessary but not sufficient for the normal tissue-specific GLUT4 promoter activity. It is well established that in both rats and miceGLUT4 gene expression is down-regulated in insulin-deficient states due to a decrease in transcription rate of the gene (30Olson A.L. Liu M.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Buse J.B. Bell G.I. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9839-9846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gerrits P.M. Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 640-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is an insulin-specific response since the decrease in transcription and loss of GLUT4 mRNA are fully restored following insulin therapy. To determine if 895-hG4-CAT was regulated by insulin deficiency in an analogous manner to the endogenousGLUT4 gene, we compared the expression of the mouseGLUT4 and transgenic CAT mRNAs in STZ-induced diabetes. Expression of CAT mRNA in white and brown adipose tissue, heart, and hindquarter skeletal muscle was reduced in diabetic mice in a manner that paralleled the down-regulation of the mouse GLUT4 gene (Fig. 2). Treatment of these diabetic mice with insulin restored bothCAT mRNA and GLUT4 mRNA levels to normal or above normal levels (Fig. 2). These data, in conjunction with the 5′ and internal deletion analysis, suggest that the regulatory and tissue-specific elements are located downstream of nucleotide −895 and that sequences upstream of this position do not contribute to the function of the GLUT4 promoter with respect to tissue-specific expression and regulated expression during insulin deficiency. The MEF2-binding site in the human GLUT4promoter is perfectly conserved in both the mouse and rat genes (37Liu M.L. Olson A.L. Edgington N.P. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28514-28521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This type of domain has been reported to specifically bind MADS box proteins of the MEF2 family of transcription factors (38Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J.

Although first described in nuclear extracts from cultured myotubes, skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, some MEF2 isoforms such as MEF2A are more broadly expressed (39Dodou E. Sparrow D.B. Mohun T. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The presence of MEF2 isoform mRNAs and immunoreactive proteins in adipose tissue has not been reported. Therefore, Northern blot analysis was performed using probes specific for either MEF2A or MEF2C to determine the tissue distribution of these genes with respect to the majorGLUT4-expressing tissues. MEF2C mRNA was detected at highest levels in skeletal muscle and brain, with much lower levels in white and brown adipose tissue and heart (Fig.3 A). On the other hand,MEF2A mRNA was highly expressed in brown and white adipose tissue, heart, and skeletal muscle as well as in brain, whereas a much lower level of mRNA was detected in liver (Fig.3 B). To determine the levels of MEF2A protein, nuclear extracts prepared from heart, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue were also subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody against MEF2A. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of MEF2A immunoreactive material in brown adipose tissue, heart, and skeletal muscle but not in liver (Fig. 3 C). Although the MEF2A antibody can cross-react with MEF2C (see below), the presence of both MEF2A mRNA and protein in the major GLUT4 expressing tissues coupled with the functional requirement of the MEF2-binding site strongly suggests that this isoform is likely to play a role inGLUT4 gene expression.

Recently, we attempted to introduce mtDNA from non-human apes into a human cell line lacking mtDNA (ρ°), and succeeded in producing human-common chimpanzee, human-pigmy chimpanzee, and human-gorilla xenomitochondrial cybrids (HXC). Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of oxidative phosphorylation function in these cells. Mitochondrial complexes II, III, IV, and V had activities indistinguishable from parental human or non-human primate cells. In contrast, a complex I deficiency was observed in all HXC. Kinetic studies of complex I using decylubiquinone or NADH as limiting substrates showed that the V max was decreased in HXC by approximately 40%, and the K mfor the NADH was significantly increased (3-fold, p < 0.001). Rotenone inhibition studies of intact cell respiration and pyruvate-malate oxidation in permeabilized cells showed that 3 nm rotenone produced a mild effect in control cells (0–10% inhibition) but produced a marked inhibition of HXC respiration (50–75%). Immunoblotting analyses of three subunits of complex I (ND1, 75 and 49 kDa) showed that their relative amounts were not significantly altered in HXC cells. These results establish HXC as cellular models of complex I deficiency in humans and underscore the importance of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes co-evolution in optimizing oxidative phosphorylation function.

Mitochondria are organelles containing their own DNA (mtDNA) and are present in essentially all eukaryotic cells. It is believed that the presence of mitochondria resulted from an evolving symbiosis of infectious prokaryotes and their eukaryotic hosts, allowing eukaryotic cells to oxidize substrates to produce energy.

The assembly and function of respiratory-competent mitochondria depend on a tight interaction between gene products coded by both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, as both contribute essential subunits to mitochondrial enzymes and collaborate in the synthesis and assembly of these proteins (1Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 2Clayton D.A. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1992; 15: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Small variations in holoenzyme structure can affect its activity, as illustrated by the presence of isoforms of the nuclear-coded subunits of complex IV that affect the catalytic function of their mitochondrially coded subunits, both in unicellular eukaryotes (3Poyton R.O. Trueblood C.E. Wright R.M. Farrell L.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 289-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and in mammals (4Kadenback B. Kuhn-Nentwig L. Buge U. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1987; 15: 113-161Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These necessary interactions led to a species-specific compatibility between the nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded factors. Nevertheless, we recently established viable human xenomitochondrial cybrids (HXC) harboring mtDNA from common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), pigmy chimpanzee (Pan paniscus), and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) (5Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9131-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein synthesis in HXC was comparable to the human 143B cell line, but the characterization of the endogenous cell respiration in these cells showed that the average oxygen consumption in xenomitochondrial cybrids was decreased by 20–30%, when compared with the parental human 143B line. Here, we describe a detailed analysis of oxidative phosphorylation function in these human xenomitochondrial cybrids, and the presence of a specific complex I defect due to nuclear DNA-mtDNA incompatibilities. Chimpanzee (P. troglodytes) adenovirus 12-simian virus 40-transformed fibroblasts (C) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1609). Pigmy chimpanzee (P. paniscus) and gorilla (G. gorilla) skin fibroblasts (P and G, respectively) were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research Repository. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate. Human xenomitochondrial cybrids (HXC) (two human-chimpanzee clones (HC1 and HC4), two human-gorilla (HG13 and HG17) and two human-pigmy chimpanzee clones (HP3 and HP4) were produced and reported previously (5Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9131-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). SUB21 and W20 cell lines (transmitochondrial cybrid clones containing wild type mtDNA) were previously characterized (6Hao H. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2347-2352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Hao H. Moraes C.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6831-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The human osteosarcoma-derived cell line 143B(TK−) and its mtDNA-less derivative, 143B/206 ρ° were cultured as described elsewhere (8King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells, were collected by trypsinization, pelleted, and resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline medium to be used for the different studies. To prepare mitochondria, cells were resuspended in a medium containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 0.25 m sucrose, 40 mm KCl, 2 mmEGTA and 1 mg/ml BSA (medium A), and mitochondria were immediately isolated as described previously (9Rustin P. Chretien D. Bourgeron T. Gérard B. Rötig A. Saudubray J.M. Munnich A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 228: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). The pellet of crude mitochondria was resuspended in medium A. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Enrichment of mitochondria was ascertained by the specific cytochromec oxidase activity found in mitochondria relative to that of the homogenate. The protein content in the cell and mitochondria samples was determined according to the Bradford's (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) method. Cell lines 143B, W20, HG13, HC4, HP4, G, and C were used for these studies. Oxygen utilization was measured polarographically in 0.3 ml of standard medium (0.3 m mannitol, 10 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) with a Clark oxygen electrode in a micro water-jacketed cell, magnetically stirred, at 37 °C (Hansatech Instruments Limited, Norfolk, United Kingdom). Approximately 5 × 106 cells (∼0.5 mg of protein) were used in each experiment. After measurement of intact cell coupled endogenous respiration, cells were permeabilized by addition of digitonin (40 μg/ml). The oxidation of pyruvate (8 mm) plus malate (0.2 mm), followed by the oxidation of glutamate (15 mm) (site I substrates) was measured. The reaction was inhibited with KCN (700 μm). The oxidation of succinate (10 mm) (site II substrate) in the presence of rotenone (3 μm) and ATP (130 μm) was also performed. After inhibition of complex II with malonate (10 mm), the oxidation of the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) (20 mm) catalyzed by a G3P-dehydrogenase containing FAD (an enzyme associated to the mitochondrial internal membrane giving electrons to complex III) was measured. Oxygen uptake triggered by duroquinol (0.6 mm) and inhibited with antimycin A (1 μm), that measures the activity of complex III plus IV, was monitored subsequently. In another experiment, the oxidation of ascorbate (10 mm) plusN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) (0.2 mm), through the complex IV was measured in intact cells. For the experiments with isolated mitochondria, 0.02–0.05 mg of protein was used. The following assays were performed in intact mitochondria: oxidation of glutamate (20 mm) plus malate (20 mm); oxidation of pyruvate (20 mm) plus malate (1 mm), oxidation of succinate (12 mm) in the presence of rotenone (3 μm) and ATP (0.2 mm), followed by the oxidation of G3P (20 mm) and the oxidation of the duroquinol (0.6 mm). State 3 rate was assessed for each substrate according to Rustin et al. (9Rustin P. Chretien D. Bourgeron T. Gérard B. Rötig A. Saudubray J.M. Munnich A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 228: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). The respiratory control associated with the succinate oxidation was determined by comparing the oxygen consumption rates obtained in the presence of the specific inhibitor of the ATPase, oligomycin (10 μm), and in the presence of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (10 μm). Mitochondria were isolated as described above from the cell lines SUB21, W20, 143B, 206-ρ°, HP4, HP3, HC4, HC1, HG13, HG17, G, and C. The measurement of the specific activity of the individual complexes of the respiratory chain was performed spectrophotometrically (DU-640 spectrophotometer, Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA) essentially as described elsewhere (9Rustin P. Chretien D. Bourgeron T. Gérard B. Rötig A. Saudubray J.M. Munnich A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 228: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). A total of 20–40 μg of mitochondrial protein was used to determine the activity of each complex. Assays were performed at 37 °C (except the citrate syntase at 30 °C) in 1 ml of medium. Assay was performed at 340 nm using the acceptor 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-n-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DB) (50 μm) and 0.8 mm NADH as donor, in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) medium supplemented with 5 mg/ml BSA. The addition of 4 μm rotenone allowed us to quantify the rotenone-sensitive activity. To permeabilize the mitochondrial internal membrane to NADH, mitochondria were incubated with H2O for 3 min at 37.5 °C. Performed at 340 nm using 40 μm cytochrome c 3+ as the acceptor and 0.4 mm NADH as the donor in a medium containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) supplemented with 5 mg/ml BSA. The subsequent addition of 4 μm rotenone allowed us to quantify the NCCR rotenone-sensitive activity. Assay was performed at 600 nm using 80 μmDCPIP as the acceptor and 10 mm succinate as the donor in a medium containing KH2PO4 10 mm (pH 7.8), EDTA 2 mm and 1 mg/ml BSA in the presence of 80 μm decylubiquinone, 4 μm rotenone, and 0.2 mm ATP. The addition of 10 mm malonate inhibited the oxidation of succinate. The addition of 20 mmG3P allowed the measurement of the glycerol-3-phosphate-decylubiquinone DCPIP reductase activity (GQR). Assay was performed at 550 nm using 40 μmcytochrome c 3+ as the acceptor and 10 mm succinate as the donor in a medium containing 10 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.8), 2 mm EDTA and 1 mg/ml BSA in the presence of 4 μm rotenone and 0.2 mm ATP. The addition of 10 mm malonate inhibited the oxidation of succinate. The addition of 20 mm G3P allowed the measurement of the glycerol-3-phosphate-cytochrome c reductase activity (GCCR). Assay was performed at 550 nm using 40 μmcytochrome c 3+ as the acceptor and 50 mm duroquinol as the donor in a medium containing 10 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.8), 2 mm EDTA and 1 mg/ml BSA in the presence of 0.3 mm KCN. The addition of 0.4 μm antimycin A allowed us to distinguish between the reduction of cytochromec catalyzed by the complex III and the nonenzymatic reduction of cytochrome c by the reduced quinone. Assay was performed at 550 nm using 50 μm reduced cytc 2+ as the donor, in a isoosmotic medium (10 mm phosphate buffer, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 6.5) after permeabilizing the external mitochondria membrane with 2.5 mm lauryl maltoside. Assay was performed at 340 nm. The complex V activity was measured by a coupled assay using lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase as the coupling enzyme. The activity was measured in a medium with 50 mmTris (pH 8.0) and 5 mg/ml BSA in the presence of 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 3 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 1 μmantimycin A, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 mmATP, 4 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase, and 0.2 mm NADH. The addition of 3 μm oligomycin allowed us to distinguish the ATPase activity coupled to the respiratory chain. Performed at 412 nm following the reduction of 0.1 mm5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the presence of 0.2 mm acetyl-CoA and 0.5 mm oxalacetic acid in a medium with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2% Triton X-100. The NQR activity was used to determine the kinetic characteristics of complex I. For NADH kinetic analysis of complex I, DB was used at a final concentration of 50 μm. For DB kinetic analysis of complex I, NADH was used at a final concentration of 0.8 mm. Determinations were made in triplicate for each cell line at different concentrations of substrate. A pH profile was constructed for the NQR activity by increasing the pH of the Tris-HCl buffer from 5 to 12. Cell respiration in intact cells was performed as described above. To determine the K i for rotenone-inhibition of the coupled cell endogenous respiration, increasing concentrations of rotenone were added to the polarographic chamber until the maximum inhibition was achieved. Also, to determine the K iof site I substrates oxidation, the experiment was repeated using digitonin-permeabilized cells in the presence of pyruvate (10 mm) plus malate (1 mm) and ADP (0.3 mm). All experiments were carried out in triplicate. The rotenone-inhibited activity was measured after each addition of rotenone and expressed as a percentage of the uninhibited activity (adding only ethanol) measured, in parallel, in a second polarographic chamber. Immunoblottings were performed using bovine holocomplex I and 75-kDa polyclonal antibodies and human succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit (SDH(Fp)) monoclonal and human ND1 polyclonal antibodies. Forty micrograms of mitochondrial proteins were separated onto 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated for 1 h with 10% milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated with the holocomplex I antibody for 14 h at 4 °C. The subsequent chemiluminescent detection of the proteins was performed using the Phototope-horseradish peroxidase Western blot detection kit using an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-linked (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Membranes were stripped and reincubated with the 75-kDa and SDH(Fp) antibodies in one case, and with ND1 and SDH(Fp) antibodies in the other. The data was analyzed using the SPSS software. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Comparisons between cell line groups were carried out using a Levane's test (for equality of variances) and the Student's t test (for equality of means) for independent data. When a potential relationship between variables was of interest, a linear regression analysis was performed. Values withp < 0.050 were considered statistically significant. Our previous results describing a small decrease in the oxygen consumption rate by the human xenomitochondrial cybrids (5Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9131-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) motivated us to perform polarographic analyses of these cells. We did not find significant differences in cell respiration between the human (143B and W20) and primate (C and G) cells (p = 0.159). However, the intact cell oxygen consumption in HXC was decreased by 20% as compared with the human cell lines, and by 17% as compared with the primate lines (p < 0.001 in both cases). Fig.1 A summarizes the oxygen consumption data on intact and on digitonin-permeabilized cells. Using pyruvate-malate and glutamate as site I substrates, the oxygen consumption rate was decreased by 36% (HC), 38% (HP), and 39% (HG) (p < 0.001 in all cases). The oxygen utilization values obtained with site II (succinate), site III (duroquinol), and site IV (ascorbate-TMPD) substrates were comparable to those obtained in human and primate controls. Some variability was observed in the oxidation of the G3P, catalyzed by a FAD-containing G3P-dehydrogenase, that feeds electrons to complex III. Particularly, clone HP4 was decreased by 50% of the average of the values obtained for the other cell lines. A decreased oxidation rate with NAD+-linked substrates (pyruvate or glutamate), but normal rates with succinate is an indicator of complex I deficiency. The use of two different substrates allowed us to exclude a possible defect in the tricarboxilic acid carrier or in the primary dehydrogenase. A constant ratio between the different respiratory chain (MRC) enzyme activities and a constant ratio between the different substrate oxidation rates is a characteristic of functional oxidative phosphorylation (11Rustin P. Chretien D. Bourgeron T. Wucher A. Saudubray J.M. Rötig A. Munnich A. Lancet. 1991; 1: 338-360Google Scholar). These ratios, considering site I substrates oxidation in HXC, were significantly different from control values (p < 0.001). Fig.1 B shows that in isolated mitochondria, we also detected a decrease in the oxidation of site I substrates in the three HXC as compared with controls (approximately a 40% decrease,p < 0.001 in all cases). Succinate and duroquinol oxidations were normal. The ratios between the different substrate oxidation rates obtained when considering the abnormal rates were also significantly different from the controls (p < 0.001). The respiratory control (that measures the coupling between the electron flux and the ATP synthesis) associated with the succinate oxidation was moderately but significantly decreased in the HXC samples (4.26 ± 0.15 for HC4, 4.23 ± 0.25 for HP4, and 4.03 ± 0.15 for HG13; p < 0.01 in all cases) as compared with both 143B (5.03 ± 0.25) and parental primate (C and G) cells (4.90 ± 0.24). To assess the mitochondria enrichment of the preparations, COX-specific activity was measured in the initial homogenate and in the isolated mitochondria fraction. COX activity was 7- to 10-fold higher in isolated mitochondria than in homogenates. MRC enzyme activities were normalized to citrate synthase (CS) activity in isolated mitochondria (Fig.2 A). NQR/CS ratios were decreased by 41% in HC (p < 0.050), 43% in HP (p < 0.001), and 45% in HG (p < 0.001), and NCCR/CS ratios were decreased by 40% in HC (p < 0.001), 37% in HP (p < 0.002), and 43% in HG (p < 0.001), as compared with the control human cells (Fig. 2 A). The same results were obtained normalizing NQR and NCCR activities for the amount of mitochondrial protein used, and the percentages of decrease were similar to those obtained after normalizing these activities to CS activity. SQDR, SCCR, QCCR, COX, and ATPase activities were not significantly altered in HXC. These data are consistent with an isolated complex I deficiency in the HC, HP, and HG cell lines. The GCCR/CS ratio was decreased in HP4, indicating a low glycolytic activity in this single HP clone. This observation was considered a characteristic of this particular clone because GCCR activity has been reported to be highly variable in culture cells (12Robinson B.H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. 1. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 869-888Google Scholar). The ratios between the MRC enzyme activities, are a consistent feature of oxidative phosphorylation in different cell types. SCCR/NQR, SCCR/NCCR, and SQDR/NQR ratios were significantly increased (p < 0.001) in the HXC cells as compared with human cell lines (Fig.2 B). COX/SCCR and COX/ATPase ratios were similar for all cell lines. These ratios were comparable in the parental primate cell lines and in the human cell lines. Complex I activities (NQR) in mitochondria from HXC and from human 143B and W20 cells were assessed at different concentrations of DB (ubiquinone analog) and NADH. TheV maxDB of HXC were consistently reduced as compared with the human controls (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3 A). When the [DB] was plotted versus the [DB]/NQR activity ratio (Eadie plot) the K mDB values (the x-intercept) in the HXC cells were indistinguishable from the controls (between 4.2 and 4.6 μm DB) (Fig. 3 A). TheV maxNADH of HXC were also reduced with respect to the human controls (p < 0.001) (Fig.3 B). The K mNADH calculated for 143B cells (19.8 ± 2.4) from the Eadie plot (Fig.3 B), was significantly different from theK m values for HC (62.1 ± 8.7 μm;p < 0.005), HP (62.4 ± 1.8 μm;p < 0.001) and HG (67.3 ± 9.8 μm;p < 0.008) cell lines. In conclusion, theV max for the NQR activity was reduced by about 30% with both substrates, and there was an alteration in theK m of the enzyme for NADH but not for DB. To investigate whether there were any changes in the optimal pH of the proton-donor or acceptor groups in the complex I catalytic site, a pH activity profile was constructed. Fig.3 C shows that for the three HXC clones tested, the optimal pH for the NQR activity was 8, the same as for 143B and W20 human control cell lines. To assess the effect of the complex I deficiency in respiratory rates, we studied the kinetics of the rotenone-inhibition of both, the coupled cell respiration (CR), and the pyruvate-malate oxidation in digitonin-permeabilized cells (P-Mox) (Fig. 4). Fig.4 A shows a S-shaped titration inhibition-curve for control cells, but not for HXC cells. For each cell line studied, the pattern of inhibition of both the CR and P-Mox was similar. In 143B cells, a modest inhibition (<5%) was observed at 3 nmrotenone, while in HXC cells a 15–25% inhibition was achieved at 1 nm rotenone. The K i of rotenone in each case was obtained by plotting the concentration of rotenone ([Rot])versus the ratio [Rot]/% inhibition (Fig. 4, Band C). The K i of rotenone-inhibition of both CR and P-Mox, were significantly decreased in HXC cells (respectively, 3.17 ± 0.14 and 3.21 ± 0.35 in HP; 4.23 ± 0.19 and 4.24 ± 0.15 in HC, and 5.77 ± 0.20 and 5.23 ± 0.36 in HG) as compared with 143B cells (36.69 ± 1.16 and 34.57 ± 0.53). However, using the values obtained for 143B cells after subtracting the concentration of rotenone necessary to observe a detectable inhibition (143B# in Fig. 4,B and C), the K i obtained (5.01 ± 0.12 for CR inhibition and 5.61 ± 0.20 for P-Mox) were very similar to those obtained for the HXC cells, indicating that there are no changes in rotenone affinity for its binding sites in complex I, but rather a different amount of activity susceptible to inhibition by rotenone. Immunoblots were performed using antibodies against bovine or human complex I. The antiserum against bovine I holoenzyme cross-reacted with the 75- and 49-kDa human subunits and the antiserum against bovine 75-kDa subunit recognized the human 75-kDa subunit. The complex I ND1 antibody recognized specifically the human NDI subunit, and SDH antibody was specific for the succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit (Fig.5). No discernible changes in the banding pattern were observed in mitochondria isolated from the three HXC as compared with human 143B parental cells, and common chimpanzee's fibroblasts (Fig. 5). We showed that transfer of mtDNA from apes (Gorilla andPan) into human ρ°-osteosarcoma mtDNA-less cells results in human xenomitochondrial cybrid lines which exhibit a clear defect of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, specifically localized to complex I. Because many human mitochondrial diseases result from complex I deficiencies, including Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), severe infantile lactic acidosis, various neuromuscular disorders, and possibly some neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (13Wallace D.C.

Complex I or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase is the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme with the most complex structure and the least understood mechanism of electron transfer and proton translocation. Because mammalian complex I has at least 40 subunits (16Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), seven of which are coded by the mtDNA (17Chomyn A.

In HXC, where the nuclear and the mitochondrial subunits are from evolutionary close but different genera, complex I would be a likely candidate to present alterations in assembly and/or function. HXC cells showed an approximate 20% decrease in the endogenous cell respiration rate and an approximate 40% decrease in the respiratory capacity using NAD+-linked substrates in both digitonin-permeabilized cells and i"

Thus, cloning of E. coli vacB led to overexpression of RNase R activity, and partial deletion or interruption of the cloned gene abolished this overexpression. Interruption of the chromosomal copy ofvacB eliminated endogenous RNase R activity; however, the absence of RNase R by itself had no effect on cell growth. In contrast, cells lacking both RNase R and polynucleotide phosphorylase were found to be inviable. These data indicate that RNase R participates in an essential cell function in addition to its role in virulence. The identification of the vacB gene product as RNase R should aid in understanding how the virulence phenotype in enterobacteria is expressed and regulated. On the basis of this information we propose that vacB be renamed rnr. vacB, a gene previously shown to be required for expression of virulence in Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, has been found to encode the 3′–5′ exoribonuclease, RNase R.

It is also known that strains lacking RNases II, D, BN, T, and PH in combination are inviable, but the presence of any one of the five enzymes is sufficient to confer viability, although with varying degrees of effectiveness (5Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).RNase R is one of the eight exoribonucleases.

Whereas RNase II accounts for more than 95% of the activity against poly(A) and poly(U) in crude cell extracts, the residual activity against these substrates and rRNA is due primarily to RNase R (1Deutscher M.P.

The alleles of this minisatellite fall into three broad categories with the following size range: class I, 0.4–0.9 kb; class II, 1.2 kb; and class III, >2 kb. In human fetal and adult pancreas, class I alleles are associated with higherINS mRNA levels than class III (2Bennett S.T. Lucassen A.M. Gough S.C. Powell E.E. Undlien D.E. Pritchard L.E.

In vitro, allelic effects are less clear as two studies showed higher reporter gene activity in the presence of class I alleles (13Lucassen A.M. Screaton G.R. Julier C. Elliott T.J. Lathrop M.

The discrepancy between these studies may have been due to the choice of particular class I subtype used in the constructs or to the absence of genomic context required for the effects seen in vitro.The VNTR lies 4.1 kb upstream of the first promoter of the human insulin-like growth factor II gene (16Lucassen A.M.

IGF2 encodes an important fetal mitogen that is ubiquitously expressed; the placenta and the adrenal gland contain the highest levels of IGF2 transcripts among all fetal tissues (17Han V.K.M.

Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has demonstrated immunomodulatory activity in a number of models (21Polychronakos C. Giannoukakis N. Deal C.L. Dev. Genet. 1995; 17: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is expressed by T-lymphocytes (22Vetvicka V. Fusek M. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 156: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and it has mitogenic and anti-apoptotic actions on these cells (21Polychronakos C. Giannoukakis N. Deal C.L. Dev. Genet. 1995; 17: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The expression ofIGF2 is regulated during development, and DNA sequence variants at or near the gene could conceivably affect its transcription. Primarily because of the close physical proximity ofIGF2 to the VNTR and the allelic effects of the minisatellite on the expression of the adjacent insulin gene, we have begun an investigation into the association between the VNTR andIGF2 gene expression in vivo and in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Ste-Justine Hospital, and informed consent was obtained for all tissues used.Tissue Preparation and Nucleic Acid PurificationHuman term placenta for DNA and RNA purification was obtained at the time of vaginal delivery or elective Cesaerian section. A 1 cm thick layer of placenta was first trimmed from the maternal side to ensure the removal of all the maternal decidual tissue. A narrow 0.5–1-g piece was then removed from the fetal side of the placenta, thoroughly washed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately frozen on dry ice. Peripheral blood was collected in EDTA-containing Vacutainer collection tubes. The blood was aliquoted, and the aliquots were centrifuged in a bench-top centrifuge for 10 min at 800 rpm; the cell pellet was immediately frozen.Placental DNA was recovered from phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extractions following proteinase K and RNase A digestion of the tissue. Genomic DNA was obtained from blood cell pellets and from purified mononuclear blood cells with phenol extraction at neutral pH as described (23John S.W.M. Weitzner G. Rozen R. Scriver C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 408Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Total RNA from placenta was isolated by acid guanidinium isothiocyanate followed by phenol/chloroform extraction (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

The reactions were, for the greater part and unless otherwise indicated, carried out in the presence of 1 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, 75–150 pmol of PCR primer (sense and antisense), 0.1 mm each dNTP, and commercially available buffers supplied with the thermostable DNA polymerase were used. The PCR can only amplify VNTR alleles whose products will be less than 1.5 kb, chiefly because of the large size of class II and class III alleles (greater than 1.2 kb) and the consequent increase in the GC content. All reagents were purchased from ID Labs (London, Ontario, Canada). An ammonium sulfate buffer was used in the PCR with 1 mmMgCl2 and 10% Me2SO with each dNTP at a final concentration of 1.5 mm and the supplier's Taqpolymerase. Following a heat denaturation step of 5 min at 94 °C, the PCR was performed for 30 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94 °C and 5 min at 72 °C (2Bennett S.T. Lucassen A.M. Gough S.C. Powell E.E.

Sense primer, 5′ TCAGGCTGGACCTCCAGGTGCCTGTTCTG 3′; antisense, 5′ TCGTCAGCACCTCTTCCTCAGGACCAGC 3′.In samples that suggested the presence of a class III VNTR allele (i.e. where only one class I VNTR PCR product was detected), the PstI genotype was ascertained to confirm this. The PCR was performed in the presence of 1.5 mm MgCl2for 35 cycles consisting of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The expected product size is 104 bp. Sense primer, 5′ CTCTACCAGCTGGAGAACTA 3′; antisense: 5′ GGCTGGTTCAAGGGCTTTAT 3′.The radioactive VNTR PCR products were digested with 10–30 units ofNcoI for 2–4 h at 37 °C, and the digests were electrophoresed in 6% polyacrylamide gels. The bands were visualized by autoradiography. Alternatively, we have optimized the PCR as indicated above for class I alleles to be performed in the absence of radioactive dNTP precursor, thereby allowing us to visualize the products in 1% agarose gels after ethidium bromide staining. The PCR products derived from the 3′ INS region were digested for 2–4 h at 37 °C with 10–30 units of PstI, and the digests were visualized by autoradiography following electrophoretic separation in 8% polyacrylamide minigels.cDNA Synthesis and Competitive RT-PCROne μg of total RNA in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water was heated for 3 min at 80 °C and quickly cooled on ice. A mix of either 75 pmol of antisense polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer or oligo(dT), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1.3 mm dNTP mix, 6 units of human placental RNase inhibitor (Promega), and 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the RNA. Incubation was at 37 °C for 1 h followed by heating at 80 °C for 10 min.The internal competitor standard was generated using PCR-based in vitro mutagenesis as indicated (25Forster E. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). The standard is 190 bp and consists of the identical sequence as that of the exon 9-derivedIGF2 cDNA PCR product with an internal deletion of 46 bp. The competitor PCR product was subcloned into a T-Vector (Promega) using the supplier's recommendations. Following bacterial transformation and purification using the QIAamp kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), the competitor plasmid was aliquoted in fractions of 0.01–1 × 10−6 fmol (as determined spectrophotometrically). A typical assay included equal volumes of cDNA and competitor (1 μl) of a given concentration in the same reaction. The PCR was performed using the exon 9-specificIGF2 primers indicated below, under the same PCR reaction and cycling conditions as described below.The cDNA and competitor were mixed with sense and antisense primer (75 pmol each) in the buffer supplied by Life Technologies, Inc., or in a buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm each dNTP including 1 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (NEN Life Science Products) and 2 units ofTaq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cycling parameters were described in Tadokoro et al. (26Tadokoro K. Fujii H. Inoue T. Yamada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 196967Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and consist of 30 cycles of 25 s at 94 °C, 25 s at 58 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C, followed by a final extension time of 5 min at 72 °C.

The PCR was carried out for 20 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 56.3 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. Sense primer, 5′CCCATCACCATCTTCCGA 3′; antisense: 5′CATCACGCCACAGTTTC 3′.Because of the risk of contamination of cDNA with genomic DNA during RNA isolation, we undertook different procedures to eliminate the possibility that genomic DNA would be amplified by PCR in cDNA amplifications. First, total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega), and the RNA was then recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation prior to cDNA synthesis. In addition, parallel PCR amplification of the reverse transcription (RT) reaction following incubation either with or without reverse transcriptase was routinely performed for every sample subjected to RT-PCR for the IGF2 gene. In the case ofGAPDH, DNA contamination is not troublesome since the PCR primers flank introns, and therefore DNA contamination is easily detected. The PCR products were resolved electrophoretically in 8% polyacrylamide minigels, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography.Generation of VNTR-INS-IGF2 Reporter Gene ConstructsFor a schematic diagram of all the constructs refer to Fig. 4 A. A P1 bacteriophage clone from a primary human fibroblast cell line genomic DNA library, selected by PCR primers for a segment in intron 1 of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene (MapPairs-Research Genetics Inc.), was purchased from Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The presence ofIGF2 exon 3 as revealed by PCR indicated the presence of the first promoter (P1) of IGF2 in this bacteriophage clone.A BamHI-XbaI fragment derived from purified bacteriophage cloned insert was found to contain human genomic DNA that included sequence from 5′ of a class III VNTR to the untranslated exonic DNA of the first promoter of IGF2. By restriction enzyme analysis, the class III allele was found to be approximately 3 kb. The entire genomic fragment from upstream of the VNTR to 97 bp downstream of the first IGF2 promoter was subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). This construct was termed pBL. Digestion of pBL with SalI and XbaI allowed the subcloning of this construct into pCAT-Basic (Promega), withIGF2 P1 directly upstream of the CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) reporter gene. Since P1 is primarily a post-natal liver promoter and thus less likely relevant to the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes, we also included P3, a major fetal promoter, which generates abundant 6.0-kb transcripts in placenta and in other fetal organs including lymphoid tissues. To obtain P3, a HindIII fragment of 8.0 kb from a lambda phage clone termed λhIGF2–1 graciously provided by G. I. Bell (27Bell G.I. Gerhard D.S. Fong N.M. Sanchez-Pescador R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6450-6454Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was first subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). A 1.3-kb P3 PCR product containing the P3EI and P3EII regulatory elements (28Raizis A.M. Eccles M.R. Reeve A.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 289: 133-139Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was then generated using this construct as template and the ID polymerase from ID Labs (London, Ontario, Canada) in the supplied ammonium sulfate buffer supplemented with 10% Me2SO and 1 mm MgCl2. The cycling parameters consisted of 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, after an initial incubation of 5 min at 94 °C. Sense primer, 5′ GGA TCC TCT AGA GGG CGG GCA GGG GGC TGG GGC GAG GGA C; antisense, 5′ GGA TCC TCT AGA CCG GGA CGG GAG TCA GCA GCG AGG CAG C. The P3 PCR product was ligated into the XbaI site (blunt-ended using Klenow polymerase, Life Technologies, Inc.) downstream of the P1 promoter. The final construct was termed pLCAT (long VNTR).As control, a construct without a VNTR was created. pBL was digested with EcoRI and BglII to remove the VNTR. The arms were then blunt-ended with T4 polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then religated with T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the manufacturer's buffer. This construct was termed pBN. The VNTR-less construct was excised from pBN with SalI and XbaI and was subcloned into pCAT-Basic, then the P3 fragment was added as described above. This construct was termed pNCAT (no VNTR). To generate a construct with a class I VNTR, a class I PCR product (allele 683 in arbitrary mobility units as defined by Bennett et al. (2Bennett S.T. Lucassen A.M. Gough S.C. Powell E.E. Undlien D.E. Pritchard L.E. Merriman M.E. Kawaguchi Y. Dronsfield M.J. Pociot F. Nerup J. Bouzekri N. Cambon-Thomsen A. Rønningen K.S. Barnett A.H. Bain S.C. Todd J.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar)) was subcloned into pNCAT in the HindIII (polylinker) site which was blunt-ended. Two new constructs were thus obtained: pSCAT-S, in which the orientation of the VNTR is in the natural context of theINS-IGF2 locus, and pSCAT-AS, where the VNTR is in the opposite (antisense) orientation.The authenticity and directionality of all the constructs was verified by restriction enzyme analysis, and the VNTR alleles were confirmed by sequencing.Transient Transfection AssaysTo assess the in vitro effects of the VNTR on IGF2 P3-based transcription of CAT, the P3-based constructs were introduced into the HepG2 hepatoma cell line (ATCC HB-8065, Rockville, MD) which expresses endogenous IGF2 primarily from P3 (29Rodenburg R.J.T. Teertstra W. Holthuizen P.E. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 424-434PubMed Google Scholar). 8 × 105 cells in 35-cm2 multiwell dishes in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) were cotransfected with 3 μg of each CAT construct and with 1 μg of pSVβ (a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase, Promega) using a cationic liposome formulation (Lipofectin, Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following a 5-h incubation, the cells were refed with minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Following this incubation, the cells were washed in PBS, and a lysate was prepared for CAT and β-galactosidase assays described below, using a commercial kit (Promega).The CAT assay was performed using a commercially available kit according to the instructions (Promega). The reaction product (n-butyryl [14C]chloramphenicol) was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. To assess β-galactosidase activity, the cell lysate was incubated with a synthetic substrate supplied in a commercially available kit, and all the procedures of the supplier were followed (Promega). The end point measured was the spectroscopic analysis of the absorbance of the converted substrate at 420 nm. CAT activity was based on the counts/min obtained following scintillation counting and corrected for β-galactosidase activity.Calculations/StatisticsDifferences in IGF2expression among placentae (in the competitive RT-PCR assay) were determined as the ratio (in arbitrary units) of the intensity of the specific 236-bp IGF2 PCR product to the intensity of the internal competitor standard (30Siebert P.D. Larrick J.W. Nature. 1992; 359: 557-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), normalized to the intensity of theGAPDH PCR product. Statistical significance of the results was evaluated by the Mann-Whitney U test for the in vivo studies in placentae and by a two-way analysis of variance for the transient transfection studies, followed by multiple comparisons using Fisher's Protected Least Significant Difference.DISCUSSIONOur results demonstrate that VNTR alleles are associated with differences in IGF2 mRNA levels in human placenta, similar to those already demonstrated for INS in fetal and adult pancreas (2Bennett S.T. Lucassen A.M. Gough S.C. Powell E.E. Undlien D.E. Pritchard L.E. Merriman M.E. Kawaguchi Y. Dronsfield M.J. Pociot F. Nerup J. Bouzekri N. Cambon-Thomsen A. Rønningen K.S. Barnett A.H. Bain S.C. Todd J.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 12Vafiadis P. Bennett S.T. Colle E. Grabs R. Goodyer C.G. Polychronakos C. J. Autoimmun. 1996; 9: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Previous in vivo studies in fetal thymus showed that the VNTR effect on INS transcription is tissue-specific and opposite to that in fetal pancreas (3Vafiadis P. Bennett S.T. Todd J.A. Nadeau J. Grabs R. Goodyer C.G. Wickramasinghe S. Colle E. Polychronakos C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), the effect being much more subtle in the pancreas compared with that in the thymus. More recent in vivo studies in fetal pancreas and thymus (34Vafiadis P. Grabs R. Goodyer C.G. Colle E. Polychronakos C. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) did not reveal a transcriptional effect of the VNTR onIGF2 such as we saw in placenta; however, whether this reflects a tissue or developmental stage specificity of VNTR action is not known. Our in vitro data suggest hepatocytes as another transcriptional environment in which VNTR alleles modulateIGF2 expression. Additionally, the effects, if any, of the VNTR on the postnatal expression of IGF2 as well as its association with human disease in addition to type 1 diabetes remain open for future investigation. It is interesting to note, however, that there appears to be a significant genetic contribution to the interindividual variability of circulating IGF-II levels in humans (35Harrela M. Koistinen H. Kaprio J. Lehtovirta M. Tupmilehto J. Erikkson J. Toivanen L. Koskenvuo M. Leinonen P. Koistinen R. Seppala M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2612-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Type 1 diabetes (previously referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or IDDM) is an autoimmune disorder culminating in the destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. The disorder is of a multifactorial nature with a significant polygenic component in the susceptibility (36Todd J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8560-8565Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The INS VNTR minisatellite is 1 of 16 mapped type 1 diabetes susceptibility loci and has been designatedIDDM2, where the class I alleles are associated with susceptibility and the class III with protection (2Bennett S.T. Lucassen A.M. Gough S.C. Powell E.E. Undlien D.E. Pritchard L.E. Merriman M.E. Kawaguchi Y. Dronsfield M.J. Pociot F. Nerup J. Bouzekri N. Cambon-Thomsen A. Rønningen K.S. Barnett A.H. Bain S.C.

Genet. 1993; 4: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The preferential paternal transmission of susceptibility haplotypes atIDDM2 in some populations studied suggests the involvement of an imprinted gene in the predisposition to type 1 diabetes that could lie at or near the VNTR, which may be under its transcriptional effects (2Bennett S.T. Lucassen A.M. Gough S.C. Powell E.E. Undlien D.E. Pritchard L.E. Merriman M.E. Kawaguchi Y. Dronsfield M.J. Pociot F. Nerup J. Bouzekri N. Cambon-Thomsen A. Rønningen K.S. Barnett A.H. Bain S.C.

An obvious human imprinted gene that could be a candidate for allelic effects of the VNTR is IGF2, because of its imprinted status (expressed from paternal chromosomes in most tissues studied) (31Giannoukakis N.

The in vitro effects of the VNTR on IGF2 P3-driven CAT expression parallel those demonstrated in the study of Lucassen et al. (13Lucassen A.M. Screaton G.R. Julier C. Elliott T.J. Lathrop M.

https://openalex.org/W2029037289,"Transcriptional activation by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is regulated by both glucocorticoid binding and phosphorylation. The rat GR N-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain contains four major phosphorylation sites: threonine 171 (Thr171), serine 224 (Ser224), serine 232 (Ser232), and serine 246 (Ser246). We have previously demonstrated that Ser224 and Ser232are phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases, while Ser246 is phosphorylated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. We report here that the remaining GR phosphorylation site, Thr171, is a target for glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)in vitro and in cultured mammalian cells. Increasing GSK-3 activity through its overexpression in cultured cells inhibits GR transcriptional enhancement, an effect dependent upon Thr171. Correspondingly, overexpression of a constitutively active form of the GSK-3 inhibitor, protein kinase B/Akt, increases GR transcriptional enhancement. Overexpression of GSK-3 had no effect on GR-mediated transcriptional repression of AP1-dependent gene expression. Importantly, transcriptional activation by the human GR (hGR), which contains an alanine (Ala150) at the position equivalent to Thr171 in rat GR, is not affected by GSK-3 overexpression. Introduction of a threonine residue at this position (A150T) establishes GSK-3-mediated inhibition of hGR transcriptional activation. These findings demonstrate species-specific differences in GR signaling, as revealed through GSK-3 phosphorylation, which suggests that GR function in rodents may not fully recapitulate receptor action in humans and that hGR is capable of adopting the GSK-3 signaling pathway through a somatic mutation. Transcriptional activation by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is regulated by both glucocorticoid binding and phosphorylation.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Upon glucocorticoid binding, GR enters the nucleus, associates with specific DNA sequences termed glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), and increases transcriptional initiation from nearby promoters. GR can also repress transcription mediated by the heterodimeric AP1 transcription factor complex (c-Jun and c-Fos) (2Miner J.N. Diamond M.I. Yamamoto K.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 525-530PubMed Google Scholar). Although glucocorticoids act as the primary signal in activating GR's transcriptional regulatory functions, GR-mediated transcriptional activation is also modulated by phosphorylation (3Bodwell J.E. Hu J.M. Orti E. Munck A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Garabedian M.J. Rogatsky I. Hittelman A. Knoblauch R. Trowbridge J.M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 231-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Rat GR isolated from cultured mammalian cells or ectopically expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is phosphorylated on four major residues (6Krstic M.D. Functional Analysis of Glucocorticoid Receptor Phosphorylation. University of California, San Francisco, CA1995Google Scholar). These sites cluster to the N-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain and include threonine 171 (Thr171), serine 224 (Ser224), serine 232 (Ser232), and serine 246 (Ser246) (Fig.1 A). Each of these residues is followed by a proline, thereby forming a motif phosphorylated by a family of serine/threonine-proline-directed kinases that includes the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), the mitogen-activated protein kinases, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Differential phosphorylation at these sites both positively and negatively regulate GR transcriptional activation. Positive regulation is accomplished by cyclin-Cdk complexes: cyclin E-Cdk2 phosphorylates Ser224, while cyclin A-Cdk2 phosphorylates both Ser224 and Ser232. Mutations at these sites, or of particular Cdk genes in yeast, reduce GR-dependent transcriptional activation, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser224 and Ser232 is required for full GR transcriptional enhancement (7Krstic M.D. Rogatsky I. Yamamoto K.R. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3947-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser246 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinases family, inhibits GR transcriptional activation (8Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).The remaining GR phosphorylation site, Thr171, also resides in a motif recognized by serine/threonine-proline-directed kinases. However, our previous studies indicate that neither the Cdks, nor c-Jun N-terminal kinase efficiently phosphorylate Thr171 in vitro. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Thr171 is evident in both serum-deprived quiescent and serum-stimulated proliferating cells (8Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), suggesting that Cdks and c-Jun N-terminal kinase are unlikely to phosphorylate Thr171 in vivo, since these kinases are largely inactive in serum-starved, nonproliferating cells. GSK-3, on the other hand, is active throughout the cell cycle, as well as in serum-deprived cells (9Woodgett J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 177-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, GSK-3 may represent the GR kinase that phosphorylates Thr171.GSK-3 was originally isolated as the kinase that phosphorylates glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycogen synthesis (10Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Two mammalian GSK-3 isoforms have been identified (GSK-3α and GSK-3β) that are 85% homologous at the level of primary amino acid sequence, and share substrate specificity (11Welsh G.I. Wilson C. Proud C.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 274-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).

GSK-3 enzymatic activity is, however, negatively regulated by protein kinase B/Akt, an enzyme that phosphorylates and inhibits GSK-3 (24Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). Akt is, in turn, activated through an association with lipid products generated by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase at the cell membrane and through phosphorylation (25Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R.

Recently, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-Akt pathway has been implicated in cell survival, with a constitutively activated form of Akt leading to a reduction in apoptosis in neuronal cells (30Dudek H.

Here we examine whether rat GR is a substrate for GSK-3in vitro and investigate the consequences of GSK-3 activation and inhibition on GR transcriptional regulation in cultured mammalian cells.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that GSK-3 phosphorylates the rat GR at Thr171 in vitro. In cultured mammalian cells, overexpression of GSK-3 inhibits GR transcriptional activation, while decreasing GSK-3 activity, through expression of the GSK-3 inhibitor, Akt, increases GR transcriptional enhancement. GR-mediated repression of AP1-dependent transcriptional activity, however, was not affected by GSK-3 overexpression. A threonine to alanine mutation at Thr171, the site of rat GR phosphorylation by GSK-3in vitro, eliminates the effect of GSK-3 on rat GR transcriptional enhancement. Although the effect of GSK-3 overexpression on GR-mediated transcriptional activation was relatively modest (∼50%), this likely represents an underestimate of the impact of GSK-3 on GR, since the studies were performed in cell lines containing active endogenous GSK-3. Our in vitrophosphorylation and mapping studies, coupled with activity assays using GR mutants, strongly suggest that GSK-3 phosphorylates rat GR at Thr171, and as a consequence, reduces GR transcriptional activation.The mechanism by which GSK-3 phosphorylation of Thr171decreases GR transcriptional activity is unclear. GSK-3 phosphorylates and inactivates other regulatory factors including c-Myc, c-Jun, NF-ATc, and β-catenin. Although the mechanism of c-Myc and c-Jun inactivation by GSK-3 phosphorylation is unknown, GSK-3 phosphorylation of β-catenin targets it for degradation (45Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 46Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar), while GSK-3 phosphorylation of NF-ATc promotes its export from the nucleus (47Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). It is doubtful, however, that either of these established mechanisms explain GSK-3 regulation of GR, since 1) neither GSK-3 nor Akt overexpression alter steady state GR protein levels, and 2) increased export of GR from the nucleus would also affect GR-dependent transcriptional repression, which has not been observed in our experiments. Alternatively, GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of rat GR at Thr171 may disrupt protein-protein interactions that favor GR transcriptional enhancement, or recruit inhibitory proteins that antagonize GR-dependent transcriptional activation, hypotheses that are currently being tested.Given the high degree of conservation between GRs from different species, it is particularly striking that the hGR does not contain a site of GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation, thereby making hGR insensitive to GSK-3 overexpression. However, when an alanine residue at the position homologous to Thr171 in rat GR is replaced with a threonine, transcriptional activation by the hGR A150T mutant becomes sensitive to GSK-3 overexpression. Sequence comparison between GRs isolated from different species shows that the primary amino acid sequence surrounding and including rat GR Thr171 (residues 164 through 173) is conserved among rodents, including rat, mouse, and guinea pig (40Miesfeld R.

The equivalent region from human, squirrel monkey, owl monkey, and cotton-top tamarin GR remains conserved among primates, but has diverged from rodents (42Hollenberg S.M. Weinberger C. Ong E.S.

Why this region of GR has diverged between primates and rodents, while the other major phosphorylation sites (Ser224, Ser232, and Ser246) are conserved remains unclear, but likely reflects alternative strategies adopted by each species to regulate GR action.The differences in GR primary amino acid structure and signaling between rodents and humans may contribute to the greater sensitivity of murine lymphocytes to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis relative to human cells. It is conceivable that GSK-3-mediated inhibition of GR transcriptional activation in rodents results in the reduced expression of a putative survival factor induced by GR. Recently, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 has been shown to be a GR-responsive gene (49Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3181-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 50Ramalingam A. Hirai A. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Cha H.H. Cram E.J.

Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Thus, p21 expression protects cells from apoptosis, and as such, can be considered a survival factor. It is tempting to speculate that inhibition of GR by GSK-3, and the subsequent lack of p21 induction, may facilitate apoptosis in murine but not human lymphocytes. It would be interesting to replace mouse GR with that of the human GR in vivo and examine whether the glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of murine lymphocytes expressing hGR still occurs. We speculate further that a threonine at position 150 in hGR would result in greater glucocorticoid sensitivity compared with an alanine at this position.Our findings demonstrate species-specific differences in human and rat GR signaling, which suggest that studies on GR function in mice and rats may not fully translate into hGR activity. In addition, our results indicate that hGR is capable of adopting the GSK-3 signaling pathway through a somatic mutation, which antagonizes hGR-dependent transcriptional activation. It would be informative to examine whether alanine to threonine substitutions at residue 150 in hGR are present in glucocorticoid-sensitive, but absent in glucocorticoid-resistant, malignancies. Glucocorticoid hormones control cellular proliferation and metabolism through their association with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; hGR, human GR; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinases; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; ER, estrogen receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; hGR, human GR; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinases; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; ER, estrogen receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; wt, wild type. a member of the intracellular receptor superfamily of transcriptional regulatory proteins (1Yamamoto K.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Upon glucocorticoid binding, GR enters the nucleus, associates with specific DNA sequences termed glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), and increases transcriptional initiation from nearby promoters. GR can also repress transcription mediated by the heterodimeric AP1 transcription factor complex (c-Jun and c-Fos) (2Miner J.N. Diamond M.I. Yamamoto K.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 525-530PubMed Google Scholar). Although glucocorticoids act as the primary signal in activating GR's transcriptional regulatory functions, GR-mediated transcriptional activation is also modulated by phosphorylation (3Bodwell J.E. Hu J.M. Orti E. Munck A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Garabedian M.J. Rogatsky I. Hittelman A. Knoblauch R. Trowbridge J.M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 231-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat GR isolated from cultured mammalian cells or ectopically expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is phosphorylated on four major residues (6Krstic M.D. Functional Analysis of Glucocorticoid Receptor Phosphorylation. University of California, San Francisco, CA1995Google Scholar). These sites cluster to the N-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain and include threonine 171 (Thr171), serine 224 (Ser224), serine 232 (Ser232), and serine 246 (Ser246) (Fig.1 A). Each of these residues is followed by a proline, thereby forming a motif phosphorylated by a family of serine/threonine-proline-directed kinases that includes the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), the mitogen-activated protein kinases, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Differential phosphorylation at these sites both positively and negatively regulate GR transcriptional activation. Positive regulation is accomplished by cyclin-Cdk complexes: cyclin E-Cdk2 phosphorylates Ser224, while cyclin A-Cdk2 phosphorylates both Ser224 and Ser232. Mutations at these sites, or of particular Cdk genes in yeast, reduce GR-dependent transcriptional activation, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser224 and Ser232 is required for full GR transcriptional enhancement (7Krstic M.D. Rogatsky I. Yamamoto K.R. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3947-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser246 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinases family, inhibits GR transcriptional activation (8Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The remaining GR phosphorylation site, Thr171, also resides in a motif recognized by serine/threonine-proline-directed kinases. However, our previous studies indicate that neither the Cdks, nor c-Jun N-terminal kinase efficiently phosphorylate Thr171 in vitro. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Thr171 is evident in both serum-deprived quiescent and serum-stimulated proliferating cells (8Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), suggesting that Cdks and c-Jun N-terminal kinase are unlikely to phosphorylate Thr171 in vivo, since these kinases are largely inactive in serum-starved, nonproliferating cells. GSK-3, on the other hand, is active throughout the cell cycle, as well as in serum-deprived cells (9Woodgett J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 177-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, GSK-3 may represent the GR kinase that phosphorylates Thr171. GSK-3 was originally isolated as the kinase that phosphorylates glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycogen synthesis (10Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R.

Why this region of GR has diverged between primates and rodents, while the other major phosphorylation sites (Ser224, Ser232, and Ser246) are conserved remains unclear, but likely reflects alternative strategies adopted by each species to regulate GR action.The differences in GR primary amino acid structure and signaling between rodents and humans may contribute to the greater sensitivity of murine lymphocytes to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis relative to human cells. It is conceivable that GSK-3-mediated inhibition of GR transcriptional activation in rodents results in the reduced expression of a putative survival factor induced by GR. Recently, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 has been shown to be a GR-responsive gene (49Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3181-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 50Ramalingam A. Hirai A. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Cha H.H. Cram E.J.

Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Thus, p21 expression protects cells from apoptosis, and as such, can be considered a survival factor. It is tempting to speculate that inhibition of GR by GSK-3, and the subsequent lack of p21 induction, may facilitate apoptosis in murine but not human lymphocytes. It would be interesting to replace mouse GR with that of the human GR in vivo and examine whether the glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of murine lymphocytes expressing hGR still occurs. We speculate further that a threonine at position 150 in hGR would result in greater glucocorticoid sensitivity compared with an alanine at this position.Our findings demonstrate species-specific differences in human and rat GR signaling, which suggest that studies on GR function in mice and rats may not fully translate into hGR activity. In addition, our results indicate that hGR is capable of adopting the GSK-3 signaling pathway through a somatic mutation, which antagonizes hGR-dependent transcriptional activation. It would be informative to examine whether alanine to threonine substitutions at residue 150 in hGR are present in glucocorticoid-sensitive, but absent in glucocorticoid-resistant, malignancies. We have demonstrated that GSK-3 phosphorylates the rat GR at Thr171 in vitro. In cultured mammalian cells, overexpression of GSK-3 inhibits GR transcriptional activation, while decreasing GSK-3 activity, through expression of the GSK-3 inhibitor, Akt, increases GR transcriptional enhancement. GR-mediated repression of AP1-dependent transcriptional activity, however, was not affected by GSK-3 overexpression. A threonine to alanine mutation at Thr171, the site of rat GR phosphorylation by GSK-3in vitro, eliminates the effect of GSK-3 on rat GR transcriptional enhancement. Although the effect of GSK-3 overexpression on GR-mediated transcriptional activation was relatively modest (∼50%), this likely represents an underestimate of the impact of GSK-3 on GR, since the studies were performed in cell lines containing active endogenous GSK-3. Our in vitrophosphorylation and mapping studies, coupled with activity assays using GR mutants, strongly suggest that GSK-3 phosphorylates rat GR at Thr171, and as a consequence, reduces GR transcriptional activation. The mechanism by which GSK-3 phosphorylation of Thr171decreases GR transcriptional activity is unclear. GSK-3 phosphorylates and inactivates other regulatory factors including c-Myc, c-Jun, NF-ATc, and β-catenin. Although the mechanism of c-Myc and c-Jun inactivation by GSK-3 phosphorylation is unknown, GSK-3 phosphorylation of β-catenin targets it for degradation (45Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 46Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar), while GSK-3 phosphorylation of NF-ATc promotes its export from the nucleus (47Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). It is doubtful, however, that either of these established mechanisms explain GSK-3 regulation of GR, since 1) neither GSK-3 nor Akt overexpression alter steady state GR protein levels, and 2) increased export of GR from the nucleus would also affect GR-dependent transcriptional repression, which has not been observed in our experiments. Alternatively, GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of rat GR at Thr171 may disrupt protein-protein interactions that favor GR transcriptional enhancement, or recruit inhibitory proteins that antagonize GR-dependent transcriptional activation, hypotheses that are currently being tested. Given the high degree of conservation between GRs from different species, it is particularly striking that the hGR does not contain a site of GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation, thereby making hGR insensitive to GSK-3 overexpression. However, when an alanine residue at the position homologous to Thr171 in rat GR is replaced with a threonine, transcriptional activation by the hGR A150T mutant becomes sensitive to GSK-3 overexpression. Sequence comparison between GRs isolated from different species shows that the primary amino acid sequence surrounding and including rat GR Thr171 (residues 164 through 173) is conserved among rodents, including rat, mouse, and guinea pig (40Miesfeld R.

Here we describe the identification, cloning, and characterization of a new isoform of Pyk2 (Pyk2-H) that is generated by alternative RNA splicing. Pyk2-H is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells including T-cells, B-cells, and natural killer cells. Engagement of T-cell or B-cell antigen receptors leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2-H. Pyk2-H is also activated in response to the chemokines RANTES and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β in T cells. In addition, we show that glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the carboxyl termini of Pyk2 and Pyk2-H bind to a different set of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in thymus lysates. Specific expression of Pyk2-H and its activation by antigens or chemokines in hematopoietic cells may contribute toward the generation of cell type-specific signals involved in host immune responses.

In this report we describe the identification, cloning, and initial characterization of an isoform of Pyk2, that is generated by alternative RNA splicing, and is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells (Pyk2-H). Using isoform-specific anti-Pyk2 antibodies we show that Pyk2-H is expressed in primary T and B lymphocytes and in natural killer cells. We demonstrate that Pyk2-H and not Pyk2 is rapidly activated in response to stimulation with chemokines and following activation of the T-cell or B-cell antigen receptors suggesting a potential role in host immune responses.

Precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (number 72), anti-paxillin and anti-p130Cas antibodies. p105Hef-1 and p130Cas were immunoprecipitated from thymus lysates with anti-p130Cas antibodies (IP Cas) or without antibodies (−) and immunoblotted with anti-p130Casantibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For exogenous substrate phosphorylation, equal amounts of Pyk2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from 293T cells transiently transfected with vector alone (pRK5) or vector containing Pyk2 or Pyk2-H. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2), and incubated with 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μg of poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 3 × sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and resolved on 7% SDS-PAGE gels. Fold increase in phosphorylation of poly(Glu-Tyr) was determined by quantitation with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphoImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For identification of autophosphorylation sites, 293T cells were transiently transfected with pRK5 containing Pyk2, Pyk2-H, or mutant forms in which tyrosine 402 was replaced with phenylalanine (Pyk2-Y402F and Pyk2-H-Y402). The immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 7 min at room temperature. 32P-Labeled autophosphorylated Pyk2 or Pyk2-H proteins were digested with trypsin and labeled peptides were separated on a reverse-phase HPLC column as described previously (17Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and 32P radioactivity was analyzed with a β-counter. cDNAs of murine brain and thymus tissues were used to amplify PCR products with pairs of oligonucleotides corresponding to the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal regions of Pyk2 (ATGTCTGGGGTGTCCGAGC and ATCTTCACGGGCAATGCCA for the amino terminus; AGTGACGTTTATCAGATG and TCACTCTGCAGGTGGGTG for the carboxyl-terminal domain of Pyk2). The PCR was performed under following conditions: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles and extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were subcloned in the TA vector and analyzed by DNA sequencing. The mutagenic oligonucleotide (CCAAAGCTGCAGTTCCAGGAGGAGGACTTCATCCAAC) and the trans-oligonucleotide (GAATTCGATATCACGCGTGGCCGCCATGGC) were used to delete 126 base pairs of Pyk2 using a CLONTECH kit. The deletion was confirmed by DNA sequencing. In order to obtain exon-intron boundaries around the spliced exon, a mouse genomic clone of Pyk2 (P1) was subjected to the long range PCR using the following oligonucleotides (CCAAAGCTGCAGTTCCAG and ACACAGACCCTCAGGAAC for cloning of the preceding intron; AAACGCCACAGCATGCGG and TTGGATGAAGTCCTCCTC for cloning of the succeeding intron) according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Perkin-Elmer). The mutagenic oligonucleotide (GAGTCAGACATTCTTCGCAGAGATTCC) and the trans-oligonucleotide (GAATTCGATATCACGCGTTGGCCGCCATGGC) were used to convert tyrosine 402 to phenylalanine of Pyk2-H using the In Vitro MutagenesisCLONTECH kit. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Site-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies against synthetic peptides from Pyk2 or against GST fusion proteins containing different domains of Pyk2 have been generated (Fig.1 A). All our anti-Pyk2 antibodies were specific for Pyk2 and did not recognize the related protein tyrosine kinase FAK (data not shown). In our attempt to study Pyk2 functions, Pyk2 was subjected to immunoprecipitation from lysates of mouse brain, spleen, thymus, and other tissues with anti-Pyk2 antibodies (number 600) followed by SDS-PAGE analysis, Commassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1 B), or by immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize the kinase domain of Pyk2 (Fig. 1,C and D). Pyk2 immunoprecipitated from hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cortex, diencephalon, as well as other brain tissues migrates in SDS-PAGE gels with an apparent molecular weight of 110,000 (Fig. 1 B). However, Pyk2 immunoprecipitated from lysates from spleen or thymus tissues migrates in the SDS gel as a doublet in which the major band has an apparent molecular weight of 106,000 and the minor band of 110,000 (Fig.1 C). In addition, the presence of p106 and p110 Pyk2 forms was also observed in liver (two forms of Pyk2 in liver and thymus are clearly seen in the shorter exposure) and to a lesser extend in heart and lung (Fig. 1 D). These results suggest the presence of different Pyk2 isoforms, differential phosphorylation of Pyk2, or degradation products in the spleen and thymus, as compared with Pyk2 expressed in neuronal cells. In order to avoid possible proteolysis and to test whether the two forms of Pyk2 present in spleen and thymus are due to differences in phosphorylation state, we have included several inhibitors against the broad spectrum of proteases (Protease inhibitors set, Boehringer Mannheim) in our lysis buffer and have subjected immunoprecipitated Pyk2 from spleen and thymus to dephosphorylation with either alkaline or potato phosphatases, respectively. However, these treatments did not affect the pattern of Pyk2 migration in SDS-PAGE gels (data not shown), suggesting that the two forms of Pyk2 are probably different Pyk2 isoforms present in spleen and thymus. In order to identify the nature of the hematopoietic Pyk2 isoform, cDNAs were prepared from murine brain or thymus mRNAs and used in PCR with pairs of oligonucleotides corresponding to the non-catalytic amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of Pyk2 (Fig.2 A). The primers corresponding to the amino-terminal region of Pyk2 gave an identical PCR product when the reaction was performed with cDNA from thymus or brain tissues (Fig. 2 A). However, the major PCR product observed using the carboxyl-terminal primers and cDNA from thymus as a template was smaller by approximately 120 base pairs from the PCR reaction products obtained with identical primers on brain cDNA or when Pyk2 cDNA was used as a template (Fig. 2 A). In addition, a small amount of full size product was also detected in the PCR reaction with 3′ primers with thymus cDNA (Fig. 2 A). This is consistent with the relative abundance of the p106 Pyk2 isoformversus the full size p110 Pyk2 that were detected by immunoprecipitation analysis of lysates from thymus (Fig.1 C). Deduced amino acid sequences of the reaction products indicates that the short PCR product represents an in-frame deletion of 126 base pairs which eliminates 42 amino acid from the proline-rich region of Pyk2. Fig. 2 B shows a comparison of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the proline-rich region of Pyk2 and of the shorter proline-rich region of the Pyk2 isoform cloned from thymus cDNA. To confirm that the shorter form of Pyk2 is generated by alternative RNA splicing, we have cloned the corresponding genomic regions of murine Pyk2. The exon that is spliced out (126 base pairs) in the shorter form of Pyk2 is preceded by a 2.2-kilobase intron and followed by a 4.8-kilobase intron in the mouse Pyk2 gene (Fig.2 C). Since the shorter form of Pyk2 was cloned from and is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues this form was named Pyk2-H. In order to compare and analyze the properties of Pyk2 and Pyk2-H proteins we have raised rabbit polyclonal antisera against a GST fusion protein containing the amino acid sequence corresponding to the exon that is spliced out from Pyk2 to generate Pyk2-H (number 638). 293T cells were transiently transfected with mammalian vectors containing the Pyk2 or Pyk2-H genes in human embryonic 293T cells. Lysates from the transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antisera numbers 638 or 600 followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies number 623, that recognize both Pyk2 and Pyk2-H (Fig.3 A). Antisera number 638 recognizes Pyk2, but not Pyk2-H, while antisera 600 immunoprecipitated both Pyk2 and Pyk2-H from transfected 293 cells, indicating that these antisera recognize the Pyk2, but not the Pyk2-H isoform. We next compared the pattern of Pyk2 and Pyk2-H protein expression in the thymus and spleen by using isoform-specific 638 antibodies that could distinguish Pyk2 from Pyk2-H, or number 600 antibodies that recognize both isoforms. Lysates from murine brain, spleen, and thymus were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antisera 638 or with antisera 600 followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies number 623 (Fig. 3 B). Similar amounts of Pyk2 were immunoprecipitated from brain lysates with either antibodies 600 or 638, while expression of Pyk2-H was approximately 10-fold higher than expression of Pyk2 in the spleen and thymus (Fig. 3 B). To test whether Pyk2 and Pyk2-H are co-expressed in the same cell or whether each isoform is present in a different cell type present in these tissues, we explored the expression pattern of Pyk2 and Pyk2-H in various hematopoietic cell types by using the same immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting strategy. We found that Pyk2-H is expressed in T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, while Pyk2 is expressed in platelets, mast/basophilic cell line (RBL), megakaryocytic (CHRF), and erythroleukemic cell lines (Mo7, K562) (Fig. 3 C). Both Pyk2 and Pyk2-H are present in human T-cells leukemia Jurkat cells and human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells (Fig. 3 C). Given the fact that Pyk2-H is present in primary T and B cells we further tested whether Pyk2-H participates in signaling pathways that are part of the host immune response, such as antigen and chemokine receptors signaling pathways. We have therefore examined the status of Pyk2-H phosphorylation in response to antigens and inflammatory cytokines in primary hematopoietic cells. Murine B cells were stimulated with goat anti-mouse IgM (50 μg/ml) and anti-goat IgG antibodies. The stimulated cells were lysed, subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Pyk2 antibodies (numbers 600 or 638) followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against phosphotyrosine or anti-Pyk2 (number 623). Murine thymocytes were stimulated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies for 5 min at 37 °C, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Pyk2 antibodies (numbers 600 and 638). The precipitates were resolved on 7% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or anti-Pyk2 (number 623) antibodies. The experiment presented in Fig.4 A shows that activation of T-cell or B-cell antigen receptors leads to a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2-H (Fig. 4 A). This experiment also confirms that Pyk2-H and not Pyk2 is exclusively expressed in murine thymocytes and B cells (Fig. 4 A). We have previously observed that stimulation of chemokine receptors by HIV envelope proteins or chemokines leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 in several hematopoietic cells (12Davis C. Dikic I. Unutmaz D. Hill C.M. Arthos J. Siani M. Thompson D.A. Schlessinger J. Littman D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether activation of chemokine receptors in the human T cell line (DU6) leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Pyk2-H. DU6 cells were stimulated with 0.5 μm RANTES and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β for 30 s, lysed, and subjected to the same immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting procedures. Immunoprecipitated Pyk2-H is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation of DU6 cells by chemokines (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that in primary T and B cells Pyk2-H is activated upon engagement of chemokine and antigen receptors (Fig. 4,A and B). Since it has been observed that deletions in the carboxyl-terminal domain of Pyk2 might lead to changes in enzyme activity (18Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we further examined whether structural changes in the carboxyl terminus of Pyk2-H might have altered activation of this kinase as compared with kinase activity of Pyk2. We have comparedin vitro kinase activities of Pyk2 and Pyk2-H toward the exogenous substrate (poly(Glu-Tyr)) or by measuring phosphorylation of tyrosine 402, a major autophosphorylation site of Pyk2. Immunoprecipitated Pyk2-H and Pyk2 were subjected to in vitro kinase reaction, run to SDS-PAGE gels, and intensity of32P-labeled poly(Glu-Tyr) were compared. The experiments show that Pyk2-H and Pyk2 exhibit similar in vitro catalytic activities, measured by in vitro phosphorylation of poly(Glu-Tyr) (Fig. 5 A). In order to compare the autophosphorylation sites of Pyk2 and Pyk2-H we have subjected the 32P-labeled autophosphorylated Pyk2-H, Pyk2, or their mutant forms where tyrosine 402 was mutated to phenylalanine (Pyk2-H-Y402F and Pyk2-Y402F) to a tryptic digest followed by separation using reverse-phase HPLC. Three phosphorylated peptides were detected in preparations of Pyk2-H and Pyk2. Phosphorylated peptides obtained from Pyk2-H-Y402F and Pyk2-Y402F proteins have only two peaks, suggesting that the first peak observed in Pyk2-H or Pyk2 separations corresponds to peptide containing autophosphorylated tyrosine 402. Given the fact that more than 80% of labeled 32P was incorporated in that single peptide in both Pyk2 and Pyk2-H preparations, we concluded that tyrosine 402 is a major autophosphorylation site of Pyk2-H and Pyk2. Together, these results suggest that structural changes in the carboxyl terminus of Pyk2 did not have a major affect on the kinase activity of Pyk2-H. The carboxyl-terminal domain of Pyk2 contains two proline-rich regions that could be responsible for binding to proteins containing SH3 or WW domains (2Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Given the fact that half of the first proline-rich region is deleted by a splicing event in Pyk2-H (Fig. 2 A), we further examined whether this region could mediate specific interactions of Pyk2 with different cellular proteins. In order to screen for proteins that could bind differently to Pyk2 or Pyk2-H, the carboxyl termini of Pyk2 and Pyk2-H or the exon that is spliced out in Pyk2-H were expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 6 A) and used to precipitate proteins from thymus lysates. The precipitates were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The region encoded by the exon that is spliced out in Pyk2-H recognized similar pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to those recognized by GST alone (Fig. 6 B). Analysis of precipitated proteins with GST fusion proteins containing the entire carboxyl termini of Pyk2 or Pyk2-H has revealed several common tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with molecular mass of 62–70 kDa and a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of approximately 115 kDa that bind specifically to the carboxyl terminus of Pyk2 but not to the carboxyl terminus of Pyk2-H (Fig.6 B). Using specific antibodies we demonstrate that paxillin is the 62–70-kDa associated protein with Pyk2 and Pyk2-H (Fig.6 B). A weak association of p130Cas with Pyk2 was previously shown in B cells (11Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the possibility whether tyrosine-phosphorylated p115 could be p105Hef1 or p130Cas. By using anti-Cas antibodies that recognize both p105Hef1 and p130Cas (Fig. 6 B) we could not detect p130Cas or p105Hef-1 that co-precipitated with the carboxyl termini of both Pyk2 or Pyk2-H in thymus lysates, suggesting that tyrosine-phosphorylated associated p115 protein is distinct from p105Hef1 or p130Cas(Fig. 6 C). We therefore conclude that the carboxyl termini of Pyk2-H and Pyk2 bind both common and unique target proteins in lysates from activated thymus cells. In this report, we describe identification and cloning of a novel Pyk2 isoform that is generated by alternative RNA splicing in the carboxyl terminus of Pyk2. Pyk2-H is mainly expressed in hematopoietic tissues and cells, with the highest expression in lysates of the spleen and thymus, where immunoprecipitated Pyk2-H could be detected by Commassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1 B). In addition, expression of Pyk2-H appears to be restricted to specific hematopoietic cells, such as thymocytes, B cells, and natural killer cells, while Pyk2 is present in platelets, megakaryocytes, mast cells, and neuronal cells. We have also observed the presence of Pyk2-H in the heart, liver, and lung, although to a much lower level than in the thymus and spleen. Since the liver, heart, and lung contain blood and since several cell lines derived from these organs express either only Pyk2 or neither of the Pyk2 isoforms (data not shown) we believe that Pyk2-H detected in immunoprecipitates from these organs is most likely due to circulating hematopoietic cells, rather than specific cells of these tissues. Since the expression of Pyk2-H is restricted to specific hematopoietic cell lineages, whereas Pyk2 is expressed mainly in neuronal cells, an alternative splicing event may provide specificity in signaling between Pyk2 and Pyk2-H in hematopoietic versus neuronal cells. The role of different spliced isoforms of tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, such as Fyn and CD45, in hematopoietic cells have been previously reported (19Davidson D. Chow L.M. Fournel M. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1483-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Alternatively spliced isoform of Fyn in cells of hematopoietic lineages (FynT) was shown to have different signaling properties in T lymphocytes as compared with the brain Fyn (FynB) isoform (19Davidson D. Chow L.M. Fournel M. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1483-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that structural changes in the amino-terminal part of kinase domains of FynT and FynB lead to differences in their abilities to promote antigen receptor-triggered calcium fluxes (21Davidson D. Vialle T.J. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4554-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, a specific role for different spliced isoforms of FAK, a Pyk2-related tyrosine kinase, has also been demonstrated (22Derkinderen P. Toutant M. Burgaya F. Le Bert M. Siciliano J.C. de Franciscis V. Gelman M. Girault J.A. Science. 1996; 27317191722Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 23Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 24Kanner S.B. Aruffo A. Chan P.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10484-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Activation of an alternatively spliced form of FAK by anandamide appears to link cannabinoid G-protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine phophorylation in hippocampal slices (22Derkinderen P. Toutant M. Burgaya F. Le Bert M. Siciliano J.C. de Franciscis V. Gelman M. Girault J.A. Science. 1996; 27317191722Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of the carboxyl-terminal isoform of FAK, called FRNK, was suggested to act as an endogenous regulator of FAK functions and formation of focal adhesions (23Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In addition, a putative homologue of FAK, FakB, has been identified and shown to be differentially regulated from FAK in T cell and B cells (24Kanner S.B. Aruffo A. Chan P.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10484-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). FakB was shown to participate in signaling by antigen receptors and associate with T-cell receptor-linked protein tyrosine kinase ZAP 70 in lymphocytes (24Kanner S.B. Aruffo A. Chan P.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10484-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We and others have previously demonstrated that Pyk2 isoform present in T cells is selectively phosphorylated by Fyn, but not Lck, following engagement of T cell receptors (8Qian D. Lev S. van Oers N.S.C. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and that stimulation of chemokine receptors by chemokines or HIV envelope proteins leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 isoform in several hematopoietic cells (12Davis C. Dikic I. Unutmaz D. Hill C.M. Arthos J. Siani M. Thompson D.A. Schlessinger J. Littman D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Pyk2-H, and not Pyk2, is the main isoform that is activated by antigen or chemokine receptors in primary hematopoietic cells. We have demonstrated that several cell lines such as Jurkat or HL-60 cells express both isoforms. However, the functional differences between Pyk2 and Pyk2-H in these cells are not well understood. For example, we have observed that activation of T-cell receptors in Jurkat T-cells or chemokine receptors in HL-60 cells lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of both Pyk2 isoforms (data not shown). Since Jurkat and HL-60 cells are neoplastic cell lines and since Pyk2 and Pyk2-H are normally present in different primary cells the biological importance of co-activation of Pyk2 and Pyk2-H in Jurkat and HL-60 cells is rendered less conclusive. In addition, a little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which Pyk2 and Pyk2-H may signal differently. The spliced exon of Pyk2 contains 42 amino acids enriched in proline, serine, and threonine residues (7 proline, 6 serine, and 3 threonine), suggesting that this region may mediate protein-protein interactions, may be a target of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases, or might lead to changes in the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of Pyk2. In this report we show that structural changes in the carboxyl terminus of Pyk2-H did not have a major effect on Pyk2-H kinase activity toward exogenous substrate or toward autophosphorylated tyrosine 402. However, the carboxyl termini of Pyk2 and Pyk2-H may mediate both common and differential interactions with cellular proteins. GST fusion proteins containing the carboxyl termini of Pyk2-H or Pyk2 bind several common tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in lysates of the thymus (Fig.6 B). An identified protein that binds to GST fusion proteins containing the carboxyl termini of Pyk2 and Pyk2-H, but not to the GST fusion protein containing the region encoded by the exon that is spliced out in Pyk2-H is the protein paxillin. It has been documented that Pyk2 constitutively associates with paxillin in several hematopoietic cell lines and our results show that the splicing event in the proline-rich domain of Pyk2-H did not lead to structural changes that could affect binding of Pyk2-H to paxillin (13Gismondi A. Bisogno L. Mainiero F. Palmieri G. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3364-3372PubMed Google Scholar, 25Salgia R. Avraham S. Pisick E. Li J-L. Raja S. Greenfield E.A. Sattler M. Avraham H. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31222-31226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, we have observed a p115 tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that preferentially binds to GST fusion protein containing the carboxyl terminus of Pyk2 and not Pyk2-H (Fig. 6 B). A weak co-precipitation of p130Cas with Pyk2 was shown in B cell lines (11Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and Pyk2 was shown to phosphorylate p130Cas and p105Hef1 (26Astier A. Manie S.N. Avraham H. Hirai H. Law S.F. Zhang Y. Golemis E.A. Fu Y. Druker B.J. Haghayeghi N. Freedman A.S. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19719-19724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, we have not been able to show co-precipitation of the carboxyl termini of Pyk2 or Pyk2-H with p105Hef-1 or p130Cas in thymus lysates (Fig.6 B). Although the identity and function of p115 tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that is associated with the carboxyl terminus of Pyk2 is currently unknown, the identification of the proteins that associate specifically with the residues of the spliced exon of Pyk2 or that bind specifically to the shorter carboxyl terminus of Pyk2-H will shed light on the role this region plays in the control of Pyk2 functions.

https://openalex.org/W2038594687,"The effects of insulin and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on glycogen synthase activation were compared in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes. In the fibroblasts, PDGF elicited a stronger phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT than did insulin. Both agents caused a comparable stimulation of receptor autophosphorylation, MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) activation in the adipocytes. However, adipogenesis resulted in the uncoupling of PI3-K activation by PDGF from subsequent AKT phosphorylation. The relative contributions of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inactivation and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) activation in the regulation of glycogen synthase in both cell types were evaluated. Insulin and PDGF caused a small increase in glycogen synthase a activity in the fibroblasts. Additionally, both agents caused a similar inhibition of GSK-3, while having no effect on PP1 activity. Following differentiation, insulin treatment resulted in a 5-fold stimulation of glycogen synthase, whereas PDGF was without effect. Both agents caused a comparable inhibition of GSK-3 activity in the adipocytes, whereas only insulin activated PP1. Finally, wortmannin completely blocked the stimulation of PP1 by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, indicating that PI3-K inhibition can impinge on PP1 activation. Cumulatively these results suggest that the weak activation of glycogen synthase in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts is mediated by GSK-3 inactivation, whereas in the more metabolically active adipocytes, the insulin-specific activation of glycogen synthase is mediated by PP1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2098167288,"The c-Abl proto-oncogene is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase whose activity and localization are regulated by integrins. Cell adhesion to fibronectin triggers the transient recruitment of c-Abl from the nucleus to focal adhesions and activation of its tyrosine kinase. To investigate the integrin regulation of c-Abl, proteins that interact with c-Abl following cell adhesion were assayed. Several proteins that were phosphorylated on tyrosine were found to transiently co-precipitate with c-Abl during cell adhesion, and one was identified as the focal adhesion protein paxillin. Abl also became transiently phosphorylated in response to cell adhesion. In addition, paxillin was found to serve as substrate for the adhesion-activated c-Abl kinase. These results suggest that c-Abl may mediate effects of integrins on cell functions by phosphorylating paxillin."

Such synthesis depends upon both the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), which is sensitive to wortmannin (IC50 7 nm) and calpain inhibitors, and the phosphorylation of PtdIns3P by PtdIns3P 4-kinase. We now report that a recently characterized C2 domain-containing phosphoinositide 3-kinase isoform (HsC2-PI3K) is present in platelets and a leukemic cell line (CHRF-288) derived from megakaryoblasts, and is likely to be responsible for the stimulated synthesis of PtdIns3P observed in platelets. HsC2-PI3K, identifiable by Western blotting and immunoprecipitatable activity, is sensitive to wortmannin (IC50 6–10 nm), requires Mg2+, and shows strong preference for PtdIns over PtdIns4P or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as substrate. HsC2-PI3K is activated severalfold when platelets aggregate in an αIIbβ3-dependent manner or when platelet or CHRF-288 lysates are incubated with Ca2+. Activation is prevented by calpain inhibitors. CHRF-288, which cannot undergo activation of αIIbβ3 and thereby aggregate in response to platelet agonists, do not generate PtdIns3P or activate HsC2-PI3K under conditions that stimulate other phosphoinositide 3-kinases. HsC2-PI3K may thus be an important effector for integrin-dependent signaling.

Most of the PI3Ks studied in these contexts are, or have been assumed to be, of the “Type I” class (see Ref. 12Zvelebil M.J. MacDougall L. Leevers S. Volinia S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Panayotou G.

Sci. 1996; 351: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar for review), where classification is based upon structural homology, substrate specificity, and mode of regulation. The Type I PI3Ks are heterodimers, containing 110–130-kDa catalytic subunits associated with 50–85- or 101-kDa adaptor entities that regulate localization and function. Type I PI3Ks phosphorylate PtdIns, PtdIns4P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2, with preference for PtdIns(4,5)P2, at the 3-OH site of the myoinositol ringin vitro and have been found to be stimulated by numerous growth factors and heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors. They can be activated, depending upon the subtype, cell, and receptor that has been stimulated, by tyrosine phosphorylation, association with tyrosine-phosphorylated or proline-rich domains, small GTPases, or βγ subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (12Zvelebil M.J. MacDougall L. Leevers S. Volinia S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Domin J. Stein R. Pages F. Waterfield M.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Type II PI3Ks are catalytic entities about twice the size of Type I catalytic subunits, and it is unknown whether they, like Type I and Type III, have adaptor proteins or whether their increased size provides a built-in adaptor. They contain a defining C2 domain at their C termini, as well as an N-terminal extension. Importantly, as well, they cannot utilize, or utilize poorly, PtdIns(4,5)P2 as a substrate, and their means of activation, or even whether they can be activated in a signal-transduction setting, has been unknown. The cloning and characterization of two new PI3Ks of the Type II class from human cells have been described recently (13Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C.

Commun. 1997; 233: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These PI3Ks have been designated PI3KC2α (13Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and HsC2-PI3K (14Brown R.A. Ho L.K.F. Weber-Hall S.J. Shipley J.M. Fry M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PI3KC2α (190 kDa), which has been expressed, is resistant to wortmannin (IC50420 nm) and resembles (90% homology) mouse m-cpk (15Molz L. Chen Y.W. Hirano M Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13892-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and p170 (16Virbasius J.V. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13304-13307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It preferentially phosphorylates PtdIns and PtdIns4P, but can, albeit poorly, phosphorylate PtdIns(4,5)P2. HsC2-PI3K is a closely related 185-kDa protein, except for its divergent 350 N-terminal residues, which encompass two proline-rich sequences appropriate for interaction with src-homology 3 domains (14Brown R.A. Ho L.K.F. Weber-Hall S.J. Shipley J.M. Fry M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As described here, expressed HsC2-PI3K phosphorylates PtdIns in strong preference to the other two known PI3K substrates, PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, and is very sensitive to wortmannin (IC50 ∼10 nm), in contrast to PI3KC2α. Mammalian Type III PI3K (HsVPS34) contains a catalytic subunit similar in size to those of Type I and an associated protein of 150 kDa. HsVPS34 is inhibited by nanomolar wortmannin, phosphorylates only PtdIns lipid substrate, and, in contrast to Type I and Type II kinases, is stimulated by Mn2+ versus Mg2+. Type III PI3Ks, based upon findings with the yeast homologue, VPSp, are thought to participate constitutively in secretory protein sorting to vacuoles, rather than being stimulated in response to cellular agonists. We have observed (17Banfić H. Tang X-W. Batty I. Downes C.P. Chen C-S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

No PtdInsP3 is generated during this integrin-dependent event. In the present study, we have examined the nature of the PI3K involved in the integrin-activated pathway, which results in the activation of platelet PKBα/Akt (17Banfić H. Tang X-W. Batty I.

Our data indicate that a PI3K of the Type II subclass, HsC2-PI3K, is most likely to be responsible for the generation of PtdIns3P that occurs. Most reagents were obtained from sources described (17Banfić H. Tang X-W. Batty I. Downes C.P. Chen C-S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

HsC2-PI3K cDNA was assembled using a combination of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and standard cDNA screening, by using the sequence of HsC2-PI3K (14Brown R.A. Ho L.K.F.

These antisera were used for all immunoprecipitations and Western blots directed at HsC2-PI3K and do not detect or immunoprecipitate Type I PI3Ks, HsVPS34, or PI3KC2α. Antibodies to p85α/β subunits and PI3KC2α were the generous gifts of Drs. Ivan Gout and Jan Domin (Ludwig Institute, London). Antibody to HsVPS34 was prepared by Dr. Volinia (19Volinia S. Dhand R.

Washed human platelets were labeled to equilibrium with [32P]Pi as described (17Banfić H. Tang X-W. Batty I. Downes C.P. Chen C-S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

CHRF-288 cells were washed with DMEM, incubated overnight with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/DMEM in the absence of serum, and incubated in low Pi-DMEM with [32P]Pi (1 mCi/ml), as reported (20Vemuri G.S. Zhang J. Huang R. Keen J.H. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).

In some cases, different concentrations of calpain inhibitors (calpeptin, calpain I, or calpain II) or wortmannin were incubated with platelets prior to platelet activation (17Banfić H. Tang X-W.

Labeled CHRF-288 were incubated up to 15 min ± SFLLRN and FIB, as for platelets. Incubations were terminated with CHCl3/MeOH/HCl, and lipids were extracted, resolved, deacylated, and quantitated by in-line 32P detection after HPLC, as described (17Banfić H. Tang X-W. Batty I.

Nonlabeled platelets or CHRF-288 cells were incubated ± agonists/calpain inhibitors as above, and incubations were terminated with ice-cold Triton lysis buffer containing 100 μg/ml calpeptin (17Banfić H. Tang X-W. Batty I. Downes C.P. Chen C-S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

After lysates (platelet, CHRF-288, or HEK293) were spun at 100,000 × g × 90 min 4 °C, HsC2-PI3K was immunoprecipitated from 450 μl of supernatants with antibody and protein A/Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with Triton lysis buffer, then three times with HEPES (5 mm)/EDTA (2 mm), pH 7.4, and re-suspended to 80 μl in HEPES/EDTA for PI3K activity assays (40 μl/100 μl assay) using PtdIns, PtdIns4P, or PtdIns(4,5)P 2 (200 μm) substrates that had been suspended in HEPES/EDTA. In some cases, varied concentrations of wortmannin in Me2SO/buffer vehicle were prepared freshly and added to washed immunoprecipitates for 5 min at 37 °C prior to assay of activity, in comparison with the same amount of Me2SO/buffer vehicle control. Assays contained [γ-32P]ATP (40 μm; 1 mCi/ml), MgCl2 (4 mm), or MnCl2 (4 mm), Tris (20 mm)/NaCl (100 mm)/EGTA (0.5 mm)/HEPES (3 mm)/EDTA (1.2 mm), pH 7.5, and were run at 30 °C for 20 min. Activity with respect to PtdIns/Mg2+ was determined to be linear for 30 min. Lipids were extracted and resolved by HPLC as above. The PI3K, p85/PI3K, was also immunoprecipitated from Triton-soluble fractions using antibodies to the p85α/p85β subunits (5Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) for assay of kinase activity under the above conditions. In other studies, Triton lysates from unstimulated platelets or CHRF-288 cells, without calpeptin or EGTA, were incubated at room temperature for various periods up to 60 min ± calpeptin ± 2 mmCa2+free. Incubations were terminated with 50 μg/ml calpeptin, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, and samples chilled and centrifugated. HsC2-PI3K was immunoprecipitated from supernatants and PI3K activity assayed with PtdIns, as above. Platelet and CHRF-288 Triton-soluble and insoluble (“CSK”) fractions and HsC2-PI3K immunoprecipitates were dissolved in SDS-reducing buffer and proteins resolved by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% gels, prior to transfer to nitrocellulose for Western blotting and enhanced chemiluminescence detection, as described previously (5Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). CSK from Triton lysates were suspended in buffer at 4–11 times their concentrations in Triton lysates before mixing with sample buffer, such that the same amount of CSK protein would be applied per lane. Exposure of platelets to a variety of agonists, under conditions that promoted αIIbβ3 + FIB-dependent aggregation, led to the activation of HsC2-PI3K and, in 32P-labeled platelets, transient accumulation of [32P]PtdIns3P (Fig.1). Both effects were inhibited by wortmannin (IC50 7 nm, for [32P]PtdIns3P; IC50 6 nm for HsC2-PI3K), in keeping with the wortmannin sensitivity of expressed HsC2-PI3K (IC50 ∼10 nm). As shown in Fig. 1A, the increased activity of HsC2-PI3K in immunoprecipitates from Triton-soluble fractions of platelets incubated with SFLLRN (directed to the thrombin receptor) + FIB was sustained for up to 14 min and slightly preceded the accumulation of [32P]PtdIns3P in stimulated platelets. The transient accumulation of [32P]PtdIns3P is probably attributable to the increased activity of PtdIns3P 4-kinase under these conditions (17Banfić H. Tang X-W. Batty I. Downes C.P. Chen C-S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Banfić H. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the absence of FIB (not shown), or in the presence of maximally effective concentrations of calpeptin (IC50 1 μm) or calpain I inhibitor (IC50 0.3 μm), the increase in PtdIns3P levels and activation of HsC2-PI3K were abolished. Calpain I inhibitor (90% inhibition at 1 μm) was more effective than calpain II inhibitor (18% inhibition at 1 μm). Similarly, increases in HsC2-PI3K activity (Fig.1 B) and [32P]PtdIns3P (Fig. 1 C) in response to PMA (activating protein kinase C) + FIB or LIBS (directly activating αIIbβ3) + FIB were blocked by calpain inhibition and did not occur in the absence of FIB. Both PMA and SFLLRN are known to activate p85/PI3K, whether or not FIB is present, and thereby contribute to “inside-out” signaling leading to the sustained activation of αIIbβ3 (5Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). SFLLRN also activates another Type I enzyme, PI3Kγ, which is dependent upon βγ subunits of GTP-binding proteins, and apparently is not involved in signaling leading to αIIbβ3 activation (5Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). LIBS by-passes such a pathway, promoting the FIB binding conformation of αIIbβ3 by interaction with the β3 subunit (21Frelinger III, A.L. Du X. Plow E. Ginsberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a wortmannin-insensitive manner,i.e. without the prerequisite of p85/PI3K activation or stimulated accumulation of 3-OH-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (5Zhang J.

Downes C.P. Chen C-S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Once FIB binds to αIIbβ3 and aggregation occurs, however, “outside-in” signaling that promotes calpain activation is triggered, leading to formation of PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (17Banfić H. Tang X-W. Batty I. Downes C.P. Chen C-S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Banfić H. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Calpain, a Ca2+-dependent thiol protease, is known to be activated intracellularly when FIB binds to αIIbβ3 and aggregates platelets that have been stimulated in the presence of Ca2+ (22Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To simulate these calpain-activating conditions, in the absence of integrin activation, unstimulated platelet lysates were incubated at room temperature in the presence of millimolar Ca2+, and the activity of immunoprecipitated HsC2-PI3K was then assayed. It was found that activity rose transiently (2.49 ± 0.12-fold after 10 min, 4.08 ± 0.18-fold after 20 min, and 3.24 ± 0.17-fold after 60 min) and that the increase was blocked by omitting Ca2+or by including calpain inhibitors. The increased 3-kinase activity in HsC2-PI3K immunoprecipitates from stimulated platelets was specific for PtdIns as a substrate (Fig.2). As would be expected from the substrate specificity of 293 cell-expressed HsC2-PI3K, which exhibited a greater than 10 times preference for PtdIns (not shown), immunoprecipitated HsC2-PI3K from resting platelets strongly favored PtdIns ([32P]PtdIns3P = 155,122 ± 6968 dpm) over PtdIns4P ([32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 = 316 ± 55 dpm) or PtdIns(4,5)P2([32P]PtdInsP3 = 573 ± 41 dpm), and activity with respect to PtdIns was selectively increased by platelet stimulation. Thus, the increased PI3K activity seen with respect to PtdIns is not attributable to co-precipitating Type I kinase activity from activated platelets (5Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C.

Furthermore, the marked sensitivity of the activity to wortmannin and selectivity of HsC2-PI3K antibody argue against PI3KC2α (13Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) being co-precipitated, despite the fact that PI3KC2α is present in platelets and CHRF-288 cells. 2J. Zhang, S. Volinia, J. Domin, and S. E. Rittenhouse, manuscript in preparation. Finally, unlike the case for both expressed and native HsVPS34 (also present in platelets and CHRF-288 cells2), which shows enhanced activity with Mn2+ versus Mg2+ as a co-factor (19Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), immunoprecipitated HsC2-PI3K was less than 10% as active when Mn2+ was substituted for Mg2+. Thus, the stimulated PI3K activity of HsC2-PI3K immunoprecipitates is not due to contaminating or co-precipitating Type III (HsVPS34) activity. Additionally, such other PI3Ks were not immunologically detectable in HsC2-PI3K immunoprecipitates (not shown). As we have reported (20Vemuri G.S. Zhang J. Huang R. Keen J.H. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Vemuri G.S. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), CHRF-288, a leukemic cell line derived from a platelet precursor cell, the megakaryoblast (24Fugman D.A. Witte D.P. Jones C.L.A. Aronow B.J. Lieberman M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1252-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can be stimulated by a variety of physiological agonists to accumulate PtdInsP3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2. These increases are sensitive to wortmannin, and CHRF-288 cells contain p85/PI3K and PI3Kγ, Type I enzymes whose activities in lysates can be stimulated by guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) and βγ subunits of GTP-binding proteins, respectively. Despite displaying apparently normal αIIbβ3 at their surface, however, CHRF-288 cells cannot undergo the activation of this integrin that leads to the binding of FIB (25Shattil S.J. Cunningham M. Wiedmer T. Zhao J. Sims P.J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18424-18431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and aggregation. We found that CHRF-288 cells, after incubation with SFLLRN + FIB (or PMA + FIB, not shown) accumulated no [32P]PtdIns3P, whereas [32P]PtdInsP3 and [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 were formed rapidly (Fig.3 A), a pattern similar to the “pre-integrin” accumulation of 3-OH-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in stimulated platelets (18Banfić H. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although much immunoprecipitatable HsC2-PI3K activity was present in Triton or RIPA lysates of CHRF-288 cells, no increased activity was observed when CHRF-288 were activated with SFLLRN + FIB or PMA + FIB (Fig.3 B). In contrast, lysates of CHRF-288 incubated in the presence of Ca2+ showed a time-dependent increase in immunoprecipitatable HsC2-PI3K activity (2.3 ± 0.2-fold in 10 min, 3.6 ± 0.1-fold in 20 min, and 4.2 ± 0.4-fold in 60 min), which was prevented by omitting Ca2+or including calpain inhibitor. This indicated that HsC2-PI3K of CHRF-288 cells could be activated in an apparently calpain-dependent manner if the requirement for activated integrin were bypassed. Thus, failure to activate αIIbβ3 is associated in intact CHRF-288 with failure to activate HsC2-PI3K and stimulate accumulation of PtdIns3P. Western blotting of CSK and Triton-soluble (TS) fractions of platelets (Fig. 4) with antibody to HsC2-PI3K revealed a protein band at about 200 kDa in both fractions. This band in the Triton-soluble fraction could be decreased by immunoprecipitation with HsC2-PI3K antibody (PS), and a corresponding band was found for the Western blot of the immunoprecipitate (IP). The migration of the band did not shift detectably for blots from activated platelets (SFLLRN) or from platelet lysates incubated with Ca2+. In conclusion, our data indicate that HsC2-PI3K is activated in platelets in a manner dependent upon the reorganization of integrin αIIbβ3, FIB binding and aggregation, and, most probably, calpain I activation. Given its strong preference for Ptd-Ins as a substrate, its susceptibility to wortmannin, and its activation under the same conditions required for the accumulation of PtdIns3P in intact cells, HsC2-PI3K is the most reasonable choice for the enzyme responsible for generating PtdIns3P in stimulated platelets. It is possible that HsC2-PI3K is a substrate for calpain I and thereby activated by it, but, at this point, other mechanisms involving other calpain targets are equally likely to contribute to the stimulation observed in vivo. Inasmuch as the antibody used for immunoprecipitation and identification of resting and activated HsC2-PI3K is directed to the N-terminal 350-amino acid region of HsC2-PI3K, and the catalytic domain lies approximately between amino acids 1037 and 1320 (14Brown R.A. Ho L.K.F. Weber-Hall S.J. Shipley J.M. Fry M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), any activating cleavage target for calpain would have to be C-terminal to these regions. If the cleavage site were in the C2 domain of HsC2-PI3K, for example, a decrease in size might not be easily detectable under our conditions. Further studies with tagged, expressed HsC2-PI3K and purified calpain I may be needed to identify possible activating cleavage sites for HsC2-PI3K in stimulated platelets.

H. pylori, but not E. coli, generated substantial amounts of superoxide radicals.

Nitric oxide is also generated from nitrite in saliva and from food by microorganisms in the oral cavity as well as by nonenzymatic mechanisms under acidic conditions, such as in gastric juice (12Lundberg J.O.N. Weitzberg E. Lundberg J.M. Alving K. Gut. 1994; 35: 1543-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Because NO synthase is also present in gastric mucosa (13Brown J.F. Tepperman B.L.

Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: A31PubMed Google Scholar), physiological concentrations of NO in gastric juice are fairly high. We have shown that the biological activity of NO is augmented significantly by physiologically low levels of oxygen tension (2Tekehara Y. Kanno T. Yoshioka T. Inoue M. Utsumi K. Arch. Biochem.

Although NO plays important roles in defense mechanisms against enteric bacteria (6Lin J.Y. Chadee K. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3999-4005PubMed Google Scholar, 7Beckerman K.P. Rogers H.W. Corbett J.A.

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative and microaerophilic bacterium that resides in the mucus layer overlying the gastric epithelium of the human stomach. This organism is thought to play essential roles in the pathogenesis of gastric inflammation, ulceration, and carcinogenesis (8Blaser M.J. J. Infect.

Although H. pyloriis exposed to fairly high concentrations of NO in gastric juice, which has low oxygen tension, the effect of NO on the metabolism of H. pylori remains to be defined. We therefore studied the effects of NO on the respiration of H. pylori and Escherichia coli under physiologically low levels of oxygen tension. Peroxynitrite solution and carboxy-2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazolin-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) were obtained from Dojin Co. (Kumamoto, Japan). Mn-type superoxide dismutase (SOD) from E. coli and 2-methyl-6-[p-methoxyphenyl]-3,7-dihydroimidazol[1,2-α]pyra zin-3-one (MCLA) were obtained from Sigma and Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Nitric oxide solution was prepared as described previously (5Yu H. Sato E.F. Nagata K. Nishikawa M. Kashiba M. Arakawa T. Kobayashi K. Tamura T. Inoue M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two types of enteric bacteria, E. coli K-12 JM109 and H. pyloriNCTC-11637, were used in all experiments. E. coli was cultured at 37 °C with shaking in nutrient broth (Difco) containing 0.5% NaCl. H. pylori was cultured in Brucellabroth containing 5% horse serum under a microaerophilic atmosphere, produced with the use of a gas pack BBL CampyPak (Becton, MD), at 37 °C for 20 h as described previously (15Nagata K. Satoh H. Iwahi T. Shimoyama T. Tamura T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The culturedE. coli and H. pylori were harvested at the logarithmic growth phase, suspended in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.9% NaCl, and used in the experiments. Respiration of E. coli and H. pylori was monitored polarographically at 37 °C in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.9% NaCl and 5 mm succinate. A Clark-type oxygen electrode was used as described previously (5Yu H. Sato E.F. Nagata K. Nishikawa M. Kashiba M. Arakawa T. Kobayashi K. Tamura T. Inoue M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Superoxide was determined by the cytochrome c method (16McCord J. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

After disrupting cells by sonication, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. SOD activity in the supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically with an SOD assay kit (Calbiochem). The assay is based on the SOD-mediated increase in the rate of autooxidation of 5,6,6a,11b-tetrahydro-3,9,10-trihydroxybenzo[c]fluorene in aqueous alkaline solution (18Nebot C. Moutet M. Huet P. Xu J.Z. Yadan J.C. Chaudiere J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in the samples were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Nitric oxide reversibly inhibited the respiration of E. coli. Consistent with our previous observations with mitochondria (2Tekehara Y. Kanno T. Yoshioka T. Inoue M. Utsumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 3Inai Y. Takehara Y. Yabuki M. Sato E.F. Akiyama J. Inoue M. Horton A.A. Utsumi K. Cell Struct.

Nagata K. Nishikawa M. Kashiba M. Arakawa T. Kobayashi K. Tamura T. Inoue M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of NO increased with a decrease in oxygen concentration of the medium. Although NO also inhibited the respiration of H. pylori in an oxygen concentration-dependent manner, it was significantly less active than with E. coli, and inhibition persisted throughout the observation period. Washing the NO-treated cells did not restore respiratory activity of H. pylori(data not shown). Because NO is rapidly metabolized into various compounds, such as nitrite and nitrate, these metabolite(s) might act to inhibit cellular respiration. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of NO metabolites and NO-trapping agents on respiration. Fairly high concentrations of nitrite and nitrate (∼100 μm) did not inhibit the respiration of E. coli or H. pylori(Fig. 2). In contrast, both cPTIO and oxyhemoglobin, NO-trapping agents (20Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M. Sasamoto K. Miyazaki K. Ueda S. Maeda H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 21Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1981; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), instantaneously abolished the inhibitory effect of NO on the respiration of E. coli. Thus, NO, rather than its metabolites, might directly interact withE. coli and thereby inhibit cellular respiration. In the case of H. pylori, neither cPTIO nor oxyhemoglobin abolished the inhibitory effect of NO. Thus, some metabolite(s) of NO other than nitrite and nitrate might irreversibly inhibit the respiration ofH. pylori. Because NO rapidly reacts with superoxide radicals (k = 6.9 × 109m−1s−1) and generates cytotoxic peroxynitrite, effects of this metabolite on the respiration of E. coli and H. pylori were tested. When added to the incubation mixture, peroxynitrite inhibited the respiration of both organisms (Fig. 2). The characteristics of inhibition by peroxynitrite were similar to those of inhibition of H. pylori by NO. Inhibited respiration of both organisms persisted even after washing the cells with incubation medium (data not shown). Thus, peroxynitrite rather than NO and other metabolites might cause the irreversible inhibition of the respiration of H. pylori. These observations suggest that H. pylori might generate superoxide radicals that rapidly react with NO and generate peroxynitrite. To test this hypothesis, the rate of superoxide generation and cellular levels of SOD were compared between the two organisms. When incubated in a medium containing MCLA, a chemiluminescence probe, H. pylori, elicited marked chemiluminescence that peaked after 2–3 min of incubation (Fig. 3). The MCLA chemiluminescence was strongly inhibited by Mn-SOD, suggesting the involvement of superoxide radicals. Under identical conditions, MCLA chemiluminescence was negligible with E. coli. In contrast to the superoxide generating activity, the cellular level of SOD was significantly lower in H. pylori than in E. coli(Table I). Based on the chemiluminescence intensity of MCLA, the steady-state level of superoxide generated byH. pylori was calculated to be 21 ± 9 μm. Because this superoxide concentration approximates that of NO used in the present experiments, NO might be rapidly trapped by superoxide radicals in and around H. pylori, forming peroxynitrite. Because peroxynitrite is cytotoxic, this metabolite, rather than NO, might irreversibly inhibit the respiration of H. pylori. Consistent with this notion is the finding that peroxynitrite, similar to NO, irreversibly inhibited the respiration ofH. pylori.Table ISuperoxide generation and SOD activity in E. coli and H. pyloriBacteriaSOD-inhibitable chemiluminescenceSOD×106 cpm/108 cellsunits/mg proteinE. coli1.2 ± 0.793.5 ± 15.6H. pylori35 ± 728.5 ± 8.5Superoxide was determined by the chemiluminescence method (17Nakano M.

The highly toxic nature of peroxynitrite and its metabolites (hydroxyl radical) may also impair the structure and functions of cell constituents, including proteins and DNA. Preliminary experiments using anti-nitrotyrosine antibody and Western blotting after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed significant amounts of immunoreactive protein bands in NO-treated H. pylori but not in NO-treated E. coli. Helicobacter species show considerable genomic variation (27Jorgensen M. Daskalopoulos G. Warburton V. Mitchell H.M. Hazell S.L. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 28Blaser M.J. Hunt R.H. Tygat G.N.J. Genetic Basis for Heterogeneity of Helicobacter pylori: Helicobacter pylori Basic Mechanisms to Clinical Cure. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 33-39Google Scholar). This genomic diversity may be one reason for their success as ubiquitous pathogens. Preliminary polymerase chain reaction-based RFLP analysis of the gene encoding urease showed that NO induced mutation in H. pylori. Under identical conditions, NO had no appreciable effect on DNA samples obtained from NO-treated E. coli. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that NO reacted with endogenously generated superoxide radicals and the resulting peroxynitrite reacted with proteins and DNA of H. pylori. Reactive oxygen species, including peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radicals, have been well documented to induce gene mutations and cancer. Thus, generation of superoxide and related metabolites might underlie the mechanisms of their genetic diversity and their role in the pathogenesis of gastric inflammation and cancer (29Perchellet J.P.

Invest. 1987; 79: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) that interacts with and reversibly inhibits the activity of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) (2Tada M. Katz A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1982; 44: 401-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). PLN has been predicted to contain three domains. Domain Ia, residues 1–20, contains 6 charged amino acids and has a net positive charge. Phosphorylation of Ser16 and Thr17, which alters the net charge of domain Ia, disrupts the inhibitory function of PLN (3Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Domain Ia is believed to be at least partly helical, but helicity may not extend beyond Ser16 so that domain Ib, residues 21–30, may be relatively unstructured (5Mortishire-Smith R.J. Pitzenberger S.M. Burke C.J. Middaugh C.R. Garsky V.M. Johnson R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7603-7613Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, studies by Tatulian et al. (6Tatulian S.A. Jones L.R. Reddy L.G. Stokes D.L. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4448-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) led to the proposal that it might form a β-sheet structure at the membrane interface. Domain Ib contains a single positive charge in the form of Arg25 in most species, but in human, Lys replaces Asn27 resulting in 2 positive charges (7Fujii J. Zarain-Herzberg A. Willard H.F. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11669-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Domain II, residues 31–52, is composed of nonpolar and hydrophobic amino acids, forming a transmembrane helix. In SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, PLN mobility corresponds to the mass of a homopentamer, but boiling in SDS reduces the apparent mass to that of a monomer or intermediate oligomers (8Jones L.R. Simmerman H.K.B. Wilson W.W. Gurd F.R. Wegener A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7721-7730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a series of papers (9Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M.

We have used the tools of chimera formation and site-directed mutagenesis to alter function, and we have assayedK Ca, the Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal activation of Ca2+ transport, as a measure of the degree of alteration of the inhibitory association between PLN and SERCA2a. These studies have allowed us to show that the cytoplasmic interaction sites are formed by charged and hydrophobic amino acids in PLN domain Ia (9Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by amino acids Lys-Asp-Asp-Lys-Pro-Val402 in SERCA2a (10Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22929-22932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that inhibitory interactions occur when only PLN residues 28–52, containing 3 domain Ib residues plus all of the domain II transmembrane residues, are coexpressed with SERCA2a (11Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that it is the transmembrane amino acids (and possibly a few additional amino acids at the cytoplasm/membrane boundary) that form the inhibitory interaction sites between PLN and SERCA2a. We proposed that inhibitory interactions in the transmembrane sequences of PLN and SERCA2a can be modulated through long range interactions by the noninhibitory cytoplasmic interaction sites and vice versa, so that regulation of SERCA2a function results from interactions among a 4-base circuit composed of 2 interaction sites in PLN and 2 in SERCA2a. We used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to show that the inhibitory interaction site in the transmembrane sequence of PLN lies on a helical face that must interact with one or more transmembrane helices in SERCA2a, whereas the other helical face is involved in pentamer formation (12Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Because the most inhibitory mutants of PLN were devoid of pentamer, we deduced that the pentamer represents an inactive reservoir of subunits and that the PLN monomer is the active, inhibitory form. Studies of a single monomeric PLN mutant, L37A, led Cornea et al. (13Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and Autry and Jones (14Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) to a similar view. In our earlier study of interactions between domain Ib and SERCA2a (9Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), scanning mutagenesis of domain Ib was incomplete, and none of the mutations that were carried out affected the inhibitory properties of PLN. In the present study, we have completed the alanine-scanning mutagenesis of domain Ib. We show that specific mutations in the C-terminal end of domain Ib also affect the inhibitory properties of PLN. Substitution of Ala for 3 amidated residues, Asn27, Gln29, and Asn30, enhanced PLN inhibition without destabilizing the pentameric structure of PLN. These residues are likely to contribute to the stability of the inhibited PLN/SERCA2a heterodimer. For mutagenesis, a 172-base pair fragment containing the coding sequence for rabbit PLN (bases −6–162) (15Fujii J. Lytton J. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was amplified in a recombinant polymerase chain reaction (16Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, California1990: 177-183Google Scholar) using primers with 5′-add-on sequences containing restriction endonuclease sites for XbaI (5′ end) andSalI (3′ end). The product was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) after digestion with XbaI andSalI. Mutagenesis with this construct as a template was carried out as described previously (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar, 18Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant PLN cDNAs were ligated into the XbaI and SalI sites of the pMT2 expression vector (19Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and amplified. Plasmid DNA was purified by adsorption to and elution from Qiagen tip-500 columns. PLN and SERCA2a cDNAs in the pMT2 vector were cotransfected (8 μg of each cDNA per dish) into human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK-293 cells) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (20Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Okayama H. Ausulbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 9.1.1-9.1.9Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and microsomes were prepared and assayed for Ca2+ transport activity as described previously (9Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed as described previously (11Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of SERCA2a and wild type and mutant forms of PLN expressed in HEK-293 cell microsomes was carried out with 10 μg of microsomal proteins. Proteins were solubilized in SDS buffer at room temperature, separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (11Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), except that PROTRANTM nitrocellulose membranes with a pore size of 0.05 microns (Schleicher & Schuell) were used during protein transfer. Membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibody IID8F6 against SERCA2a (a kind gift from Dr. Kevin P. Campbell) or antibody 1D11 against PLN (21Mayer E.J. McKenna E. Garsky V.M. Burke C.J. Mach H.

Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligomer/monomer ratios were calculated by scanning densitometry of individual lanes in the exposed films of the immunoblots of the gels. Data were averaged from 13 experiments. Coexpression of PLN with SERCA2a diminished the affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+, shifting apparentK Ca (the Ca2+ concentration for half-maximal Ca2+ transport activity expressed inpCa units) from 6.59 to 6.25 (Fig.1 A). The reduction in the apparent affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+ of −0.34pCa units provided a measure of the inhibitory function of wild type PLN, which was used as a standard for measurement of the gain or loss of inhibitory function by PLN mutants in which each residue in domain Ib was mutated sequentially to alanine (Fig.1 A). PLN domain Ib mutants P21A, R25A, Q26A, and L28A lost inhibitory function relative to PLN, as indicated by ΔK Cavalues between −0.19 and −0.25 pCa units. PLN mutants N27A, Q29A, and N30A gained inhibitory function relative to PLN, as indicated by ΔK Ca values ranging from −0.62 to −1.08 pCa units. PLN mutants Q22A, Q23A, and A24V had unaltered function, as indicated by ΔK Cavalues not significantly different from −0.34 pCa units. In addition, PLN domain Ia mutants, A11V and A15V, not previously analyzed, had unaltered function, as indicated by ΔK Ca values not significantly different from −0.34 pCa units. Loss or gain of PLN function could not be correlated with different levels of expression (Fig.2). Moreover, gain of function is not induced by overexpression of PLN under the conditions of our coexpression studies (11Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In further characterization of two of the gain of function mutation sites in domain Ib, we determined the effect of residue size and of positive and negative charge by mutating Asn27 and Asn30 to Gln, Asp, and Lys (Fig. 1 B). The mutant N27Q had unaltered inhibitory function, whereas the mutant N30Q gained inhibitory function. The mutant N27D lost inhibitory function, whereas the mutant N30D had unaltered function. Mutant N27K, recreating the sequence found in human PLN (7Fujii J. Zarain-Herzberg A. Willard H.F. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11669-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gained inhibitory function relative to rabbit wild type PLN. Fig. 2 illustrates the results of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the pentamer/monomer relationship in unboiled samples of PLN and each of the 17 PLN mutants created in this study. All mutants retained essentially the same pentamer/monomer ratio as wild type PLN (Table I), even though the mutants N27A, N27K, Q29A, N30A, and N30Q had gained inhibitory function.Table IMonomer content for PLN and PLN mutants in domain IbMutants% monomernFunctionmean ± S.E.Wild type10.9 ± 2.513P21A2.5 ± 1.52LQ22A10.1 ± 2.34NQ23A7.1 ± 2.14NA24V18.8 ± 0.33NR25A6.6 ± 4.03LQ26A18.0 ± 6.24LN27A10.1 ± 1.64GL28A15.8 ± 2.33LQ29A25.8 ± 5.64GN30A7.7 ± 5.13GMonomer percent was determined by scanning densitometry of pentameric and monomeric bands in individual lanes from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Inhibitory function is indicated as follows: G, gain of inhibitory function; L, loss of inhibitory function; N, no change in inhibitory function.

We tested the effect on inhibitory function of mutant PLNs of combining mutations in domain Ib with mutations in domain II that had been characterized earlier (12Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We created a double mutant, N30A/I40A, which combined two gain of function mutations, one pentameric and located in domain Ib and one monomeric and located in domain II (Fig.1 C). The ΔK Ca for this strongly inhibitory double mutant was −1.08 pCa units over SERCA2a alone or −0.74 pCa units over SERCA2a plus PLN. The ΔK Ca for the single monomeric I40A mutant was −0.78 pCa units over SERCA2a alone or −0.44 pCa units over SERCA2a plus PLN. The ΔK Ca for the single pentameric N30A mutant was −0.62 pCa units over SERCA2a alone or −0.28 pCa units over SERCA2a plus PLN. Thus the gain of inhibitory function over wild type PLN for the double mutant N30A/I40A (−0.74 pCa units) was equivalent to the additive gain of inhibitory function over wild type PLN for the I40A plus N30A mutations (−0.44 + −0.28 = −0.72 pCa units). L31A and N34A are pentameric mutants in domain II that are devoid of inhibitory function (12Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). When these mutations were combined with the strong gain of function pentameric mutation N27A in domain Ib, the double mutant N27A/N34A regained significant inhibitory function (Fig.1 C) and mutant N27A/L31A tended toward gain of inhibitory function. Combination of the weaker gain of function domain Ib mutations, Q29A or N30A, with N31A or N34A, however, did not result in regain of inhibitory function (Fig. 1 C).

In Fig. 1 A, we have combined data published earlier (9Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the results of the present study to provide a single map for the results of alanine-scanning mutagenesis of PLN domains Ia and Ib. Fig. 1 A, together with Fig. 1A in Ref.12Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, provides a complete alanine-scanning mutagenesis map for PLN. These data highlight the fact that mutation to Ala of specific charged (Glu2, Arg9, and Arg14) and hydrophobic (Val4, Leu7, and Ile12) residues in domain Ia leads to loss of function. Loss of inhibitory function also occurs with mutation to Ala of Pro21, Arg25, Gln26, and Leu28 in domain Ib and with mutation to Ala of residues Leu31, Asn34, Phe35, Ile38, Leu42, Ile48, Val49, and Leu52 in domain II (12Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The results suggest that each of these residues provides an important ligand for the establishment of the circuit of interacting sites that permits PLN to modulate the function of SERCA2a (11Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A also highlights the fact that gain of function accompanies the mutation to Ala of Asn27, Gln29, and Asn30 in domain Ib, whereas Fig. 1A in Ref. 12Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar illustrates that gain of function accompanies the mutation to Ala of Phe32, Ile33, Leu37, Ile40, Leu43, Leu44, Ile47, Met50, and Leu51 in domain II. Different explanations are required for the gain of function that follows mutation of specific residues in domain Ib and for the gain of function that follows mutation of specific residues in domain II. In an earlier study (12Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we proposed that the formation of an inhibited PLN·SERCA2a complex would require two separate steps, the first being the dissociation of the PLN pentamer to form the inhibitory monomeric species and the second being the association of the PLN monomer with SERCA2a. In our hypothesis, gain of function could result from pentamer destabilizing mutations in domain II, which would increase the monomer concentration, and through mass action, increase the concentration of the inhibited complex or through other mutations for example those in domain Ib, which could stabilize the inhibited PLN·SERCA2a complex. As a first test of the hypothesis, we carried out an indirect measurement of the association between PLN and SERCA2a. Because increased Ca2+ can dissociate the PLN·SERCA2a complex (4James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), we measured the Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+transport for each mutant. The fact that higher concentrations of Ca2+ were required to activate SERCA2a, Ca2+transport was in line with a tighter association between PLN and SERCA2a in domain Ib mutants N27A, Q29A, and N30A. As a further test of the hypothesis, we combined two strong inhibitory mutations, one from domain Ib and one from domain II. The gain of function for the double mutant N30A/I40A was equal to the sum of the gain of function for the N30A mutant plus the gain of function for the I40A mutant. This observation is in line with our view that these two mutations represent different mechanisms of inhibition, the effects of which are additive. In a third test of the hypothesis, we also combined mutants from domains II and Ib. The two domain II mutants, L31A and N34A, were devoid of function, presumably because the mutation had diminished their affinity for complementary interacting residues in the transmembrane domain of SERCA2a. Within domain II, loss of function is dominant over gain of function (12Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). They were combined with the strong gain of function mutants, N27A and N30A, which according to our hypothesis would enhance the affinity between PLN and SERCA2a. In line with our hypothesis, we recovered significant inhibitory function for the double mutant, N27A/N34A, and we observed a tendency toward regain of function for the double mutant N27A/L31A. This suggests that the gain in strength of the inhibitory interaction for the mutant N27A was sufficient to overcome the loss in strength of the inhibitory interaction for the mutant N34A. When we combined the N31A or N34A mutations with either of two weaker gain of function mutations, Q29A or N30A, we did not observe regain of inhibitory function in the double mutants, suggesting that the gain in strength of the inhibitory interactions in mutants Q27A and N30A was insufficient to overcome the loss in strength of the inhibitory interactions induced by the mutations L31A or N34A. The results of analysis of double mutants are fully consistent with the postulate that gain of function domain Ib mutants act through a different mechanism from gain of function domain II mutants. They are also consistent with the view that domain II mutants act through PLN depolymerization, whereas domain Ib mutants act through stabilization of the inhibited PLN·SERCA2a complex. The question of how the mutation of domain Ib residues leads to gain of inhibitory interaction with SERCA2a was investigated by further mutagenesis of Asn27 and Asn30. The mutant N27D (gain of negative charge) had slight loss of function, the mutant N27K (gain of positive charge and size) had slight gain of function, whereas the mutant N27Q (increased size) had unaffected function. The mutant N30D (gain of negative charge) had unaltered function, whereas the mutant N30Q (increased size) gained function. These results indicate that hydrophilic residues at positions 27 and 30 manifest weaker inhibitory properties than the small hydrophobic residue, Ala. An acidic residue at position 27 exhibited the weakest inhibitory property. The effect of charge in domain Ib seems to be far less dramatic than it is in domain Ia (9Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overall results, showing rather minor effects over a range of charge and a small increase in size, do not provide a clear picture of the type of interaction between PLN and SERCA2a that might involve Asn27, Gln29, and Asn30. Mutations in domain Ib may increase the affinity of the inhibitory interaction between PLN and SERCA2a through direct interactions with stalk sequences in SERCA2a, or they may occur through the long range transmission of the effects of an altered conformation. Under normal conditions, it is unlikely that PLN/SERCA2a interactions are profoundly influenced by amino acids in this region of domain Ib, especially since Asn27 is not highly conserved, being mutated to Lys in humans (7Fujii J. Zarain-Herzberg A. Willard H.F. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11669-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, it is conceivable that the highly inhibitory N27A mutation or the corresponding mutation in humans, K27A if it occurred naturally, could lead to potential cardiomyopathies as predicted earlier for gain of function mutants in domain II (12Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). High resolution structures of both PLN and SERCA2a will be required before we can define the specific interactions between PLN and SERCA2a with greater accuracy. In the meantime, the biochemical approach in our laboratory is being directed toward the discovery of the amino acids in SERCA2a that are likely to interact with the loss of function residues in domains Ib and II of PLN that have been identified in this study and in an earlier study (12Kimura Y.

Here, we demonstrate that functionally similar low sulfonylurea affinity KATP channels are formed by two heterologous molecules, products of Kir1.1a and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genes. Co-injection of CFTR and Kir1.1a cRNA into Xenopus oocytes lead to the expression of K+ selective channels that retained the high open probability behavior of Kir1.1a but acquired sulfonylurea sensitivity and ATP-dependent gating properties. Similar to the KATP channels in the kidney but different from KATP channels in excitable tissues, the Kir1.1a/CFTR channel was inhibited by glibenclamide with micromolar affinity. Since the expression of Kir1.1a and CFTR overlap at sites in the kidney where the low sulfonylurea affinity KATP are expressed, our study offers evidence that these native KATP channels are comprised of Kir1.1a and CFTR. The implication that Kir subunits can interact with ABC proteins beyond the subfamily of sulfonylurea receptors provides an intriguing explanation for functional diversity in KATP channels. Unique ATP-inhibitable K+channels (KATP) in the kidney determine the rate of urinary K+ excretion and play an essential role in extracellular K+ balance. Here, we demonstrate that functionally similar low sulfonylurea affinity KATP channels are formed by two heterologous molecules, products of Kir1.1a and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genes.

However, the renal epithelial KATP channels are readily distinguished from other ATP-sensitive K+ channels by their relatively low affinity for sulfonylurea agents (6Wang T. Wang W.H.

Defining a new class of K+ channel proteins, characterized by their inward rectifying properties (Kir) (10Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and a unique two-transmembrane structural motif, Ho et al. (11Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) isolated a novel K+ channel cDNA, called ROMK1 or Kir1.1a, from rat kidney. As required for a secretory K+ channel gene, Kir 1.1a is specially expressed in the distal nephron (12Lee W.S. Hebert S.C. Am. J.

While Kir1.1a shares many functional features of the secretory channel, the notable absence of ATP (11Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) or sulfonylurea sensitivity suggested that the native channel was more complex than Kir 1.1a alone. Certainly, the recent discovery of Aguilar-Bryan et al. (14Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P. Boyd A.E. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar) gave credence to this notion. These investigators showed that the high affinity sulfonylurea receptor expressed in the pancreatic islet beta cell is encoded by a unique ATP-binding cassette protein (ABC protein or traffic ATPase), SUR1. The sulfonylurea binding protein does not exhibit any channel activity itself. Instead, SUR1 interacts with a pancreatic inward rectifying K+ channel subunit, Kir 6.2, to form a KATP channel like those observed in beta-islet cells (15Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). With the subsequent discovery that the cardiac KATP channel is comprised of a related ATP-binding cassette protein, SUR2A, and the inward-rectifying K+ channel isoform, Kir 6.2, a molecular paradigm for other KATP channels began to be established (16Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Wang C-Z. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Seino S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar).Having this multimeric Kir/ABC protein motif in mind, we explored the possibility that the distal nephron KATP channel is encoded by unique Kir and ATP-binding cassette proteins as a basis for its distinct functional properties. While Kir 1.1a appeared to be an excellent candidate for the inward rectifying K+ channel subunit, the identity of the ABC subunit remained less certain. As might be surmised from the low sulfonylurea sensitivity of renal KATP channels, neither the pancreatic islet beta cell (SUR1) nor the cardiac myocyte (SUR2A) ABC proteins are expressed in the kidney (14Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P. Boyd A.E. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 16Inagaki N. Gonoi T.

Another ABC protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), does standout as a plausible candidate. First, CFTR is expressed abundantly in the kidney and is localized along the entire nephron (17Morales M.M. Carroll T.P. Morita T. Schwiebert E.M. Devuyst O. Wilson P.D. Lopes A.G. Stanton B.A. Dietz H.C. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F1038-F1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the apical membrane (18Crawford I. Maloney P.C. Zeitlin P.L. Guggino W.B. Hyde S.C. Turley H. Harris A. Higgins C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9262-9266Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cellular and subcellular expression overlap with Kir1.1a in the cortical collecting duct. Second, the cystic fibrosis gene product is the only other member of the ABC superfamily that is known to bind sulfonylurea agonists (19Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 573-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sulfonylurea affinity of CFTR is similar to the renal epithelial KATP channels. Finally, besides acting as a chloride channel itself, there is a growing consensus that CFTR may also regulate other channels (20Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).In agreement with this general hypothesis, McNicholas et al.(21McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8083-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) have recently reported that CFTR confers glibenclamide sensitivity on a closely related Kir1.1a isoform, ROMK2 (Kir1.1b). However, two critical questions remained unanswered. First, does CFTR interact with other members of the ROMK family? Second, and more importantly, does coexpression of CFTR with any ROMK (Kir1.1) isoform reconstitute ATP-sensitive K+ channels? In the present study, we have specifically addressed these issues by measuring the functional consequences of CFTR/Kir1.1a interaction in Xenopus oocytes injected with CFTR and Kir1.1a cRNA. Our results demonstrate that CFTR associates with Kir 1.1 to modify single channel conductance and to confer both ATP and sulfonylurea sensitivity. The data are compatible with the notion that CFTR and Kir1.1 physically associate to form a hybrid channel with properties that are reminiscent of the distal nephron KATP channel. The implication of this study that Kir subunits can interact with ATP-binding cassette proteins beyond the subfamily of sulfonylurea receptors provides an intriguing explanation for functional diversity in KATP channels.DISCUSSIONUnique KATP channels in the renal cortical collecting duct, comprising the final regulated component of kidney's potassium secretory machinery, play an essential role in the regulation of extracellular K+ balance (28Wang W.-H. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1024-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that functionally similar low sulfonylurea affinity KATP channels are formed by two heterologous molecules, products of Kir1.1a and CFTR genes. Co-injection of CFTR and Kir1.1a cRNA into Xenopus oocytes lead to the expression of unique K+ selective channels that retained the high open probability behavior of all Kir1.1a channels but acquired sulfonylurea sensitivity and ATP-dependent gating properties, thesine qua non of KATP. The Kir1.1a/CFTR channel was inhibited by glibenclamide with a much lower affinity than those expressed in excitable tissues (endocrine pancreas, Kir 6.2/SUR1 or heart, Kir6.2/SUR2), similar to the unique KATP channels in the kidney (6Wang T. Wang W.H. Klein-Robbenhaar G. Giebisch G. Renal Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 18: 169-182PubMed Google Scholar). With observations that the expression patterns of Kir1.1a (12Lee W.S. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1124-F1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CFTR (18Crawford I. Maloney P.C. Zeitlin P.L. Guggino W.B. Hyde S.C. Turley H. Harris A. Higgins C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9262-9266Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) overlap in the distal nephron along the apical membrane, our study offers compelling evidence that the native potassium secretory KATP channels may be comprised of Kir1.1a and CFTR.Several important aspects of our study differ from a recent report of McNicholas et al. (21McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8083-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) with Kir1.1b(ROMK2) and CFTR. By employing an oil gate for rapid and efficient solution exchange, we demonstrated that glibenclamide directly inhibits Kir1.1a/CFTR as required for a KATP channel. Subsequently it is not necessary to evoke a dephosphorylation-dependent rundown process to explain the glibenclamide effect on Kir1.1a/CFTR as suggested by McNicholas et al. for Kir1.1b/CFTR. In addition to extending and clarifying the mechanism of sulfonylurea sensitivity, we have discovered that co-expression CFTR with Kir1.1a was required to reconstitute ATP-dependent gating properties. In these regards, the renal epithelial KATP channel appears to mimic the basic Kir/ATP binding cassette protein paradigm exhibited by other KATP channels.Although the acquisition of ATP and low-affinity sulfonylurea sensitivity are compatible with the reconstitution of the renal secretory KATP channel, the single channel conductance of Kir1.1a/CFTR deserves some comment. In the present study, we demonstrate a variable downward shift in the single channel conductance of Kir1.1a with co-expression of CFTR, from 36 pS in Kir1.1a alone to an average of 20 pS in Kir1.1a/CFTR. Sulfonylurea sensitivity and ATP-dependent gating properties appeared to be unique characteristic of the smaller conductance channel, making it likely that these particular channels reflect the interaction among CFTR and Kir1.1a subunits. The shift in the mean current amplitude of Kir 1.1a/CFTR to the subconductance level observed with Kir 1.1a is consistent with the CFTR-mediated stabilization of the smaller and more rare conductance state in the Kir 1.1a-only channels. A mutation in the Kir1.1 channel that eliminates a site for protein kinase A phosphorylation also stabilizes the subconductance state (29MacGregor G.G. Xu Z-C. Yang Y. McNicholas C.M. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7 (abstr.)1285Google Scholar), suggesting a possible mechanism for the CFTR induced change in the conductive properties.In any regard, the conductive properties of Kir1.1a/CFTR are more similar to those initially reported for the native secretory channel than Kir1.1a alone. Frindt and Palmer (25Frindt G. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F143-F151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that the apical membrane K+ channel in the cortical collecting duct exhibited an inward slope conductance of 22–25 pS at room temperature, smaller than Kir1.1a but more similar to Kir1.1a/CFTR. In agreement with these early observations and as predicted by the temperature dependence of aqueous diffusion (Q 10 = 1.3–1.8) (30Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992: 329Google Scholar), latter measurements at 37 °C placed the value at 36 ps (7Wang W. Schwab A. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F494-F502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although all these observations are more compatible with Kir1.1a/CFTR than the Kir1.1a channel, it should be pointed out that Palmer et al. (31Palmer L.G. Choe H. Frindt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F404-F410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently come to a different conclusion in a systematic comparison of the native channel to Kir1.1b (ROMK2), a splice variant that lacks the first 19 amino acid residues of Kir1.1a. These investigators now report that the conductive properties of the two channels are more similar (31Palmer L.G. Choe H. Frindt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F404-F410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At room temperature both channels exhibit a inward slope conductance of 36 pS. At present we can not wholly account for the disconcordance between these more recent measurements in the native secretory KATP channel and our own with Kir1.1a/CFTR. However, co-expression of CFTR appears to be absolutely required for the acquisition of ATP and sulfonylurea-sensitivity in Kir1.1a.The time dependence of ATP inhibition in the native channel has never been systematically studied under ideal conditions (i.e. an oil gate). Nevertheless, based on what can be inferred from work with the native channel, it would appear that inhibition of the Kir1.1a/CFTR channel often occurs at a slower rate than the kidney channel. At present, the mechanism underlying the kinetics of ATP-dependent inhibition in Kir1.1a/CFTR, or any KATP channel for that matter, are unknown. Based on the variability of the response, however, we speculate that ATP-dependent modulation may be dependent on a particular conformational state of Kir1.1a/CFTR. Obviously, further work to elucidate the mechanism by which CFTR interacts with Kir1.1a to form a KATP channel will be necessarily before a mechanism is established with any certainty.CFTR-dependent modulation of other ion channels, involving either direct or indirect interaction mechanisms (20Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), provides some clues, however. While still controversial, activation of the outward rectifying chloride channel in respiratory epithelia is perhaps the best characterized example of indirect regulation (32Egan M. Flotte T. Afione S. Solow R. Zeitlin P.L. Carter B.J. Guggino W.B. Nature. 1992; 358: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In this system, CFTR is thought to mediate the efflux of ATP which in turn increases outward rectifying chloride channel activity through a purinergic receptor signaling pathway (33Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T.H. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Cutting G.R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In contrast to this autocrine mechanism of interaction, our observations point to a membrane delimited pathway. CFTR-dependent modulation of Kir1.1a, revealed by the decrease in single channel conductance, acquisition of sulfonylurea sensitivity and development ATP-dependent gating properties, were observed in the excised patch configuration. Furthermore, the interaction between CFTR and Kir1.1a occurred in the apparent absence of any autocrine regulators, addition of kinases or nucleotides for phosphorylation, making an indirect pathway unlikely. While we can not rule out a role of undefined linker proteins, such as cytoskeletal elements, our observations strongly imply that CFTR modifies Kir1.1a by direct protein-protein interactions, similar to that proposed for CFTR-dependent modulation of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (34Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) and Kir6.2/SUR1 (35Clement J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Recently, the pancreatic islet beta cell KATP channel has recently been shown to consist of an (SUR1-Kir6.2)4 octamer, comprised of a Kir 6.2 tetramer, forming the K+ selective pore, surrounded by four SUR1 subunits (35Clement J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Based on homology, it seems plausible that the organization of CFTR and Kir1.1a subunits is similar. While the distribution of several different conductance states in CFTR/Kir1.1a may suggest the CFTR interaction stoichiometry is variable, further experimentation is required before any definitive conclusions can be made.The domains of the Kir1.1a/CFTR complex that confer ATP and sulfonylurea sensitivity are presently unknown. The molecular homology of CFTR to sulfonylurea receptors, all members of the ATP-binding cassette family of proteins, suggests that CFTR acts as the sulfonylurea receptor in the Kir1.1a/CFTR channel. Certainly, the close concordance in the affinity of the Kir1.1a/CFTR channel for glibenclamide and that of CFTR alone (19Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 573-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) support this view. The functional domains responsible for ATP-sensitivity remain more obscure. Because CFTR contains two functional nucleotide binding domains (36Smit L.S. Wilkinson D.J. Mansoura M.K. Collins F.S. Dawson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9963-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), similar to the nucleotide binding domains in SUR1 that have been implicated nucleotide-dependent modulation of the islet beta cell KATP (37Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement J.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Bryan J. Science. 1996; 272: 1785-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), it is possible that these sites play some role. Alternatively, a recent report by Tucker et al.(38Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) with Kir 6.2 suggests that the critical ATP binding site resides in the Kir subunit. In agreement with this notion with ROMK channels, Kir1.1a contains a functional nucleotide binding domain (39McNicholas C.M. Yang Y. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F275-F285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Welling P.A. Salyer L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7 (abstr.)1294Google Scholar). Subsequently, CFTR may stabilize a more favorable gating conformation in Kir1.1a, allowing direct ATP-binding with Kir1.1a to induce channel closure. Obviously, further study is required to determine the relative importance of each of the nucleotide-binding domains in the two different subunits of the renal epithelial KATPchannel.In summary, we have shown that co-expression of Kir1.1a (ROMK1) with CFTR in Xenopus oocytes reconstitute unique low-sulfonylurea affinity KATP similar to those involved in renal K+ excretion and K+ homeostasis. The implication of this study that Kir subunits can interact with ATP binding cassette proteins beyond the subfamily of sulfonylurea receptors provides an intriguing explanation for functional diversity in KATP channels. Extracellular potassium homeostasis, maintained through the regulation of renal potassium excretion (1Wright F.S. Giebisch G. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology.

Having this multimeric Kir/ABC protein motif in mind, we explored the possibility that the distal nephron KATP channel is encoded by unique Kir and ATP-binding cassette proteins as a basis for its distinct functional properties. While Kir 1.1a appeared to be an excellent candidate for the inward rectifying K+ channel subunit, the identity of the ABC subunit remained less certain. As might be surmised from the low sulfonylurea sensitivity of renal KATP channels, neither the pancreatic islet beta cell (SUR1) nor the cardiac myocyte (SUR2A) ABC proteins are expressed in the kidney (14Aguilar-Bryan L.

How such plant cells avoid intoxication has remained an open question. Here we report the transient expression of a number of ricin A chain-encoding cDNA constructs in tobacco protoplasts. Ricin A chain entered the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, where it was efficiently glycosylated, but it was toxic to the cells and disappeared with time in a brefeldin A-insensitive manner, suggesting reverse translocation to the cytosol and eventual degradation. Proricin (the natural precursor form containing A and B chains joined together by a linker sequence) was glycosylated, transported to the vacuole, and processed to its mature form, but was not toxic. Free ricin A chain and proricin were not secreted, whereas free ricin B chain was found entirely in the extracellular medium. The coexpression of ricin A and B chains resulted in the formation of disulfide-linked, transport-competent heterodimers, which were secreted, with a concomitant reduction in the observed cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the production of ricin as a precursor is essential for its routing to the vacuole and for protection of ricin-producing cells.

Ricin is a cytotoxin present in the endosperm of Ricinus communis seeds, where it accumulates in protein bodies (storage vacuoles) to 5% of the total particulate protein (1Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Robertus J.D. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Structurally, ricin is a heterodimeric glycoprotein comprising a ribosome-inactivating A chain (RTA) 1The abbreviations used are: RTA, ricin toxin A chain; RTB, ricin toxin B chain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BFA, brefeldin A; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; pRTA, ricin A chain preceded by a signal sequence; cRTA, cytosolic RTA lacking a signal sequence. and a galactose-binding B chain (RTB) covalently linked by a single disulfide bond. RTA (glycosylated molecular mass ∼of 32 kDa) catalyzes the removal of a single adenine from a highly conserved loop of 28 S/26 S/25 S rRNA within the context of a eukaryotic ribosome (2Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ribosomes depurinated in this manner are unable to bind the elongation factor-2·GTP complex, and protein synthesis is blocked at the translocation step of the elongation cycle (3Osborn R.W. Hartley M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The precise activity of RTA varies depending on the source of ribosomes. Thus, a single A chain molecule can depurinate 1000–2000 mammalian cell ribosomes/min under physiological conditions (2Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This can be measured in vitroas a DC50 (the concentration causing 50% depurination) of ∼5 ng/ml under standard conditions. Although ricin A chain is certainly active against tobacco ribosomes, the DC50 value is 650 ng/ml, showing that tobacco ribosomes are ∼130-fold less sensitive than mammalian or salt-washed yeast ribosomes (4Taylor S. Massiah A. Lomonossoff G. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Hartley M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, such is the potency of RTA that should it begin to accumulate within the cytosol of tobacco leaf protoplasts, the protein biosynthetic capacity of the expressing cells would be severely compromised. When heterodimeric ricin is presented to the surface of mammalian cells, RTB opportunistically binds to membrane components with exposed galactose residues. Toxin molecules are then endocytosed to a specific internal compartment from which RTA translocates to reach the cytosol, where the ribosomes are located. There is now considerable evidence supporting the cytosolic entry of RTA from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen (5Simpson J.C. Dascher C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20078-20083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Simpson J.C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Exp.

The possibility of studying the retrotranslocation of RTA by directly delivering the protein to the ER lumen has been explored, but attempts to express RTA in eukaryotic cells such as mammalian and yeast cells have failed due to the extreme sensitivity of the ribosomes to the toxins. 2L. Frigerio, A. Vitale, J. M. Lord, A. Ceriotti, and L. M. Roberts, unpublished results. This poses obvious questions concerning the biosynthesis of toxinin planta. If the ER is the compartment for reverse translocation of toxin to the cytosol in eukaryotic cells, how does the synthesizing plant cell avoid intoxication? Cells of R. communis synthesize ricin as a precursor polypeptide (preproricin) with a glycosylated molecular mass of ∼68 kDa (8Butterworth A.G. Lord J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This protein consists of RTA (preceded by a signal peptide) and RTB joined by a short linker peptide (9Lamb F.I. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). From the ER lumen, proricin is transported to storage vacuoles via vesicular transport through the Golgi complex (10Lord J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Only upon correct targeting to these storage vacuoles is the linker between RTA and RTB removed to yield mature toxin (10Lord J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ricin then stably accumulates within the low pH environment of these storage organelles. That RTA exists in the Ricinus cell ER as part of a precursor may render it incompetent for reverse translocation across the ER membrane, a possible safeguard against cell suicide. Here we present evidence that the cellular fate of RTA can vary depending on the form of toxin expressed within tobacco protoplasts. Indeed, it is only when RTA is synthesized as part of the preproricin molecule that it is delivered, with minimal cytotoxicity, to its normal destination of the vacuoles. All coding sequences derive from the full-length preproricin cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession numberX03179) and were cloned in the CaMV35S promoter-driven expression vector pDHA (11Tabe L.M. Wardley-Richardson T. Ceriotti A. Aryan A. McNabb W. Moore A. Higgins T.J.V. J. Anim. Sci. 1995; 73: 2752-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The basic features of the inserts in the different constructs are summarized in Fig. 1. Full-length preproricin was subcloned as an XbaI/PstI fragment intoXbaI/PstI-cut pDHA. pRTA, encoding pre-RTA (residues 1–302 on the preproricin cDNA clone (9Lamb F.I. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)) was constructed by cloning an XbaI/PstI fragment from pGEMRA (12May M.J. Hartley M.R. Roberts L.M. Krieg P.A. Osborn R.W. Lord J.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) into the same sites of pDHA. cRTA, encoding a truncated form of pRTA starting at Met-12, was excised from pGEM1RA (13O'Hare M. Roberts L.M. Thorpe P.E. Watson G.J. Prior B. Lord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as anXbaI/PstI fragment and cloned into the same sites of pDHA. To obtain pRTB, the sequence encoding the full signal peptide (residues 1–24) of β-phaseolin (SwissProt accession number P02853) (14Slightom J.L. Drong R.F. Klassy R.C. Hoffman L.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6483-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was fused to the mature RTB coding sequence via overlapping mutagenic polymerase chain reaction. The fusion protein was then inserted into the XbaI/PstI sites of pDHA. The construction of pDHET343F has been described (15Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. De Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This construct contains the complete coding sequence of a phaseolin variant in which the glycosylation site at position 341 has been destroyed. For transient expression of all constructs, protoplasts were prepared from axenic leaves of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana SR1. Protoplasts were subjected to polyethylene glycol-mediated transfection as described (15Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. De Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Vector pDHA without inserts was used as a negative control for transfection. After transfection, protoplasts were allowed to recover overnight in the dark at 25 °C in K3 medium (Gamborg's B5 basal medium with minimal organics (Sigma), supplemented with 750 mg/liter CaCl2·2H2O, 250 mg/liter NH4NO3, 136.2 g/liter sucrose, 250 mg/liter xylose, 1 mg/liter 6-benzylaminopurine, and 1 mg/liter α-naphthaleneacetic acid, pH 5.5) at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. Protoplasts float in K3 medium and can be kept viable in this medium for days. Protoplasts were radiolabeled by incubation in the dark at 25 °C in K3 medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 100 μCi/ml Pro-Mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chase was performed by adding unlabeled methionine and cysteine to 10 and 5 mm, respectively. In some experiments, before radioactive labeling, protoplasts were incubated for 45 min at 25 °C in K3 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) (Boehringer Mannheim; 2 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol, stored at −20 °C) or 50 μg/ml tunicamycin (Boehringer Mannheim; 5 mg/ml stock solution in 10 mm NaOH, stored at 4 °C). At the desired time points, 3 volumes of W5 medium (154 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 125 mmCaCl2·2H2O, and 5 mm glucose) were added, and protoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 60 × g for 5 min. Due to the composition of W5 medium, protoplasts sink without bursting. The supernatant, containing secreted proteins, was removed, leaving 50 μl above the protoplast pellet. Cells and supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The frozen samples were homogenized by adding 2 volumes of protoplast homogenization buffer (150 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with “complete” protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim). After vortexing, the homogenates were used for immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against native RTA and RTB fromR. communis, against phaseolin from common bean, and immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein from tobacco (15Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. De Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (16D'Amico L. Valsasina B. Daminati M.G. Fabbrini M.S. Nitti G. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant J. 1992; 2: 443-455PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modification. To reduce nonspecific immunoselection, rabbit anti-RTA and anti-RTB antisera were preincubated on ice for 45 min with unlabeled protoplast homogenate, before adding the radiolabeled samples. Radioactive samples were then analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Rainbow 14C-methylated proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as molecular mass markers. Gels were treated with Me2SO/2,5-diphenyloxazole (17Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar), and radioactive polypeptides were revealed by autoradiography. Protoplast pellets (from 125,000–500,000 cells) obtained at the desired time points during pulse-chase were resuspended in 400 μl of sucrose buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 12% (w/w) sucrose) and homogenized by repeated passage through a syringe needle. Intact cells and debris were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g. The supernatant was removed and loaded on top of a 17% (w/w) sucrose pad and centrifuged in a Beckman SW 55 Ti rotor at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Pellets (microsomes) and supernatants (soluble proteins) were diluted in protoplast homogenization buffer and immunoprecipitated as described above. Toxicity of the various constructs was assayed by cotransfecting β-phaseolin and monitoring its level of synthesis. Toxicity was expressed as the percentage of β-phaseolin immunoselected from toxin-transfected protoplasts compared with mock-transfected protoplasts. Cells were cotransfected with one of the toxin constructs and with the phaseolin-encoding construct pDHET343F and allowed to recover overnight. Cells were then pulse-labeled for 1 h. Radiolabeled phaseolin was then immunoselected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Quantification of the relative intensities of bands was performed by microdensitometry using a Camag TLC Scanner II (Muttenz, Switzerland). Care was taken to use film exposures that were in the linear range of film darkening. A variety of constructs were prepared for expression in tobacco protoplasts (Fig. 1). Preproricin is encoded by the cDNA as isolated from R. communismRNA, which had been modified to include the 5′-terminal ATG codon (18Halling K.C. Halling A.C. Murray E.E. Ladin B.F. Houston L.L. Weaver R.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8019-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which was missing in the original cDNA clone (9Lamb F.I. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This cDNA was used to prepare expression constructs encoding preproricin or the toxin subunits as shown in Fig. 1 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). While pRTA encodes RTA preceded by a full signal peptide, the sequence encoding most of the natural signal peptide is missing in the cRTA construct. β-Phaseolin encodes phaseolin with an N-terminal signal peptide (19Ceriotti A. Pedrazzini E. Fabbrini M.S. Zoppé M. Bollini R. Vitale A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and was used in cotransfection experiments for the expression of an immunoprecipitable marker to assess the protein biosynthetic capacity of toxin-transfected protoplasts. We transfected tobacco leaf protoplasts with plasmids encoding preproricin or vector alone (control). We then pulse-labeled the protoplasts with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 1 h and chased them for different times in the presence of unlabeled amino acids. We homogenized protoplasts in the presence of non-ionic detergent to solubilize all the proteins present in the endomembrane system. Immunoprecipitation with anti-RTA antiserum showed that, after the pulse, preproricin-transfected cells synthesized a polypeptide that has an apparent molecular mass of 68–70 kDa (Fig.2 A). This is equivalent to the expected size of the glycosylated ricin precursor. After a 5-h chase, however, most of the precursor had disappeared, and immunoreactive bands were detected with the expected sizes of mature glycosylated RTA (32 kDa) and RTB (34 kDa). Minor polypeptides around 40–46 kDa were present also in mock-transfected protoplasts and therefore do not represent ricin. Thus, proricin was being proteolytically processed within tobacco cells to release the toxin subunits. The conversion from the precursor form to the mature subunits was particularly evident when samples were analyzed at intermediate chase times (Fig. 2 C). These data are in agreement with earlier work tracing the transport of proricin within Ricinus cells (10Lord J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Indeed, the processing activity has been shown to reside in acidic storage vacuoles (10Lord J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Harley S.M. Lord J.M. Plant Sci. 1985; 42: 111-116Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the presence of BFA, which prevents transport of storage proteins to the vacuole in transgenic tobacco (15Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. De Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21Gomez L. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the appearance of mature subunits was prevented (Fig. 2, A and C), as would be expected if proricin were normally transported to storage vacuoles via vesicular transport through the Golgi stack. Proricin was never detected in the extracellular medium (data not shown). That mature RTA and RTB are covalently linked is shown in Fig.2 B, a duplicate of Fig. 2 A, except that the samples were run under nonreducing conditions. Proricin contains five intrachain disulfide bonds, which results in its having an apparently lower molecular mass on gels than when these bonds are broken under reducing conditions (Fig. 2, A and C). The small size difference observed between proricin and mature holotoxin after the chase in the absence of BFA (Fig. 2 B) most likely represents loss of the 12-amino acid linker during toxin maturation. When experiments similar to the ones described above were performed using the two RTA constructs (viz. with and without the ricin signal peptide), there was a dramatic loss of RTA during the chase period (Fig. 3 A). This was particularly noticeable for the RTA possessing a signal peptide (pRTA). Such apparent loss was not prevented by continuous treatment of the protoplasts with BFA, suggesting that RTA was not being secreted or targeted to and degraded within acidic vacuoles. Analysis of the extracellular medium revealed a complete absence of RTA (not shown here, but see Fig. 6). By treating protoplasts with tunicamycin (an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation), it was evident that all the detectable pRTA was glycosylated (Fig. 3 B). As expected, tunicamycin did not have any effect on cRTA mobility, confirming the cytosolic localization of this RTA variant. Thus, pRTA was being translocated into the lumen of the ER and becoming glycosylated prior to an apparent degradation that did not depend on Golgi complex-mediated transport to the vacuole. The glycosylated RTA observed after a 1-h pulse in the presence of BFA had a slightly lower molecular mass than that made in the absence of BFA (Fig.3 A, compare lane 3 with lane 1). This is probably the result of oligosaccharide-trimming events catalyzed by Golgi enzymes after their redistribution to the ER following BFA treatment (15Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. De Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The time course of degradation of cytosolic and ER-segregated forms of RTA was also analyzed (Fig. 3 C). Degradation started within the first hour of chase and occurred with comparable kinetics for both RTA forms, with pRTA being degraded at a slightly faster rate than cRTA.Figure 6Synthesis, assembly, and transport of individually expressed ricin A and B chains. Tobacco protoplasts were transfected with pRTA or pRTB or cotransfected with both constructs. A, cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h and chased for 4 h. The cell homogenates and the culture media were immunoprecipitated with anti-RTA (lanes 1, 2,5, and 6) and anti-RTB (lanes 3 and4) antisera. B, cells transfected with pRTA and pRTB and pulse-labeled for 1 h were homogenized, immunoprecipitated with anti-RTA antiserum, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agents.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) pRTA glycosylation demonstrates that this protein is initially translocated to the ER. However, the BFA-insensitive degradation suggests that, as must occur in intoxicated mammalian cells, the glycosylated polypeptide is retrotranslocated to the cytosol. To compare the cellular location of pRTA with that of proricin and mature toxin subunits, cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h and chased for 4 h. Protoplasts were then homogenized in buffer containing 12% (w/w) sucrose, which is isosmotic with the cytosol and avoids bursting of the microsomes originating from the ER and the Golgi complex; the soluble proteins contained in the vacuoles, which rupture completely during homogenization, are released and remain in the soluble fraction, even when subjected to high speed centrifugation (15Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. De Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,22Gomord V. Denmat L.-A. Fitchette-Laine A.-C. Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. Hawes C. Faye L. Plant J. 1997; 11: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The homogenates were centrifuged through a sucrose pad to separate microsomal pellets from soluble material. Immunoselection of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein revealed the integrity of the microsomal fraction (Fig.4 A). Glycosylated RTA was present in the microsomal fraction predominantly after the 1-h pulse, but after a 4-h chase, it had largely disappeared (Fig. 4 B). When protoplasts expressing preproricin were similarly labeled and fractionated (Fig. 4 C), the precursor was found mainly in microsomes at the 1-h time point, whereas processed subunits were prevalent only in the soluble fraction after 4 h, indicating their likely presence in the vacuolar fraction. The presence of precursor polypeptides in the soluble fraction at the end of the pulse probably represents a fraction of proricin polypeptides that have already reached the vacuole, but have not yet undergone proteolytic maturation. Since RTA has ribosome-inactivating ability, it was of interest to assess the toxicity of these proteins to the tobacco cells. Since the percentage of protoplasts transfected is low, usually on the order of ∼10%, a standard measurement of [35S]methionine/cysteine incorporation into protein of the entire population of cells would be meaningless. It was therefore important to examine the transfected cell population alone. This was achieved by cotransfecting protoplasts with DNA encoding toxin together with DNA encoding phaseolin, a nontoxic storage protein normally found in Phaseolus vulgaris seeds. After cotransfection, cells were incubated overnight to allow accumulation of the exogenous mRNAs and then subjected to pulse labeling for 1 h. Radiolabeled phaseolin was immunoselected, and its synthesis was quantified by densitometry of the immunoprecipitated bands, relative to the control transfection in which toxin DNA was excluded. The results are shown in Fig.5, revealing that proricin was not toxic to cells, whereas both glycosylated RTA and cytosolic RTA showed significant inhibition of phaseolin synthesis. It should be noted that the inhibition measured by pulse labeling is the result of the continuous synthesis of RTA during the overnight incubation that preceded the pulse period. It seems unlikely that glycosylated RTA could inhibit cytosolic ribosomes from the lumen of the ER. Therefore, glycosylated toxin is most probably retrotranslocated from the endomembrane system to the cytosol. To examine whether coexpression of RTB would permit assembly of a mature toxin within the ER and whether such assembly might reduce the toxicity caused by glycosylated RTA, protoplasts were cotransfected with pRTB and pRTA DNAs and pulse-labeled and chased in the standard way. Immunoprecipitates are shown in Fig.6 A. Both pRTA and pRTB, when expressed singly or together, were detectable intracellularly at the end of the pulse, but not after the chase. Examination of the extracellular medium revealed that free pRTB and coexpressed pRTA/pRTB were being secreted from the cells. By contrast, free glycosylated RTA was not found in the medium after the chase period. Thus, pRTB expression leads to the stabilization and secretion of pRTA, which is otherwise degraded intracellularly. The co-immunoprecipitation of pRTA and pRTB with anti-RTA antibodies indicates that pRTA stabilization and secretion are due to the formation of pRTA-pRTB heterodimers. Indeed, when the coexpressed sample was analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, it was clear that the two subunits are disulfide-bonded, suggesting a post-translational assembly of mature toxin in the ER lumen, followed by secretion rather than a routing to vacuoles. Not all the pRTA was present as a disulfide-linked dimer, as judged by the presence of free pRTA in the nonreduced sample (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly, the synthesis of pRTA was found to be consistently higher in protoplasts coexpressing both subunits. To investigate whether this reflected a pRTB quenching effect on the toxicity of the coexpressed pRTA, incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into the reporter protein phaseolin was again examined. As shown in Fig. 5, pRTB coexpression partially rescued phaseolin synthesis in pRTA-expressing protoplasts. pRTB coexpression must therefore interfere with step(s) involved in the presentation of the toxic subunit to cytosolic ribosomes. In this work, we have compared the intracellular targeting and toxicity of preproricin and the two ricin subunits when expressed in tobacco protoplasts. Preproricin is synthesized, transported, and processed to a heterodimer, reflecting correct vesicular transport to the vacuoles and endoproteolytic processing after deposition, analogous to events within castor bean seeds (10Lord J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Indeed, this pathway is taken by many storage proteins and lectins, including those from bean, rice, pea, barley, and pumpkin (15Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. De Virgilio M. Frigerio L.

Vacuoles of leaf cells have a higher hydrolytic activity than those of storage tissues. However, it has been shown for some proteins normally accumulated in storage vacuoles that they are faithfully processed when expressed in vegetative tissues or protoplasts (24Wilkins T.A. Bednarek S. Raikhel N. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Edwards G.A. Hepher A. Clerk S.P. Boulter D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whereas the ricin precursor is correctly targeted to the vacuole, the reconstituted pRTA-pRTB dimer is secreted, indicating that the targeting information for routing to vacuoles normally requires the 12-amino acid linker. Expression of preproricin does not affect the synthesis of a marker protein, showing that the precursor form is efficiently targeted to the ER lumen and is absent in the ribosome-containing cytosol (Fig. 5). The presence of RTB within the precursor may render the ER-segregated material incapable of export back to the cytosol. The data suggest that once transported through the Golgi complex and processed intracellularly, the mature toxin can safely accumulate in vacuoles of plant cells. The interchain disulfide bond would be very stable in such a low pH compartment and might be important in maintaining mature ricin incompetent for translocation to the cytosol. When cytosolic or ER-targeted RTA was expressed, the proteins were unstable, and we observed a strong reduction in the synthesis of coexpressed phaseolin. Since all detectable ER-targeted RTA was in a glycosylated state, it is likely that toxicity was due to reverse translocation of pRTA from the ER lumen (the site ofN-glycosylation) to the cytosol. Alternatively, this toxicity might be due to a tiny fraction of non-segregated, non-glycosylated pRTA, too low in amount to visualize. The latter explanation would appear unlikely in that the level of toxicity observed is equivalent to that seen when RTA is deliberately expressed in the cytosol. It seems more likely that a significant amount of glycosylated pRTA was able to reach the ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis. This interpretation is also supported by the observation that pRTB coexpression reduces the toxic effect of synthesizing pRTA. This strongly suggests that pRTB is sequestering a fraction of ER-located RTA from the pathway that leads to its presentation to cytosolic ribosomes. The effect of pRTB on pRTA toxicity must be exerted within the ER and cannot be due to an interaction occurring in the cytosol since microinjected RTA-RTB dimers are potently active on ribosomes (26Saxena S.K. O'Brien A.D. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 596-601Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The observation that pRTB expression mitigates the toxicity of pRTA is apparently in contrast with the high toxicity of ricin holotoxin to mammalian cells. However, in these cells, ricin might be subjected to activation steps during internalization and retrograde transport, which are essential for its toxicity. Such steps may not occur when newly made holotoxin is assembled in the endomembrane system of plant cells. Recent evidence suggests that, in mammalian cells, the presence of RTB is not essential for RTA to enter the cell (6Simpson J.C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); rather, RTB increases the efficiency of binding to the cell surface and internalization. RTB is therefore likely to dissociate from RTA at some stage during retrograde transport, although where this might occur is not known. The observed toxicity of ER-targeted RTA and its rapid degradation might be linked events. Indeed, the ER lumen is a major cellular site of protein folding and oligomerization, and it has been recognized for some time that proteins that do not fold or assemble properly in the ER are rapidly degraded (27Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that several defective proteins are not degraded within the ER, but rather by the cytosolic ubiquitin/proteasome system. For example, in the presence of particular viral gene products in mammalian cells, glycosylated major histocompatibility complex class I molecules can be transported from the ER to the cytosol for degradation (28Wiertz E. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Malfolded secretory proteins have also been shown to exit the yeast ER (29Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 30Hiller M.H. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The ER is therefore able to rapidly and selectively export proteins and glycoproteins back into the cytosol, possibly by reverse translocation through the Sec61p-containing translocons that normally deliver nascent proteins into the ER lumen (31Wiertz E. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). If this is the fate of pRTA, it may be that, in the absence of pRTB, pRTA is recognized as an unassembled subunit of an oligomeric protein and thus dislocated for degradation in the cytosol. Thus, we might have recreated within plant cells the translocationally competent form of RTA that is not normally found in the ER of the toxin-producing plant cells. We tested the effect of “classical” proteasome inhibitors such as lactacystin (32Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 286: 726-731Crossref Scopus (1500) Google Scholar) and MG-132 (31Wiertz E. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) on the degradation kinetics of pRTA and cRTA (data not shown). At the concentrations normally effective in mammalian cells, these inhibitors did not prevent RTA degradation when added to tobacco protoplasts. This is apparently the case in yeast cells also (33Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Whether this is due to inefficient uptake by the plant cells, to a lower sensitivity of the plant proteasome to the drugs, or to the fact that the degradative pathway of RTA does not involve the proteasome is not clear at present. These findings, however, preclude the experimental approach successfully used with mammalian cells. We should add that no successful application of proteasome inhibitors has been reported in plants so far. Although a fraction of pRTA must reach the cytosol to exert its toxic effects, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the bulk of free pRTA is delivered to the vacuole for degradation. However, vacuolar degradation is not supported by results from the BFA experiments. These show that pRTA degradation is not affected by BFA, whereas proricin delivery to the vacuole can be efficiently inhibited by the drug. Thus, if the bulk of pRTA is degraded in the vacuole, the pathway followed during transport from the ER must radically differ from that followed by proricin, which utilizes a route through the BFA-sensitive Golgi stack. An autophagic route to the vacuole has been shown to participate in storage protein deposition in wheat endosperm (34Levanony K.H. Rubin R. Altschuler Y. Galili G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1117-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Overall, the behavior of pRTA is similar to that of an assembly-defective mutant of the trimeric storage protein phaseolin. In protoplasts from transgenic tobacco, wild-type phaseolin is targeted to the vacuole in a BFA-sensitive manner, whereas the assembly-defective mutant has a prolonged interaction with the ER chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein before being degraded in a process that cannot be inhibited by BFA (15Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. De Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this case also, the location of the degradation process remains to be established. It is also evident, from the efficient secretion of co-assembled pRTA-pRTB heterodimers, that pRTA does not possess an active vacuolar targeting signal. In contrast to the fates of pRTA and preproricin, free pRTB is efficiently secreted by protoplasts, indicating that, in plant cells, correct folding of this polypeptide can occur in the absence of RTA. This has been previously observed using Xenopus oocytes as an expression system (35Richardson P.T. Westby M. Roberts L.M. Gould J.H. Colman A. Lord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Secretion of pRTB also reveals the absence of a vacuolar targeting signal within the mature polypeptide. It would therefore appear that the signal utilized by ricin for vacuolar targeting resides within the 12-amino acid residue linker that connects RTA and RTB in the proricin precursor. Overall, it can be seen that RTA has a number of very different fates depending on the way it is synthesized in tobacco protoplasts. The preproricin precursor is clearly the most effective means of producing ricin in a nontoxic manner. Only when synthesized in this form can eukaryotic cells survive in the long term, as exemplified by the expression of preproricin in transgenic tobacco plants (36Sehnke P.C. Pedrosa L. Paul A.-L. Frankel A.E. Ferl R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22473-22476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of ricin in a precursor form most likely guarantees the perfect stoichiometric balance between the two subunits and the concomitant absence of any free RTA in the ER. Other efforts to successfully express ricin A chain in eukaryotic cells, including Xenopus oocytes, yeast, insect cells, and mammalian cells, have failed, and such work remains largely unpublished. The tobacco protoplast expression system therefore shows a unique feature: it allows the expression of RTA in a nonlethal fashion, providing an unprecedented tool to follow its intracellular fate and a means to measure the toxicity of the expressed protein in vivo. In addition to the relative resistance of tobacco ribosomes to RTA action, other factors may allow RTA synthesis in tobacco cells. If RTA is able to cross the ER membrane in tobacco protoplasts, it may arrive in the cytosol in an unfolded or partially folded state. Using mammalian ribosomes in vitro, we have evidence for ribosome-facilitated refolding of a partially unfolded RTA. 3R. H. Argent, L. M. Roberts, J. M. Lord, and S. E. Radford, unpublished results. This refolding may protect the toxin from degradation. By contrast, we may speculate that the more recalcitrant tobacco ribosomes do not facilitate refolding of RTA to the same degree, leaving a significant fraction of the toxin susceptible to degradation.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The yeast PIC has been expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli (10Pain D. Murakami H. Blobel G.

Methods have been described to solubilize mitochondrial carriers from inclusion bodies including PIC in a functionally active state (11Wohlrab H. Briggs C.

PIC is a typical member of the structural family of mitochondrial carriers with subunits of six transmembrane segments and a molecular mass of 32 kDa (14Aquila H. Link T.A. Klingenberg M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 15Kuan G. Dassa E. Saurin W. Hofnung M. Saier M.H. Res. Microbiol. 1995; 146: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). There are several lines of evidence that mitochondrial carriers do not function as monomers but form dimers in the functional state. The first and still one of the most convincing indications up to now was the observation of a binding stoichiometry of one molecule of the tightly binding ligand carboxyatractylate to two monomeric units of the ADP/ATP carrier (16Riccio P. Aquila H. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). An even lower binding stoichiometry was observed for the ligands ADP and ATP (17Weidemann M.J. Erdelt H. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 313-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), which in experiments with fluorescent nucleotide analogs led to the suggestion of a tetrameric functional unit of the ADP/ATP carrier (18Dupont Y. Brandolin G. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6343-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By using cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifuge techniques it was shown that the ADP/ATP carrier as well as the mitochondrial uncoupling protein, at least in the solubilized state, forms a homodimer (19Hackenberg H. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Lin C.S. Hackenberg H. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1980; 113: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In recent experiments the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bridge between the monomers of the ADP/ATP carrier provided further evidence for the dimeric state of this mitochondrial carrier (21Majima E. Ikawa K. Takeda M. Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29548-29554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Studies with PIC in mitochondria demonstrated the requirement of less than one NEM per subunit of PIC (22Wohlrab H. Collins A. Costello D. Biochemistry. 1993; 23: 1057-1064Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and in reconstituted proteoliposomes that a disulfide between Cys-28 of the two monomers reversibly blocks transport (23Phelps A. Wohlrab H. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 321Google Scholar). Besides these findings, it has been argued also on a theoretical point of view that a dimeric state is favorable for carrier function (24Klingenberg M. Nature. 1981; 290: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that there is a further reason for the acceptance of the dimeric nature of mitochondrial carriers, namely the “consensus minimal unit” of about 12 transmembrane segments which holds true for many carrier proteins (25Henderson P.J. Res. Microbiol. 1990; 141: 316-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Maloney P.C. Res. Microbiol. 1990; 141: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Marger M.D. Saier M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of secondary carriers has been investigated in a number of cases. Evidence has been provided for both the monomeric and the dimeric form of the E. coli lactose permease to be functional (28Sahin-Toth M. Lawrence M.C. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the dominating evidence suggests that lactose permease is functional as a monomer with 12 transmembrane segments (28Sahin-Toth M. Lawrence M.C. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The situation is not better understood for other well studied carriers. Mammalian facilitative sugar carriers, i.e.uniporters (GLUT-family) and Na+-coupled symporters (SGLT-family), were found to function both as monomers and oligomers, and cooperative interactions were suggested as a regulatory mechanism (29Hebert D.N. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4654-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Bell G.I. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Gould G.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9734-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). There is experimental evidence that also the erythrocyte anion transporter (band 3 protein) may exist as a mixture of dimers and tetramers (32Jennings M.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 80: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 33Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15726-15737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Reithmeier R.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 515-523Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but evidence for a monomeric function of this protein has also been provided (35Lindenthal S. Schubert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6540-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, by coexpression and co-reconstitution of functional and nonfunctional monomers of the small secondary carrier EmrE, the oligomeric state of this protein has been demonstrated (36Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, several of the methods used to prove oligomeric associations in these proteins may be questioned (37Kyte J. Nature. 1980; 292: 201-204Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and consequently their functional oligomeric structures have not yet been definitely established. The aim of the present work was to prove that the dimeric state is a prerequisite for function of PIC in the membrane. We used differently tagged PIC monomers to prepare defined heterodimers. The monomers were obtained after heterologous expression in E. coli and solubilization. Analyses of these constructs showed both an inability of monomers to function in phosphate transport and cross-talk between the subunits when integrated into stable dimers. [33P]Phosphate was obtained from Amersham-Buchler (Braunschweig, Germany). Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) supplied the following chemicals: mersalylic acid, dithiothreitol, HEPES, PIPES, anti-mouse IgG, alkaline phosphatase conjugate, turkey egg yolk phospholipid, Sigma Fast BCIP/NBT tablets. Dowex 2-X10, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate (SLS), and C12E8 were purchased from Fluka (Deisenhofen, Germany), C8Enfrom Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), Bio-Beads SM-2 from Bio-Rad (Munich, Germany), Sephadex G-75 from Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany), and N-ethylmaleimide and pyridoxal phosphate were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The micro BCA protein assay was used for protein determination and was purchased from Pierce. Ni-NTA-agarose and Ni-NTA alkaline phosphatase conjugate was purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). The FLAG system for protein tagging was purchased from Kodak (Rochester, MN). All further chemicals were of analytical grade. All sulfhydryl reagents used were prepared freshly. The reagents were diluted with water or the respective gel filtration buffer. Pyridoxal phosphate in high concentrations was dissolved in 1 mimidazole (pH 6.5). Cloning of DNA and subsequent transformation steps were carried out using standard techniques (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

The 3′ part of the mir gene coding for the phosphate carrier was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using two oligonucleotide primers annealing upstream (5′-GACTGCTGGTTTGGC-3′) of the KpnI site and downstream of the 3′ part thereby introducing the FLAG tag (5′-GGTGGTGGTGGTCATGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTAGGGATCC-3′) or the His tag (5′-GGTGGTGGTGGTCATCATCATCATCATCATTAGGGATCC-3′) (tags underlined), respectively, and a BamHI restriction site downstream from the stop codon. Polymerase chain reaction (30 s 94 °C, 30 s 50 °C, 60 s 72 °C, 30 cycles) was carried out using Taq polymerase (Boehringer, Mannheim) and a Thermo-Cycler 480 (Perkin-Elmer).

The polymerase chain reaction products were cut withBamHI and KpnI and cloned into the plasmid pUC18 for sequencing. Sequencing was carried out using a Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany) A.L.F. DNA sequencer and the AutoRead sequencing kit (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) as recommended by the supplier. Appropriate fragments were subsequently cloned into plasmid pNYHM131 via BamHI and KpnI restriction and ligation. All cloning steps were carried out in the E. coli strain DH5α. The expression of the different proteins was carried out in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as described below. Expression strain BL21 (DE3) carrying plasmids coding for the wild type PIC or a mutant, respectively, was transformed. A total of 1 liter of 2 × YT medium (plus 100 mg of carbenicillin) was inoculated with a fresh overnight colony of transformed BL21 (DE3) and grown to an OD600 of 0.6 (about 5 h) under vigorous shaking at 37 °C. Expression of PiC was initiated by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and 100 mg of carbenicillin was added. Growth was continued for 3 h, and the cells were harvested and stored at −20 °C. All the following steps were carried out on ice (11Wohlrab H. Briggs C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9371-9375Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cell pellet with the expressed PIC was suspended in TE (10 mm Tris base, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, adjusted to pH 7.0 with HCl) and passed twice through a French pressure cell, followed by centrifugation at 12,100 × g for 10 min. The pellet was homogenized in 10 ml of TE and centrifuged at 1,100 × g for 5 min; 8.8 ml of the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,100 ×g for 3 min. The pellet was stored at −20 °C. Isolation of PIC from the inclusion bodies was carried out as described (12Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem.

The pellet was suspended three times in TE buffer containing 2% Triton X-114, followed by a centrifugation at 12,100 × g for 2.5 min. The supernatant was discarded. Finally the pellet was solubilized in 400 μl of TE containing 1.5% SLS. After addition of 1% C12E8 the SLS-solublized protein was used for reconstitution directly or for subsequent dialysis. Functional reconstitution was not possible without addition of C12E8 or another nonionic detergent (see “Results” and Table I).Table IProtein recovery and phosphate transport activity after reconstitution of the wild type PIC from different detergentsDetergentRecoveryTransport activity%μmol/min · mg proteinTriton X-11460 ± 15144 ± 18Triton X-10045 ± 8108 ± 21C8En12 ± 536 ± 8C12E882 ± 10180 ± 25Dodecyl maltoside74 ± 1254 ± 16PIC was solubilized in SLS and dialyzed in the presence of different detergents as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein recovery is normalized to the protein concentration before dialysis.

Open table in a new tab PIC was solubilized in SLS and dialyzed in the presence of different detergents as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein recovery is normalized to the protein concentration before dialysis. Transport activity was determined as homologous phosphate/phosphate exchange in forward exchange experiments. Chemical modification of the monomeric PIC was achieved by incubating the SLS-solubilized PIC (before the addition of C12E8) with a freshly prepared solution of NEM (final concentration 2 mm) for 15 min in the dark at 4 °C. Excess NEM was removed by adding 10 mm DTT, 1% C12E8 was added afterward as described above. For detergent exchange 1% C12E8 was added to the solubilized PIC and dialyzed four times for 12 h against a 1000-fold excess of buffer. Composition of the buffers used was as follows: 400 mmLiCl, 20 mm PIPES, 0.03% NaN3 1 mmDTT (pH 6.5) (first dialysis); 400 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES (pH 6.5), 0.03% NaN3, 1 mm DTT (second dialysis); 100 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES, 0.03%, NaN3, 1 mm DTT (pH 6.5) (third dialysis); 300 mm NaCl, 50 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 8.5) (fourth dialysis). After dialysis the protein solutions were centrifuged. The Ni-NTA-agarose column was equilibrated in buffer A (300 mm NaCl, 50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 8.0). After application of the protein the column was washed with buffer B (buffer A containing 10% glycerol (v/v)). Elution was carried out using an imidazole gradient (0–0.5 m imidazole in buffer B). PIC protein was eluted at an imidazole concentration of 0.2 m. The fractions were collected and concentrated using Centricon 30 tubes (Amicon, Eschborn, Germany). After a 5-fold dilution with TBS buffer plus detergent (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% C12E8 (v/v), pH 7.4) the protein was applied to an anti-FLAG affinity column equilibrated with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) in a recycling procedure, i.e. the affinity chromatography was repeated five times. After washing the column with TBS the protein was eluted with TBS containing the FLAG-peptide. The eluted fractions were concentrated and used for reconstitution. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow (41Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) using gels containing 10% acrylamide and 6 m urea. For analysis under native conditions, urea was replaced by 12% glycerol, and SDS by SLS. For immunological detection of the different constructs the SDS gels were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in a semi-dry blotter (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar). The FLAG-specific antibody or the Ni-NTA-conjugate was added. In the case of the FLAG antibody the second alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody was added subsequently. The color reaction was initiated by adding freshly prepared 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP/NBT reagent) solution. The reaction was stopped after 10 min by adding 10 mm EDTA. PIC was reconstituted into pre-formed phospholipid vesicles by using the amberlite method (42Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This method was modified (13Schroers A. Krämer R. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 10558-10564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with regard to the applied phospholipid/protein and phospholipid/detergent ratio. Maximum exchange rates were obtained with a phospholipid concentration of 16 mg/ml, a phospholipid/protein ratio of 6.25 μg/mg, and a detergent/phospholipid ratio of 0.62 mg/mg. This means that 70 μl of Triton X-114 (10%, v/v), 112 μl of preformed liposomes (10% of egg yolk phospholipids in 50 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, KPi 20 mm, pH 6.5), 20 μl of protein solution; HEPES (pH 6.5, final concentration 50 mm) and phosphate (final concentration 30 mm) were added up to 700 μl. A detergent/amberlite ratio of 12 mg/g in combination with 15 column passages was used to remove the detergent (43Krämer R. Heberger C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 863: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The methods were identical to those described for the analysis of the aspartate/glutamate carrier (44Dierks T. Riemer E.

Transport activity was determined using forward exchange experiments (44Dierks T. Riemer E. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 943: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The assay was started by adding labeled phosphate. The time course of isotope equilibration was fitted to the data points according to a single exponential function {y = A · (1 −e−kt) + B} which delivered the apparent time constant k [min−1]. The specific activity (μmol/min · mg of protein) was calculated from k(min−1), from the final value of the isotope equilibration (dpm), the specific radioactivity (dpm/nmol), the volume of the proteoliposome fraction (ml), and the protein concentration (μg/ml) as published previously (44Dierks T. Riemer E. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 943: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In order to be able to monitor the formation of defined dimeric proteins, the individual monomers and the different types of dimers must be experimentally distinguishable. In the solublized state mitochondrial carriers are assumed to be dimers of identical monomers, PIC monomers had thus to be rendered different artificially. For this purpose, we constructed monomers of the wild type PIC with two different tags, namely the His-tag and the FLAG-tag. These tagged PIC monomers were separately and heterologously expressed in E. coli inclusion bodies, solubilized, and reconstituted. These two constructs, after reconstitution by themselves into proteoliposomes showed specific activities of phosphate transport comparable to the wild type protein (see below). We did not succeed in directly reconstituting PIC solubilized from inclusion bodies in SLS as the only detergent, however, after the simple addition of appropriate other detergents, reconstitution of the SLS-solubilized PIC was successful (see “Experimental Procedures and Table II). For proper formation of dimers and for optimum reconstitution, we tried several detergents for replacing SLS as the solublizing agent, some of which are listed in Table I. When considering both protein recovery after the dialysis step, in which protein is lost due to aggregation, as well as the specific transport activity obtained after reconstitution of the dialyzed protein, the polyoxyethylene detergent C12E8 proved to be most favorable. Consequently, this detergent was used in all further experiments. The various constructs and combinations were all active when reconstituted from preparations in which C12E8 was used as detergent (cf. Fig. 3 and TableII).Table IITransport activity of different PIC constructsPIC constructDetergentTransport activityμmol/min mg protein[PIC]SLS + C12E8124 ± 13[His-PIC]SLS + C12E8110 ± 16[FLAG-PIC]SLS + C12E895 ± 10[PIC]2C12E8180 ± 25[His-PIC]2C12E8159 ± 18[FLAG-PIC]2C12E8155 ± 22[His-PIC/FLAG-PIC]C12E8168 ± 14Activity was determined as homologous phosphate/phosphate exchange in forward exchange experiments.

Construction of the defined oligomers as described in the text. Detailed studies on the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier and uncoupling protein using analytical ultracentrifuge techniques have shown that these mitochondrial carrier proteins exist as dimers after solubilization with Triton X-100 (19Hackenberg H. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Lin C.S. Hackenberg H. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1980; 113: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial carriers used for these studies were isolated from intact mitochondria. The presence of monomers of these transport proteins has only been demonstrated in SDS gels. It is not known, however, under which conditions these dimers can be formed. The experimental strategy used in the present study could be applied due to the fact that we found that PIC was in a monomeric state when solubilized from E. coli inclusion bodies using SLS. This was established by several kinds of experiments. By gel electrophoresis using SLS as detergent instead of SDS, we showed that PIC, when solubilized from inclusion bodies, is in monomeric form (about 30 kDa), just like the protein in SDS gels (Fig.1). Although addition of the polyoxyethylene detergent C12E8 significantly improved the reconstitutibility of PIC, it did not change its behavior in the nondenaturing SLS gel. After dialysis and detergent exchange to C12E8, the apparent molecular weight in SLS was significantly increased, although not as much as would have been expected for a dimer. Besides the observation of an increased apparent molecular weight in SLS gels, however, the oligomeric (dimeric) state of PIC after dialysis was proven by the fact that stable homo- and heterodimers could be formed under these conditions (see below). It was not possible to reconstitute PIC in functionally active form from the SLS-solublized state directly (experiments not shown). This, however, was achieved by using SLS-solubilized protein after addition of nonionic detergents (see below). The conformational state of PIC in SLS micelles after solubilization from inclusion bodies was investigated using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This lead to an estimation of the α-helix content which is clearly too low (experiments not shown) when compared with results obtained for the purified ADP/ATP carrier by CD spectroscopy (47Klingenberg M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 4. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 511-553Crossref Google Scholar). A further experimental indication for PIC being in an unfolded state when solublized in SLS is the drastically changed accessibility of cysteines to the alkylating reagent NEM in comparison to PIC in functionally active form (see below). It is noteworthy, that by cross-linking studies applying intermolecular disulfide bridges it was found, that the ADP/ATP carrier is not in the correctly folded state even when solubilized in Triton X-100 (21Majima E. Ikawa K. Takeda M. Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29548-29554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). An interesting reconstitution experiment corroborated our findings of SLS-solubilized PIC being in the monomeric state as obtained by gel electrophoresis. In Fig. 2, the observed absolute transport activity of the reconstituted PIC protein is correlated to the amount of PIC incorporated into a constant amount of phospholipid. A linear dependence at low protein/phospholipid ratios for this kind of experiment has been found for many mitochondrial carriers (5Krämer R. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys.

The cycle is completed by translocation of a potassium ion in the opposite direction. Recently we have identified two adjacent amino acid residues of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 that influence potassium coupling. Using the scanning cysteine accessibility method we have now explored the highly conserved region surrounding them. Replacement of each of the five consecutive residues 396–400 by cysteine abolished transport activity but at several other positions the substitution is tolerated. One residue, tyrosine 403, was identified where cysteine substitution renders the transporter sensitive to modification by positively charged methanethiosulfonate derivates in a sodium-protectable fashion. In the presence of sodium, the nontransported glutamate analogue dihydrokainate potentiated the covalent modification, presumably by binding to the glutamate site and locking the protein in a conformation in which tyrosine 403 is accessible from the external bulk medium. In contrast, transported substrates significantly slowed the reaction, suggesting that during the transport cycle residue 403 becomes occluded. On the other hand, transportable substrates are not able to protect Y403C transporters against N-ethylmaleimide, which is highly permeant but unable to modify cysteine residues buried within membrane proteins.

We suggest that it is alternatingly accessible from either side of the membrane in a substrate-dependent manner. HeLa cells were cultured (26Keynan S. Suh Y.-J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Data presented are after subtracting the values obtained from cells transfected with the vector, pBluescript SK−, alone. In the case of some of the mutants and in particular if they were subcloned into the cDNA encoding the cysteine-less GLT-1 (see below), the sodium concentration of the transport medium was lowered to 15 mm (supplemented with 135 mm choline chloride) as the sodium affinity of aspartate transport endogenous to the HeLa cells is much lower than that of GLT-1 and its derivatives (data not shown). This enables us to obtain acceptable signal/background ratios, at least 4-fold, even in the case of relatively low activities exhibited by the cysteine-less transporter and its derivatives. Prior to the transport measurements, the cells, adhered to 24-well plates, were washed with the 150 mm NaCl containing transport medium. Each well was then incubated at room temperature with 200 μ l of this solution (in case of different composition this is indicated in the figure legends) and the indicated concentration of reagent under study. After 5 min the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of the transport solution. Subsequently they were assayed ford-[3H]aspartate transport using solution to which the labeled amino acid was added (22Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Most results reported in this study concern individual replacements of selected residues of the wild type GLT-1 by cysteine, but cysteine mutants in a cysteine-less background were also tested to confirm the specificity of the effects observed in the wild type background. The cysteine-less GLT-1 was prepared and characterized as follows: Cysteines 536, 549 and 562 are clustered together at the carboxyl-terminal tail. Because we have evidence that the major part of this tail is not required for transport,2 the stretch from residue 533 to residue 563 was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis. At the same cycle of the mutagenesis another primer was annealed simultaneously to the uracil-containing single-stranded DNA. It was designed to convert cysteine 38 to serine. After verifying by DNA sequencing that these changes were indeed incorporated, the construct was expressed and shown to be unimpaired ford-[3H]aspartate transport. Subsequently uracil-containing single-stranded DNA was prepared from this construct, and new cycles of mutagenesis, sequencing, and expression were performed to mutate the remaining cysteines to serine. In the second cycle, cysteines 60, 293, and 296 were converted, in the third 184, and in the fourth 373. In the subsequent cycle a deca-histidine tail was introduced between the last residue of GLT-1, lysine 573, and the stop codon. A major reason to prepare the above construct was for the determination of the membrane topology of GLT-1 by one of several approaches,3 namely, biotinylation of single cysteine-containing transporters. In this approach artifactual biotinylated bands are observed running with a similar mobility as the above described construct. To detect transporter-related signals, it was necessary to “mass-tag” the construct so that the transporter band would be resolved from the artifactual ones. We have shown previously that most of the amino-terminal tail of the GABA transporter GAT-1 is not required for its functional expression (31Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have inserted upstream of the original first methionine the coding sequence for the first 41 amino acids of GAT-1 preceded by the DNA sequence 5′-ATGCATTTCGTGCTCCGAGAC-3′, encoding for the amino acids MHFVLRD; the latter was added to facilitate its insertion using standard molecular biology approaches. Using GAT-1 as a template, the primers used for amplification were designed such that on both ends of the amplified fragment a StuI site was created. After digestion withStuI, the fragment was ligated into blunt ends created in the cysteine-less histidine-tagged GLT-1 described above, by cutting it with PflMI and removal of the 3′-overhangs with bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase. Plasmid DNA of several of the transformants was isolated and one of those, which gave rise to aspartate transport after expression, was retained. The result is that the 48 amino acids are inserted immediately amino-terminal to the original start codon of GLT-1. All the expected features of the modified cysteine-less GLT-1 were verified by sequencing in both directions and upon expression itsd-[3H]aspartate transport activity was found to be 44.5 ± 1.5% of that of the wild type GLT-1 (n = 7), and the level of expression as estimated by immunoprecipitation was comparable to that of the wild type (data not shown). The characteristics of transport of this cysteine-less histidine-tagged GLT-1 transporter were very similar to that of the wild type GLT-1, as judged by affinity to d-aspartate (Fig.1 A) and sodium (Fig.1 B). Single cysteine-containing transporters were made using uracil-containing single strand DNA derived from this construct. Mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutations Y403C and E404C were subcloned into wild type or cysteine-less GLT-1 using the enzymesBsrGI and BstEII. Subcloned DNAs were sequenced in both directions between these restriction sites. Residues 395–407 of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 have been changed one at a time to cysteine. After transient expression of the wild type and the cysteine replacement mutants in HeLa cells, transport ofd-[3H]aspartate was monitored. No transport can be detected when cysteine is introduced in each of the five consecutive residues from 396 to 400 (Fig.2). The possible role of these residues in the transport process will be addressed under “Discussion.” Right now we focus on the remaining residues, where cysteine replacement leaves significant biological activity (Fig. 2). Transport activity of wild type GLT-1 is not inhibited by 2.5 mm of the MTS derivative (MTSEA), and the same is true for all the active cysteine replacement mutants with the exception of Y403C (Fig. 3). When the preincubation with the sulfhydryl reagent is carried out in a sodium-free medium (choline substitution) E404C transporters become sensitive to the reagent as well (Fig. 4). It appears that sodium protects against covalent modification at this position, since similar data are obtained when the E404C mutation is introduced in a cysteine-less GLT-1 background (data not shown). Although not visible in the experiments depicted in Figs. 3 and 4, there is also a partial protection of Y403C transporters by sodium against inhibition by MTSEA. This can be readily observed at lower concentrations of this sulfhydryl reagent (Fig. 5). Similar results have been observed with the Y403C mutation introduced in a cysteine-less background (data not shown, but see Fig. 9). Other cations are not effective except for lithium, which affords a small but significant protection (data not shown). It is of interest to note that also in the case of E404C, lithium is the only cation besides sodium that can give a significant protection against inhibition by MTSEA (data not shown).Figure 4Inhibition of transport by MTSEA in the absence of sodium. This was carried out exactly as described in the legend to Fig. 3, except that in the preincubation and washing solutions sodium was replaced by the same concentration of choline.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Effect of sodium on inhibition of the Y403C transporter by MTSEA. HeLa cells expressing the transporters were preincubated for 5 min in sodium- or choline chloride-containing media without (control) or with 0.25 mm MTSEA. After washing the cells, sodium-dependent uptake ofd-[3H]aspartate was measured in triplicate in a 15 mm NaCl + 135 mm choline chloride-containing medium. Data are presented as percent activity of the control (± S.E.) of each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Effect of d-aspartate and dihydrokainic acid on inhibition of transport of Y403C in a cysteine-less background. The conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 8 using MTSEA at 0.1 mm. It should be noted that here, in contrast, to Fig. 8, data are presented as % inhibition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As will be shown below, the most striking observation described in this paper is the opposite effect of transportable and nontransportable substrates on the inhibition of Y403C by MTS reagents in a sodium-containing medium. In contrast, E404C transporters are not inhibited very much by MTSEA in the presence of sodium (Fig. 3), and the same is true when transporter substrates are added (data not shown). Therefore, we have focused on the characterization of functional effects of covalent modification of Y403C transporters. Wild type GLT-1 is not inhibited by the positively charged MTSEA and MTSET (Figs. 3, 4, and 6 A) and also not by MTSES (data not shown). In contrast with wild type, not only MTSEA (Fig. 3) but also MTSET potently inhibit Y403C transporters (Fig.6 A). On the other hand, negatively charged MTSES does not (Fig. 6 B). Because MTSES is intermediate in size between MTSEA and MTSET (23Akabas M. Stauffer D. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), it appears that the positive charge in the reagent determines its ability to inhibit. After preincubation of Y403C transporters with MTSES, they still can be inhibited by a subsequent exposure to MTSEA (Fig. 6 B). This speaks against the possibility that the residue can be covalently modified MTSES but that this does not lead to inhibition of transport. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 7, Y403C transporters are preincubated with 0.25 mm MTSEA in a sodium-containing medium. When transport ofd-[3H]aspartate is subsequently measured, an inhibition of almost 80% is observed. When a saturating concentration (1 mm) of transportable acidic amino acids such asd- and l-aspartate or l-glutamate is added during the preincubation, this causes a marked protection of the transporters against the inhibition by MTSEA (Fig. 7). This protection is only observed in the presence of sodium ions (data not shown). Amino acids that are not substrates of GLT-1, such as GABA or glycine, do not protect (Fig. 7). The protective effect ofd-aspartate is dose dependent; half-maximal effects are observed with 30–50 μm (data not shown), which is in good agreement with the apparent K m ofd-aspartate transport in HeLa cells expressing GLT-1 (22Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The protection by d-aspartate is observed at all MTSEA concentrations examined (Fig.8 A). The substrate similarly affords protection against the impermeant MTSET (Fig. 8 B). It is also apparent that the larger MTSET inhibits less potently than MTSEA, presumably because of steric constraints. Again, inhibition by the MTS reagents and the protection by transportable substrates are the consequence of a direct modification of the cysteine at the 403 position, because similar results are obtained with transporters in which this is the only cysteine (Fig. 9). Strikingly, the competitive inhibitor dihydrokainate (12Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.L. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a nontransportable glutamate analogue (32Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.L. Murdoch G.H.

Neurochem. 1988; 50: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), does not protect, and in fact even potentiates the inhibition by the MTS reagents. Thus transportable substrates induce a conformational change making the residue less accessible to the impermeant reagent, whereas the blocker seems to lock the transporter in a conformation where it is more accessible to the extracellular bulk medium. Importantly, the wild type as well as the cysteine-less GLT-1 are not inhibited by MTSEA and MTSET even in the simultaneous presence of dihydrokainate (data not shown).Figure 8Effect of d-aspartate and dihydrokainic acid on inhibition of transport of Y403C by MTSEA and MTSET. Cells expressing Y403C transporters were preincubated under standard conditions with the indicated concentrations of MTSEA or MTSET in the absence (▪) or presence of 1 mm of either dihydrokainate (▴) or d-aspartate (•). Uptake was measured in the low sodium-containing medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The conformational change induced by aspartate may cause burial of the 403 residue within the core of the transporter. Alternatively, it may reflect the transport step itself, and the residue may become accessible to the inside bulk medium. In the former case the residue is not expected to be reachable by NEM, which permeates lipid bilayers readily but is unable to modify cysteine residues within transmembrane-spanning α helices (35Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The maleimide does not inhibit wild type GLT-1 (data not shown) but inhibits the activity of the Y403C transporter (Fig.10). In contrast with its protection against MTS reagents, d-aspartate does not protect the Y403C transporters against NEM (Fig. 10). This is consistent with the idea that its protection against relatively impermeant MTS reagents is because of the movement of the 403 residue from the outside of the cell to the inside. Similar results are obtained with the mutation introduced in a cysteine-less background (data not shown). The partial protection observed with dihydrokainate will be discussed below. Analysis of amino acid residues 395–407 of GLT-1 by SCAM leads to two major conclusions: 1) Within the putative pore-forming domain of GLT-1 are five consecutive residues (396–400) where mutation to cysteine leads to complete loss of function, a result consistent with the structural conservation and functional importance of this region. 2) Residue 403, which has been previously shown to interact with cotransported cations (21Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), behaves as if it is alternately accessible from either side of the membrane in such a way that glutamate transport promotes its exposure to the inside, whereas binding of a nontransportable analog promotes its exposure to the outside. This residue is located in the middle of transmembrane α-helix seven (37Slotboom D.J. Lolkema J.S. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31317-31321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).3 One of the five residues that do not tolerate replacement by cysteine (Fig. 2) is aspartate 398. Its replacement by either asparagine, glycine, or glutamate also leads to loss of function, and this is not because of a defective biosynthesis or targeting (22Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Injection of D398E cRNA into Xenopus oocytes results in neither glutamate transport currents nor transient currents reflecting sodium binding.4 It is possible therefore that this residue, together with asparagine 396, methionine 397, glycine 399, and threonine 400, plays a crucial role in sodium binding. Recent experiments in our laboratory indicate that sodium and potassium binding sites are close to each other (21Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Glutamate 404 and tyrosine 403 are involved in potassium binding (13Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and residues 396–400 are in fact nearby. Consistent with this is the protection of E404C and Y403C transporters by sodium against thiol modification (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). This modification occurs at these very positions, as evidenced by the fact that the same results are also obtained in a cysteine-less background. This rules out a scenario in which the introduction of a new cysteine residue induces a change in the transporter's structure such that modification now may occur at one of the nine endogenous cysteines of GLT-1. The cysteine-less GLT-1 transporter has around 40% of the wild type activity, and therefore most of the experiments have been done in the wild type background. However, they have been validated in the cysteine-less background as shown, for instance, in Fig. 9. It is of interest to note that the only ion that can partially substitute for sodium in the protection experiments is lithium. This is not unexpected as only this cation can replace some of the three sodium ions in the transport process (38Grunewald M. Kanner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17017-17024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The fact that only positively charged MTS reagents inhibit at the 403 position (Fig. 6), also supports the idea that it is part of a negatively charged binding pocket for cations, which repels the negatively charged MTSES. On the other hand, the protection by transportable acidic amino acids against inhibition by positively charged MTS reagents (Figs. Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9) is because of a conformational change induced by their binding at a distinct site. This is inferred because the opposite effect is induced by binding to this site of the nontransportable dihydrokainate, which locks the transporter in a conformation where tyrosine 403 is accessible from the external bulk medium. Transportable substrates cause a conformational change where this residue becomes occluded. Further evidence for a close association of this phenomenon with the transport step itself is that it was only observed in the presence of the cosubstrate sodium. The sensitivity to NEM during transport conditions (Fig. 10), in contrast to the protection against MTS reagents (Figs. 8 and 9), suggests that now tyrosine 403 becomes accessible to the aqueous intracellular compartment. Determinants of the binding site for the acidic amino acids are located on a stretch of 76 amino acid residues (39Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17668-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which also contains the cation binding site (13Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y.

U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One explanation for the partial protection by dihydrokainate against NEM may be that the former is bound close enough to hamper the access of NEM, which is bulkier than the MTS reagents. Tyrosine 403 is involved in the interaction of the transporter with internal as well as external potassium (21Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and it appears, together with glutamate 404 (13Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), to be a structural determinant of the potassium site. Because of the role of potassium, which is to promote the return of the unloaded transporter to the side of the membrane from where substrate can be moved (11Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 12Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Kavanaugh M.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), it is to be anticipated that during the transport cycle the potassium binding site should be alternately accessible to either side of the membrane. The findings documented here are entirely consistent with this. We anticipate that application of SCAM to other interesting regions of GLT-1 and to other transporters, may lead to important structural and functional insights as well.

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) plays a major signaling role in cells (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6186) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of PIP2 by phospholipase C (PLC) leads to production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and Ca2+release from intracellular stores via activation of InsP3R. PIP2 by itself can play a regulatory role in cells. Effects of PIP2 on structural organization of cellular cytoskeleton are well established (7Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 91-169Crossref Scopus (475) Google Scholar). More recently direct functional interaction between skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (8Chu A. Stefani E. J. Biol Chem. 1991; 266: 7699-7705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (9Hilgemann D.W. Ball R.

Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) has been demonstrated. The emerging paradigm is that PIP2 by itself may be a signaling messenger. We set out to test the hypothesis that PIP2 may interact directly with the InsP3R. To investigate InsP3R-PIP2 interaction, we reconstituted rat cerebellar InsP3R into planar lipid bilayers and tested response of these channels to addition of specific monoclonal anti-PIP2 antibody (11Fukami K. Matsuoka K. Nakanishi O. Yamakawa A. Kawai S. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on our data, we concluded that cerebellar InsP3R forms a stable inhibitory complex with PIP2 that can be disrupted by anti-PIP2antibody. Membrane insertion of PIP2 is not required for interaction with the InsP3R. We concluded that PIP2 most likely interacts with InsP3 binding site of the InsP3R. A novel model of compartmentalized Ca2+ signaling is proposed based on results obtained in the study. Rat (Sprague-Dawley; 4–5 weeks old) cerebellar microsomes were isolated essentially as described previously for canine preparation (5Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E.

Planar lipid bilayers were formed from PE:PS (3:1) synthetic lipid mixture in decane on the small (100–200 μm in diameter) hole in Teflon film separating two chambers 3 ml each (cis and trans). Prior to formation of the bilayer the hole was prepainted with PC:PS mixture (3:1). Rat cerebellar InsP3R were incorporated into the bilayer by microsomal vesicle fusion as described previously for canine preparation (5Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E.

Single channel currents were recorded at 0 mV transmembrane potential using 50 mm Ba2+dissolved in HEPES (pH 7.35) in the trans (intraluminal) side as a charge carrier (12Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In most of the experiments (standard recording conditions of InsP3R activity), the cis (cytosolic) chamber contained 110 mm Tris dissolved in HEPES (pH 7.35), 0.2 μmfree Ca2+ (5Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar) buffered with 1 mm EGTA and 0.7 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmNa2ATP (6Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise InsP3R were activated by addition of 2 μm InsP3 to the cis chamber. In some experiments 2 μm of ruthenium red was added to the cis chamber to block cerebellar RyanR present in the bilayer (5Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar) and facilitate InsP3R activity (P o = 5.8 ± 0.7% (n = 4)). All PIP2 blocking and most of PIP2Ab activating experiments were performed in the presence of 0.1 mm NaF in the cis chamber to chelate contaminating traces of heavy metal ions. Addition of NaF had no effect on InsP3R activity (n = 20). All additions were to the cis chamber from the concentrated stocks with at least 30 s stirring of solutions in both chambers. Monoclonal PIP2Ab (11Fukami K. Matsuoka K. Nakanishi O. Yamakawa A. Kawai S. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In both cases similar effects on InsP3R activity were observed. Initial PIP2stocks were made in chloroform or chloroform/methanol (19:1). An aliquot of the stock solution was transferred into a siliconized glass tube, and organic solvent was evaporated under a stream of argon. Nanopure water was added to the dried lipids, and PIP2vesicles were prepared by vortexing and sonication. Only freshly made or 1-day-old vesicles were used for all experiments. A sample from each vesicle stock was taken to determine lipid concentration from the total phosphate content using spectrophotometric phosphorus assay. PIP2 stock concentrations (0.2–1 mm) determined by phosphorus assay were employed for data analysis. Hydrophilic ShPIP2 was solubilized in water to yield 0.2 mm stock as determined by the phosphorus assay. InsP3R single channel currents were amplified (Warner OC-725), filtered at 1 kHz by a low pass 8-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 5 kHz (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments), and stored on a computer hard drive and recordable optical disks. For off-line computer analysis (pClamp 6.0.3, Axon Instruments) single channel data were filtered digitally at 500 Hz. Single channel open probability (P o) was determined by using half-threshold crossing criteria (t≥ 2 ms) from records lasting at least 2 min. In most of the experiments (55 out of 70) multiple InsP3R were incorporated into the bilayer (probably due to InsP3R clustering). P o in multichannel experiments was calculated under the assumption that all active channels in the bilayer were identical and independent and using the binomial distribution: P1 = Np(1 − p)N −1, where P1 is the experimentally determined probability of the first open level,N is the number of channels in the bilayer, and p =P o. N in each experiment was estimated from the maximal number of simultaneously open channels. Specific [3H]InsP3 binding to rat cerebellar microsomes was measured with minor modifications of procedure described previously (13Chadwick C.C. Saito A. Fleischer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes (5 μg of protein) were incubated on ice with 10 nm [3H]InsP3 in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl) and precipitated with 12.5% polyethylene glycol and 1.2 mg/ml γ-globulin at 14,000 × g. Precipitates were quickly washed with the binding buffer, dissolved in Soluene, and their [3H] content was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific counts, determined in the presence of 25 μm nonlabeled InsP3, were subtracted from the total to yield specific binding. Various amounts of PIP2vesicles, prepared as described above for bilayer experiments, were added to the binding buffer in [3H]InsP3competition experiments. Monoclonal anti-PIP2 Antibody (PIP2Ab) (11Fukami K. Matsuoka K. Nakanishi O. Yamakawa A. Kawai S. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was from PerSeptive Biosystems. ShPIP2 was synthesized by following procedure similar to that previously described for (3,4)PIP2 water-soluble PIP2 analog (14Reddy K.K. Ye J. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 2115-2116Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ShPIP2 was >95% pure based on NMR and TLC analysis. (1,4,5)InsP3 was from LC Laboratories. [3H]InsP3 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To form planar lipid bilayers dioleoyl-PS, dioleoyl-PE, and diphytanoyl-PC from Avanti Polar Lipids were used. Stearoyl-arachidonyl-(4,5)PIP2 (bovine brain) was from Boehringer Mannenheim. Dipalmitoyl-(4,5)PIP2 and dipalmitoyl-(3,4)PIP2 were from Matreya Inc. Stearoyl-arachidonyl-PC was from Avanti Polar Lipids. Ruthenium red and Na2ATP were from Calbiochem. Other chemicals were from Sigma or Intermountain Scientific Corp. Single-channel open probability (P o) of rat cerebellar InsP3R reconstituted in planar lipid bilayer is typically low (<5%), and channel openings are infrequent (Fig.1 A). We found that InsP3R activity was increased 3–4-fold by addition of monoclonal anti-PIP2 antibody (PIP2Ab) (11Fukami K. Matsuoka K. Nakanishi O. Yamakawa A. Kawai S. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) to the cis (cytosolic) side of the membrane. On average, PIP2Ab increased P o of InsP3R from 3.5 ± 0.5% (n = 18) to 13.6 ± 1.7% (n = 14) (Fig. 1). In some experiments, PIP2Ab induced periods of InsP3R activity with P o of 30–40%P o. Addition of boiled PIP2Ab or irrelevant mouse IgG fraction had no effect on InsP3R in control experiments. InsP3R activated by PIP2Ab could be inhibited by addition of exogenous PIP2 vesicles (n = 3). We concluded that cerebellar InsP3R may form a stable inhibitory complex with PIP2 in vivo. During microsomal extraction and bilayer reconstitution procedure, preexisting InsP3R-PIP2 complex remains intact until it is disrupted by addition of PIP2Ab to the bilayer. To get insight into the mechanism of PIP2Ab action, we characterized the effect of PIP2Ab on InsP3R sensitivity to activation by InsP3. Fit of cerebellar InsP3R dose dependence (Fig. 2 A, filled circles, n = 5) yielded apparent affinity (K app) of 1.5 μmInsP3, maximal P o(P max) of 6.6% and Hill coefficientn H of 1.4. In contrast, fit of the data obtained in the presence of PIP2Ab (Fig. 2 B, open circles, n = 3) resulted inK app of 0.13 μm,P max of 13.4%, and n H of 2.0. Thus, on average PIP2Ab induced over 10-fold change in InsP3R apparent affinity and 2-fold change inP max. A similar shift in sensitivity to InsP3 induced by PIP2Ab can be observed for the same InsP3R (Fig. 2 B). In this experiment 2 μmInsP3 initially activated channels to 3–5%P o and then PIP2Ab further increased InsP3R activity to 15% P o level. Following perfusion of the cis chamber InsP3R activity subsided. Addition of 100 nm InsP3 to the cis chamber induced InsP3R activity at 15%P o that could not be further elevated by increase in InsP3 concentration or addition of PIP2Ab (Fig. 2 B). The shift in InsP3sensitivity of the InsP3R induced by PIP2Ab led us to hypothesize that endogenous PIP2 may interact directly with the InsP3 binding site of the InsP3R. Interaction between PIP2 and the InsP3 binding site of InsP3R was tested in competitive [3H]InsP3 binding assay performed with cerebellar microsomes and exogenously added (4,5)PIP2vesicles (Fig. 3 A). We found that stearoyl-arachidonyl-PIP2(SA-PIP2, IC50 of 3.2 μm, filled circles) and dipalmitoyl-PIP2 (DP-PIP2, IC50 of 1.3 μm, filled triangles) inhibited [3H]InsP3 binding with IC50 in micromolar range, whereas SA-PC did not have an effect in concentrations as high as 100 μm (open diamonds). In another control, addition of PS in concentrations up to 100 μm had only a minor effect on InsP3binding (closed diamonds), whereas PIP2:PS mixed vesicles inhibited binding proportionately to molar PIP2content (open triangles). Thus, the inhibitory effect on InsP3 binding was specific for PIP2. Does PIP2 have to be inserted into the membrane to inhibit InsP3 binding? To answer this question, we performed experiments with the novel water-soluble synthetic PIP2analog ShPIP2. ShPIP2 inhibited [3H]InsP3 binding to cerebellar microsomes with IC50 of 1.9 μm (Fig. 3 A, IC50 of 1.9 μm, open circles), similar to lipophilic SA-PIP2 and DP-PIP2. Therefore, insertion of PIP2 into the membrane is not required to block InsP3 binding. Exogenous PIP2 inhibited InsP3R activated by 2 μm InsP3 in planar lipid bilayer reconstitution experiments (Fig. 3, B andC). SA-PIP2 and DP-PIP2 inhibited InsP3R in micromolar concentration range (Fig.3 B), whereas PC and PS vesicles did not block channels in concentrations as high as 100 μm. After complete channel block by PIP2, we increased InsP3 concentration to 20 μm, which resulted in partial recovery of InsP3R activity (Fig. 3 B). Block of InsP3R by PIP2 also could be reversed by application of PIP2Ab (n = 4). ShPIP2 exerted a similar inhibitory effect on InsP3R (Fig. 3 C), indicating that insertion of PIP2 into the membrane is not required to block InsP3R. Topology of InsP3R-PIP2interaction appear to be unique when compared with all reported cases of functional effects of PIP2 on channels and transporters. Indeed, PIP2 and effector protein have to be located in the same membrane for effects on Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (9Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), inward rectifier K+ channels (10Huang C.-L. Feng S. Hilgemann D. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), and ryanodine receptor (data not shown). In contrast, our experiments with water-soluble PIP2 analog dioctanoyl-(4,5)PIP2indicated that PIP2 insertion into the membrane is not required to block InsP3R. If PIP2 is not in the membrane, how can PIP2 interact with the InsP3R? Several lines of evidence point to InsP3 binding site of the InsP3R as likely site of interaction with PIP2: 1) extraction of endogenous PIP2 from the complex with the InsP3R by anti-PIP2 antibody resulted in 10-fold increase in the apparent affinity of InsP3R for InsP3 (Fig. 2). 2) In micromolar concentration range exogenous PIP2 inhibits specific InsP3 binding to cerebellar microsomes and blocks InsP3R in planar lipid bilayers (Fig. 3, A andB). 3) Water-soluble dioctanoyl-(4,5)PIP2 analog exerts similar effects on InsP3 binding and InsP3R channel activity (Fig. 3, A andC). Quantitatively similar competition between InsP3 and PIP2 for a binding site has been reported for the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLCδ1 (15Cifuentes M.E. Delaney T. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1945-1948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. R O.B. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 17Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Thus, by analogy with PLCδ1-PH domain and based on our data, we hypothesize that InsP3 binding domain of InsP3R is also responsible for PIP2 binding. N-terminal InsP3 binding domain of InsP3R is on the opposite end of the molecule from the C-terminal transmembrane domain (18Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulate that in vivoPIP2 interacts with the InsP3R intrans configuration, that is PIP2 and InsP3R are located in juxtaposed membrane leaflets. Immunolocalization data support the existence of transInsP3R-PIP2 complexes in cells. InsP3R are highly concentrated in compact endoplasmic reticulum cisternal stacks and peripheral cisternal membrane structures in Purkinje cerebellum cells (19Satoh T. Ross C.A. Villa A.

Neurocytol. 1993; 22: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and in vas deferenssmooth muscle cells (22Villa A. Podini P. Panzeri M.C. Soling H.D. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 51-1041Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These membrane structures are sufficiently compact to allow formation of the complex between InsP3R from one endoplasmic reticulum membrane leaflet and PIP2 in the juxtaposed membrane. InsP3R-PIP2 complex at the plasma membrane may form in caveolae (23Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), which are highly enriched in both PIP2 (24Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and InsP3R (25Fujimoto T. Nakade S. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Ogawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 26Fujimoto T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 7-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis agrees well with the emerging role of caveolae as a specialized messenger center of the cell (27Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 28Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Based on our in vitro functional data and discussed above in vivo morphological findings, we would like to postulate a novel compartmentalized coupling model in which InsP3R is linked directly to PIP2 (Fig.4). We propose that in unstimulated cells, some fraction of InsP3R is constitutively inhibited due to interaction with PIP2 in the juxtaposed membrane (resting state). We propose that these InsP3R are unable to open because of the spatial constraint imposed by the topology of InsP3R-PIP2 interaction. Agonist stimulation leads to activation of PLC, cleavage of InsP3R-tethered PIP2, and release of the spatial clamp on the InsP3R (signal transduction step). PLC simultaneously removes the inhibitor (PIP2) and generates the activator (InsP3) of the InsP3R, leading to Ca 2+ wave initiation. We propose that this novel compartmentalized signaling mechanism is responsible for Ca2+ wave initiation in specialized trigger zones, whereas Ca2+ wave propagation through the cell is sustained by direct Ca2+ feedback on the InsP3R (5Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar, 29Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 30Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Preferential coupling between PLC-linked hormonal receptors and InsP3R have been demonstrated previously in some intact cell preparations (31Wakui M. Osipchuk Y.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1990; 63: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 32Paradiso A.M. Mason S.J. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It appears that integrity of this preferential coupling depends on correct spatial arrangement between intracellular Ca2+ release stores and PLC-linked receptors, which is maintained by intact actin cytoskeleton network (34Ribeiro C.M. Reece J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26555-26561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).

PAF-R gene transcripts were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot, using three sets of primers corresponding either to the coding region of the human PAF-R sequence (polymerase chain reaction product: 682 base pairs (bp)) or to the leukocyte- and tissue-type transcripts of 166 and 252 bp, respectively. An elongated splice variant was identified in the 5′-untranslated region of the tissue-type PAF-R transcript (334 bp) in colonic epithelial crypts and tumors. In human colonic PCmsrc cells transformed by c-src oncogene, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent invasiveness of collagen gels was abolished by 0.1 μm PAF and restored by the PAF-R antagonists WEB2086 and SR27417. PAF blocked HGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase. The phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3′-K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 totally blocked the HGF-induced invasion. Similar effects were observed in ts-srcMDCK kidney epithelial cells transformed by a v-Src temperature-sensitive mutant: (i) PAF and wortmannin exerted additive inhibitory effects on Src-induced invasion and (ii) activated and dominant negative forms of p110α PI3′-K, respectively, amplified and abrogated the Src- and HGF-dependent invasiveness of parental and ts-srcMDCK cells. We also provided the first evidence for the contribution of rapamycin-insensitive, pertussis toxin-dependent G-protein pathways to the integration of the signals emerging from activated Met and PAF receptors. These results indicate that PI3′-K is a critical transducer of invasiveness and strongly suggest that PAF exerts a negative control on invasion by inhibiting this signaling pathway.

It is a potent lipid mediator produced by neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, platelets, and endothelial cells via two main routes of biosynthesis: the remodeling pathway and a second pathway termed de novo. Products of phospholipid catabolism (PAF and eicosanoids) are detected in the gastrointestinal mucosa and epithelial cells during the inflammatory process and neoplastic progression (3Langholz E.

Numerous clinical and experimental observations reveal that colonic cancer is increasingly frequent after inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and Crohn's disease (3Langholz E.

On the other hand, anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer and reduced mortality due to this disease (10Giovannucci E. Egan K. Hunter D. Stamper M. Colditz G.

In view of the information above, we are now asking whether functional PAF receptors (PAF-R) are present in both normal and transformed human colonic epithelial cells. As a first step toward answering this question, we investigated 1) the expression of PAF-R transcripts by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blot in normal and transformed human colonic epithelial cells, 2) the effects of PAF on invasion by tumor cells, using two models of PCmsrc human colonic epithelial cells and ts-srcMDCK canine kidney epithelial cells transformed by the src oncogene (11Empereur S.

(i) Specific tissue-type PAF-R transcripts are clearly identifiable in human intestinal epithelial cells at various stages of cancerous progression and cell differentiation; (ii) upon PAF addition, there was complete reversion of the Src- and HGF-dependent invasiveness of intestinal and kidney epithelial cells; (iii) the PI3′-K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 mimic and cooperate with PAF against invasion; (iv) there was phosphorylation of p125FAK by HGF that was completely blocked by PAF; (v) constitutively activated PI3′-K and dominant negative forms of the PI3′-K p110α catalytic subunit respectively induced and abrogated the invasiveness of parental and Src-transformed MDCK cells; and (vi) the HGF- and PAF-dependent invasion pathways were sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTx), suggesting that heterotrimeric G protein components (Gαi-β/γ dimers) are involved in the signaling cascades that affect the invasiveness of Src- and Met-transformed epithelial cells.

The colonic cancer cell lines HT-29, Caco-2, and HT29-MTX cells, respectively, exhibit undifferentiated, enterocyte-type, and mucinous-type phenotypes (17Nagano M. Chastre E. Choquet A. Bara J. Gespach C. Kelly P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G431-G442PubMed Google Scholar). Human colonic crypts were obtained from fresh samples, as described previously (15Chastre E. Di Gioia Y. Barbry P.

MDCK canine kidney epithelial cells, transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Src (ts-srcMDCK cells, Cl2), exhibit an invasive phenotype at the permissive temperature of 35 °C, but are not invasive at the restrictive temperature of 40 °C for v-Src activity (12Behrens J.

Transformed ts-srcMDCK cells were stably transfected by the dominant-negative mutant of bovine PI3′-K p110-EcoS. This truncated form of PI3′-K p110α contains the binding site for the regulatory p85 subunit but lacks the catalytic domain (18Nishioka N. Akimoto K. Moriya S. Takayanagi J. Fukui Y. Hirai S.

Cells were transfected by the LipofectAMINE™ method, using 25 μl of reagent/well and 10 μg of plasmid for 2 × 106 cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, cells were selected over a period of 2 weeks with 500 μg/ml G418. Individual resistant colonies were then isolated, picked, and expanded, and the expression of the mutant PI3′-K p110-EcoS form was assessed by Northern blot. Parental MDCK cells and MDCKp110* cells, stably transfected by the activated form of bovine p110*α after addition of the C-terminal farnesylation signal from Ha-Ras, were a generous gift from Dr. J. Downward (19Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennström S. Warne P. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Normal human leukocytes were isolated from peripheral blood and purified by leukapheresis and countercurrent centrifugation elutriation (20Mirossay L. Chastre E. Callebert J. Launay J.M. Housset B. Zimber A. Abita J.P. Gespach C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: R602-R611PubMed Google Scholar). Human leukemic HL-60 promyelocytes were cultured as described previously (20Mirossay L. Chastre E.

Specimens from patients who had undergone surgery for colonic cancer were obtained from the Center de Chirurgie Digestive (Prof. R. Parc, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France). Tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Individual colon carcinomas were staged according to Dukes' classification, as modified by Astler and Coller (17Nagano M. Chastre E. Choquet A. Bara J. Gespach C. Kelly P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G431-G442PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation (11Empereur S. Djelloul S. Di Gioia Y. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Van Hengel J. Van Roy F. Comoglio P. Courtneidge S. Paraskeva C. Chastre E. Gespach C. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To eliminate contamination by genomic DNA for RT-PCR analysis, RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA, using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and random hexanucleotides (5 μm). A fraction of the corresponding cDNA (1/10) was then amplified in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 200 μm amounts of each dNTP, 0.5 μm amounts of each primer, and 1 unit of Ampli-Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Samples displaying a clear PCR product of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were considered useful. Negative control reactions in which no RT was performed were included in our experiments, to avoid artifacts due to genomic DNA contamination. As shown in Fig. 1, four sets of primers were designed to amplify the RT-PCR products of the PAF-R gene transcripts corresponding to the coding region, and the tissue- and leukocyte-type 5′-UTR sequences (21Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Sakanaka C. Mutoh H. Minami M. Bito H. Seyama Y. Matsumoto T. Noma M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20400-20405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sugimoto T.

Thirty amplification cycles, each comprising 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min 30 s at 72 °C, were run in an automatic thermal Robocycler Gradient 96 (Stratagene). The reaction was initiated by a 5-min incubation at 94 °C and ended by a 7-min final extension at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Southern blot analysis was performed to verify the authenticity of the PCR products, using two internal probes: probe 1 (5′-CATCAAGACTGCTCAGGCCAACA-3′) and probe 2 (5′-ACCAGGACCAGCTGATCATTC-3′). To subclone the RT-PCR fragments corresponding to the 5′-UTR of the tissue- or leukocyte-type PAF-R transcript, amplicons were eluted from the agarose gels using the Qiagen kit (Coger, France) and cloned in a PCR-TRAP vector (GenHunter Corp.). Sequencing was performed using the Lseq and Rseq primers and the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Northern blot analysis for the expression of PAF-R and PI3′-K in MDCK cells was performed as described previously (11Empereur S. Djelloul S. Di Gioia Y. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Van Hengel J. Van Roy F.

RNA samples underwent electrophoresis in 1% agarose, 2.2 mol/liter formaldehyde gels, were transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom), and hybridized with the 32P-labeled probes (Megaprime, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative amount of RNA in each lane was judged to be similar by comparing the ethidium bromide or methylene blue staining of the ribosomal bands. The specific probes used were human PAF-R cDNA (21Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Sakanaka C. Mutoh H. Minami M. Bito H. Seyama Y. Matsumoto T. Noma M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20400-20405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the EcoRI restriction fragment of the p110α cDNA corresponding to the N-terminal fragment of the dominant negative mutant of the enzyme (18Nishioka N. Akimoto K. Moriya S. Takayanagi J. Fukui Y. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Kosaka K. Ohno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1037-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Petri dishes were filled with 1.2 ml of neutralized type I collagen (UBI) and incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow gelification. Cells were harvested using Moscona buffer and trypsin/EDTA, and seeded on top of the collagen gels. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 24 or 48 h in the presence of PAF, alone or combined with one of its receptor antagonists WEB 2086 and SR27417A, or with one of the PI3′-K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. The invasiveness of PCmsrc and ts-srcMDCK cells was measured by the depth of cell migration inside the gel, using an inverted microscope controlled by a computer program (24Vleminckx K. Vakaet L. Mareel M. Fiers W. Van Roy F. Cell. 1991; 66: 107-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Invasive and superficial cells were counted in 12 fields of 0.157 mm2. The invasion index was expressed as the percentage of cells invading the gel over the total number of cells. Subconfluent PCmsrc cells in 6-cm diameter Petri dishes were starved for 24 h and then incubated for 24 h in the presence of 10 units/ml HGF, alone or combined with 10−7m PAF, or without either HGF or PAF (control). Control and treated PCmsrc cells were then rinsed twice with PBS containing 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and lysed at 100 °C in 0.5 ml of 1% SDS, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Cell lysates (1–2 mg of protein) were boiled for an additional 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatants were then adjusted for protein content. Total lysate (100 μl) containing 600–800 μg of protein was diluted in 400 μl of H2O and 500 μl of 2× immunoprecipitation buffer (1× buffer: 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 10 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin and aprotinin). Next, these samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation for a 1-h incubation in the presence of the anti-p125FAK mAb clone 77 directed against the kinase domain of FAK (Transduction Laboratories). This step was followed by another hour of incubation with Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). All incubations were carried out with mixing at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in 1× immunoprecipitation buffer and denatured by boiling in SDS sample buffer. For the Western blots, total proteins or immunoprecipitates were submitted to electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were rinsed twice in TBS for 5 min, the nitrocellulose was blocked overnight in TBS plus 5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma), and probed for 1 h with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (UBI). The blots were then washed in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, probed for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monkey anti-mouse IgG, and revealed by the ECL Western detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the relative amounts of FAK protein, the same nitrocellulose membranes were stripped and incubated with the anti-FAK mAb. ts-srcMDCK cells in culture were washed three times with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 containing 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and labeled for 2 h with 0.5 mCi/ml carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Gent, Belgium). Cells were then detached with an E-cadherin-saving procedure, and incubated in suspension for 30 min at the nonpermissive temperature of 40 °C in the presence of HGF, either alone or combined with PAF, and were further aggregated at 40 °C for 30 min. Control and treated ts-srcMDCK cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1% Triton X-100 and the following phosphatase or protease inhibitors (all from Sigma): PMSF (1.7 mm), leupeptin (21 μm), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), sodium pyrophosphate (10 mm), sodium fluoride (10 mm), and sodium vanadate (1 mm). Equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with the anti-phosphotyrosine mouse mAb PY20 (ICN Immunobiologicals, Costa Mesa, CA), and then incubated for 1 h with Protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow beads. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were eluted three times for 15 min with the same buffer containing 1 mmphospho-l-tyrosine and 10 mm phenylphosphate. Eluted molecules were then immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of the β-catenin antiserum 1522, and for 1 h with Protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow beads. The immune serum 1522 was raised against the synthetic peptide PGDSNQLAWFDTDL corresponding to the C-terminal part of mouse β-catenin, and recognized a 95-kDa band on Western blots (25Vermulen S. Bruyneel E. Van Roy F. Mareel M. Bracke M. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and PI3′-K assay were carried out as described previously (26Mayeux P. Dusanter-Fourt I. Muller O. Mauduit P. Sabbah M. Druker B. Vainchenker W. Fischer S. Lacombe C.

The ts-srcMDCK cells (5 million cells/dish) were cultured for 24 h in the absence of fetal calf serum and then incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in the presence of HGF (10 units/ml) alone or combined with 0.1 μm PAF. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmPMSF, and 5 μg/ml each aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts containing 1 mg of protein were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 and 40 μl of Protein G-Sepharose, and the immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with PBS supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, twice with 0.5 m LiCl in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), and twice with kinase buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mmMgCl2). The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]-ATP, and 0.4 mg/ml of a sonicated mixture of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol (1:1, w/w). The tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and the reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl. Phospholipids were extracted with 350 μl of a 1:1 mixture of chloroform/methanol, and the organic phase was washed three times with methanol, 1 mHCl (1:1, v/v). The lipids were desiccated, and the pellets were redissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol, 1 m HCl (200:100:1) and chromatographed on thin layer chromatography plates (precoated with potassium oxalate and backed at 120 °C for 1 h just before use) in chloroform, methanol, 4 mNH4OH (9:7:2, v/v). The human PAF-R is encoded by a unique gene composed of two 5′-noncoding exons, each driven by distinct promoters (23Mutoh H. Bito H. Minami M. Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Nakata R. Kurachi Y. Terano A. Shimizu T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 129-134Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The transcripts originating from exons 1 and 2 are alternatively spliced to a common acceptor site on the third exon encoding the functional PAF-R protein. Transcripts 1 and 2 have both been detected in heart, lung, spleen, and kidney, whereas transcript 1 mainly accumulates in peripheral leukocytes. Using the pair of primers P4/P5 encompassing the 682-bp internal region of the human PAF-R mRNA coding sequence (amino acids 63–289), 682-bp amplicons of the expected size were clearly identified in freshly isolated normal colonic epithelial crypts and cultured human colonic cancer cell lines (data not shown). PAF-R gene expression was detected in human colon cancer resections (Dukes' stages B2 and C1) and their distant nontransformed colonic mucosa. As positive control, PAF-R expression was characterized in normal and leukemic human leukocytes. We next designated two sets of primers corresponding to either leukocyte-type 1 transcripts (P2/P3 primers) or tissue-type 2 transcripts (P1/P3 primers), in order to examine the expression of both transcripts in colonic epithelial cells. Leukocyte-type transcripts (166 bp) were weakly expressed in both normal and transformed intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 2,A and B). In contrast, the tissue-type transcript was strongly expressed in intestinal cells, as a PCR product of the expected size (252 bp), as compared with its expression in leukocytes (Fig. 2 C). This 252-bp product was revealed with an additional 334-bp variant (aT). After cloning and sequencing, we demonstrated that the tissue-type 252-bp sequence is identical to the PAF-R transcript 2 as reported previously (22Sugimoto T. Tsuchimochi H. McGregor C. Mutoh H. Shimizu T. Kurachi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we observed that the additional tissue-type 334-bp product (aT) sequenced in Caco-2 cells was lengthened by the following 82 nucleotides at the 3′-end of exon 1, as shown in Fig. 1: ACAGCATAGAGGCTGAGGCTGGGGCCAGGACCCAGACAGAGACACACGGTCACTGCAGCTGAAGCCGCTGCCCCTGCTACAG (dashed line in exon 1 of Fig. 1). This fragment was produced by alternative splicing, because the apparent consensus splice donor and acceptor sites GT/AG were identified at the boundaries of this additional aT sequence. The presence of this splice variant in the 5′-untranslated region of the PAF-R transcript may be associated with differential regulation and translational efficiency of PAF-R mRNA in normal and transformed intestinal cells. Because the splice variant of the tissue-type transcript may serve as a template for amplification of the 166-bp product, we used the P6 primer upstream of the splice site in exon 1 to confirm the expression of the leukocyte-type transcript in intestinal epithelial cells HT-29, Caco-2, and PCmsrc (data not shown).

TFIID consists of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP associated factors (TAFIIs). TFIIA binds directly to TBP and stabilizes its interaction with TATA-containing DNA. In this work, we present evidence that TAFIIs inhibit TBP-DNA and TBP-TFIIA binding, and that TFIIA stimulates transcription, in part, by overcoming this TAFII-mediated inhibition of TBP-DNA binding. TFIIA mutants modestly compromised for interaction with TBP were found to be significantly more defective in forming complexes with TFIID. Subtle changes in the stability or conformation of the TFIIA-TBP complex resulted in a failure of TFIIA to overcome TAFII-mediated inhibition of TBP-DNA binding and transcription function. Inhibition of TBP-DNA binding by TAFIIs could be partially relieved by limited proteolysis of TFIID. Proteolysis significantly stimulated TFIIA-TFIID-TATA binding in both electrophoresis mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting but had little effect on complexes formed with TBP. Recombinant TAFII250 inhibits TBP-DNA binding, whereas preincubation of TFIIA with TBP prevents this inhibition. Thus, TFIIA competes with TAFII250 for access to TBP and alters the TATA binding properties of the resulting complex. Transcriptional activation by Zta was enhanced by temperature shift inactivation of TAFII250 in the ts13 cell line, suggesting that TAFII250 has transcriptional inhibitory activity in vivo.

Thus, both TFIIA and TAFIIs can modulate the interactions of TBP with activators, DNA, and other general transcription factors. However, the potential interactions between TFIIA and TAFIIs have been less extensively examined and are likely to be an important component of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation. TFIID consists of TBP and at least eight TAFIIs (reviewed in Refs. 11Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar and 14Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). TAFII250 binds directly to TBP and multiple other TAFIIs, thus serving as a potential scaffold for the multiprotein complex (28Kokubo T. Gong D.W. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Ruppert S. Wang E.H. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 362: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Other TAFIIs can bind TBP directly, including a subset of TAFIIs with homology to histone proteins, which form a histone fold motif (30Hoffman A. Chiang C.-M. Oelgeschlager T. Xie X. Burley S.K. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 356-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Histones have generally been associated with transcriptional repression by limiting activator and general factor access to promoter sequences, and it is possible that some TAFIIs share histone-like features (31Hoffmann A. Oelgeschlager T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8928-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Purified TAFII250 has been shown to inhibit the DNA binding activity of TBP (21Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Chen J.L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 264: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 28Kokubo T. Gong D.W. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y.

TAFII250 is identical to CCG1, a gene identified by a mutation that causes arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. TAFII250 has been shown to have both protein kinase and histone acetylase activities, but the functional significance of these activities is not yet clear (33Mizzen C.A. Yang X.J. Kokubo T.

Mutations in TBP, which abrogate transcription activation function in vivo, were found to disrupt the ability of TBP to bind to TAFII250 in vitro (35Tansey W.P. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2756-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More recent studies in yeast and hamster cell lines indicate that TAFII250 is required for coordinating the interaction between promoter-specific activators and core promoter elements (36Wang E.H.

Several lines of evidence indicate that a dynamic interplay between TFIIA and TAFIIs regulates the binding of TFIID to promoter DNA. Cross-linking studies indicate that TFIIA significantly alters the interaction of TAFIIs with promoter DNA (40Oelgeschlager T. Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). TFIIA mediates an activator-dependent conformational change in TFIID that results in the interaction of TAFIIs with sequences near and downstream of the transcriptional initiation site (20Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 41Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J.

Carey M. Nature. 1995; 377: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The recruitment of TFIIA by an activator significantly enhanced the ability of TFIID to interact with TFIIB, further indicating that TFIIA can alter the properties of TFIID (43Chi T. Lieberman P. Ellwood K. Carey M. Nature. 1995; 377: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). TFIIA can derepress the inhibitory effects of several factors that bind directly to TBP (5Meisterernst M.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The direct binding of TFIIA to TBP is likely to preclude interaction of these inhibitory factors with TBP. The derepression function of TFIIA is mediated by the subunits of TFIIA that contact TBP directly, but these subunits are not sufficient for TFIIA-mediated transcriptional activation function in vitro(48Ma D. Olave I. Merino A. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6583-6588Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the yeast TFIIA-TBP-DNA ternary complex reveals that TFIIA makes direct contact with TBP through several hydrophobic residues in the small subunit of TFIIA (Toa2) (26Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 27Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the homologous residues in the human TFIIA small subunit (γ ) interrupt TFIIA stimulation of TBP-DNA binding and TFIIA-mediated transcription stimulation in vitro (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, conservative phenylalanine substitution mutation of these residues (TFIIA γ Y65F and W72F) had little detectable effect on the formation of a TFIIA-TBP DNA complex but were found to be defective for transcription activation in vitro (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for these defects was not clear but suggest that subtle changes in the TFIIA-TBP interface have dramatic effects on transcription function. In this work, we further investigated the mechanism underlying the transcription defect caused by these TFIIA mutations. We showed that these mutants are substantially more defective in the presence of TAFIIs and that TAFIIs are generally inhibitory for TBP-TFIIA complex formation. We also show that the ability of TFIIA to overcome TAFII-mediated inhibition correlates with transcription activation function in vitro. The Escherichia coliexpression constructs for human wild type and mutant TFIIA-γ (pRSET A-IIA-γ) and TBP were previously described (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol.

Wang, and Zta was expressed from the SV40 promoter in pBXGo. The pQE-IIA-αβ and pRSET A-IIA-γ wild type or mutant constructs were expressed in M15 and BL21 E. coli strains, respectively. Expressed proteins were purified under denaturing conditions on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Qiagen) and dialyzed into D100 buffer as described (20Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H.

For protease experiments, protein and DNA were preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C before the addition of 40 ng of protease K for 20 min at 30 °C (unless noted otherwise). The relative mobility of the TBP-DNA (T) and TFIIA-TBP-DNA (T-A) complexes varied dramatically in EMSA depending upon the probe used (E1B or E4T) and whether magnesium was included in gels (46Kirov N. Lieberman P. Rushlow C. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 7079-7087Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol.

Wild-type or mutant pRSET A-IIA-γ was added back to transcription reactions as described (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The hamster ts13 cell line was purchased from ATCC. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were transfected in a 100-mm dish using calcium phosphate precipitation with 250 ng reporter, 5 μg of SV-Zta and 30 μg of CMV-TAFII250 (where indicated). Vector DNA was used to compensate for differences in DNA concentration of effector plasmid. Transfected cells were incubated for 8–12 h at 34 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated at 34 or 39.5 °C as indicated. Cells were harvested for CAT assay 36 to 48 h post-transfection. CAT reactions analyzed by thin layer chromatography and quantitated with a PhosphorImager 445SI screen. All transfections were repeated at least three times. In a previous study, we examined a large panel of TFIIA-γ mutants for the ability to stimulate TBP binding to the adenovirus E1B core promoter and to mediate activator stimulated transcription in vitro. We found that alanine substitution of Tyr-65 completely eliminated the TBP-TFIIA DNA complex (T-A), whereas W72A caused an aberrant migrating complex in acrylamide EMSA. Alanine substitution of these residues and neighboring aromatic residues reduced transcription activation by several activators in vitro (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To explore the possible effect of TFIIA mutations on interactions with TAFIIs in the TFIID complex, we compared the panel of TFIIA mutants for their ability to support an interaction between the Zta transcriptional activator and TFIID (Fig. 1). Zta stimulates a highly stable interaction between TFIIA, TFIID, and promoter DNA (referred to as the Z-D-A complex) that correlates with transcriptional activation function for a subset of promoters (55Lieberman P.M. Ozer J. Gursel D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TFIIA mutants were first tested for their ability to form a stable complex with TBP (referred to as T-A) on the E4T promoter. Under limiting conditions, TBP did not form a stable Mg2+-agarose EMSA complex by itself but forms a weak smear (Fig. 1 A,lane 2). The addition of wt TFIIA results in a stable well resolved T-A complex (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). Similar stable complexes were resolved for most TFIIA-γ substitution mutants, with the exception of γY65A, which failed to form T-A (lane 10). Several substitution mutations were reduced for T-A complex formation, and γW72A produced a T-A complex with a slower mobility in these Mg2+-agarose EMSA (Fig. 1 A, lane 13 and data not shown). We previously reported an altered mobility complex with the γW72A mutant in polyacrylamide-EMSA (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These Mg2+-EMSA results are consistent with previous studies examining the ability of these TFIIA mutants to form a T-A complex with the E1B 30-base pair oligonucleotide in polyacrylamide gel EMSA (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The same panel of TFIIA-γ mutants were examined for the ability to form Z-D-A by Mg2+-agarose EMSA. Under conditions where affinity-purified TFIID (hIID) was limiting for DNA binding, wt TFIIA significantly stimulated Z-D-A complex formation (Fig. 1 B,lane 2). Most TFIIA-γ substitution mutations that support T-A were capable of forming Z-D-A. TFIIA mutant γY65A, which could not form T-A, was similarly incapable of forming Z-D-A (lane 9). Interestingly, γY6A, γF67A, γC68A, γW72A, and γF74A were significantly reduced in Z-D-A complex formation. The γY6A, γF67A, γC68A, γW72A, and γF74A mutants have defects in mediating regulated transcriptional activity in vitro, indicating that the failure to form Z-D-A correlates with the transcription defects of these TFIIA mutants (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Quantitation of complex formation revealed that TFIIA γY6A, γF67A, γC68A, γW72A, and γF74A were significantly more disruptive to Z-D-A complex formation compared with T-A complex formation (compare Fig. 1,A and B). None of these TFIIA-γ mutants disrupted the interaction with Zta in a glutathioneS-transferase binding assay, suggesting that failure to form Z-D-A is a result of a failure of TFIIA to interact properly with TFIID (data not shown). The fact that these mutations were more defective with TFIID than with TBP raised the possibility that some of these TFIIA mutations were incapable of interacting with TBP in the presence of TAFIIs. To further investigate the possible effect of TAFIIs on TFIIA association with TBP, we examined the properties of TFIIA mutants that specifically alter the TFIIA-TBP interface. Based on the crystal structure of the yeast TFIIA-TBP-DNA ternary structure, conserved human residues TFIIA-γTyr-65 and γ Trp-72 are likely to make direct contact with TBP. Our previous analysis indicated that semiconservative substitution mutants TFIIA γY65F and γW72F were able to stimulate T-A complex formation at nearly wt levels on a 30-base pair adenovirus E1B oligonucleotide in EMSA (Fig.2 B) (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, these mutants were defective in mediating regulated transcriptional activation for the GAL4-CTF, -AH, and -VP16 activators on the G5E1BTCAT template and AP1 on the collagenase promoterin vitro (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, the TFIIA γ-W72A and Phe mutants were also shown to be incapable of coactivating transcription from the G5E4TCAT reporter with the GAL4-AH activatorin vitro (Fig. 2 C). Thus, these TFIIA mutants are defective for transcriptional activation on two different core promoters. Because these mutants were capable of forming T-A but were defective in mediating transcriptional activation, we suspected they may be incapable of interacting with TFIID. The ability of these mutants to interact with TFIID was tested by comparing their ability to form complexes with TBP, TFIID, or TFIID and Zta in Mg2+-agarose EMSA (Fig. 2 A). The γY65F and γW72F mutants stimulate T-A formation in Mg2+-agarose EMSA (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 6), just as they do in the polyacrylamide EMSA (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 5) (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both the Trp-72 mutants formed a slower, altered mobility complex in polyacrylamide EMSA as in the Mg2+-agarose gel EMSA (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6). However, these TFIIA mutants were completely defective in forming stable complexes with TFIID in the absence (lanes 9–11) or presence (lanes 15–17) of the Zta transcriptional activator. Thus, the TAFIIs in TFIID inhibit these TFIIA mutants from forming a stable complex with TBP. Moreover, the failure of these mutants to form stable complexes with TFIID correlates with their defects in transcriptional activation function (Fig. 2 C) (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The semiconservative substitutions at residues Tyr-65 and Trp-72 were particularly interesting because these form T-A but were defective for D-A formation and transcriptional coactivation (Fig. 2) (49Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based on crystal structure, we would predict that mutations at these residues should have a primary defect in the interaction with TBP. To determine whether these TFIIA mutants alter the stability of the T-A complex, we compared the dissociation rate of T-A formed with the wild-type and mutant TFIIAs. Dissociation rates were measured in polyacrylamide EMSA by the addition of excess unlabeled TATA oligonucleotide competitor to preformed T-A-DNA complexes (Fig.3 A). T-A complex stability was assayed at increasing times after the addition of competitor TATA oligonucleotide. We found that γ Y65F had a significantly increased dissociation rate relative to wild-type TFIIA because there was an ∼8-fold difference in the reduction of T-A complex after 4 h of oligonucleotide challenge relative to the reduction of complex formed with wild-type IIA (Fig. 3 A, lanes 18 and19). In contrast, the γ W72A mutant showed no significant change in the dissociation rate relative to wild-type TFIIA after 4 h of oligonucleotide challenge (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the transcriptional defect of γ Y65F may be attributed, in part, to decreasing the stability of the T-A-DNA ternary complex. Mutations at residue Trp-72 produce a stable T-A complex but often give rise to a species of slower mobility. To explore the possibility that TFIIA-γW72A and γW72F may produce alternative conformations in the ternary complex with TBP and DNA, we used limited proteolysis as a probe of protein structure and stability. Limited proteolysis has been used previously to map a core domain of TBP and TFIIA and for evidence that TFIIA induces a conform"
https://openalex.org/W1982601427,"Abstract Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) are essential proteins in many cellular processes. In vitroselection was used to evolve high affinity RNA aptamers to theYersinia PTPase from two random pools varying in length. Selected aptamers from the two different pools share a 21-residue conserved sequence. They bind to their target with dissociation constants of 18 and 28 nm and inhibit the enzyme with IC50 values of 10 and 35 nm, but do not bind a related PTPase. Modification of the PTPase’s active site cysteine with the alkylating agent iodoacetate results in a loss of binding affinity. These experiments suggest that the selected aptamers act by binding at or near the active site and might therefore be useful in defining the interactions between PTPases and their targets."
https://openalex.org/W2007314127,"CD43, the most abundant membrane protein of T lymphocytes, is able to initiate signals that lead to Ca2+ mobilization and interleukin-2 production, yet the molecular events involved in signal transduction pathway of the CD43 molecule are only beginning to be understood. We have shown recently that cross-linking CD43 on the cell surface of human T lymphocytes with the anti-CD43 monoclonal antibody L10 leads to CD43-Fyn kinase interactions and to Fyn phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. This interaction seems to be mediated by the SH3 domain of Fyn and a proline-rich sequence located in the cytoplasmic domain of CD43. Here we show that CD43-specific activation of human T lymphocytes induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc and of the guanine exchange factor Vav, as well as the formation of a macromolecular complex that comprises Shc, GRB2, and Vav. CD43 ligation resulted in enhanced formation of Vav·SLP-76 complexes and in the activation and nuclear translocation of ERK2. Cross-linking of the CD43 molecule in 3T3-CD43+ cells induced luciferase activity from a construct under the control of the Fos serum responsive element. Altogether, these data suggest that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is involved in CD43-dependent interleukin-2 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2062910628,"Cot kinase is a protein serine/threonine kinase, classified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, implicated in T lymphocyte activation. Here we show that an increase in Cot kinase expression promotes tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production in Jurkat T cells stimulated by soluble anti-CD3 or by low concentrations of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and calcium ionophore. Overexpression of Cot kinase in Jurkat cells activates TNF-α gene expression. Cot kinase promotes TNF-α promoter activation to a similar extent as calcium ionophore and PDBu or soluble anti-CD28 and PDBu. Neither phorbol esters nor calcium ionophore can replace Cot kinase on TNF-α promoter-driven transcription. Expression of a dominant negative form of Cot kinase inhibits TNF-α promoter activation induced by stimulation with either calcium ionophore and PDBu, soluble anti-CD28 and PDBu, or soluble anti-CD3 and PDBu. TNF-α promoter-driven transcription by Cot kinase is partially mediated by MAPK/ERK kinase and is cyclosporin A-resistant. Cot kinase increases at least the AP-1 and AP-2 response elements. These data indicate that Cot kinase plays a critical role in TNF-α production. Cot kinase is a protein serine/threonine kinase, classified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, implicated in T lymphocyte activation. Here we show that an increase in Cot kinase expression promotes tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production in Jurkat T cells stimulated by soluble anti-CD3 or by low concentrations of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and calcium ionophore. Overexpression of Cot kinase in Jurkat cells activates TNF-α gene expression. Cot kinase promotes TNF-α promoter activation to a similar extent as calcium ionophore and PDBu or soluble anti-CD28 and PDBu. Neither phorbol esters nor calcium ionophore can replace Cot kinase on TNF-α promoter-driven transcription. Expression of a dominant negative form of Cot kinase inhibits TNF-α promoter activation induced by stimulation with either calcium ionophore and PDBu, soluble anti-CD28 and PDBu, or soluble anti-CD3 and PDBu.

The data shown here demonstrate that overexpression of Cot kinase enhances TNF-α secretion in Jurkat cells. Transfection of Cot kinase in Jurkat T cells promotes TNF-α gene expression. We also demonstrate that a dominant negative form of Cot kinase inhibits TNF-α promoter-driven transcription. Our data also further demonstrate that Cot kinase activates TNF-α promoter-driven transcription in a CSA-resistant way and that Cot kinase regulates at least the AP-1 and AP-2 response elements. The DraI fragment (222–1871 nt) of cot (8Chan A.M.-L. Chedid M. McGovern E.S. Popescu N.C. Miki T. Aronson S.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1329-1333PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pEF-BOS, previously digested with BamHI, treated with CIP, and subsequently with Klenow enzyme. A pEF-BOS-cot construct, in the 5′-3′ orientation relative to the EF promoter, was selected. A similar pEF-BOS-trunc-cot construct, in the 5′-3′ orientation relative to the EF promoter, was obtained by digesting truncated cot withDraI (30–1302 nt) (5Miyoshi J. Higashi T. Mukai H. Ohuchi T. Kakunaga T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4088-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The inactive kinase form of full-length cot was generated by PCR. TheAvaI-HindIII fragment of cot was cloned into the AvaI-HindIII sites of a normal pUC19 vector. A PCR with the mutagenic primers AGAATGGCGTGTGCACTGATCCCA and TAGTCTACCGAATTTAACTAGATG encompassing the substitution Lys-168 to Ala-168 was performed using this construct as template. Separately, cot cDNA (8Chan A.M.-L. Chedid M. McGovern E.S. Popescu N.C. Miki T. Aronson S.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1329-1333PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated to a pUC19 vector devoid of AvaI and HindIII sites. The AvaI-HindIII fragment of cot was replaced by the mutatedAvaI-HindIII fragment obtained by PCR, yielding inactive cot (inac-cot), which was subsequently cloned in the pEF-BOS vector as described for cot kinase and obtaining pEF-BOS-inac-cot(5′-3′). DNA sequencing of inac-cot was performed to verify the construct.

Immunoglobulin from the ascitic fluid was purified by Sepharose-protein A chromatography. The human leukemia T cell line Jurkat was obtained from Dr. Abelardo López-Rivas and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), gentamycin (50 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) (complete medium). DNA-mediated gene transfer into Jurkat cells was accomplished by electroporation (43Ballester A. Tobeña R. Lisbona C. Calvo V. Alemany S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were washed and resuspended in complete medium at a concentration of 2 × 107/ml, and 1 ml of the cell suspension was transferred into a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad), and unless otherwise indicated, 10 μg of the different pEF-BOS constructs and 5 μg of the different pTNFα-Luc constructs were added. Electroporation was accomplished with a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) with a capacitance of 960 microfarads and an electrical field of 300 V. The electroporated cells were transferred into tissue culture flasks (Costar) in complete medium at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. After 2 h in culture, transfected cells were stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 (Boehringer Mannheim) and different concentrations of PDBu (Sigma) or with soluble anti-CD3 for 24 h. Culture supernatants were tested for TNF-α production with the human TNF-α quantification enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Genzyme), following the manufacturer's instructions. The detection limit according to the standard curve was over 73 pmol. The transfection efficiency of electroporation, as tested by expression of the fluorescent protein from the pTR-UF2 construct (44Zolotuknin S. Potter M. Hauswirth W.W. Guy J. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4646-4654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was about 35%. Jurkat cells were electroporated with pEF-BOS (10 μg/ml), pEF-BOS-cot(5′-3′) (10 μg/ml), or no plasmid. After 30 min incubation cells were stimulated for 6 h, with 0.25 μm calcium ionophore and 50 ng/ml PDBu or 0.1 μm calcium ionophore and 5 ng/ml PDBu, and total RNA was extracted using Ultraspec (Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To perform the RT reaction (45Souzé F. Ntodou-Thome A. Tran C.Y. Rosténe W. Forgez P. Biotechniques. 1996; 21: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), 2 μg of total RNA from nonstimulated or stimulated cells were heated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 50 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2.5 units of DNase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and RT buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), and then treated at 95 °C for 5 min. Ten μmrandom primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were subsequently added, and the mixture was heated at 70 °C for 10 min. After chilling on ice, 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript RNase H−, Life Technologies, Inc.) were added, and the reaction was continued at 42 °C for 60 min. The reaction was finished by heating at 99 °C for 5 min. To perform the PCR the specific oligonucleotides, 5′ AGCCTCTTCTCCTTCCTGAT (277–297 nt) and 3′ AGTAGATGAGGGTCCAGGAG (575–595 nt), deduced from the human TNF-α cDNA, and 5′ AGCACAATGAAGATCAAGAT (1292–1311 nt) and 3′ TGTAACGCAACTAAGTCATA (1460–1479 nt), deduced from the human β-actin cDNA were used. The first round was performed for 25 cycles, with 10 μmTNF-α primers, 1 μm β-actin primers, and with 1 μl of the RT, and at an annealing temperature of 57 °C. The second round was performed in the same conditions, using 0.2 μl of the first PCR as template, except that 10 μm of the 4 primers were used. The reactions were analyzed in 1% agarose gels. DNA-mediated gene transfer into Jurkat cells was performed as explained above. Jurkat cells were cotransfected with different TNF-α promoter-Luc reporter constructs (5 μg/ml) together with control construct (pEF-BOS) (10 μg/ml) or different pEF-BOS-cot constructs (10 μg/ml). After 30 min in culture, cells were stimulated for 12 h with different stimuli as follows: soluble anti-CD3, soluble anti-CD28 9.3 antibody (generously donated by Dr. C. June), calcium ionophore A23187, or PHA (Sigma) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of PDBu (Sigma). 8-Br-cAMP (Boehringer Mannheim), Dex (Sigma), CSA, or PD 98059 (MEK inhibitor) (Calbiochem) were added to the cells 30 min after electroporation and then the cells were stimulated 2 h later. Twelve hours after stimulation cells were collected by centrifugation, and Luc activity was determined by the luciferase assay kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell extracts were normalized by protein measurements with the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad). Table I illustrates the effect of Cot expression in Jurkat T cells on TNF-α production. Jurkat cells stimulated with 0.25 μm calcium ionophore and 50 ng/ml PDBu (maximum stimulation) produced about 240 pmol/5 × 105 cells of TNF-α, independently of whether cells were electroporated with pEF-BOS-cot(5′-3′), pEF-BOS, or no plasmid. Stimulation with suboptimal concentrations of calcium ionophore and PDBu only increased TNF-α production in cells overexpressing Cot kinase (Table I). Soluble anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) alone did not stimulate TNF-α production in pEF-BOS or non-plasmid electroporated cells. However, with this stimulus TNF-α production was detected in pEF-BOS-cot(5′-3′)-electroporated cells. In the absence of any stimuli pEF-BOS-cot(5′-3′)-transfected cells were not able to produce TNF-α, indicating that overexpression of Cot kinase by itself was not able to induce TNF-α production.Table IRegulation of TNF-α production by Cot kinaseNo stimulusPDBu (50 ng/ml) + ionophore A23187 (0.25 μm)PDBu (5 ng/ml) + ionophore A23187 (0.1 μm)PDBu (0.5 ng/ml) + ionophore A23187 (0.1 μm)Anti-CD3pEF-BOS-cot<73225 ± 20181 ± 5163 ± 9170 ± 11pEF-BOS<73250 ± 13<73<73<73—<73243 ± 10<73<73<73Jurkat cells (2 × 107) were electroporated with 10 μg/ml pEF-BOS-cot(5′–3′), 10 μg/ml pEF-BOS, or no DNA (—) as described under “Experimental Procedures” and stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 (0.25 μm) and PDBu (50 ng/ml) (maximum stimulation), with calcium ionophore A23187 (0.1 μm) and PDBu (5 ng/ml), with calcium ionophore A23187 (0.1 μm) and PDBu (0.5 ng/ml), or with soluble anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) for 24 h, and TNF-α production was measured in the supernatant. The data expressed in pmol/5 × 105 cells show the mean of three experiments performed in duplicate. Open table in a new tab Jurkat cells (2 × 107) were electroporated with 10 μg/ml pEF-BOS-cot(5′–3′), 10 μg/ml pEF-BOS, or no DNA (—) as described under “Experimental Procedures” and stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 (0.25 μm) and PDBu (50 ng/ml) (maximum stimulation), with calcium ionophore A23187 (0.1 μm) and PDBu (5 ng/ml), with calcium ionophore A23187 (0.1 μm) and PDBu (0.5 ng/ml), or with soluble anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) for 24 h, and TNF-α production was measured in the supernatant. The data expressed in pmol/5 × 105 cells show the mean of three experiments performed in duplicate. We then decided to investigate whether Cot kinase regulated TNF-α gene expression in Jurkat cells. RNA from pEF-BOS, pEF-BOS-cot(5′-3′), or non-plasmid electroporated cells stimulated or not with different concentrations of calcium ionophore and PDBu was isolated to perform RT-PCR assays. In the different electroporated cells stimulated with 0.25 μm calcium ionophore and 50 ng/ml PDBu (maximum stimulation), TNF-α mRNA was detected (Fig.1). A similar amount of TNF-α PCR product was obtained in Cot-transfected cells stimulated with 0.1 μm calcium ionophore and 5 ng/ml PDBu (submaximal stimulation). However, in pEF-BOS or no plasmid-transfected cells incubated with these concentrations of stimuli, a significant decrease in the intensity of the band corresponding to the TNF-α PCR product was detected. Without stimuli, the TNF-α PCR product was only detected in cells overexpressing Cot kinase (Fig. 1). Next, we decided to determine whether Cot kinase enhanced TNF-α promoter-driven transcription. Jurkat cells electroporated with −1185 pTNFα-Luc alone or together with pEF-BOS-cot(5′-3′) or pEF-BOS were subjected to different stimuli, and Luc activity was measured. In −1185 pTNFα-Luc alone or together with pEF-BOS electroporated cells, it is necessary to add both calcium ionophore (0.25 μm) and PDBu (50 ng/ml) (maximum stimulation) to observe an increase (about 25-fold) in TNF-α promoter-driven transcription (Fig. 2 A). Cells transfected with Cot kinase together with the −1185 pTNFα-Luc exhibited a similar Luc activity in the absence of any stimulus (Fig.2 A). Jurkat cells overexpressing Cot kinase treated with calcium ionophore (0.25 μm) and PDBu (50 ng/ml) (maximum stimulation) or calcium ionophore (0.25 μm) alone resulted in a further increase in the Luc activity. Stimulation of these cells with 50 ng/ml PDBu, or with suboptimal doses of calcium ionophore and PDBu (0.1 μm and 5 ng/ml respectively), or with 2 μg/ml of PHA did not further enhance Cot kinase-induced TNF-α promoter activation (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained when Jurkat cells were transfected with pEF-BOS-trunc-cot(5′-3′) instead of pEF-BOS-cot(5′-3′) (data not shown). Jurkat cells overexpressing the kinase-inactive form of Cot, by transfection of pEF-BOS-inac-cot(5′-3′), did not enhance the −1185 pTNFα-driven transcription of the Luc gene (data not shown). These data indicate that the kinase activity of Cot is necessary for TNF-α promoter activation. Several compounds were used to study if overexpression of Cot kinase stimulated the TNF-α promoter-driven transcription through the same mechanism as PDBu and calcium ionophore. Cells electroporated with −1185 pTNFα-Luc and either pEF-BOS-cot(5′-3′), pEF-BOS-trunc-cot(5′-3′), pEF-BOS, or no additional plasmid were incubated with 8-Br-cAMP, Dex, CSA, or MEK inhibitor. Cells transfected with −1185 pTNFα-Luc alone or together with pEF-BOS were also incubated with 50 ng/ml PDBu and 0.25 μm calcium ionophore. Addition of 8-Br-cAMP (0.5 mm) or Dex (10−7m) at concentrations that have been described to inhibit IL-2 promoter transcription in Jurkat T cells (46Paliogianni F. Raptis A. Ahuja S.S. Najiar S.M.

CSA added at a concentration of 100 ng/ml inhibited the TNF-α promoter-driven transcription in cells electroporated with pEF-BOS and −1185 pTNFα-Luc or only with pTNFα-Luc by 90%. CSA, used at the same concentration, did not significantly inhibit the TNF-α promoter transcription activity in Jurkat cells overexpressing truncated Cot kinase or Cot kinase (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether stimulation with soluble anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) or with soluble anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) further enhanced Cot kinase activation of the TNF-α promoter, cells were electroporated with either pEF-BOS-cot(5′-3′) or pEF-BOS, and −1185 pTNFαLuc or only with the −1185 pTNFα −Luc, and different stimuli were added. Soluble anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) or soluble anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) did not enhance the TNF-α promoter-driven transcription in cells overexpressing Cot kinase. However, addition of both stimuli together, or anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) and PDBu (20 ng/ml), increased the Cot kinase-induced TNF-α promoter-driven transcription by about 2-fold (Fig. 3). CSA inhibited TNF-α promoter activity by about 30% in Cot kinase overexpressing cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Nevertheless, CSA hardly inhibited TNF-α promoter activation in Cot-transfected cells stimulated with anti-CD28 and PDBu (Fig. 3). Cells electroporated with the −1185 pTNFα-Luc alone or together with pEF-BOS exhibited a significant activation of the TNF-α promoter-driven transcription when stimulated with anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 (about a 9-fold induction) or when activated with anti-CD28 and PDBu (about a 20-fold induction) (Fig. 3). In these cells CSA inhibited a 30% TNF-α promoter activation by soluble anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and did not regulate the stimulation by anti-CD28 and PDBu. One of the hallmarks of the anti-CD28 stimulation of cytokine production is its insensitivity to CSA (49Linsley P.S. Ledbetter J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol."

Priestman D.A. Patel M.S. Roche T.E. Harris R.A. α-Keto Acid Dehydrogenase Complexes. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1996: 151-161Google Scholar). To limit consumption of body carbohydrate reserves, PDC activity is controlled by an intricately regulated cycle carried out by dedicated kinase and phosphatase components. PDC activity is reduced due to phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) tetramers and increased by production of nonphosphorylated tetramers. Phosphorylation proceeds in a kinetically preferred order at three sites on the α subunit of E1 (2Yeaman S.J. Hutcheson E.T. Roche T.E. Pettit F.H. Brown J.R. Reed L.J. Watson D.C. Dixon G.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Sale G.J. Randle P.J. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14297-14304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component forms the structural core of the complex. It consists of four independently folded domains set apart from each other by interdomain linker (or hinge) regions, each having substantial reach (>40 Å) and high mobility (Fig.1, E2). The largest domain, located at the COOH terminus, forms a catalytically active trimer which assembles at the 20 vertices of a pentaganol dodecahedron to form a 60-mer inner core structure with icosahedral symmetry. Then a flexible segment (H3) connects to an E1-binding domain followed by two lipoyl-bearing domains (L2 and then L1 at the NH2 terminus) sequentially connected by two more flexible hinge regions (H2 and H1). In the outer surface of the E260 structure, these mobile, multisegment NH2-terminal structures intercede in dynamic processes associated with catalytic transfers and regulatory interconversions (5Perham R.N.

Harris R.A. α-Keto Acid Dehydrogenase Complexes. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1996: 33-52Google Scholar). Here we further define the latter adaptor protein roles in the regulation of PDC. Bovine kidney pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) activity are greatly enhanced in the presence of E2. Furthermore, E2 mediates acetyl-CoA and NADH stimulation of PDK activity and facilitates Ca2+stimulation of PDP activity (6Roche T.E. Liu J. Ravindran S. Baker J. Wang D. Patel M.S. Roche T.E. Harris R.A. α-Keto Acid Dehydrogenase Complexes. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1996: 33-52Google Scholar). These regulatory inputs constitute important and sensitive response mechanisms in the control of cellular energy metabolism. The marked reduction in PDC activity due to elevated NADH:NAD+ and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios stimulating PDK activity is a strategic response resulting from increased fatty acid oxidation and serves to preserve body carbohydrate stores (1Randle P.J. Priestman D.A. Patel M.S. Roche T.E. Harris R.A. α-Keto Acid Dehydrogenase Complexes. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1996: 151-161Google Scholar, 6Roche T.E. Liu J. Ravindran S. Baker J. Wang D. Patel M.S. Roche T.E. Harris R.A. α-Keto Acid Dehydrogenase Complexes. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1996: 33-52Google Scholar). To meet transitional energy needs, PDC activity is increased due to elevation of intramitochondrial Ca2+ in association with a wide variety of signal transduction cascades (7Denton R.M. McCormack J.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 451-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Increasing Ca2+ from <0.1 μm to >1.5 μmcan enhance PDP activity more than 10-fold (8Denton R.M. Randle P.J. Martin B.R. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In dissecting the intercession of E2 in these regulatory mechanisms, we have used recombinant lipoyl domain constructs to establish that the L2 domain of E2 has a crucial role in these processes (9Liu S. Baker J.C. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 793-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Ravindran S. Radke G.A. Guest J.R. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

Baker J.C. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 793-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); we have suggested that this is critical to E2 activation of PDK activity. Effector stimulation of bovine kidney PDK by NADH and acetyl-CoA ensues from using these products in reducing and acetylating, respectively, the L2 lipoyl prosthetic group (10Ravindran S. Radke G.A. Guest J.R. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 653-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Reduction and acetylation are sequentially catalyzed by the reverse of the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) and E2 components. Additionally, the L2 domain exclusively binds PDP through a Ca2+-dependent interaction, and we have suggested that this is critical to stimulation of PDP in response to increased Ca2+ (11Chen G. Wang W. Liu S. Chang C. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28064-28070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This marked enhancement in PDP activity only occurs when E2 retains its lipoyl prosthetic groups. Although interaction of PDK and PDP with L2 and effector stimulation of PDK by NADH and acetyl-CoA have been demonstrated with the isolated lipoyl domain, the marked activations of PDK and PDP function elicited by the E2–60-mer are not achieved with the isolated domain. It is now known that there are at least 4 PDK isozymes (PDK1, PDK2, PDK3, and PDK4) (12Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol.

Roche, unpublished observations. 2J. C. Baker, J. Dong, and T. E. Roche, unpublished observations. we have developed unique preparations of the human isozymes and are characterizing the capacity of these recombinantly produced PDK isozymes to undergo activation by E2. Considerable isozyme variability has been observed; we are evaluating whether some unexpected outcomes reflect normal isozyme properties or are an artifact due to the physical state of the recombinantly prepared kinase isozymes. 3PDK3 is markedly activated (>10-fold) by E2, and this is a stable response; PDK1 and PDK2 are activated up to 4-fold by E2 when first prepared, but these responses fade with time. 3PDK3 is markedly activated (>10-fold) by E2, and this is a stable response; PDK1 and PDK2 are activated up to 4-fold by E2 when first prepared, but these responses fade with time. Thus, the present studies are conducted with bovine kidney kinase. Recombinantly produced human E2 (free of tightly bound E3BP) provides high activation of bovine PDK and PDP activity (16Yang D. Song J. Wagenknecht T. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 6361-6369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, we have prepared and evaluated the capacity of reconstructed E2 assemblages modified by selective deletion of one lipoyl domain or by mutation at the site of lipoylation for their capacity to support enhanced PDK and PDP activity and mediate effector stimulations (Fig. 1). The results further support critical roles of the L2 domain in activated PDK and PDP function. Conversion of the lysines that undergo lipoylation to alanines provides additional support for an essential role of lipoyl cofactor of L2 in both PDK and PDP function. The Lys to Ala mutation is less drastic than delipoylation (9Liu S. Baker J.C. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 793-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Ravindran S. Radke G.A. Guest J.R. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

The results also indicate some role for the L1 domain but not for the L1 lipoyl group for E2 assemblages maximally enhancing PDK and PDP activity. However, NADH and acetyl-CoA stimulated PDK activity to the maximal extent with the E2 assemblage lacking the L1 domain suggesting the selective interaction of acetylated L2 with bovine PDK markedly alters its function. Bovine kidney PDC, E1 component, E2·E3BP·PDK subcomplex, the recombinant bilipoyl domain region of human E2, and one form of full sized human E2–60-mer were prepared as described previously (16Yang D.

Primers (200 pmol) having about 50–60% G:C content (Tms >45 °C) were reacted with 1.5 ng of purified template DNA, 200 μm dNTPs, 2.5 IUsPfu DNA polymerase in Pfu buffer (Stratagene). The reaction mixtures, overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil, were denatured initially and in each cycle for 1 min at 95 °C, reacted for 20 to 30 cycles with 0.5 min annealing at 55 °C, and 0.5 min extension at 72 °C with the final extension reaction proceeding for 2 min. As diagramed on the right side of Fig.2, a cDNA fragment coding for L1 was amplified by PCR with pShE2 plasmid (codes for mature human E2 with the E2 leader sequence removed and a start Met inserted (16Yang D. Song J. Wagenknecht T. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

This introduced flanking NcoI and EagI sites (compatible with EaeI site) at the 5′- and 3′-ends (sense direction), respectively. The DNA amplified from PCR was digested byNcoI and EagI, purified, and ligated to 1-kilobase pair DNA fragment purified after digestion of pShE2 plasmid with EaeI and BamHI. The resulting DNA fragment coding for L1E2 (Fig. 1) was ligated to pSE420 vector previously digested by NcoI and BamHI to produce pShL1E2. DNA sequencing was performed for the region produced by PCR and flanking ligation sites. As shown on the left side of Fig. 2, a segment including the 5′-region coding for L1 portion of E2 was removed from pShE2 vector by digestion with BspMI in combination with BamHI digestion to produce a 1.3-kilobase pair cDNA fragment. This fragment was ligated to a hybrid of two oligonucleotides that include 16 base pairs encoding the NH2 terminus of L2 plus two other amino acids (Gly and Ser) prior to start codon. This spliced fragment was subcloned into the pSE420 vector previously digested byNcoI and BamHI. The resultant expression vector, pShL2E2 (Fig. 2, left side), encoded L2E2 (Fig. 1). The DNA derived from the synthetic oligonucleotides along with their adjoining ligation sites were sequenced in pShL1E2 and pShL2E2. pShL1E2 and pShL2E2 plasmids were introduced into BL21(DE3) strains by electroporation using the Transfector 300 BTX. Expression of pShL1E2 and pShL2E2 was carried out as described previously for pShE2 to produce E2 (16Yang D. Song J. Wagenknecht T. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

Cells were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (buffer A) and then disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 ×g for 20 min). PEG-8000 was added dropwise to 8% (v/v), and the precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 20 min). The pellet was in a cloudy state after being resuspended in buffer A. Upon addition of (NH4)2SO4 to 9% saturation, substantial clearing occurred; after ∼20 min, the material still suspended was precipitated and discarded. Addition of (NH4)2SO4 was continued until the concentration of (NH4)2SO4 reached 25% saturation. The precipitated protein was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 20 min and redissolved in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Aliquots of purified samples were stored frozen at −80 °C. The protein concentration was measured by the BCA method. The E2 activity at each fraction step was followed by measuring the PTA activity (21Ono K. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. Rahmatullah M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26135-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein pattern was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal sequencing of SDS-PAGE-separated protein bands was conducted as described previously (16Yang D. Song J. Wagenknecht T. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

The ratio of the different protein bands was analyzed by scanning the band patterns for Coomassie Blue R-250 and silver-stained gels following SDS-PAGE separation on samples from the preparations of L1E2 or L2E2. An Ittis Dos Program was used to do the image density analysis and analyze the intensity ratios. As will be described in detail elsewhere, 4A. Yakhnin, X. Gong, X. Yan, M. P. Sadler, and T. E. Roche, manuscript in preparation. a variety of lipoyl domain mutants has been prepared and tested alone and incorporated into E2 oligomers. Expression vectors for mature E2 and for glutathione S-transferase fused L1 or L2 and have been designed with silent restriction sites to permit transfer of cDNA fragments encoding L1 or L2 mutants from vectors expressing glutathioneS-transferase-lipoyl domains to vectors expressing these mutant domains in whole E2 structures. DNA fragments, encoding K46A-modified L1 or K173A-modified L2, were introduced by this approach into E2 structures. The modified cDNA inserts expressing whole E2 have also been modified to include a removable His tag at the NH2terminus. The E2 assemblages are purified to >98% purity by a two-step procedure which involves fractionation with polyethylene glycol and gel filtration chromatography which is immediately preceded by removal of the His tag.4 The introduction of the His tag greatly increased the recovery of E2 by improving solubility of E2 assemblages and reduced the presence of truncated E2 subunits, probably by reducing the tendency of a codon for Met in the L1 domain operating as an internal start site (16Yang D. Song J. Wagenknecht T. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 6361-6369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (32) Google Scholar). E2, K43AE2, and K173AE2 prepared by this approach were used for studies shown in panel B of Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7. Other properties of these and several other constructs developed will be described elsewhere.4 To evaluate E1 binding to the truncated or full-sized human E2 constructs, ∼20 μg of L1E2 or L2E2 subunit with or without E1 (20 μg) was incubated at 4 °C for 120 min. After incubation, the above mixtures and the control E1 sample were each loaded onto the top of a three-step sucrose gradient, and gradient separation was carried out as described (16Yang D. Song J.

E2 activity was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring acetyl-dihydrolipoamide production at 232 nm. The acetylation capacities for E2, L1E2, and L2E2 (50 pmol) were determined by E3-catalyzed reduction of lipoyl groups followed by E2-catalyzed acetylation using [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (11.35 cpm/pmol) under conditions of CoA conversion to succinyl-CoA as described previously (10Ravindran S.

To evaluate maximal PDK activities, assays were conducted in the presence of 20 mm potassium phosphate (condition 1); to evaluate regulatory effects or otherwise assay PDK activity at a near-physiological level of K+, assays were conducted in the presence of 50 mm MOPS-K, pH 7.5, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl (condition 2). Under both reaction conditions, assays additionally contained 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.2% Pluronic-F-68, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Reactions were started by addition of [γ-32P]ATP (∼3 × 105 cpm/pmol) to give a final volume of 50 μl and then terminated and worked up as described previously (28Li L. Radke G.A. Ono K. Roche T.E.

In studies involving L1E2 and L2E2, E2 sources were preincubated with E1b at 4 °C for about 120 min before the activity assays, while only 20 min was used with mutated E2 structures. By using the domain codes in Fig. 1 and the approaches outlined under “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 2, the region coding for the H1-L2 was removed along with reconnecting the coding region for the L1 domain to yield a vector, pShL1E2 (Fig. 2,right side) expressing L1E2 (Fig. 1). L1E2 has one extra amino acid, a glycine at the NH2 terminus following the start Met codon, and was designed with residues 233–240 of H2 hinge region removed so that L1 was connected after Ser-98 to a hinge region, H2′, which starts with an Ala-Ala sequence (residues 241 and 242 of E2). This produced a transition similar to that between L1 and the beginning of H1; H2′ is still a hinge region over 20 residues in length. Similarly, the coding region for L1-H1 was removed from pShE2 expression vector for E2 to produce a vector, pShL2E2 (Fig. 2,left side), coding for L2E2 (Fig. 1). The last two residues of H1 region (Gly-126 and Ser-127) were retained following the start Met in L2E2. The accuracy of the cDNA inserts was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Western blotting confirmed that L1E2 or L2E2 expressed"

The transcriptional regulatory region of the gp34 gene was activated by HTLV-I Tax in the human T cell line Jurkat, in which endogenous gp34 is induced by Tax. Sequence analysis demonstrated that two NF-κB-like elements (1 and 2) were present in the regulatory region. Both NF-κB-like elements were able to bind to NF-κB or its related factor(s) in a Tax-dependent manner. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays indicated that NF-κB-like element 1 was Tax-responsive, although the activity was lower than that the native promoter. NF-κB-like element 2 elevated promoter activity when combined with NF-κB-like element 1, indicating cooperative function of the elements for maximum promoter function. Unlike typical NF-κB elements, the NF-κB-like elements in gp34 were not activated by treatment of Jurkat cells with phorbol ester despite induction of the NF-κB-like binding activity. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter assays using the region upstream of the NF-κB-like elements identified an upstream region that reduced transcription from cognate and noncognate core promoters in a Tax-independent manner.

Interestingly, unlike those molecules, gp34 and OX40 are not detected on the cell surface until lymphocytes are activated, suggesting that they function at later stages of lymphocyte activation and proliferation. However, little is known about the function of the gp34/OX40 system. Recent studies indicate that both gp34 and OX40 transmit signals into the cytoplasm (38Baum P.R. Gayle R.B. r. Ramsdell F.

Unlike other cellular genes transactivated by HTLV-I Tax, gp34 is not induced on T cells by stimulation with mitogens, phorbol ester, or IL-2 (35Tanaka Y. Inoi T. Tozawa H. Yamamoto N. Hinuma Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1985; 36: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These observations imply that the gp34/OX40 system may be involved in growth regulation of T cells during immune responses and in growth of HTLV-I-infected T cells. Thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of gp34 and OX40 expression would be useful in understanding normal and cancerous proliferation of T cells. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of Tax-induced transcriptional regulation of gp34. Tax-induced gp34transactivation was mediated through a unique NF-κB-like element that was not activated by phorbol ester. We detected a region upstream of the NF-κB-like element that suppressed transcription from cognate and noncognate core promoters. The array of these regions may contribute to the strict and complex regulation of gp34 expression in T cells. TL-Mor (49Sugamura K. Fujii M. Kannagi M. Sakitani M. Takeuchi M. Hinuma Y. Int. J.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics at 5% CO2 in air. A human genomic DNA library was constructed by introduction of Sau3AI partially digested genomic DNA from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes into theBamHI site of phage vector EMBL3. The library (5 × 105 plaques) was screened by plaque hybridization using the 5′-most EcoRI fragment of gp34 cDNA as a probe. Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase 2.0 (United States Biochemicals) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNA was isolated from MT-2 and Jurkat cells by the guanidium thiocyanate method as described previously (53Sakitani M. Nakamura M. Fujii M. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. Virus Genes. 1987; 1: 35-47PubMed Google Scholar). The probe used for S1 mapping was the 499-base pair (bp) AluI genomic DNA fragment. The end-labeled AluI fragment was annealed with 20 μg of RNA in 20 μl of solution containing 80% formamide, 20 mmPIPES (pH 6.4), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 200 mm NaCl at 52 °C for 3 h after initial incubation at 85 °C for 5 min. The annealed products were digested with S1 nuclease (100 units) in 100 μl of solution containing 270 mm NaCl, 1 mmZnSO4, 30 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA was ethanol-precipitated and analyzed by electrophoresis in an 8% acrylamide sequencing gel with 7m urea. The primer used for primer extension was a 30-mer oligonucleotide (CTTGTTCCTCTCGAATCTTGGCCTGGCTGC) corresponding to the 5′-end of the minus strand of the S1 mapping probe. End-labeled primer was annealed to 20 μg of RNA in 30 μl of solution containing 80% formamide, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mmKCl, and 20 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 8 h after initial incubation at 85 °C for 5 min. The annealed product was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 20 μl of solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTPs, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 unit/μl human placental ribonuclease inhibitor. The extension reaction was initiated by adding 50 units of reverse transcriptase and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The products were analyzed by electrophoresis along with the S1 mapping product. Size markers were sequencing ladders of thegp34 genomic DNA fragment using a 17-mer primer corresponding to the 5′-end of the 30-mer oligonucleotide used for primer extension analysis. The 9-kbp fragment (Sau3AI (−9000) -AvaII (+27)) upstream of the first exon of the gp34 gene was inserted in front of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in a reporter plasmid, pSV0CAT (54Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar), to generate pGP(−9000)CAT. Deletion mutants of both 5′- and 3′-ends of the genomic fragment were generated by digestion from restriction sites with exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease. The 5′ deletion mutants were derived from pGP(−9000)CAT. The 3′ deletion mutants were prepared by insertion of a series of 3′ deletion mutants of the −823 to −54 fragment into the −31 CAT reporter plasmid, pGP(−31)CAT, which contained the 58-bp (−31 to +27) genomic fragment. Plasmids with mutant fragments were named according to the numbers of the 5′- or 3′-end of the fragments. pGP(−31)CAT was also used as a backbone vector to be introduced with the −100 to −54 fragment, NF-κB-like elements 1 and 2, and the HTLV-I enhancer fragment. The −100 to −54 fragment was introduced into the pGP(−31)CAT plasmid in single form (pGP(−100∼−54) CAT) and four tandem repeat form (pGP(−100∼−54)x4CAT). Similarly, NF-κB-like elements 1 and 2 were inserted into the pGP(−31)CAT plasmid in single and four tandem repeat forms, yielding pGPκB1CAT, pGPκB2CAT, pGPκB1×4CAT, and pGPκB2×4 CAT, respectively. pHE(−31)CAT is a derivative of the pGP(−31)CAT plasmid carrying the 267-bp HTLV-I enhancer fragment (55Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Noda T. Ito Y. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). pdHE4 is a CAT plasmid containing the HTLV-I core promoter (55Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Noda T. Ito Y. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). pdHEκB-4 carries four tandemly repeated SV40 NF-κB sites in pdHE4(56). pdHE(−823∼−54)CAT is a derivative of the pdHE4 having the −823 to −54 fragment of the gp34 gene promoter. pMAXneo is a Tax expression vector in which the Tax gene is regulated by the mouse metallothionein promoter, whereas pMAXneo/M is a nonfunctional Tax mutant (55Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Noda T. Ito Y. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reexamination of the DNA sequence for the Tax mutant demonstrated that the mutant gene has a 3-base insertion at the MluI site in the coding region, rather than a 4-base insertion as reported initially (55Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Noda T. Ito Y. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), resulting in a mutant with an additional Arg residue between amino acids 62 and 63. Tax mutants TaxM22, Tax703, and Taxd3, which are not effective in activation of the NF-κB, serum-responsive factor, and CREB/ATF binding sites, respectively, have been described previously (32Suzuki T. Hirai H. Fujisawa J. Fujita T. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2391-2397PubMed Google Scholar, 57Akagi T. Ono H. Nyunoya H. Shimotohno K.

Wild type Tax and these Tax mutant genes were cloned into pHβAPr-1-neo, which has a β-actin promoter (59Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmid DNA was transfected into Jurkat cells by the DEAE-dextran method and assayed for CAT activity as described previously (55Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Noda T. Ito Y. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CAT activities were shown as percent acetylation, and transactivation was expressed as fold induction of CAT activity with pMAXneo compared with that with pMAXneo/M. In CAT assays with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), TPA was added to cells transfected with CAT plasmids at a concentration of 20 nm, 12 h after transfection, and incubation was continued for a further 36 h. We also compared CAT activity with TPA to that without TPA. All CAT assays were carried out at least three times in duplicate. Repeated assays showed similar results, and representative data are presented. The gel shift assay was performed as described previously (56Nakamura M. Niki M. Nagata K. Ohtani K. Saito S. Hinuma Y. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20189-20192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA probes were end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol; Amersham). Nuclear extracts were prepared from TL-Mor, Jurkat, and JPX-9 cells as described previously (56Nakamura M. Niki M. Nagata K. Ohtani K. Saito S. Hinuma Y. Sugamura K. J. Biol.

In order to analyze the regulatory mechanism of gp34 gene transcription, we cloned the promoter region of the gp34 gene. A human genomic DNA library constructed with EMBL3 was screened with the 5′-most EcoRI fragment of thegp34 cDNA. Several positive clones were identified, and one clone, which contained sequences 9 kbp upstream of the ATG initiation codon for gp34, was further analyzed. The promoter activity of this region was examined by CAT assays. The 9-kbp 5′-flanking fragment was isolated and ligated to the CAT reporter gene. CAT activity was examined with or without a Tax expression vector, pMAXneo, in the human Jurkat T cell line. As expected, in Jurkat cells, the 9-kbp fragment showed little or no promoter activity in the absence of Tax (Fig. 1 A). Tax expression induced promoter activity of this fragment. Thus, the promoter of the gp34 gene was present in this region, and its activity was dependent on Tax. Experiments using 5′ deletion mutants of the 9-kbp fragment showed that most, if not all, of the promoter activity was associated with the 850-bp KpnI-AvaII fragment in the 9-kbp 5′-flanking region. The nucleotide sequence of the 850-bp fragment was then determined (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that the transcriptional start site was contained in this fragment, S1 mapping and primer extension analyses were performed. Total RNA was isolated from an HTLV-I infected T cell line (TL-Mor) and an HTLV-I-unrelated T cell line (Jurkat). RNA was hybridized with an S1 mapping probe of the 497-bp AluI genomic fragment. A 224-base fragment protected from nuclease digestion was detected using RNA from TL-Mor but not Jurkat cells (Fig. 1 C). A product of the same size was observed using TL-Mor but not Jurkat RNA by primer extension analysis using a 30-mer primer with the same 5′-end as the minus strand of the S1 probe. These results showed that the transcriptional start site was located 154 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon and that most of the promoter activity resided in the region extending from −824 to +27. Sequence analysis showed that there were two NF-κB site-like sequences (−87 to −77 and −64 to −54) and one AP-1 site-like sequence (−74 to −68) between the two NF-κB-like sequences (Fig.1 B). Although a typical TATA box sequence was not found around 30 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site, it is possible that the TTAAA sequence located at −29 might be TATA-related. In order to examine the function of each subregion in the regulatory region, a series of deletion mutants of the regulatory region was generated, and the mutants were assayed for their promoter activities with or without Tax. A 5′-end deletion (up to −31) of the −824 to +27 fragment completely abolished Tax responsiveness (Fig. 2). This −31 mutant retained the TATA-related sequence TTAAA and was thought to contain the core promoter as evidenced by the fact that addition of the HTLV-I enhancer to the −31 mutant restored Tax responsiveness. Thus, the core promoter of the gp34 gene seemed to be Tax-independent, and the upstream region appeared to be responsible for Tax-dependent activation. As expected, the −31 mutant linked to the −823 to −54 fragment exhibited the same CAT activity in response to Tax as did the −823 mutant. Combination of the −823 to −54 fragment with the HTLV-I core promoter also showed Tax-dependent activation. These results indicate that the region between −823 and −54 of the gp34 gene mediates transactivation by Tax. Note that the −31 mutant showed higher CAT activity than the −823 mutant in the absence of Tax. Similarly, the −823 to −54 fragment, when linked to the HTLV-I core promoter, significantly reduced CAT activity in the absence of Tax, although it endowed Tax-dependent activation. These results indicate that in addition to a region enhancing transcription in response to Tax, there is a region in the −823 to −54 fragment that suppresses basal transcription in the absence of Tax. The Tax-responsive region was further localized by CAT assays using 5′ and 3′ deletion mutants of the 5′-flanking fragment. A mutant with a −106 deletion at the 5′-end retained Tax responsiveness although it showed an increased inherent CAT activity without Tax. This result suggests that an element responsible for Tax-dependent activation is retained in a region downstream of −106 and that the suppressive activity is associated with a region upstream of −106. To determine the 3′-border of the Tax-responsive region, a set of 3′ deletion mutants of the −823 to −54 fragment were linked to the −31 mutant and assayed for their Tax-dependent activation. Addition of the −823 to −54 fragment to the −31 core CAT vector gave as high an activation (more than 30-fold induction) in response to Tax as did the native −823 to +27 fragment (Fig. 2). A 3′ mutant deleted to −57 exhibited a profoundly reduced response to Tax with induction of only 7.7-fold. Further deletion to −118 completely abolished Tax-dependent activation. Collectively, these results indicate that a Tax-responsive element is present in the region between −106 and −54. Interestingly, all 3′ deletion mutants exhibited reduced CAT activity as compared with the −31 mutant in the absence of Tax (Fig. 2). This implies that suppressive activity is associated with a region upstream of −118, consistent with observations from the 5′ deletion mutants. To identify an element responsible for"
https://openalex.org/W1982663134,"Type-1 plasminogen activator-inhibitor (PAI-1) is a major physiologic inhibitor of plasminogen activation. Incubation of HTC rat hepatoma cells with the cyclic nucleotide analogue, 8-bromo-cAMP, causes a dramatic increase in tissue-type plasminogen activator activity secondary to a 90% decrease in PAI-1 mRNA. Although 8-bromo-cAMP causes a modest decrease in PAI-1 transcription, regulation is primarily the result of a 3-fold increase in the rate of PAI-1 mRNA degradation. To determine the cis-acting sequences required for cyclic nucleotide regulation, we have stably transfected HTC cells with chimeric genes containing sequences from the rat PAI-1 cDNA and the mouse β-globin gene and examined the effect of cyclic nucleotides on the decay rate of these transcripts. The mRNA transcribed from the β-globin gene is stable and not cyclic nucleotide-regulated, whereas the transcript from a construct containing the β-globin coding region and the PAI-1 3′-untranslated region (UTR) is destabilized in the presence of 8-bromo-cAMP, suggesting that this response is mediated by sequences in the PAI-1 3′-UTR. Analyses by deletion of sequences from this chimeric construct indicate that, whereas more than one region of the PAI-1 3′-UTR can confer cyclic nucleotide responsiveness, the 3′-most 134-nucleotide sequence alone is sufficient to do so. Insertion of PAI-1 sequences within the β-globin 3′-UTR confirms that the 3′-most 134 nucleotides of PAI-1 mRNA can confer cyclic nucleotide regulation of stability on a heterologous transcript, suggesting that this sequence may play a major role in hormonal regulation of PAI-1 mRNA stability.

Eukaryotic gene expression is determined not only by the rate of gene transcription, but also by the rate at which the transcript is degraded. The steady state concentration of a particular mRNA, as well as the rate at which a new transcriptionally induced steady state is attained, is directly related to the message half-life (1Hargrove J.L. Hulsey M.G. Beale E.G. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous recent studies have been aimed at understanding the role of specific sequences within the mRNA in determining basal transcript stability and have led to the identification of consensus sequences that confer stability or instability to a transcript (2Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chen C.-Y. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). Although it is known that many stimuli alter mRNA stability, little is known about either the cis-acting sequences in the RNA or the cellular factors involved in regulation of message decay. Plasminogen activators (PAs) 1The abbreviations used are: PA, plasminogen activator; PAI, plasminogen activator-inhibitor; PAI-1, type-1 PAI; UTR, untranslated region; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s); bp, base pair(s); Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MCS, multicloning site; cA, 8-bromo-cAMP plus isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; ARE, AU-rich element; RE, restriction endonuclease. are serine proteases that are critical for thrombolysis and also play a key role in other physiological functions involving tissue remodeling. Plasminogen activator-inhibitors (PAIs) are specific inhibitors of PAs and are members of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family of proteins. Type-1 PAI (PAI-1) is a 50 kDa glycoprotein found in plasma, platelets, and a variety of cell types; its expression is regulated by growth factors, cytokines, and hormones, including agents that alter cellular cAMP levels (4Andreasen P.A Georg B. Lund L.R. Riccio A. Stacey S.N. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 68: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). HTC rat hepatoma cells synthesize and secrete tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and PAI-1 (5Gelehrter T.D. Sznycer-Laszuk R. Zeheb R. Cwikel B.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that incubation with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, decreases HTC cell tPA activity by increasing PAI-1 mRNA and protein 5–10-fold, an effect that is entirely explained by an increase in PAI-1 gene transcription (5Gelehrter T.D. Sznycer-Laszuk R. Zeheb R. Cwikel B.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Heaton J.H. Kathju S. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, these cells respond to cyclic nucleotides with a dramatic (≥50-fold) increase in tPA activity that is primarily the result of a decrease in PAI-1 mRNA and protein (8Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This effect is time- and concentration-dependent; a 90% decrease in PAI-1 mRNA occurs after 12 h of incubation with 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP plus 1 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (cA) (8Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Barouski-Miller P.A. Gelehrter T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2319-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on experiments have shown that cA causes about a 60% decrease in PAI-1 transcription, not sufficient to account for the decrease in message accumulation. We have determined the half-life of HTC cell PAI-1 mRNA by following the decrease in message level either after inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D or after washing out the transcriptional inducer, dexamethasone. By either method, PAI-1 mRNA displays a half-life of 4.0–4.5 h. Incubation of cells with cA accelerates PAI-1 mRNA decay, decreasing the half-life to 1.5 h. Thus, cyclic nucleotides regulate PAI-1 gene expression at both a transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. Interestingly, although actinomycin D does not alter the basal rate of PAI-1 mRNA degradation, it prevents the cA-induced acceleration of decay; incubation with cyclic nucleotides in the presence of actinomycin D results in a decay rate identical to that seen in the presence of actinomycin D alone (7Heaton J.H. Kathju S. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this study is to understand the mechanism by which cyclic nucleotides regulate PAI-1 mRNA decay by determining the sequences within the PAI-1 transcript that are required for 8-bromo-cAMP regulation. We report here that the 3′-UTR of PAI-1 mRNA can confer cyclic nucleotide regulation on the otherwise stable β-globin mRNA. Deletion analysis of the PAI-1 3′-UTR reveals the presence of at least two cA-responsive regions; one of these is in the 3′-most 134 nt of PAI-1 mRNA. Furthermore, the 3′-most 134-nt sequence by itself is able to confer cA responsiveness on the heterologous β-globin mRNA, suggesting that this sequence plays a major role in the hormonal regulation of PAI-1 mRNA stability. Eagle's minimal essential medium, glutamine, fetal calf serum, calf serum, G418, restriction endonucleases (REs),Taq DNA polymerase, T4 ligase, and TRIzol® were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine serum albumin was purchased from Intergen Co. (Purchase, NY). Cycloheximide, 8-bromo-cAMP, and isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were purchased from Sigma. T3 and T7 RNA polymerases, RNase inhibitor, RNase A, and RNase T1 were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. α-32P-labeled UTP (specific activity 800 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The vector pSVL was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and pBluescriptKS(−) and Escherichia coli AG-1 competent bacteria were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA (10Fort Ph Marty L. Piechaczyk M. El Sabrouty S. Dani Ch Jeanteur Ph Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Rodrigo Bravo (Bristol-Myers Squibb). Oligonucleotide primers used in PCR were synthesized by the University of Michigan Biomedical Research Core Facilities. The vector pSVL, which has an SV40 late promoter upstream and an SV40 polyadenylation signal downstream from the multicloning site (MCS), was used to drive expression of the DNA constructs used in these studies. Because the SV40 late promoter does not appear to be regulated by cyclic nucleotides, this vector allowed us to examine the effects of cA on message decay independent of transcriptional effects. All DNA vectors described below were amplified in E. coli AG-1 competent bacteria by established procedures (11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley Interscience, New York1989: 1.1.1-1.8.9Google Scholar). Mouse β-globin genomic DNA from position 233 to 1669 (numbering according to Konkel et al.) (12Konkel D.A. Maizel Jr., J.V. Leder P. Cell. 1979; 18: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR to include an XbaI site 5′ to bp 233 and a BglII site 3′ to bp 1669. This product was subcloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of the pSVL MCS to give pSVL βG (Fig. 1) (13Kathju S. Regulation of Tissue Type Plasminogen Activator Gene Expression by Glucocorticoids and Cyclic Nucleotides in Rat Hepatoma Cells. University of Michigan, Ann Arbor1994Google Scholar). The chimeric construct of rat PAI-1 and mouse β-globin diagrammed in Fig. 1 was prepared as follows. The 1200-bp coding portion of the mβ-globin gene was amplified by PCR to include an XbaI recognition sequence 5′ to bp 233 and the BglII recognition sequence 3′ to bp 1436. The 1730-bp 3′-UTR of PAI-1 was PCR-amplified to generate the sequence with the BglII recognition site 5′ to bp 1331 and the XbaI site 3′ to bp 3060. (Nucleotides are numbered from the start site of transcription (14Zeheb R. Gelehrter T.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).) These PCR products were digested with the appropriate REs and subcloned intoXbaI-digested pSVL in a one-step ligation to give the construct called pSVL G/P. The chimeric construct was verified by restriction analysis and partial DNA sequence analysis. The neomycin resistance (neo) gene under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pSVLβG and pSVL G/P as well as pSVL. Constructs having deletions in the 3′-UTR of PAI-1 (Fig. 3) were prepared from pSVL G/P using convenient RE sites; additional sites in the neo gene precluded preparing the deletions from the vector containing the neo gene. All deletion constructs diagrammed in Fig. 3 were prepared in a similar manner, using the indicated RE digestion to excise a portion of the sequence, incubation with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase to create blunt ends, followed by self-ligation using T4 DNA ligase. Because the pSVL vector carries recognition sites for NcoI, the construct G/PΔ AU3A was prepared from pBluescriptKS(−)G/P. In addition, because mβ-globin has an NcoI recognition site at position 307,BssHII and NcoI digestion of pBluescriptKS(−)G/P creates three fragments. The 4100-bp and 1500-bp fragments were gel-purified (leaving behind the 250-bp fragment to be deleted), incubated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase to make blunt ends, and ligated. The desired deletion and the orientation of the fragments were verified by RE analysis and partial DNA sequencing. In each case, the G/P sequence with the desired deletion was excised from pSVL or from pBluescriptKS(−)using XbaI and subcloned into the XbaI site in the MCS of pSVLneo and the identity of the new construct was confirmed by RE analysis and partial DNA sequencing. Constructs are designated by the regions of the PAI-1 sequence deleted as indicated in the diagram at the top of Fig. 3. We also generated constructs in which portions of sequence from the PAI-1 3′-UTR were inserted into mouse β-globin 3′-UTR as illustrated in Fig. 5. To provide a site for insertion of PAI-1 sequence, aBglII recognition site was constructed in the 3′-UTR of β-globin as follows. PCR was used to amplify the β-globin gene from bp 233 to bp 1470, including 5′ XhoI and 3′ BglII sites, and a portion of the β-globin 3′-UTR from bp 1471 to bp 1668, including 5′ BglII and 3′ XbaI recognition sites. The products were cloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites of pSVLneo in a one step ligation to produce pSVL G/G. Portions of the PAI-1 3′-UTR were amplified by PCR to includeBglII recognition sites on both the 3′ and 5′ ends. Each PCR product was inserted into the pSVL G/G construct by ligation at theBglII site. Presence of a single insert and orientation were confirmed by PCR and RE analysis. A PCR-amplified fragment of mβ-globin from bp 1256 to bp 1436 (which includes coding and intronic sequence) was subcloned into the PstI and BamHI sites of the pBluescriptKS(−) MCS. When linearized by digestion with HindIII (site in the pBluescriptKS(−)) and transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase, this plasmid generates an antisense riboprobe complementary to 119 nt of the mβ-globin coding region mRNA (Fig. 1). The 177-bp XbaI to AccI fragment of rat GAPDH cDNA (10Fort Ph Marty L. Piechaczyk M. El Sabrouty S. Dani Ch Jeanteur Ph Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the MCS of pBluescriptKS(−). This plasmid was digested withBstEII and transcribed using T3 RNA polymerase to generate an antisense riboprobe that protects an 80-nt fragment of GAPDH mRNA. Riboprobes were prepared by published methods (11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley Interscience, New York1989: 1.1.1-1.8.9Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA (approximately 500 ng) linearized with the appropriate RE was incubated with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase in transcription buffer (Boehringer Mannheim) containing RNase inhibitor, ATP, CTP, GTP, and [32P]UTP at 37 °C for 60 min. RNase-free DNase I was added, and, after 15 min at 37 °C, the reaction was extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1) and the RNA was precipitated in the presence of ammonium acetate and ethanol. The labeled RNA was purified by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel, eluted from the gel, and ethanol-precipitated. HTC cells were maintained in monolayer cultures as described previously (5Gelehrter T.D. Sznycer-Laszuk R. Zeheb R. Cwikel B.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In preparation for experiments, cells were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes and grown to confluence. Cultures were washed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without 0.1 mm cycloheximide. After 10–16 h, the medium was removed, the monolayers washed twice with PBS to remove cycloheximide, and fresh medium with or without cA was added. Cells were harvested at the times indicated for each experiment. For experiments in which the RNA from the transfected genes was to be analyzed, incubation with cycloheximide provides two major advantages. First, cycloheximide significantly enhances expression from the SV40 late promoter (5–50-fold), resulting in easier detection of transcript from the transfected gene (13Kathju S. Regulation of Tissue Type Plasminogen Activator Gene Expression by Glucocorticoids and Cyclic Nucleotides in Rat Hepatoma Cells. University of Michigan, Ann Arbor1994Google Scholar). Second, cycloheximide can be readily removed and its effects completely reversed by washing the monolayers with PBS and adding fresh medium (15Peterkofsky B. Tomkins G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 60: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Gelehrter T.D. Tomkins G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), resulting in a dramatic decrease in SV40 promoter activity. This protocol allowed us to measure mRNA degradation without using actinomycin D, which not only inhibits transcription but also blocks the cA effect on PAI-1 mRNA (7Heaton J.H. Kathju S. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cycloheximide is known to alter the decay rates of some transcripts (2Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the degradation rate of endogenous PAI-1 mRNA (determined using actinomycin D to block transcription) in cells from which cycloheximide has been removed after a 12-h incubation with the inhibitor, is nearly identical to that in cells not treated with cycloheximide. Furthermore, in cells transiently treated with cycloheximide, as in untreated cells, endogenous PAI-1 mRNA decay is accelerated after incubation of the cells with cA. HTC cells were transfected using the Ca2PO4 DNA precipitation technique, and stably transfected cells were selected in media containing 1 mg/ml G418 as described previously (17Kathju S. Heaton J.H. Bruzdzinski C.J. Gelehrter T.D. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Colonies of stably transfected cells were pooled to minimize the possible effects of different integration sites. Total cellular RNA was isolated either by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (7Heaton J.H. Kathju S. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) or by the TRIzol® reagent method as described by Life Technologies, Inc. Ribonuclease protection analysis was carried out essentially as described (11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley Interscience, New York1989: 1.1.1-1.8.9Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA (20–40 μg/sample) was precipitated and resuspended in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mm Pipes, pH 6.4, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 80% formamide) containing 1–5 × 105 cpm of32P-labeled riboprobe. After 5 min at 85 °C, the samples were placed at 50 °C for 16–20 h. RNase digestion buffer (350 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml RNase A, and 100 units/ml RNase T1) was added to each reaction. After 30 min at 30 °C, SDS (0.5% final concentration) and proteinase K (125 μg/ml) were added and incubation continued at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were then extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. The RNA pellets were washed with 80% ethanol, allowed to air-dry, and resuspended in an 80% formamide gel-loading buffer. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels and the gels were dried under vacuum. The amount of radioactivity in each protected fragment was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For each sample the signal in the specific band of interest was normalized to the signal in the 80-nt protected fragment of GAPDH. To determine the sequences in the PAI-1 mRNA involved in the cA regulation of message stability, we stably transfected HTC cells with DNA constructs carrying portions of the PAI-1 sequence and examined the degradation rates of the transcribed mRNAs. The pSVL vector was chosen because the SV40-late promoter, unlike some other viral promoters, does not appear to be regulated by 8-bromo-cAMP. 2J. H. Heaton and T. D. Gelehrter, unpublished observation. To confirm that the cA regulation can be faithfully reproduced in a transfection system, we first prepared a PAI-1 mini-gene using the SstI recognition site to delete 530 bp of the coding region, and subcloned it into the vector pSVLneo. The mRNA transcribed from the PAI mini-gene can be distinguished from the endogenous PAI-1 mRNA in ribonuclease protection analysis using a PAI-1 riboprobe that overlaps the deleted sequence. The half-life of the transcript from the PAI-1 mini-gene is 4.0 h and is decreased to 2.0 h in cells treated with cA (data not shown). These results are nearly identical to those observed for endogenous PAI-1 mRNA (7Heaton J.H. Kathju S. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and confirm that the cyclic nucleotide regulation of the transfected mini-gene faithfully reflects the regulation of the endogenous gene. These results also confirm that under these conditions cA regulation of message stability can be reproduced in cells that have been transiently treated with cycloheximide. To determine which regions of PAI-1 transcript are involved in the cA regulation, we prepared chimeric genes of rat PAI-1 and mouse β-globin. The β-globin transcript is normally very stable, and its decay is not regulated by cyclic nucleotides. As a first step, we compared degradation rates of transcripts from the β-globin gene and a chimeric gene containing globin coding region and the full 3′-UTR of PAI-1 using the constructs illustrated in Fig.1. As shown in Fig.2, transcripts from the stably transfected pSVL βG or pSVL G/P gene can be readily detected in ribonuclease protection analysis using the 5′G riboprobe. Because there is no endogenous globin, only the protected 119-nt fragment representing the β-globin coding region and the 80-nt fragment from the GAPDH control are seen. The 119-nt fragment is not present in the RNA from non-transfected cells (data not shown). Quantitative analysis of this experiment is shown in Fig. 2(C and D). As expected, the β-globin transcript has a long half-life that is not regulated by cA. In this experiment, the half-life of the transcript from the G/P construct is 8.5 h. Although not as short as PAI-1, this half-life is much shorter than that of β-globin and is decreased to 3.5 h when cells are incubated with cA, a 2.4-fold cA-induced increase in decay rate. This is nearly identical to the cA effect on the PAI-1 mini-gene mRNA. These results confirm that cA regulation can be reproduced in the transfection system and demonstrate that the 3′-UTR of PAI-1 mRNA can confer this regulation onto the β-globin transcript. Determinants of mRNA stability have been described in the coding regions of some transcripts (19Caponigro G. Muhlrad D. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5141-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20Schiavi S.C. Wellington C.L. Shyu A.-B. Chen C.-Y.A. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. J. Biol.

However, because it is clear from our results that the 3′-UTR of PAI-1 mRNA is sufficient to confer both an increase in degradation rate and cyclic nucleotide responsiveness on a heterologous message, we focused our studies on this region. In an effort to locate the region within the PAI-1 3′-UTR responsible for cyclic nucleotide responsiveness, we used convenient restriction endonuclease sites to delete selected portions of the PAI-1 cDNA in the context of the G/P construct. The 3′-UTR of PAI-1 mRNA has several sequences of potential interest (14Zeheb R. Gelehrter T.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) illustrated in the top portion of Fig.3. AU-rich elements (AREs) that include AUUUA motifs flanked with U-rich stretches have been implicated in the instability of mRNAs of cytokines and oncogenes (3Chen C.-Y. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). The PAI-1 3′-UTR has three AUUUA motifs (ATTTA in the cDNA), two in close proximity at nt 2053 and 2117, and a third farther downstream at position 2728, close to the two 70-nt U-rich stretches (T-rich in the cDNA) (nt 2821–3023). PAI-1 has a highly conserved region in its 3′-UTR; the 127-nt sequence in rat PAI-1 from nt 2506 to nt 2632 is 80% identical in mink, murine, bovine, porcine, and human PAI-1 and shares 85–97% identity when compared pairwise with each of these species (14Zeheb R.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Finally, PAI-1 has an unusual stretch of 39 GpA dinucleotides between nt 2363 and 2442. The location of these regions within the 3′-UTR, the RE sites that flank them and the designations given them are shown in the top of Fig. 3. Regions “A” and “C” are so named for lack of putative regulatory sequences. Deletion constructs of pSVL G/P were made by restriction enzyme digestion and blunt end ligation as described under “Experimental Procedures” and shown in Fig. 3. HTC cells were stably transfected with each deletion construct, incubated with or without cA, and analyzed by ribonuclease protection analysis using the β-globin riboprobe as described above. Fig. 3 summarizes the results from experiments with all of the deletion constructs tested, and Fig.4 shows examples of data from representative individual experiments with three of these deletion constructs. The full-length β-globin message decays slowly and shows no cA regulation, whereas the transcript from the G/P construct, which has the PAI-1 3′-UTR, is more labile and its degradation is accelerated in cA-treated cells. Interestingly, all of the deletion constructs tested exhibit some degree of cyclic nucleotide regulation, suggesting that two, or possibly more, regions in the 3′-UTR can confer cA regulation. Of particular interest is the construct G/PΔ 1600 (Δ1331–2926) (Figs. 3 and 4 B) that retains only the 3′-most 134 nt of the PAI-1 3′-UTR. The half-life of this transcript was decreased 2.3-fold in cyclic nucleotide-treated cells, demonstrating that the 3′-most 134-nt sequence of PAI-1 is sufficient to confer cA responsiveness. However, the construct G/PΔ U II (Δ2923–3060), in which only this sequence is deleted, also displays a 2-fold increase in the rate of degradation in the presence of cA, consistent with the presence of another upstream regulatory region (Figs. 3 and 4 A). Examination of the other deletion constructs, such as the G/PΔ U I (Δ2718–2926) (Fig.4 C), failed to locate the upstream element because they all contain the 3′-most 134-nt element, which by itself is sufficient to mediate cyclic nucleotide responsiveness. The deletion construct G/PΔ U I + U II also retains cA regulation, suggesting that the other functional element is located upstream from bp 2714. To more clearly define thecis-acting regions involved in the cA regulation, we prepared constructs in which selected portions of the PAI-1 3′-UTR sequence were inserted into the 3′-UTR of the β-globin gene (Fig.5). These constructs were then stably transfected into HTC cells and experiments performed as described above for the deletion constructs. Results from experiments with four of these constructs are shown in Fig. 6. The mRNA transcribed from pSVL G/G, like the β-globin transcript, is stable and not regulated by cyclic nucleotides (Fig. 6 A). However, when the 3′-most 130 nt of PAI-1 sequence (lacking the final 6 A nucleotides; see Fig. 8) was inserted into the globin 3′-UTR (pSVL G/G + U II), the resultant construct was"

However, difficulty in identifying non-peptide molecules which possess intrinsic activity has been a major obstacle in achieving this goal. At present, most of the known non-peptide ligands for peptide hormone receptors appear in standard functional assays to be antagonists. Here, we report that a constitutively active mutant of the human cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor, Leu325 → Glu, offers the potential to detect even trace agonist activity of ligands which, at the wild type receptor isoform, appear to lack efficacy. The enhanced functional sensitivity of the mutant receptor enabled us to detect intrinsic activity of L-365,260, an established non-peptide antagonist for the cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor. Extending from this observation, we were able to demonstrate that minor structural modifications could convert L-365,260 into either: (i) an agonist or (ii) an inverse agonist (attenuates ligand-independent signaling). The ability to confer functional activity to small non-peptide ligands suggests that the properties of endogenous peptide hormones can be mimicked, and even extended, by considerably less complex molecules.

The ability to confer functional activity to small non-peptide ligands suggests that the properties of endogenous peptide hormones can be mimicked, and even extended, by considerably less complex molecules. Current understanding of G-protein-coupled receptor activation has in large part been based on the study of biogenic amine receptors (1Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). The corresponding endogenous ligands, together with synthetic derivatives of these small molecules, cover a spectrum of functional activities ranging from full agonists to antagonists. With the discovery of constitutively active receptor mutants, this range has been further extended to include inverse agonists, distinguished by their ability to attenuate ligand-independent signaling (2Leff P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Another major group of G-protein-coupled receptors is activated by endogenous peptide molecules. Compared with biogenic amines, these peptide agonists are significantly larger and structurally more complex. Since endogenous peptides exert important hormone and neurotransmitter functions, there is considerable interest in whether their function can be mimicked by non-peptide drugs (3Schwartz T.W. Gether U. Schambye H.T. Hjorth S.A. Curr. Pharmaceut. Design. 1995; 1: 325-342Google Scholar). This possibility is suggested by the opioid receptor system. Naturally occurring opioid receptor non-peptide agonists (e.g.morphine) as well as synthetic derivatives have been utilized since the early 19th century (4Reisine T. Pasternak G. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Gilman A.G. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 9th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 521-555Google Scholar). Over the last 10 years, numerous non-peptide compounds have been identified which recognize specific peptide hormone receptor subtypes with high affinity. Unlike the corresponding endogenous peptide agonists, the vast majority of these new ligands appear to lack intrinsic activity and have been pharmacologically classified as antagonists (5Alexander S.P.H. Peters J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 3-75PubMed Google Scholar). The difficulty in generating non-peptide agonists is exemplified by the extensive efforts which have focused on the identification of ligands for the human cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor (CCK-BR). 1The abbreviations used are: CCK-BR, cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor; G-17, gastrin heptadecapeptide (unsulfated form); CCK-8, cholecystokinin octapeptide (sulfated form); CCK-8US, cholecystokinin octapeptide (unsulfated form). 1The abbreviations used are: CCK-BR, cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor; G-17, gastrin heptadecapeptide (unsulfated form); CCK-8, cholecystokinin octapeptide (sulfated form); CCK-8US, cholecystokinin octapeptide (unsulfated form). This receptor has been implicated in modulating memory, anxiety, and pain perception, as well as in regulating gastrointestinal mucosal growth and secretion (6Crawley J.N. Corwin R.L. Peptides. 1994; 15: 731-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 7Walsh J.H. Walsh J.H. Dockray G.J. Gastrin. Raven Press, New York1994: 75-121Google Scholar, 8Wank S.A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1995; 269: G628-G646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of some peptide-derived compounds (9Schmassmann A. Garner A. Flogerzi B. Hasan M.Y. Sanner M. Varga L. Halter F. Gut. 1994; 35: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Ding X.Q. Chen D. Håkanson R. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1181-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), all of the synthetic CCK-BR non-peptide ligands which have been discovered to date are reported to be antagonists and thus appear unable to satisfy the structural requirements for receptor activation. The prototype of such non-peptide, selective CCK-BR antagonists is L-365,260, a benzodiazepine-based ligand which was discovered in 1989 (11Lotti V.J. Chang R.S.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 162: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Widely tested both in vivo and in vitro, this compound has become a cornerstone in the characterization and pharmacological classification of CCK receptors. We now report that L-365,260 has unexpected residual intrinsic activity, which we were able to detect using a constitutively active CCK-BR mutant. Extending from this finding, we demonstrate that slight structural modifications of L-365,260 convert this ligand into either: (i) a non-peptide agonist for the wild type CCK-BR, or (ii) an inverse agonist. These findings illustrate that existing non-peptide ligands may have considerably higher potential to activate peptide hormone receptors than was previously appreciated, and suggest that constitutively active receptor mutants provide promising tools to detect and optimize such functional properties.

(Gaithersburg, MD) and from Intergen (Purchase, NY), respectively. 125I-CCK-8 (2,200 Ci/mmol) and myo-[3H]inositol (45–80 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA). Unlabeled gastrin heptadecapeptide (G-17, unsulfated form), CCK-8 (sulfated form), CCK-8US (unsulfated form), and CCK-4 were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). L-365,260, L-740,093 (R and S forms), YM022, and L-364,718 were generously provided by Wyeth Research Ltd. (Taplow, United Kingdom). The “peptoid” compounds PD-135,158 and PD-136,450 were a gift from Parke-Davis Research Center (Cambridge, UK). COS-7 cells (1 × 106) were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C. The cells were transfected with 5 μg of wild type or mutant CCK-BR cDNA (12Lee Y.-M. Beinborn M. McBride E.W. Lu M. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Kopin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8164-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), subcloned into the expression vector pcDNAI (Invitrogen). The following day, cells were split into 6-well plates (3 × 105/well) (Nunc). The cells were then prelabeled overnight with 3 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. To assess ligand-induced inositol phosphate production, the medium was replaced with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm LiCl, and cells were incubated with the respective ligands for 30 min at 37 °C. Each ligand was tested at a concentration which was at least 25-fold higher than the corresponding dissociation constant (K i value) determined in radioligand binding experiments (see below, Table I). According to the simple Langmuir isotherm (fractional receptor occupancy = ligand concentration/[Ligand concentration +K i]) the ligand concentrations which were utilized result in >95% receptor occupancy (13Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Hulme E.C. Receptor-Ligand Interactions. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 63-176Google Scholar), and will thus induce near maximal receptor stimulation and inositol phosphate production. After incubation, cells were lysed and extracted with methanol/chloroform; the upper phase was analyzed for inositol phosphates by strong anion exchange chromatography (14Seidler U. Pfeiffer A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1991; 260: G133-G141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inositol phosphate production was expressed as a percentage of the total cellular tritium content which was incorporated during an overnight exposure tomyo-[3H]inositol. Concentration-response curves were calculated using the GraphPad Prizm software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).Table IBinding affinities of peptide, peptoid, and non-peptide ligands at the wild type and the constitutively active CCK-BRWild type receptor, K iLeu325 → Glu mutant,K inMPeptidesGastrin-171.35 ± 0.280.78 ± 0.16CCK-80.12 ± 0.010.07 ± 0.01CCK-8US2.20 ± 0.781.16 ± 0.51CCK-411.6 ± 4.07.97 ± 2.08PeptoidsPD-135,1582.25 ± 0.611.01 ± 0.19PD-136,4500.99 ± 0.100.59 ± 0.12Non-peptidesL-740,093 (R)0.19 ± 0.020.18 ± 0.04YM022 (R)0.07 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.01L-364,718 (S)150 ± 42170 ± 34L-365,260 (R)7.2 ± 0.97.8 ± 1.5L-740,093 (S)19.5 ± 1.516 ± 1.4K i values were averaged from three to five independent experiments (mean ± S.E.).

Twenty-four hours after transfection, COS-7 cells were seeded into 24-well dishes (1 × 104/well) (Costar). After an additional 24 h, competition binding experiments were performed in Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.15 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, using 20 pm125I-CCK-8 as the radioligand. After an 80-min incubation in the absence or presence of unlabeled ligands, cell monolayers were washed three times with Hank's balanced salt solution and then hydrolyzed in 1 n NaOH for γ-counting (15Beinborn M. Lee Y.-M. McBride E.W. Quinn S.M. Kopin A.S. Nature. 1993; 362: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). All binding affinities were calculated by nonlinear curve fitting using the LIGAND computer program (16McPherson G.A. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1985; 14: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Receptor densities in transfected COS-7 cells were calculated from125I-CCK-8 binding experiments with increasing concentrations of unlabeled CCK-8 as the homologous competitor. Molecular characterization of the third intracellular loop of the human CCK-BR led to the identification of a point mutation (Leu325 → Glu) which results in constitutive receptor activity (17Beinborn M. Wu M.-J. Quinn S.M. Goeke E.-K. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Kopin A.S. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110A1059Google Scholar). When transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, the Leu325 → Glu mutant triggers agonist independent production of inositol phosphates, to levels exceeding cells expressing the wild type receptor at similar densities (Fig.1 A). Despite this difference in ligand-independent signaling, the wild type and the mutant receptors increase inositol phosphate production to comparable levels when stimulated with saturating concentrations of either CCK-8 or G-17, two of the principal endogenous agonists for the CCK-BR (6Crawley J.N. Corwin R.L. Peptides. 1994; 15: 731-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 7Walsh J.H. Walsh J.H. Dockray G.J. Gastrin. Raven Press, New York1994: 75-121Google Scholar, 18Liddle R.A. Walsh J.H. Dockray G.J. Cholecystokinin. Raven Press, New York1994: 175-216Google Scholar). In addition, both CCK-8 and G-17 have similar potencies and binding affinities when respective values at the wild type and the mutant receptor isoforms are compared (Fig. 1 B, TableI). Contrary to expectation, we found that the non-peptide ligand, L-365,260, has significant partial agonist activity when stimulating the mutant (versus the wild type) receptor (Fig.2 A). L-365,260, previously considered a prototype CCK-BR antagonist (5Alexander S.P.H. Peters J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 3-75PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lotti V.J. Chang R.S.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 162: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), is able to activate the Leu325 → Glu receptor mutant with approximately half the efficacy of the full agonist, G-17. On closer examination, it became apparent that L-365,260 also induces a small yet significant (p < 0.01) increase of inositol phosphate production in cells expressing the wild type CCK-BR (Fig. 2 A, left panel). These findings prompted us to investigate the functional properties of compounds which are structurally related to L-365,260, including YM022 (19Nishida A. Miyata K. Tsutsumi R. Yuki H. Akuzawa S. Kobayashi A. Kamato T. Ito H. Yamano M. Katuyama Y. Satoh M. Ohta M. Honda K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 725-731PubMed Google Scholar) and (R)-L-740,093, as well as its stereoisomer, (S)-L-740,093 (20Showell G.A. Bourrain S. Neduvelil J.G. Fletcher S.R. Baker R. Watt A.P. Fletcher A.E. Freedman S.B. Kemp J.A. Marshall G.R. Patel S. Smith A.J. Matassa V.G. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All of these molecules share a 1,4-benzodiazepine backbone (Fig. 2 B), and are reported to function as antagonists. However, when assessed with the constitutively active receptor mutant (Fig. 2 A), it became readily apparent that these compounds cover a broad range of intrinsic activities. The amplification of second messenger signaling observed with the Leu325 → Glu receptor allowed us to demonstrate that minor structural changes of L-365,260 result in considerable functional alterations. Replacing the C5-phenyl moiety of the core benzodiazepine structure with an azabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane substituent, combined with changing the C3 stereochemistry, converts L-365,260 into (S)-L-740,093 (20Showell G.A. Bourrain S. Neduvelil J.G. Fletcher S.R. Baker R. Watt A.P. Fletcher A.E. Freedman S.B. Kemp J.A. Marshall G.R. Patel S. Smith A.J. Matassa V.G. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the most efficacious agonist of the tested ligands. Reflecting its relatively strong signaling potential, (S)-L-740,093 also functions as a partial agonist at the wild type CCK-BR (Fig. 2 A). Further confirming the agonist activity of (S)-L-740,093, stimulation of the wild type CCK-BR with this compound triggers a concentration-dependent increase in second messenger signaling (Fig. 3). Therefore, (S)-L-740,093 provides the first example of a “true” non-peptide agonist for the human CCK-BR. It is noteworthy that the mirror image (R-enantiomer) of the non-peptide agonist (S)-L-740,093 has the opposite functional properties. (R)-L-740,093 reduces basal signaling of the constitutively active receptor close to that of the wild type isoform (Fig. 2 A) and thereby satisfies the criterion of an inverse agonist. Non-peptide inverse agonists have recently been identified for two other types of peptide receptors, i.e.the thyrotropin-releasing hormone and the AT1A angiotensin II receptors (21Heinflink M. Nussenzveig D.R. Grimberg H. Lupu-Meiri M. Oron Y. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1455-1460PubMed Google Scholar, 22Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.-C. Marie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1822-1826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Like (R)-L-740,093, each of these non-peptide inverse agonists appears to have no intrinsic activity at the respective wild type receptors and was therefore originally classified as an antagonist. Together, these examples illustrate that inverse agonism is likely a hidden property of many ligands which are currently considered “antagonists.” To enable more definitive classification of these compounds, further functional characterization using constitutively active receptors will be required. The discovery of non-peptide inverse agonists provides a compelling rationale for developing a new class of drugs, targeted at constitutively active peptide hormone receptors which result in human disease (23Milligan G. Bond R.A. Lee M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 10-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 24Spiegel A.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2434-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For example, the pathogenesis of thyroid adenomas has been linked to constitutively active thyroid stimulating hormone receptors (25Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Gervy C. Mockel J. Dumont J. Vassart G. Nature. 1993; 365: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar); drugs which “silence” these overactive proteins could potentially be utilized to inhibit tumor growth. Similarly, inverse agonists could delay the onset of precocious puberty in patients with constitutively active luteinizing hormone receptors (26Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The concentration-dependent activity of (S,R)-L-740,093 at the wild type and mutant CCK-BRs supports the pharmacological classification of these compounds as agonist and inverse agonist, respectively (Figs. 3 and4 A). It is intriguing that altering the steric conformation of these compounds can interconvert their function. An observation which parallels our findings with the L-740,093 enantiomers was recently reported for synthetic derivatives of the carboxyl-terminal cholecystokinin tetrapeptide fragment, CCK-4. Two of these peptoid ligands, PD-149,164 and PD-151,932, which are distinguished only by their steric conformation, were found to act as agonist and antagonist, respectively, at the CCK-A receptor subtype (27Hughes J. Dockray G.J. Hill D. Garcia L. Pritchard M.C. Forster E. Toescu E. Woodruff G. Horwell D.C. Regul. Pept. 1996; 65: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It remains to be established whether stereoisomers of ligands for other peptide hormone receptors will also have opposite functional properties. Unlike the L-740,093 enantiomers, YM022 has minimal effect on the basal activity of either the wild type or the mutant CCK-B/gastrin receptors (Fig. 2 A). This lack of intrinsic activity, and the ability of YM022 to block CCK-8 induced inositol phosphate formation (17Beinborn M. Wu M.-J. Quinn S.M. Goeke E.-K. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Kopin A.S. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110A1059Google Scholar), are consistent with the expected properties of an antagonist. To further validate the functional classification of the CCK-BR non-peptide ligands, the interaction of YM022 with S- andR-740,093 was studied. (S)-L-740,093 induced inositol phosphate production was inhibited by YM022 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4 B, top), further supporting that (S)-L-740,093 functions as a non-peptide agonist. In addition, YM022 was able to attenuate the inhibitory effect of (R)-L-740,093 on the constitutively active CCK-BR mutant (Fig. 4 B, bottom). This observation is in agreement with the principle that the activity of inverse agonists should also be sensitive to inhibition by antagonists (2Leff P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To determine whether the enhanced signaling observed with the Leu325 → Glu mutant applied to a structurally different class of molecules, we compared activation of the wild type and the mutant CCK-BRs by two peptoid ligands, PD-135,158 and PD-136,450. Both of these compounds have in previous in vivo studies been shown to be partial CCK-BR agonists (9Schmassmann A. Garner A. Flogerzi B. Hasan M.Y. Sanner M. Varga L. Halter F. Gut. 1994; 35: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Ding X.Q. Chen D. Håkanson R. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1181-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Using recombinant human CCK-BRs expressed in COS-7 cells we confirmed the agonist properties of PD-135,158 and PD-136,450 in vitro, and in addition demonstrated that these peptoids are almost full agonists at the constitutively active mutant (Fig.5). Despite significant structural differences between tested compounds, respective efficacy values at the wild type CCK-BR are systematically amplified at the Leu325 → Glu mutant. The correlation of ligand efficacies at both receptor isoforms is illustrated by thedashed line in Fig. 5. This systematic amplification contrasts with several reports of mutant receptors where observed efficacy changes were clearly ligand-specific. For the β-adrenergic, δ-opoid, and CCK-B receptors, mutations have been identified which only result in the amplification of ligand efficacies for selected compounds. In contrast, the efficacies of other, structurally different ligands remain unchanged or are even reduced when examined with these mutant receptors (28Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Dixon R.A.F. Sigal I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16470-16477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Claude P.A. Wotta D.R. Zhang X.H. Prather P.L. McGinn T.M. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 30Bläker M. Gordon M.C. Hsu J.E. Beinborn M. Kopin A.S. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112A1133Google Scholar). It is of note that all of the mutations which differentially affect the function of individual ligands correspond to amino acid substitutions within the transmembrane domains of the receptor, close to the extracellular surface, whereas the Leu325 → Glu mutation of the CCK-BR is found in the third intracellular loop. Whether mutations induce a ligand-specific or a generalized amplification of ligand efficacies may depend on the location of these mutations within the receptor molecule. We have previously demonstrated that CCK-BR transmembrane domain mutations differentially modulate the interaction of individual compounds with the putative transmembrane domain “ligand binding pocket” (31Kopin A.S. McBride E.W. Quinn S.M. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Beinborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5019-5023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, we hypothesize that intracellular mutations can globally affect receptor isomerization by altering the equilibrium between “inactive” and “active” states (2Leff P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Our observations can in part be explained by an extended ternary complex model of receptor activation which has been proposed based on study of a constitutively active β2-adrenergic receptor (32Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, we noted that the efficacies of partial CCK-BR agonists were systematically enhanced when comparing respective values at the wild type receptor and the Leu325→ Glu mutant (Fig. 5). The extended ternary complex model of receptor activation further postulates that with constitutive receptor activity, the binding affinities of ligands should increase commensurate with their signaling efficacies, i.e. the largest affinity shifts are expected for full agonists. This prediction is supported by the observation that agonist affinities at constitutively active biogenic amine receptors were increased by up to 100-fold when compared with respective wild type values (33Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Brauner-Osborne H. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7405-7410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When comparing the binding of different ligands to the wild type CCK-BR and to the Leu325→ Glu mutant, we observed only minor (≤2-fold) affinity increases (Table I) despite the marked alterations in efficacy (Fig. 5). Although it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions based on the extremely small affinity changes at the CCK-BR, the observed shifts roughly correlate with the efficacies of tested ligands as would be expected based on previous studies with biogenic amine receptors. Enhanced signaling potencies of agonists have been proposed as another general property of constitutively active (versus wild type) receptors (38Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated by detailed pharmacological characterization of a constitutively active muscarinic receptor that the degree of potency increase for individual ligands correlates with respective agonist efficacies (34Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Brauner-Osborne H. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 1274-1279PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the expectation of increased agonist potencies, our data reveal that (S)-L-740,093 is slightly more potent at the constitutively active CCK-BR (EC50 of inositol phosphate formation = 0.7 nm; see Fig. 4 A) than at the wild type receptor (EC50 = 2.5 nm; see Fig. 3). However, we were unable to detect any potency shifts for the peptide ligands CCK-8 and gastrin (see Fig. 1 B), despite the fact that both of these full agonists have considerably higher efficacy than the partial agonist, (S)-L-740,093. The latter findings suggest limitations of the extended ternary model of receptor activation in predicting how constitutive receptor activity affects agonist potency for a given ligand. Consistent with our observations, it has been previously noted for other constitutively active mutants that the potencies of peptide agonists show little or no changesversus corresponding values at the respective wild type receptor isoforms (22Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.-C. Marie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1822-1826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Yano K. Saji M. Hidaka A.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 725-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the extended ternary complex model of receptor activation is most applicable to small ligands (e.g. (R)-L-740,093 and biogenic amines), whereas larger ligands (e.g. peptides) may interact with the receptor in a less predictable fashion. The apparent lack of generalizable rules regarding potency shifts at constitutively active receptors can be best explained by the “cubic ternary complex” model of receptor activation (42Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 413-463PubMed Google Scholar). This recently proposed model refines earlier theories by considering additional receptor- and ligand-specific variables and multiple receptor states which may be involved in agonist-mediated receptor activation. The model acknowledges that several of these factors may be altered by receptor mutations which confer constitutive activity, and implies that these changes will not necessarily result in potency increases. In addition to revealing both consistencies with and limitations of existing models of receptor activation, our observations extend current knowledge regarding the versatility of benzodiazepine-based molecules as potent and selective ligands for a wide range of different receptors (43Hogan Jr., J.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 17-19PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the precedent provided, it appears likely that such molecules are preferred structures not only for the development of specific antagonists, but may also provide promising templates for novel receptor agonists. Consistent with this generalization, it has been recently reported that certain benzodiazepine derivatives can act as mixed CCK-A receptor agonists/CCK-BR antagonists (44Hirst G.C. Aquino C. Birkemo L. Croom D.K. Dezube M. Dougherty Jr., R.W. Ervin G.N. Grizzle M.K. Henke B. James M.K. Johnson M.F. Momtahen T. Queen K.L. Sherrill R.G. Szewczyk J. Willson T.M. Sugg E.E. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 5236-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, although structural similarities exist between these 1,5-benzodiazepine-derived CCK-A receptor agonists and 1,4-benzodiazepine-based CCK-BR ligands (tested in the present study), the two groups of compounds are clearly distinguished by the configuration of their respective benzodiazepine cores and by the different composition of attached substituents. As a common theme, the respective substituents appear to play a key role in determining the level of ligand intrinsic activity both at the CCK-A and the CCK-B/gastrin receptors. At present, there are only a few other examples of non-peptide agonists which can mimic the function of endogenous peptide hormones (45Perlman S. Schambye H.T. Rivero R.A. Greenlee W.J. Hjorth S.A.

Constitutively active receptors, as exemplified by the Leu325 → Glu mutant, hold promise as sensitive probes for the systematic screening of non-peptide ligands for intrinsic activity since these receptors lead to a systematic efficacy increase, regardless of ligand structure (see above). As an important advantage in the search for agonist potential, the proposed strategy may be applicable independent of the chemical structure of non-peptide ligands, and could therefore be utilized to re-assess a large variety of already known non-peptide ligands which have been classified as antagonists for different peptide hormone receptors. Once identified, lead agonist mimetics can then be stucturally modified as necessary, to optimize receptor specificity, oral bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic properties. This approach should accelerate the identification and development of new drugs, applicable for the treatment of a broad spectrum of diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1481724108,"The ATP-regulated potassium (K ATP) channel plays an essential role in the control of insulin release from the pancreatic β-cell. In the present study we have used the patch-clamp technique to study the direct effects of α-ketoisocaproate on the K ATPchannel in isolated patches and intact pancreatic β-cells. In excised inside-out patches, the activity of the K ATPchannel was dose-dependently inhibited by α-ketoisocaproate, half-maximal concentration being approximately 8 mm. The blocking effect of α-ketoisocaproate was fully reversible. Stimulation of channel activity by the addition of ATP/ADP (ratio 1) did not counteract the inhibitory effect of α-ketoisocaproate. In the presence of the metabolic inhibitor sodium azide, α-ketoisocaproate was still able to inhibit single channel activity in excised patches and to block whole cell K ATP currents in intact cells. No effect of α-ketoisocaproate could be obtained on either the large or the small conductance Ca2+-regulated K+ channel. Enzymatic treatment of the patches with trypsin prevented the inhibitory effect of α-ketoisocaproate. Based on these observations, it is unlikely that the blocking effect of α-ketoisocaproate is due to an unspecific effect on K+ channel pores. Leucine, the precursor of α-ketoisocaproate, did not affectK ATP channel activity in excised patches. Our findings are compatible with the view that α-ketoisocaproate not only affects the β-cell stimulus secretion coupling by generation of ATP but also by direct inhibition of the K ATPchannel. The ATP-regulated potassium (K ATP) channel plays an essential role in the control of insulin release from the pancreatic β-cell.

No effect of α-ketoisocaproate could be obtained on either the large or the small conductance Ca2+-regulated K+ channel. Enzymatic treatment of the patches with trypsin prevented the inhibitory effect of α-ketoisocaproate. Based on these observations, it is unlikely that the blocking effect of α-ketoisocaproate is due to an unspecific effect on K+ channel pores. Leucine, the precursor of α-ketoisocaproate, did not affectK ATP channel activity in excised patches. Our findings are compatible with the view that α-ketoisocaproate not only affects the β-cell stimulus secretion coupling by generation of ATP but also by direct inhibition of the K ATPchannel. An increase in plasma glucose concentration is the major physiological stimulus for insulin release from the pancreatic β-cell. Glucose metabolism leads to membrane depolarization and initiation of a characteristic pattern in electrical activity concomitant with fluctuations in cytosolic-free Ca2+-concentration (1Berggren P.O. Larsson O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Depolarization results from an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio, thereby inducing a closure of the ATP-dependent K+ (K ATP) channel (2Cook D.L. Hales C.N. Nature. 1984; 311: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). 1The abbreviations used are:K ATP, ATP-regulated K+ channel; α-ketoisocaproate, 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate; nS, nanosiemens;N.S., not significant. An increase in mitochondrial metabolism plays an important role in the response to glucose and several other fuel secretagogues. Among other fuel secretagogues, the deamination product of the amino acidl-leucine, α-ketoisocaproate, is of particular interest since it is exclusively metabolized in mitochondria (3Panten U. Christians J. Kriegstein E. von Poser W. Hasselblatt A. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Hutton J.C. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Atwater I. Kawazu S. Boschero A.C. Somers G. Devis G. Malaisse W.J. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Accordingly, several studies have shown that α-ketoisocaproate stimulates insulin secretion (3Panten U. Christians J. Kriegstein E. von Poser W. Hasselblatt A. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Hutton J.C. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Atwater I. Kawazu S. Boschero A.C. Somers G. Devis G. Malaisse W.J. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), initiates electrical activity (5Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: E245-E252PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibits the β-cell K ATP channel in intact cells monitored in the cell-attached configuration of the patch-clamp technique (6Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J. Harrison D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 385: 517-529Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Eddlestone G.T. Ribalet B. Ciani S. J. Membr.

The fact that metabolism of α-ketoisocaproate is confined to the mitochondria indicates that a product in Krebs cycle is involved in modulation of channel activity. The most likely candidate is ATP, which has been shown to be elevated after exposure of β-cells to α-ketoisocaproate (4Hutton J.C. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Atwater I. Kawazu S. Boschero A.C. Somers G. Devis G. Malaisse W.J. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J. Harrison D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 385: 517-529Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present study we have further investigated the effects of α-ketoisocaproate on theK ATP channel and demonstrate that the substance directly inhibits the β-cell K ATP channel. Adult obese mice (gene ob/ob) of both sexes were obtained from a local colony (9Hellman B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1965; 131: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The mice were starved for 24 h and then killed by decapitation. Pancreatic islets were isolated by a collagenase technique (10Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar), and a cell suspension was prepared and washed essentially as described previously (11Lernmark A. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Flow Laboratories, Scotland, UK) containing 11 mm glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 60 μg/ml gentamycin. Collagenase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The cell suspension was seeded into Petri dishes (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1–3 days. The bath solution (i.e. the “intracellular” solution) consisted of 125 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 30 mm KOH, and 5 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.15) unless otherwise indicated. In the experiments using the inside-out configuration, the pipettes were filled with standard extracellular solution containing 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.6 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.40). In the perforated patch experiments, the pipette solution contained 10 mm KCl, 76 mm K2SO4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm NaOH (pH 7.15), and 200 μg of amphotericin B/ml (dissolved in Me2SO). The final concentration of Me2SO was less than 0.1%. ATP and ADP (both supplied by Sigma) were added to the intracellular solution as indicated. When nucleotides were added as their Na+ salt (ADP), Mg2+ was added to maintain an excess of Mg2+. α-Ketoisocaproate-Na+ salt was obtained from two different suppliers (Sigma and Fluka Chemie AG, Neu-Ulm, Switzerland), and 2-oxopentanoate was obtained from Aldrich. Trypsin-EDTA was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. K ATP channel activity and membrane potential were recorded using the patch-clamp technique (12Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfuegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar). Pipettes were coated with Sylgard resin (Dow Corning, Kanagawa, Japan) near their tips to reduce capacitance transients and, finally, were fire-polished. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200 patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Experiments were stored on magnetic tape using a video cassette recorder (JVC, Tokyo, Japan) and a digital data recorder (VR-10B, Instrutech Corp., Elmont, NY). The recorded signal was stored with an upper cut-off frequency of 2 kHz. Patches were excised into a nucleotide-free solution, and 0.1 mm ATP was first added to test for channel inhibition. With the solutions used, ion currents were outward, and channel records were displayed according to the convention; upward deflections denote outward currents. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–24 °C), and channel activity was measured at 0 mV unless otherwise indicated. Whole cellK ATP currents and β-cell membrane potential were recorded using the perforated patch configuration of the patch-clamp technique. For analysis of single channel kinetics, records were low-pass filtered at 0.2 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) digitized at 0.8 kHz using a TL-1 DMA interface (Axon Instruments) and stored in a computer. Open time kinetics were determined using in-house software by digitizing segments of the current records (∼60-s long) and forming histograms of base-line and open-level data points. Analysis of the distribution of K ATPchannel open times was restricted to segments containing no more than three active channels. Events were identified using a 50% amplitude criterion. The kinetic constants were derived by approximation of the data to exponential functions by the method of maximum likelihood (13Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-Channel Recording. Plenum Press Corp., New York1983: 191-263Crossref Google Scholar). Channel activity (NPO) was calculated as the mean current (I X) divided by the single channel current amplitude. The mean current (I X) was calculated according to Equation 1. IX=∑j=1N (ii−iB)NEquation 1 where N is the number of samples,i j is the current observed in sample j, andi B is the value of a user-defined base line. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was analyzed using paired or unpaired Student's t tests. In the intact β-cell, the activity of theK ATP channel is the main regulator of resting membrane potential, and the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio is considered to constitute the primary determinator of channel activity (14Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is obvious that substances that are capable of modulating channel activity may also influence resting membrane potential. Fig.1 A shows a typical trace exposing an excised patch to 20 mm α-ketoisocaproate. When exposing patches to 20 mm α-ketoisocaproate, channel activity (NP O) decreased to 31 ± 5% (n = 6; p < 0.001) compared with what was found before the addition of the substance. In Fig. 1 B, we exposed isolated patches to an ATP/ADP ratio of 1, which efficiently stimulates K ATP channel activity (15Hopkins W.F. Fatherazi S. Peter-Riesch B. Corkey B.E. Cook D.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 129: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of the nucleotides, mean current increased with 247 ± 74% (n = 3) and induced a typical kinetic pattern with openings of long duration (16Larsson O. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Fredholm B. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 463: 349-365Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The addition of α-ketoisocaproate (20 mm) to the patch in the continued presence of nucleotides reduced channel activity to 26 ± 7% (n = 4;p < 0.05). These data clearly show that theK ATP channel can be directly modulated by α-ketoisocaproate in inside-out patches. Since α-ketoisocaproate is a Na+ salt, the decrease in single channel unitary conductance from 19.1 ± 0. 3 picosiemens to 14.3 ± 0.4 picosiemens (n = 7;p < 0.01) after the addition of this fuel secretagogue could be explained by the presence of Na+ alone. In the millimolar range, Na+ is known to interact with channel conductance (17Kakei M. Noma A. Shibasaki T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 363: 441-462Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 18Horie M. Irisawa H. Noma A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 387: 251-272Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, the obtained decreases in channel conductance by the various concentrations of the α-ketoisocaproate-Na+ salt were identical to those reported earlier by Na+ (17Kakei M. Noma A. Shibasaki T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 363: 441-462Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). When correcting for the Na+ concentration during and before exposure of the patches to α-ketoisocaproate, no alteration in unitary conductance was observed (Fig. 1 C). In a series of experiments we exposed patches to four different concentrations of α-ketoisocaproate ranging from 2 to 20 mm. It is clear that α-ketoisocaproate dose-dependently decreased K ATPchannel activity (Fig. 2 A). Compiled data of the concentration-inhibition relation is shown in Fig.2 B. Values are expressed as the ratio of channel activity obtained in the presence of α-ketoisocaproate (NP O), and the activity assessed in the standard intracellular solution before the addition of α-ketoisocaproate (NP O Control). The mean value points were fitted to the Hill equation. Estimates of the concentration causing a 50% reduction in channel activity was found to be 8.1 mm, with a Hill coefficient of 2.3, which suggests that the block involves the binding of more than one molecule to theK ATP channel complex. We further examined the effects of α-ketoisocaproate on kinetic properties of the K ATP channel. In Fig.2 C we analyzed the open-time distribution in the presence of α-ketoisocaproate using patches containing no more than three simultaneously active channels. Insets show examples of channel openings under the respective experimental conditions on an expanded time scale. The mean duration of openings under control conditions was 34.1 ± 1.1 ms (n = 5), which is similar to what has been reported earlier for theK ATP channel (16Larsson O. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Fredholm B. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 463: 349-365Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The same type of channel activity was observed in the presence of α-ketoisocaproate, with a mean open time of 29.7 ± 2.1 ms (n = 4;n.s.). To further verify that α-ketoisocaproate has the ability to directly inhibit theK ATP channel without involving metabolism of the substance, we investigated K ATP channel activity in intact cells in the presence of the metabolic inhibitor sodium azide (NaN3) using the perforated patch configuration of the patch-clamp technique. It is well established that the input conductance in the unstimulated β-cell is dominated by theK ATP channel and this conductance is virtually completely inhibited by the sulfonylurea compound tolbutamide (14Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To measure input conductance, we used a voltage-clamp protocol with ±5-mV excursions from a holding potential of −70 mV. As shown in Fig.3 A, the addition of 1 mm NaN3 in the presence of 3 mmglucose increased input conductance 7-fold (698 ± 78%;p < 0.05; n = 6). However, the addition of α-ketoisocaproate in the continued presence of NaN3 decreased input conductance to 50 ± 3% (n = 5; p < 0.01), whereas no significant change was observed when increasing the glucose concentration to 15 mm (106 ± 6%; n= 3; n.s.). Fig. 3 B shows compiled data of a series of measurements of input conductance after the addition of glucose and α-ketoisocaproate, respectively, in the presence of NaN3. We have previously shown that glucose-induced membrane depolarization and increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration are slower at room temperature compared with 37 °C (19Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Rorsman P. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5448-5454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most likely reflecting a lower metabolic rate in the β-cell. We therefore estimated the time from the addition of α-ketoisocaproate or 15 mm glucose to the appearance of action potentials at high (34 °C) and low (26 °C) temperature. Top traces in Fig. 3 C show recordings of membrane potential after the addition of 20 mm α-ketoisocaproate at low and high temperature. No significant change in the latency between the addition and appearance of action potential was observed using α-ketoisocaproate, 11.2 ± 0.9 s versus 9.8 ± 1.6 s at low and high temperature, respectively (n = 4; n.s.). In contrast, when adding 15 mm glucose (bottom traces), a significant delay was observed when lowering the temperature to 26 °C, 37.7 ± 6.7 s at 34 °C 86.2 ± 20.5 s at 26 °C (n = 6; p < 0.05). It should be pointed out that it has been reported that the onset of insulin secretion is more rapid after stimulation with α-ketoisocaproate compared with stimulation with glucose (4Hutton J.C. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Atwater I. Kawazu S. Boschero A.C. Somers G. Devis G. Malaisse W.J. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Finally, we studied the effect of NaN3 in inside-out patches. As seen in Fig. 3 D, channel activity remained unchanged after the addition of NaN3 to the bath. In the presence of NaN3, α-ketoisocaproate (bottom trace) still potently inhibited channel activity. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that α-ketoisocaproate can blockK ATP channel activity independent of metabolism of the keto acid. Several studies have described insulinotrophic effects of l-leucine (3Panten U. Christians J. Kriegstein E. von Poser W. Hasselblatt A. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Freinkel N. Younsi C.E. Dawson R.M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3403-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Panten U. von Kriegstein E. Poser W. Schonborn J. Hasselblatt A. FEBS Lett. 1972; 20: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because of the blocking effect of α-ketoisocaproate on theK ATP channel, we also investigated whether the precursor amino acid, l-leucine, had direct effects on the channel in excised patches. As shown in Fig.4 A, the addition of 20 mml-leucine to an isolated patch neither effected single K ATP channel activity nor channel mean open time (30.4 ± 2.8 ms; n = 4;n.s.). Subsequent inclusion of 20 mmα-ketoisocaproate in the same patch significantly inhibited channel activity. l-Arginine, which has a close structural resemblance to l-leucine, was also without effect onK ATP channel activity (data not shown). Oxopentanoate, which is derived from pentanoic acid, differs from α-ketoisocaproate in lacking a methyl group. Like α-ketoisocaproate, 2-oxopentanoate potently inhibitedK ATP channel currents (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to the potent inhibition of the K ATP channel by α-ketoisocaproate, no effect could be seen on the large conductance Ca2+-regulated K+ (KBK) channel (14Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5 A, exposing inside-out patches to 20 mm α-ketoisocaproate, no effect on the mean current of KBK channel could be monitored. In a series of experiments, KBK channel activity (NP O) was assessed to 0.61 ± 0.09 during control solution, compared with 0.60 ± 0.10 in the presence of α-ketoisocaproate (n = 3; n.s.). The activity of the small Ca2+-regulated K+conductance channel (KSK) (14Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was also unaffected after inclusion of 20 mm α-ketoisocaproate in the bath solution (data not shown). To further investigate whether the effect of α-ketoisocaproate is specific for the K ATP channel, we studied the effects of α-ketoisocaproate on channel activity in trypsin-modified patches. Exposure of isolated membrane patches to 20 μg/ml trypsin for ≈5 min has been reported to alter K ATPchannel activity with a specific pattern. Thus, trypsin treatment takes away the activating effect of MgADP and the inhibitory effect of sulfonylureas on K ATP channel activity, whereas the inhibitory effect of ATP remains, although with slightly decreased efficiency (22Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 424: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Evidently this action of trypsin treatment results from its specific proteolytic effects on theK ATP channel complex (22Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 424: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), trypsin having a primary affinity for arginine and lysine residues (24Benyon R.J. Boyd J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). After trypsin modification, inclusion of α-ketoisocaproate (20 mm) in the bath solution was unable to affect K ATPchannel activity (Fig. 5 C). This experimental protocol was repeated four times, and in all four patches the inhibitory effect of α-ketoisocaproate on K ATP channel activity was lost subsequent to trypsin treatment (Fig. 5 D). Channel activity (NP O) was 3.1 ± 0.5 and 3.0 ± 0.5 (n = 4; n.s.) before and after the addition of α-ketoisocaproate, respectively. Based on these observations, it is highly unlikely that the effect of α-ketoisocaproate is due to a nonspecific block of any K+channel pore but rather involves a specific interaction with theK ATP channel protein complex. It has been known for the last decade that the deamination product of l-leucine, α-ketoisocaproate, is a potent stimulator of insulin secretion (21Panten U. von Kriegstein E. Poser W. Schonborn J. Hasselblatt A. FEBS Lett. 1972; 20: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A number of studies have demonstrated that this compound, like glucose, causes inhibition of the K ATP channel in the pancreatic β-cell (6Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J. Harrison D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 385: 517-529Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Eddlestone G.T. Ribalet B. Ciani S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Ribalet B.

FEBS Lett. 1972; 20: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, blocking of the respiratory cycle reduces the insulinotrophic effect of α-ketoisocaproate (4Hutton J.C. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Atwater I. Kawazu S. Boschero A.C. Somers G. Devis G. Malaisse W.J. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These observations have suggested a role for oxidative phosphorylation-generated messengers to promote closure of the K ATPchannel. In contrast to these findings, the results presented in this study clearly show that α-ketoisocaproate directly and reversibly inhibits the K ATP channel in the pancreatic β-cell without involving metabolism of the substance. Since the resting potential in the intact β-cell is mainly determined by the activity of the K ATP channel (14Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), it is clear that α-ketoisocaproate will also influence membrane potential and thereby insulin secretion by direct inhibition of the channel. Thus, in view of our findings, the use of α-ketoisocaproate as a tool to study the role of mitchondrial metabolism in intact β-cells should be interpreted cautiously. To what extent direct effects of α-keto acids on K ATP channel activity are involved in the β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling is at present difficult to assess. In our view, the concentrations required to affect the activity of theK ATP channel, as found in the present study, are not likely to be reached during physiological conditions. The present design does not allow us to evaluate relative contribution of the direct effect of α-ketoisocaproate on theK ATP channel versus effects resulting from metabolism of the substance. In this context it is interesting that α-ketoisocaproate stimulates insulin release more rapidly than glucose (4Hutton J.C. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Atwater I. Kawazu S. Boschero A.C. Somers G. Devis G. Malaisse W.J. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The direct effect of α-ketoisocaproate on theK ATP channel may explain this difference in kinetics in the stimulation of insulin release."

Several data implicate a role for DNA ligase I in DNA replication, probably coordinated by the action of other enzymes and proteins. Since both DNA polymerases δ and ε show multiple functions in different DNA transactions, we investigated the effect of DNA ligase I on various DNA synthesis events catalyzed by these two essential DNA polymerases. DNA ligase I inhibited replication factor C-independent DNA synthesis by polymerase δ. Our results suggest that the inhibition may be due to DNA ligase I interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and not to a direct interaction with the DNA polymerase δ itself. Strand displacement activity by DNA polymerase δ was also affected by DNA ligase I. The DNA polymerase δ holoenzyme (composed of DNA polymerase δ, PCNA, and replication factor C) was inhibited in the same way as the DNA polymerase δ core, strengthening the hypothesis of a PCNA interaction. Contrary to DNA polymerase δ, DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase ε was stimulated by DNA ligase I in a PCNA-dependent manner. We conclude that DNA ligase I displays different influences on the two multipotent DNA polymerases δ and ε through PCNA.

Four DNA ligases (I, II, III, and IV), the functions of which are not yet completely understood, have been identified in mammalian cells (2Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Human DNA ligase I is a monomer of 102 kDa (3Barnes D.E. Johnston L.H. Kodama K. Tomkinson A.E. Lasko D.D. Lindahl T. Proc.

The most important proteins in the DNA synthesis reaction are the pols. So far six pols have been identified in eukaryotic cells, called α, β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ (reviewed in Refs. 16Wang T.S.-F.

Chem. 1997; 378: 345-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three of them (α, δ, and ε) have been shown to be essential in DNA replication (18Boulet A. Simon M. Faye G. Bauer G.A. Burgers P.M.

Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). It is moderately processive and dissociates from the DNA, facilitating a switch to a highly processive, proofreading pol such as pol δ. pol δ consists of at least two identified subunits with molecular masses of 125 and 50 kDa. The polymerase and the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activities are both located on the large subunit (22Pignède G. Moussy G. Bouvier D. Tillit J. de Recondo A.M. Baldacci G.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). pol δ exhibits very low activity on its own, but upon addition of the auxiliary factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (reviewed in Refs. 24Kelman Z.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar), in an ATP-dependent fashion. RF-C recognizes the 3′-end of the nascent strand, thereupon inducing the dissociation of pol α/primase and recruiting pol δ (29Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), which then performs processive leading strand synthesis. On the lagging strand, pol δ has been shownin vitro to extend the Okazaki fragments (13Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol.

Whether this is also the case in vivo remains controversial, since pol ε has been proposed as the lagging strand pol (30Burgers P.M. J. Biol.

Hübscher U. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 345-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and V(D)J recombination (34Jessberger R. Schar P. Robins P. Ferrari E. Riwar B. Hübscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). pol ε is enzymatically distinguishable from pol δ by its differing response to PCNA. Whereas pol δ is processive only in the presence of PCNA, pol ε is very active even in the absence of PCNA. Previous studies have reported that pol ε is completely unresponsive to the addition of PCNA (20Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 35Focher F. Gassmann M. Hafkemeyer P. Ferrari E. Spadari S. Hübscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1805-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); however, more detailed kinetic studies have shown that PCNA can also stimulate the processivity of pol ε and that pol ε interacts with PCNA, increasing its rate of nucleotide incorporation (36Maga G. Hübscher U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the presence of RF-C and ATP, pol ε, like pol δ, is able to form a stable complex with PCNA at the 3′-end of the primer, called pol ε holoenzyme (30Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Podust V. Mikhailov V. Georgaki A. Hübscher U. Chromosoma. 1992; 102: 133-141Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar to pol δ, the pol ε also has a role in DNA repair (38Shivji M.K. Podust V.N. Hübscher U. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 39Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a function in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks has been suggested (40Jessberger R. Podust V. Hübscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we show that pols δ and ε are affected in different ways by DNA ligase I. DNA elongation by pol δ is strongly inhibited by DNA ligase I, most likely through the already observed interaction of DNA ligase I with PCNA (41Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis by pol ε on the other hand is stimulated by DNA ligase I. Here PCNA plays a dual role; at low concentrations pol ε stimulation by DNA ligase I is increased, whereas at high concentrations the stimulatory effect is canceled. All these effects are ATP-independent, that is they do not involve the DNA ligase I per se and consequently appear to be caused by protein-protein interactions between PCNA and DNA ligase I. Radiolabeled nucleoside triphosphates were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and unlabeled dNTPs were from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). The single-stranded M13 DNA was hybridized to the universal sequencing primer as outlined (42Ottiger H.P. Hübscher U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gapped double-stranded DNA was constructed as described (43Amacker M. Hottiger M. Hübscher U. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6273-6279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to the incorporation of 1 nmol of total dTMP into acid-precipitable material in 60 min at 37 °C in a standard assay containing 500 ng of poly(dA)/oligo(dT)10:1 and 20 μm dTTP. A final volume of 25 μl contained the following: 50 mm BisTris-HCl (pH 6.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 250 μg/ml BSA, 20 μm [3H]dTTPs (400 cpm/pmol), 500 ng of poly(dA)/oligo(dT), 120 ng of PCNA (unless differently mentioned) and pol δ to be titrated. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the insoluble radioactive material was determined as described (48Hübscher U. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6284-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

Reactions were analyzed as described above for pol δ. A final volume of 25 μl contained the following: 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm DTT, 200 μg/ml BSA, 15 μm[3H]dNTPs (300 cpm/pmol), 100 ng of singly primed M13 DNA, 120 ng of PCNA, 350 ng of single-stranded DNA-binding protein, 20 ng of RF-C, and 0.25 units of pol δ (or 0.16 units pol ε). The reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, stopped, and quantified as described (48Hübscher U. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6284-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A recombinant PCNA form that could be artificially phosphorylated in vitro at the N terminus by cAMP-dependent protein kinase was used (45Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A final volume of 25 μl contained the following: 40 mm triethanolamine HCl (pH 7.5), 200 μg/ml BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 50 ng of 32P-phosphorylated PCNA, 50 ng of RF-C, 60 ng of gapped circular DNA (49Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Floth C. Hübscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2970-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and DNA ligase I in the amount indicated in the figure. The samples were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v) and further incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. The samples were then adjusted with 2.5% Ficoll-400 and marker dyes, loaded on a 0.8% agarose gel, and electrophoresed in 45 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 1 mmEDTA and 0.1% SDS. The gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid, 12% methanol, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. PCNA loading onto DNA was quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The steps of the DNA substrate synthesis are described (see Ref. 43Amacker M. Hottiger M. Hübscher U. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6273-6279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gapped dsDNA was first digested with KpnI and PvuII in suitable buffer conditions for 1 h at 37 °C. Digested DNA was used for the experiment without further purification. For strand displacement DNA synthesis the following components were mixed in a final volume of 25 μl: 50 mm BisTris (pH 6.5), 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 250 μg/ml BSA, 120 ng of PCNA, 5 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 20 ng of gapped dsDNA, and 0.25 units pol δ. The mixture was incubated for 7 min at 37 °C to allow incorporation of the first two dATPs. Then dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (30 μm each) and DNA ligase I (in amounts as described in the figure legend) were added. DNA synthesis was allowed to continue for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by heating for 10 min at 70 °C. After cooling to room temperature, reactions were treated with proteinase K (60 μg/ml), in the presence of 1% SDS (w/v) and 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for 30 min at 37 °C. After addition of the same volume of 100% formamide and marker dyes, samples were loaded on a 8% polyacrylamide gel, containing 7 m urea (17 × 21 × 0.8 mm). The gel was run in 1× TBE buffer at 30 V/cm until the bromphenol blue dye reached the bottom. The gel was finally fixed in 10% acetic acid, 12% methanol, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Pol δ was titrated on poly(dA)200/oligo(dT)12–18, and all reactions were carried out under conditions under which less than one nucleotide was incorporated per 3′-OH primer present, so that statistically no more than one enzyme molecule per 3′-OH primer was bound. Under these conditions most primers initiated no synthesis at all, whereas DNA synthesis starting from the few primers that were bound was the result of only one stretch of processive activity. The length of extension of the utilized 3′-OH primers reflects the processivity of the enzymes (50Sabatino R.D. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A. Kwon-Shin O. Marraccino R.L. Frickey P.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2998-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Oligo(dT)12–18 was hybridized to poly(dA)200 at a weight ratio of 1:10, the equivalent of a molar ratio of 1.9:1. DNA replication reactions were carried out with 500 ng of template DNA, corresponding to 8.9 pmol 3′-OH ends. 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 pmol of DNA ligase I, respectively, were first mixed with the required amount of PCNA (1.4 pmol) and then added to the reaction tube. Replication was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C. Fig. 1 A shows that DNA ligase I affected DNA elongation by pol δ in two different ways. At DNA ligase I concentrations between 40 and 200 nmthe amount of nucleotides incorporated in 30 min increased by about 10–20%. An intrinsic polymerase activity of the ligase sample used could be excluded (data not shown). At higher DNA ligase I concentrations (0.4–0.8 μm) DNA synthesis was clearly inhibited to an extent of 70–85%. At 50% inhibition the calculated ratio between DNA ligase I and PCNA trimer molecules was 10:1, whereas DNA ligase I molecules were not in excess over pol δ. That the inhibitory effect is not due to DNA ligase I binding to the 3′-OH groups is indirectly shown in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 10(see below). A competition experiment with an excess of primer ends cannot be carried out because of the ability of pol δ to bind to the competitor DNA.Figure 10DNA ligase I cannot discriminate between pol δ and ε. RF-C-independent DNA synthesis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” for pol δ. Various amounts of DNA ligase I were added to a reaction mix containing 0.007 units of pol δ only (diamonds), 0.07 units of pol ε only (circles), or 0.007 units of pol δ and 0.07 units of pol ε together (squares). Triangles represent sum of the values obtained with pol δ and pol ε alone (i.e. diamonds and circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Levin and co-workers (41Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) demonstrated a direct interaction of DNA ligase I with PCNA; furthermore, they found that pol α, δ, and ε did not directly interact with DNA ligase I. We therefore next determined whether the DNA ligase I effects observed in Fig. 1 A could be attributed to an influence on pol δ or on PCNA. Fig. 1 B shows that the inhibition by DNA ligase I could be overcome with high PCNA concentrations. Addition of 15 pmol of PCNA, which corresponds to the highest DNA ligase I amount present, resulted in a partial reversion of the inhibitory effect. These results therefore suggest that DNA ligase I might inhibit in vitroDNA synthesis by trapping the PCNA molecules and consequently preventing them from interacting with pol δ. pol δ has very poor processivity by itself; PCNA was established as an auxiliary factor of pol δ that dramatically increased the processivity of the latter (26Tan C.K. Castillo C. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Prelich G. Tan C.K. Kostura M. Mathews M.B. So A.G. Downey K.M. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 51Bravo R. Frank R. Blundell P.A. MacDonald-Bravo H. Nature. 1987; 326: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Gel analysis of the DNA synthesis products confirmed the loss of processivity of pol δ in the presence of DNA ligase I. Only a decrease of long products (>200 nucleotides), but not of short products (<200 nucleotides), was observed (data not shown). From the results shown in Fig. 1 B an involvement of PCNA in the inhibitory effect by DNA ligase I can be postulated. Therefore, we next determined whether pol δ had also a role in this process by performing an experiment in which two of the three proteins, pol δ, DNA ligase I, and PCNA, were first allowed to form a possible “complex,” before being exposed to the rest of the assay components. In the experiment illustrated in Fig.2 A, PCNA was incubated with DNA ligase I for 2 min at 37 °C, and then the rest of the reaction mixture containing pol δ and DNA substrate was added, and DNA synthesis was allowed to proceed for 30 min. As mentioned above, DNA ligase I traps the PCNA molecules, thus preventing interaction with the pol. The expected inhibitory effect (60%) was observed. In the second case (Fig. 2 B) the pol was preincubated with PCNA (2 min at 37 °C) prior to the addition of DNA ligase I and DNA. No difference in the inhibition pattern was evident. Whether pol δ and PCNA can interact in the absence of DNA is still controversial. If this were the case, the results would speak for a competition between pol and DNA ligase for PCNA, whereby DNA ligase I would be the winner. On the other hand, it would be more probable that PCNA remains free to be trapped by DNA ligase I. In the third case (Fig. 2 C), DNA ligase I and pol δ were preincubated. pol δ and DNA ligase I do not interactin vitro (data not shown and Ref. 41Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and in fact DNA synthesis was affected to exactly the same extent as above (Fig. 2,A and B), confirming a lack of interaction between pol δ and DNA ligase I. From this experiment it can therefore be concluded that the inhibitory effect of DNA ligase I on pol δ activity might be due to DNA ligase I interaction with PCNA and does not involve the pol itself. In the experiments described so far, DNA ligase I was included in the reaction from the beginning. Therefore, the next question to answer was whether DNA ligase I had any effect on an active, replicating pol δ·PCNA complex. DNA ligase I was added to the in vitro reaction at different time points, and the amount of nucleotides incorporated after 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min was followed. Results in Fig.3 show that inhibition of DNA synthesis occurs if DNA ligase I is added during the first 5 min of synthesis. The inhibitory effect is not immediate, but a delay is observed, which is directly proportional to the elapsed time between the beginning of synthesis and addition of DNA ligase I (data not shown). When DNA ligase I was added in the reaction after 10 or 20 min, no significant inhibition was observed. This suggests that the DNA ligase I molecules do not interfere with an actively moving PCNA·pol δ complex, the interaction to PCNA being limited to free trimers. Next, we investigated the behavior of DNA ligase I in the presence of different ratios of primer versustemplate. pol δ was titrated using different template/primer ratios, varying between a weight ratio of 25:1 and 1:1. The amount of pol δ was chosen so that no more than 1 pol molecule bound per 3′-OH primer end. Table I illustrates the different templates used as well as the results obtained after addition of DNA ligase I. The maximal inhibition of activity is exerted on a 25:1 template/primer base weight ratio; an increase of the number of 3′-OH ends per poly(dA) molecule led to a decrease of the inhibitory effect. These results might be due to the fact that more 3′-OH ends support more active pol δ·PCNA complexes, which are then inaccessible to the DNA ligase I molecules.Table IThe inhibitory effect of DNA ligase I on DNA replication by pol δ is more pronounced at low amounts of primer terminiPoly(dA)/oligo(dT)Poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (mratio)Maximum inhibition (with 20 pmol DNA ligase I)w/w%25:11.3:17110:11:1.963.55:11:3.756.62:11:9.3401:11:18.435RF-C-independent DNA replication was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” with different DNA templates.

https://openalex.org/W2092294603,"The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) β genes in Xenopus laevis are regulated by thyroid hormone in all organs of an animal during metamorphosis. This autoregulation appears to be critical for systematic transformations of different organs as a tadpole is transformed into a frog. To understand this autoregulation, we have previously identified a thyroid hormone response element in the hormone-dependent promoter of the X. laevisTRβA gene. We report here the detailed characterization of the promoter. We have now mapped the transcription start site and demonstrated the existence of an initiator element at the start site critical for promoter function. More important, our deletion and mutational experiments revealed a novel upstream DNA element that is located 125 base pairs upstream of the start site and that is essential for active transcription from the promoter. Promoter reconstitution experiments showed that this novel element does not function as an enhancer, but acts as a core promoter element, which, together with the initiator, directs accurate transcription from the promoter. Finally, we provide evidence for the existence of a protein(s) that specifically recognizes this element. Our studies thus demonstrate that the TRβA promoter has a unique organization consisting of an initiator and a novel upstream promoter element. Such an organization may be important for the ubiquitous but tissue-dependent temporal regulation of the gene by thyroid hormone during amphibian metamorphosis.

Thus, it is believed that T3 induces a cascade of gene regulation in each tissue or organ to effect the metamorphic transition (12Shi Y.-B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 14-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Many T3 response genes have been isolated from various metamorphosing tadpole tissues, and their developmental expression profiles have implicated potential roles during metamorphosis (12Shi Y.-B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 14-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R. Atkinson B.G.

Genes to Cells. 1996; 1: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Among the T3 response genes are the TR genes themselves. Two TRα and two TRβ genes have been isolated from Xenopus laevis (15Brooks A.R. Sweeney G. Old R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9395-9405Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 16Yaoita Y. Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1992; 13: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Schneider M.J. Galton V.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consistent with their roles in mediating T3 effects, all TR genes are expressed during metamorphosis and can be up-regulated by T3 treatment of premetamorphic tadpoles (17Helbing C.C. Gergely G. Atkinson B.G. Dev. Genet. 1992; 13: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Schneider M.J. Galton V.A. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In particular, the Xenopus TRβA genes have been shown to be directly regulated by T3 at the transcriptional level (21Kanamori A. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 739-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Machuca I.

This T3 regulation appears to be mediated mostly by a thyroid hormone response element (TRE), consisting of two near-perfect repeats of AGGTCA separated by 4 bp. Interestingly, promoter studies using transient transfection assays in frog tissue culture cells failed to identify any other elements necessary for the TRβA promoter due to the lack of information on the transcription start site (22Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Machuca I. Esslemont G. Fairclough L. Tata J.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 96-107PubMed Google Scholar). Promoters recognized by RNA polymerase II generally contain a TATA box and/or an initiator that directs specific transcription initiation. In many genes, the TATA element is the primary core element responsible for positioning the basal transcription machinery on the promoter (25Smale S.T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York, NY1994: 63-81Google Scholar, 26Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 27Zawel L. Reinberg D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 67-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, many other genes lack a TATA element and, instead, contain an initiator. The initiator encompasses the transcription start site and is sufficient to position the basal transcription complex. This specific positioning of the basal transcription machinery at a promoter by a TATA and/or initiator element allows basal transcription, which can be enhanced by transcription activators. To determine the nature of the TRβA promoter, we have now mapped its start site by introducing the TRβA promoter into Xenopusoocytes and analyzing the resulting transcript by primer extension and by PCR cloning of the 5′-end of TRβA mRNA from tadpoles. Deletion and mutational studies demonstrated a unique nature of the TRβA promoter, consisting of a novel promoter element and an initiator, thus different from the two major classes of RNA polymerase II promoters mentioned above. We further show that specific proteins exist to recognize the novel promoter element, thus likely allowing specific transcription initiation and activation by TRs. The wild-type pTRβA promoter construct was generated by cloning a 1.9-kilobase EcoRI fragment containing 1.6 kilobases of TRβA promoter sequence and ∼0.3 kilobase of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene sequence from plasmid pCAT-WT (22Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pBluescript II KS(−) (Stratagene). To make a construct of the promoter with a 5′- and/or a 3′-deletion, a 5′-primer (bearing a HindIII restriction site and located at an appropriate position for the desired deletion) and a 3′-primer (bearing a BglII restriction site and located at a downstream position for the desired deletion) were used to PCR-amplify a promoter fragment from the wild-type template. The amplified fragment was then cloned into the wild-type plasmid after removing the promoter sequence by HindIII and BglII digestions. To make a specific mutation in the UPE or Inr region, a specific primer bearing the desired mutation was used to prime second strand DNA synthesis on a single-stranded wild-type construct using a mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli to obtain the mutant promoter construct. To place the UPE into a short inactive promoter (pTRp5′-1), a double-stranded oligonucleotide bearing the wild-type UPE (made of 5′-AGC TTT AAA GTA CCC CCT CTT GTA AAA TAT AAG GAT ATT ATA A-3′ and 5′-AGC TTT ATA ATA TCC TTA TAT TTT ACA AGA GGG GGT ACT TTA A-3′) or a truncated UPE (mUPE) (made of 5′-AGC TTG TAA AAT ATA AGG ATA TTA TAA-3′ and 5′-AGC TTT ATA ATA TCC TTA TAT TTT ACA-3) and containing HindIII overhangs was cloned intoHindIII-digested pTRp5′-1. All clones were verified by sequencing. Finally, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing either the Gal4-binding site (consisting of 5′-AGC TTC GGA GGA GAG TCT TCC GA-3 and 5′-AGC TTC GGA AGA CTC TCC TCC GA-3) (34Lin Y.S. Carey M.F. Ptashne M. Green M. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) or a TRE (22Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HindIII overhangs was cloned intoHindIII-digested pTRp5′-1 and pTRp5′-7 to generate chimeric promoters. The clones containing one or three copies of the Gal4-binding site or TRE were selected based on DNA sequencing. The double-stranded DNA of pTRβA promoter constructs was prepared using a QIAGEN kit as described by the manufacturer. The single-stranded DNA of pTRβA promoter constructs was prepared from phagemids induced with VCS M13 as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The preparation ofXenopus stage VI oocytes and the microinjection procedure were essentially as described (29Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The TRβA promoter plasmid DNA was injected (23 nl/oocyte) either as single-stranded DNA (1.15 ng/oocyte) or double-stranded DNA (2.3 ng/oocyte) into the nuclei (germinal vesicle) of the oocytes, and the indicated amounts of mRNAs forXenopus TRβA and RXRα were injected (27 nl/oocyte, 50 ng/μl) into the oocyte cytoplasm. The mRNAs were usually injected 6 h before the injection of DNA. For transcription analysis, ∼20 oocytes were injected for each sample to minimize the variations among oocytes and injections. The injected oocytes were incubated at 18 °C overnight in MBSH buffer (29Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) supplemented with antibiotics (50 units/ml ampicillin and streptomycin) and then collected for transcription analysis. The pSP64(A)-xTRβA, pSP64(A)-xRXRα, and pSP64(A)-Gal4-VP16 plasmids (30Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4361-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) were linearized with EcoRI, and in vitro transcription was performed using an SP6 Message Machine kit (Ambion) as described by the manufacturer. A typical reaction with ∼0.5 μg of linearized template in a 20-μl reaction yielded 10–15 μg of capped mRNA. The mRNAs were resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water at a final concentration of 50 ng/μl and injected into the cytoplasm of groups of oocytes (27 nl/oocyte). After incubation overnight, the oocytes were collected. We examined the relative levels of expression of the TRβA and RXRα receptors in the oocytes by coinjection of [35S]methionine and mRNA (31Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which indicated that similar amounts of receptors were produced when equal concentrations of mRNAs were injected. Therefore, in all experiments with the injection of TRβA and RXRα, equal amounts of TRβA and RXRα mRNAs were mixed to give a final concentration as indicated for each. Transcription analysis by primer extension from the injected oocytes were performed essentially as described (29Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼20 injected oocytes were collected for each sample, rinsed with 400 μl of MBSH buffer, and then homogenized in 300 μl of 0.25 m Tris (pH 8.0). To isolate RNA, 50 μl of of RNazol reagent/oocyte was added to the sample, vortexed, and then incubated on ice for 15 min before centrifugation. The clean supernatant was transferred to a new tube and extracted once with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform. The RNA was then precipitated with 0.7 volume of isopropyl alcohol, rinsed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. For primer extension analysis, RNA from 1 or 2 oocyte eq was annealed with either the end-labeled chloramphenicol acetyltransferase primer (5′-GGTGGTATATCCAGTGATTTTTTTCTCCAT-3′, located just downstream of the TRβ promoter sequence) or primer I (5′-ATCCTTATAAACGGTGAGTAGTGATGTACT-3′, located at +109 to +80) in 10 μl of 0.4 m KCl at 65 °C for 10 min, 55 °C for 25 min, and 42 °C for 5 min. Thirty microliters of reverse transcription mixture (67 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTP mixture, 1 unit of RNasin, and 10 units of Superscript II) were then added. The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h and then stopped by ethanol precipitation. The products were analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel and visualized by autoradiography. As an internal control, a histone H4 antisense primer (5′-GGCTTGGTGATGCCCTGGATGTTATCC-3′) was included in the primer extension reaction to quantify the endogenous H4 mRNA level. The anchor PCR cloning procedure was performed according to Frohman et al. (32Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Ten micrograms of stage 64 tadpole RNA were reverse-transcribed as described above with primer II (5′-AAAAGCCATGAATATCCTGTA-3′, +136 to +116). The cDNAs were isolated by phenol extraction, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation and were resuspended in 1× Tris/EDTA. One-fifth of the cDNAs were precipitated again with ethanol in an ammonium acetate buffer and resuspended into 20.6 μl of 1× Tris/EDTA. For tailing, 2.4 μl of 2.5 mm dATP, 6 μl of 5× tailing buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 15 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 12 min at 37 °C and heated for 15 min at 65 °C. The reaction mixture was diluted to 500 μl in 1× Tris/EDTA, and 5-μl aliquots were used for amplification in 50 μl of PCR mixture (5 μl of 10× Taq polymerase buffer with MgCl2 (Promega), 0.8 μl of 25 mm dNTP, 0.65 μl of 0.1 μg/μl (dT)17 adapter, 0.8 μl of 0.1 μg/μl adapter, 0.8 μl of 0.1 μg/μl primer I, and 2.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Promega)) (for adapter primer sequence, see Ref. 32Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Using a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer), the mixture was denatured at 94 °C for 4 min, annealed at 42 °C for 2 min, and extended at 72 °C for 30 min before 40 cycles of amplification using a step program (94 °C, 40 s; 55 °C, 2 min; and 72 °C, 3 min), followed by a 30-min final extension at 72 °C. PCR products were cloned with the Original TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Individual clones were isolated and sequenced with a T7 Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Seven independent TRβA cDNA clones were obtained that had only a few base changes (different among different clones) compared with the TRβA genomic clone. These changes were likely derived from PCR errors due to the use of Taq polymerase and/or sequence polymorphisms. However, all had their 5′-end at position +1 or +3. Two nanograms of32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were mixed with 9 μg of cell extract, made from X. laevis tissue culture cell line XL58 as described (22Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in 20 μl of 1× binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) containing 1 μg of poly(dI·dC). After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction mixture was analyzed directly on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (0.5× Tris borate/EDTA, running at 4 °C for ∼4.5 h with 1× Tris/EDTA as the running buffer). The double-stranded oligonucleotides used included UPE, mUPE, Inr (made of 5′-TAA TTA ATA AAG TAC CCC CAG TTG TAA AAT-3′ and 5′-ATT TTA CAA CTG GGG GTA CTT TAT TAA TTA-3′), and mInr (made of 5′-TGT ATT ATA ATT AAT ACC CAG TTG TAA AAT-3′ and 5′-ATT TTA CAA CTG GGT ATT AAT TAT AAT ACA-3′). The two X. laevisTRβ genes (TRβA and TRβB) are regulated identically during development and by thyroid hormone (16Yaoita Y. Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Shi Y.-B. Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 733-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic structure analyses have revealed that each TRβ gene produces mRNAs with two alternative 5′-ends, i.e. having two different 5′-exons (exons a and b, respectively) (33Shi Y.-B. Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 733-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the relative locations of the two exons, i.e. whether exon b is located upstream of exon a or vice versa, have yet to be determined, both exons are independently transcribed (21Kanamori A. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 739-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Shi Y.-B. Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 733-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression from the promoter upstream of exon a is maintained at low but constitutive levels. In contrast, the promoter upstream of exon b is repressed in the absence of T3, but is activated to high levels when T3is present. We (22Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (23Machuca I. Esslemont G. Fairclough L. Tata J.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 96-107PubMed Google Scholar) have previously analyzed this T3-inducible promoter (upstream of exon b) of the TRβA gene and identified a strong TRE that mediates the strong autoinduction of the receptor gene (Fig.1 A). However, the start site of the TRβA promoter had not been determined, possibly due to the low abundance of the mRNA in vivo or generated from transfection (22Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has not be possible to identify any elements other than the TRE that are necessary for reporter gene expression in transient transfection assays (22Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the transcription start site, we microinjected a single-stranded reporter construct, which contained 46 bp of the previously reported exon b (16Yaoita Y. Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and another 1.6 kilobases of upstream sequence, into Xenopus oocytes in the presence or absence of overexpressed TR/RXR heterodimers and/or T3. The single-stranded DNA is known to be replicated into the double-stranded form and assembled into chromatin through a replication-coupled assembly process, mimicking that in somatic cells (24Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2696-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 29Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis showed that there was a very low level of transcription from the promoter in the absence of T3 and TR/RXR (Fig. 1 B). Overexpression of TR/RXR in the absence of T3 caused a further reduction of transcription. In the presence of both T3 and TR/RXR, the transcription was strongly activated, in agreement with the early transfection studies. Both the basal and T3-induced transcripts initiated from position +1 (Fig. 1, A and B), 264 bp upstream of the 5′-end of the published exon b sequence (16Yaoita Y. Shi Y.-B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, the previously published exon b sequence was derived from a partial mRNA clone truncated at the 5′-end, and the TRE is located ∼262 bp downstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 1 A). To confirm that the start site identified in the oocyte is also used in tadpoles, the anchor PCR or rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR method (32Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar) was used to clone the 5′-end of TRβA mRNA. For this purpose, stage 64 tadpole RNA was reverse-transcribed with a TRβ-specific primer and PCR-amplified with another specific primer and the adapter primer. The resulting cDNA was cloned, and individual clones were isolated and sequenced. Seven independent TRβA cDNA clones were obtained. Three clones had their 5′-ends at position +1, and four clones at position +3 (Fig. 1 A). These results indicate that position +1 is also the start site in metamorphosing tadpoles when TRβ genes are highly expressed (20Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar,31Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As earlier transfection studies showed that TRβA plasmid constructs with 5′-deletions passing site +1 still gave strong reporter signal (Ref. 22Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, where position +1 is equivalent to position +270 in this paper), we were interested to determine whether these constructs were able to direct accurate transcription in frog oocytes. For this purpose, we microinjected the same double-stranded plasmid constructs used in the earlier studies into frog oocytes. Since double-stranded plasmids do not undergo replication and consequently are assembled through a different pathway into a chromatin form that yields high levels of basal transcription (24Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2696-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 29Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), it was not necessary to overexpress TR/RXR and/or to add T3 to the oocyte culturing medium. Consistently, primer extension analysis of the RNA isolated from oocytes injected with the full-length TRβA promoter (wild-type, −1336 to +316) showed that the RNA with the expected size was efficiently transcribed in the oocytes (Fig.2). However, many of the short constructs failed to produce specific transcripts (data not shown). To better define the promoter sequence, several additional deletion constructs were made around the start site and analyzed in oocytes. Constructs with 5′-deletions up to −276 or −172 (pTR6 and pTRp11, respectively) were still able to direct accurate transcription from position +1, as were the constructs with 3′-deletions up to +266, +244, or +8 (pTRp9, pTRp6, and pTRp10, respectively) (Fig. 2). On the other hand, those constructs with 5′-deletions passing −172 (pTRp4, pTRp5, pTRp7, and pTRp8) failed to produce any transcripts from the start site (+1). Thus, these data suggest that the reporter activity detected by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay reported for the transient transfection experiments with some of the constructs (22Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was most likely due to nonspecific transcription from the reporter plasmid, which was enhanced by the TRβA DNA sequence inserted in front of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding region through a yet unknown mechanism. Furthermore, these results suggest that the region from −172 to +8 is sufficient for accurate basal transcription from the promoter. To further characterize the DNA sequences necessary for the basal promoter activity, additional 5′- and 3′-deletion constructs were made and injected into oocytes in the double-stranded form. Primer extension analysis showed that 5′-deletion up to −154 (pTRp5′-7) still yielded an active promoter, whereas a further deletion of 13 bp (pTRp5′-6) or more resulted in an inactive promoter (Fig.3 A). Thus, the region from −154 to −141 is an essential element for the activity. Transcription studies of promoter constructs with additional 3′-deletions showed that the sequences downstream of +7 (pTRp3′-1) were not necessary for promoter activity, whereas deletion to +5 (pTRp3′-2) or −4 (pTR3′-3) abolished accurate transcription (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the region around the start site is critical for the promoter, i.e. the presence of an initiator. Site-directed mutagenesis was then carried out to further define the UPE around −140 and the Inr. Three site-directed mutational constructs were made, each changing 6 residues to the recognition site ofNdeI. Two of them were in the upstream region around −140,i.e. the UPE, and one was near the start site,i.e. the Inr. Consistent with the deletion analyses above, mutating residues −148 to −143 abolished the promoter function (Fig.4, construct UPE/m2). On the other hand, changing residues −130 to −125 had no effect (construct UPE/m1). Thus, the UPE lies within −151 to −130. Similarly, the mutation of residues +6 to +11 to CATATG (construct Inr/m1) inactivated the promoter, confirming that sequence up to +7 is important for initiator function. Inspection of the UPE and Inr sequences revealed that they are complementary to each other with the exception of a few residues. This prompted us to examine whether the sequences or the complementarity between them is critical for the promoter. We first mutated 5-CCCCC-3′ in the UPE to 5′-GCGGG-3′ (UPE/m3) or 5′-GGGGG-3′ in the Inr to 5′-CCCGC-3′ (Inr/m2) and analyzed the promoter activities of the resulting constructs. Both were found to be inactive, although slight activity was detected for UPE/m3 (Fig. 4). This is consistent with the deletion and mutational studies for UPE above and with the fact that initiators require the sequences both upstream and downstream of the start site (26Roeder R.G.

The interaction of helicase with these effectors was investigated by kinetic techniques to determine if the complexes were kinetically competent for ATP hydrolysis. k cat values with the 16-mer and HF16 were 2.7 and 36 s−1, respectively. The maximal value of the rate constant for the approach of an intermediate to the steady-state level has to be at least 4-fold greater thank cat for it to be kinetically competent.

Biochem. 1976; 65: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the kinetic and chemical mechanisms for this class of enzymes have not been elucidated. In particular, the mechanism of coupling ATP hydrolysis to the unwinding of double-stranded DNA is incompletely understood.

The two DNA-binding sites in the catalytic dimer unwind defined lengths of the DNA duplex by alternatively binding duplex and single-stranded DNA in a process coupled to ATP hydrolysis (2Lohman T.M.

Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2268-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that E. coli helicase II unwinds approximately 4 base pairs during each catalytic cycle (13Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Nucleotide binding also regulates the binding of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA to E. coli Rep helicase. In particular, ATP stimulates the rate of single-stranded DNA exchange by increasing the rate constant for dissociation of DNA (10Bjornson K.P. Wong I. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the active form of this enzyme is a dimer (2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev.

Bjornson K.P. Hsieh J. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5726-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), there are minimally two potential sites for ATP binding. Bjornsen et al. (10Bjornson K.P. Wong I. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have provided kinetic evidence that suggested these two sites communicate. Recently Wong and Lohman (14Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) made heterodimers of Rep helicase containing ADP-AlF4 tightly bound at the ATP site and covalently cross-linked single-stranded DNA at the DNA-binding site. Through the use of cis- (substrate analogues on the same subunit) and trans (substrate analogues on different subunits)-labeled dimers, they concluded that most of the observed ATPase activity was the result of the cis-labeled subunit. The ATPase activity of the subunit lacking single-stranded DNA was small because of a slow conformational change occurring prior to ADP release and not due to a diminished rate of ATP hydrolysis (14Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Even though the kinetic mechanism for ATP hydrolysis by Rep helicase in the presence of single-stranded DNA has been clearly defined, the chemical mechanism for coupling ATP hydrolysis to double-stranded DNA unwinding is still unclear.

Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Recently, a crystal structure of the HCV helicase has been reported (16Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). However, the protein was crystallized in the absence of a divalent metal cofactor such as Mg2+, which is required for ATP hydrolysis and nucleic acid unwinding, and in the absence of nucleic acid or nucleotide. Crystal structures of Rep helicase from E. coli (17Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) and a helicase fromBacillus stearothermophilus have also been reported. Co-crystals of Rep helicase with nucleic acid and ADP in the absence of Mg2+ implicated motifs Ia, V, and III for single-stranded DNA binding, motifs I and IV for nucleotide binding, and motifs II and IV possibly functioned in the coupling of nucleotide and single-stranded DNA binding (17Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These structures suggested a single nucleotide-binding site per monomer. HCV helicase has a large intrinsic ATPase activity (k cat = 3 s−1 (19Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)). Single-stranded DNA or RNA increases the k catvalue up to 30-fold (19Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, the k catvalues for ATPase activities of bacterial helicases such as Rep helicase and helicase II are increased over 1000-fold by single-stranded DNA (11Wong I. Moore K.J.M. Bjornson K.P. Hsieh J. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5726-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The turnover numbers for ATP hydrolysis by HCV helicase and Rep helicase in the presence of nucleic acid are similar. The differential DNA stimulation of these enzymes is the result of the large intrinsic ATPase activity of HCV helicase in the absence of single-stranded nucleic acid. This observation suggested that either HCV helicase ATPase activity was associated with a single site that was not tightly coupled to nucleic acid binding or HCV helicase may have ATPase activity associated with two separate sites on the enzyme. Further support for the latter suggestion was the finding that stoichiometry for ADP binding to the enzyme in the presence of excess Mg2+, F−, and poly(rU) was two nucleotides per nucleic acid-binding site (30Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7390-7396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HCV helicase forms spectrofluorometrically detectable intermediates with DNA (19Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that react with ATP. The kinetic competence of the intermediates formed from the reaction of E·DNA with ATP or “E·ATP” with DNA was evaluated from pre-steady-state and steady-state data. In summary, the intermediates associated with these fluorescent changes were catalytically incompetent. These results suggested either the fluorescent changes were monitoring a catalytically inactive ATP-binding site with a fluorescently silent catalytically active site or the first cycle of interaction of enzyme with ATP was unique relative to subsequent cycles of ATP hydrolysis. Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase, NADH, ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, and MOPS were from Sigma. HF16 and the 16-mer from Oligo Therapeutics, Inc., were purified by electrophoresis through 20% polyacrylamide gels in 6m urea. Oligomer concentrations were calculated from the absorbance at 260 nm and the extinction coefficients provided by Oligo Therapeutics. The standard buffer was 0.5 m MOPS K+ and 3.5 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.0. HCV helicase was purified as described previously (19Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The concentration of monomer was calculated with ε280 = 88 mm−1 cm−1 (19Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). ATPase was assayed spectrophotometically by the absorbance change at 340 nm resulting from the oxidation of NADH that was coupled to the phosphorylation of ADP through pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (20Kayne F. Enzymes. 1973; 8: 353-382Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Rates were calculated using a Δε340 = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. A solution of the coupling components (40 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 40 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 8.0 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 800 μm NADH) was prepared in the standard buffer at 5 °C. This solution was diluted 4-fold with the standard buffer containing the selected concentrations of DNA and ATP. The reactions were initiated with HCV helicase. The t½ for phosphorylation of 5 μm ADP in this assay was 3 s. The measured rate of ATP hydrolysis was not affected by decreasing the standard concentration of the coupling enzymes NADH and phosphoenolpyruvate by 50%. Titration of helicase (E) with a ligand (L) was monitored by quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence or by quenching of fluorescence of hexachlorofluoresceinyl-labeled DNA upon formation of the enzyme-ligand complex (E·L). It was assumed that this process could be described by the simplified mechanism of Equation 1, where Kwas the dissociation constant of E for L, [E t] was the concentration of enzyme sites binding ligand, and [Lt] was the concentration of ligand. E+L ⇋K ELEquation 1 Furthermore, it was assumed that the fractional fluorescence (F([L]t)) remaining was related to the total concentration of added ligand sites ([Lt]) by Equation 2 in which ΔF ∞ was the fractional fluorescence decrease resulting from conversion of E toE·L. F([L] t)=1−ΔF∞ [E·L][Et]Equation 2 Because the concentration of enzyme was in many cases comparable to the dissociation constant of the enzyme for L, the concentration ofE·L for the simple scheme of Equation 1 was related to [Lt] by Equation 3. [E·L]=[Lt]+[Et]+K2−12 ([Lt]+[Et]+K) 2−4[Et][Lt]Equation 3 During the titration of E with the 16-mer, which was monitored by the quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence (λex = 280 nm and λem = 340 nm), there was significant drift in the fluorescence signal. This was corrected for by a blank titration in which the experimental signal obtained after addition of the 16-mer to the enzyme was normalized to that observed after addition of an equivalent volume of buffer to the enzyme. The time between additions of sample to the protein was 30 s. The dependence of the rate of ATP hydrolysis by HCV helicase on ATP, HF16, and the 16-mer concentrations was complicated. Equation 4 for a random rapid equilibrium scheme in which two molecules of ATP and one molecule of DNA bound to helicase described these data. The parameter of interest for these studies was k cat, which was relatively independent of the model fitted to the data. The substrate coefficients in Equation 4 were not used in the present studies. vEt=kcat[ATP] 2[DNA]+N1[ATP][DNA]+N2[ATP] 2+N3[ATP][ATP] 2[DNA]+D0+D1[ATP][DNA]+D2[ATP] 2+D3[DNA]+D4[ATP]Equation 4 The time courses for fluorescence changes were described by exponential functions (Equation 5). F(t)=F0+∑i=1n Fie(−ki·t)Equation 5 Where F(t) was the observed signal at time equal to t, F i was the respective amplitude of the phase associated with k i.F 0 was the final value of the fluorescence. The reaction of ligand (L) with enzyme was described by the two-step mechanism of Equation 6. For this mechanism, the dependence of the observed rate constant (k obs) on ligand concentration ([L]) was given by Equation 7. E+L ⇌K EL*⇌k−2k2 ELEquation 6 kobs([L])=k−2+k2[L](K+[L])Equation 7 ΔF([L])=ΔF∞[L]K k−2(k2+k−2)+[L]Equation 8 Where k obs([L]) was the value ofk obs for the indicated concentration of L;k −2 was the first-order rate constant at zero concentration of L; the sum of k 2 andk −2 was the first-order rate constant at infinite ligand concentration; and K was the concentration of L such that k obs =k −2 + 0.5k 2. ΔF([L]) was the amplitude of the fluorescence change as a function of [L] and ΔF ∞ was the maximal signal change. Equations 7 and 8 were fitted to the amplitude data and the kinetic data globally to yield estimates for K, K −2, k 2, and ΔF ∞. If the value of K was much greater than the concentrations of L, Equation 7 was approximated by Equation 9. kobs([L])=k−2+k2K [L]Equation 9 If L were a substrate for the enzyme, Equation 6 was modified to include an additional step (k cat) for the return of EL to E. In this modified scheme, thek −2 term in Equations Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9 would be the sum ofk −2 and k cat(k −2,obs). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Kontron SFM 25 spectrofluorometer. Intrinsic protein fluorescence data (λex = 280–300 nm, tryptophanyl and tyrosinyl residues, λem = 340 nm) were corrected for inner and outer filter effects. Fluorescence of HF16 was monitored with λex = 510 nm and λem = 550 nm. Absorbance and conventional kinetic data were obtained from a UVIKON 860 spectrophotometer at 25 °C or from a Spectramax 250 plate reader at 21 °C. Rapid reactions were monitored on an Applied Photophysics SX.17MV Spectrophotometer (Leatherhead, UK). All concentrations of reactants are given after mixing on the stopped-flow spectrofluorometer. Entrance and exit slits were 10 mm in the absorbance mode and 2 mm in the fluorescence mode. The fluorescence of the hexachlorofluoresceinyl moiety was monitored on the stopped-flow spectrofluorometer with λex = 500 nm and λex >530 nm. Intrinsic protein fluorescence was monitored with λex = 280–290 nm and λem >305 nm. Stopped-flow time courses were an average of 4–6 experiments. Fluorescence data from the stopped-flow spectrophotometer were presented as the voltage change from the beginning of the reaction. These changes were not normalized to the initial fluorescence of the solution because the solutions contained varying amounts of HF16 that were in excess of enzyme. For a group of experiments associated with a particular figure, the photomultiplier voltage was held constant. However, the magnitude of the voltage changes should not be compared between groups of experiments, only the voltage changes associated with a single group of experiments should be compared. The appropriate equations were fitted to the data by nonlinear least squares using SigmaPlot from Jandel Scientific (Corte Madera, CA). The goal of the studies described herein was to determine if the formation of spectrally observed intermediates was a step in the steady-state catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis by HCV helicase. The criteria for kinetic competence of an intermediate in the catalytic cycle was that the value of the limiting first-order rate constant for the approach to the steady-state was at least 4-fold greater than thek cat for ATP hydrolysis. 2The first-order rate constant for the approach of an enzymatic intermediate on the catalytic pathway to a steady-state value must be minimally 4 times larger thank cat. Considering the simple scheme of Equation 10 in which formation and breakdown of the catalytic intermediate (EP) was described by k and αk, respectively. At saturating substrate concentration, the pseudo first-order rate constant for approach to the steady-state (k obs) and k cat are given by Equations 11 and12. kobs=k+αkEquation 11 kcat=αk(α+1)Equation 12 The expression of k obs in terms of α and k cat is given by Equation 13. kobs=(α2+2α+1)kcatαEquation 13 The minimal value of k obs for a given value of k cat can be shown by elementary calculus to occur with α = 1. Substituting this value for α into Equation 13 demonstrated that the minimal value ofk obs was 4 ×k cat. Thus, the value of k cat was the number of importance determined from steady-state rate data. The value fork cat for ATP hydrolysis by HCV helicase is dependent on the single-stranded DNA effector. For example (dU)18 increased the value of k cat30-fold (19Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). With HF16 as the DNA effector, the ATPase activity of the enzyme was inhibited at small ATP concentrations and enhanced at large ATP concentrations (Fig. 1). The complex concentration dependence of the initial rate data was adequately described by Equation 4 with k cat = 2.73 ± 0.09 s−1 for HF16. The k cat for the 16-mer was calculated to be 36 ± 7 s−1 from an analogous data set. The rate of hydrolysis of 1.6 mm ATP in the presence of 1.4 μm HF16 (data not shown) was linearly dependent on enzyme concentrations between 1 and 60 nm. This result indicated that the value of k cat was independent of enzyme concentration so that it was valid to comparek cat values with kinetic parameters determined at different enzyme concentrations. The values for theK m of the enzyme for ATP at near-saturating concentrations of HF16 (1600 nm) and the 16-mer (6000 nm) were determined to be 320 ± 50 and 410 ± 20 μm, respectively. The binding of HCV helicase to HF16 was monitored by the quenching of HF16 fluorescence upon formation of E·HF16. Titration of 22.4 nm HF16 with HCV helicase (Fig.2) was described by Equations 2 and 3(L = HF16) with K = 0.48 ± 0.02 nm and ΔF ∞ = 0.457 ± 0.006. Quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence monitored the binding of HCV helicase to the 16-mer. Titration of 33.5 nmE (Fig. 2, inset) was described by Equations 2 and 3 (L = 16-mer) with K = 2.2 ± 0.4 nm and ΔF ∞ = 0.377 ± 0.006. Because the concentration of the fixed ligand was many fold greater than theK d for dissociation of E·DNA, the calculated values for K d were associated with considerable error. Nonetheless, these estimates for the values ofK d were similar to the estimate values calculated from bimolecular association rate constants and dissociation rate constants (see below). The time course for quenching of the fluorescence of HF16 by HCV helicase was a first-order process (Fig.3, inset). The pseudo first-order rate constant for this process (k obs) was linearly dependent on the concentration of HF16 with [HF16] > [E] (Fig. 3). These data indicated that the K d for formation of the initial complex between E and HF16 (Equation 6) was much greater than the highest concentration of HF16 tested. Consequently, Equation 9 was fitted to these data to estimate a value for the apparent bimolecular rate constant for association of HCV helicase with HF16 (k 2/K d in Equation 9with k −2 = 0) of 640 ± 20 μm−1 s−1. The reaction of the 16-mer with HCV helicase was monitored by the quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence upon formation of E·16. The pseudo first-order rate constant for this reaction was also linearly dependent on the concentration of the 16-mer yielding an analogous bimolecular rate constant of 99 ± 2 μm−1 s−1. The dependence of the pseudo first-order rate constant for the reaction of HF16 with HCV helicase appeared to extrapolate to a small value (Fig. 3, ordinate intercept) at zero concentration of HF16. This result suggested that the rate constant describing the dissociation of E·HF16 (k −2 in Equation 9) was very small. A direct measure of the dissociation ofE·HF16 was made by monitoring the associated increase in fluorescence of HF16 (λex = 500 nm, λem>530 nm) upon release from the enzyme in the presence of excess dextran sulfate that trapped free HCV helicase (Equation 14). The fluorescence (λex = 500 nm, λem>530 nm) of a solution of 13.2 nm E and 18.8 nm HF16 increased in a first-order process (k obs) upon addition of 2.0 mmdextran sulfate. k obs had a value of 0.087 ± 0.001 s−1 with 2.0 mm dextran sulfate and a similar value (0.109 ± 0.001 s−1) with 0.4 mm dextran sulfate. Because k obs was similar for two dextran sulfate concentrations, this value was assigned to the dissociation rate constant (k −2) forE·HF16. Similar experiments with E·16 (λex = 280 nm, λem >305 nm) yielded a value for k −2 of 0.096 ± 0.009 s−1. The apparent dissociation constants (K) of E for HF16 and the 16-mer were calculated from the relationshipK ∼K d k −2/k 2, where k −2 was the effective rate constant for dissociation of E·HF16, andk 2/K d was the effective association rate constant for reaction of HCV helicase and HF16 (Equation 6, L = HF16). The values of K for HCV helicase and HF16 and the 16-mer were calculated from the kinetic data to be 0.14 and 1.0 nm, respectively, which were in reasonable agreement with the values estimated from titration data (0.48 and 2.2 nm, respectively). The time courses for the approach to the steady-state starting with 2.0 mm ATP, 13.2 nm E·ATP, and selected concentrations of HF16 were first-order processes (k obs). The dependence ofk obs on HF16 concentration was described by Equations 7 and 8 with k −2,obs = 0.37 ± 0.02 s−1, k 2 = 1.2 ± 0.2 s−1, K = 240 ± 70 nm, and ΔF ∞ = 0.40 ± 0.03 V (Fig.4). Similarly, the approach to the steady-state starting with 50 nm E·ATP and selected concentrations of the 16-mer was a first-order processes. Because the highest concentration of the 16-mer was significantly less than the K d for the reaction, Equation 9 was fitted to the data with k −2,obs = 2.0 ± 0.1 s−1, k 2/K d = 0.41 ± 0.01 μm−1 s−1. The dissociation constant of the enzyme for HF16 was increased over 100-fold by ATP (compare data of Fig. 2 with that of Fig. 4,inset). Consequently, mixing ATP with a solution ofE·HF16 ([HF16] < [K HF16]) should result in the partial dissociation of HF16 fromE·ATP as depicted in Equation 15. The release of HF16 from the enzyme was monitored by the associated increase in fluorescence of HF16 (λex = 500 nm, λem >530 nm). The approach to the steady-state upon addition of 1.0 mm ATP to 9.3 nm E·HF16 that was generated from 9.3 nm helicase and 17.7 nm HF16 was a biphasic process that indicated that ATP bound to the E·HF16 complex to form an intermediate (“E·HF16·ATP”) from which HF16 dissociated (Fig.5). Equation 5 (i = 2) was fitted to these data to give F 0 = −0.494 ± 0.003 V, F 1 = −3.98 ± 0.2 V, k 1 = 1.01 ± 0.03 s−1,F 2 = 4.3 ± 0.2 V, andk 2 = 0.403 ± 0.008 s−1. The early phase of the reaction was attributed to formation ofE·HF16·ATP from E·HF16 and ATP, whereas the late phase of the reaction was attributed to dissociation of HF16 fromE·HF16·ATP. When dextran sulfate was added to a steady-state mixture of ATP, HCV helicase, and HF16 to trap freeE as it was cycled during catalysis, the time course for formation of free HF16 was monophasic (Fig. 5, inset). Equation 5 (i = 1) was fitted to these data withF 0 = −0.67 ± 0.002 V,F 1 = 0.067 ± 0.002 V, andk 1 = 0.341 ± 0.002 s−1. The value of the rate constant for the latter process was in good agreement with the value for the late phase of the reaction in the presence of ATP alone (0.403 s−1). ATP also induced the dissociation of E·16. The release of the 16-mer from E·16 was monitored by the associated change in intrinsic protein fluorescence (λex = 280 nm, λem >305 nm) upon formation of (E·ATP) from (E·16·ATP). The addition of 1.0 mm ATP to a solution of 50 nm E·16 generated from 50 nm E and 75 nm 16-mer resulted in a biphasic increase in fluorescence. These data (not shown) were described by Equation 5 (i = 2) withF 0 = −0.129 ± 0.001 V,F 1 = −0.83 ± 0.07 V,k 1 = 2.34 ± 0.05 s−1,F 2 = 1.08 ± 0.07 V, andk 2 = 1.70 ± 0.02 s−1. The early phase of the reaction was attributed to formation ofE·16·ATP from E·16 and ATP, whereas the late phase of the reaction was attributed to dissociation of the 16-mer from E·16·ATP. The previous results indicated that the reaction of E·HF16 with ATP to form E·HF16·ATP was associated with a fluorescence decrease (Fig.6 A). Because the concentration of HF16 in these experiments was less than the dissociation constant ofE·ATP for HF16, E·HF16·ATP partially dissociated to E·ATP and HF16. The dissociation phase of the reaction was eliminated by including high concentrations of HF16 in the reaction. Thus, the reaction of 2.0 mm ATP with 50 nm E·HF16, which was generated by premixing 50 nm E with 492 nm HF16, was a first-order process (Fig. 6 A). Equation 5 (i = 1) was fitted to these data with F 0 = 0.262 ± 0.01 V, F 1 = −0.262 ± 0.001 V, andk 1 = 1.67 ± 0.03 s−1. This rate constant described the approach to the steady-state after mixingE·HF16 with ATP. The values of pseudo first-order rate constant (k obs) and the amplitudes of the fluorescence change for this reaction were determined for selected ATP concentrations (Fig. 6 B). Equations 7 and 8 were fitted to these data with K = 121 ± 7 μm,k 2 = 1.82 ± 0.03 s−1,k −2,obs = 0.05 ± 0.01 s−1, and ΔF ∞ = 0.29 ± 0.01 V. IfE·ATP·HF16 were a catalytic intermediate in ATP steady-state ATP hydrolysis as depicted in Equation 15, the value ofk −2,obs should have been the sum ofk −2 and k cat. A data set similar to that for E·ATP and HF16 was collected for the reaction of E·ATP with the 16-mer.E·16 was generated by premixing 50 nm E with 12 μm 16-mer. Addition of 1.0 mm ATP resulted in a first-order increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence (data not shown). Equation 5 (i = 1) was fitted to these data with F 0 = 0.109 ± 0.002 V, F 1 = −0.109 ± 0.002 V, andk 1 = 2.55 ± 0.07 s−1. The values of pseudo first-order rate constant (k obs) and the amplitudes of the fluorescence change for this reaction were determined for selected ATP concentrations. Equations 7 and 8 were fitted to these data withK = 170 ± 20 μm,k 2 = 2.9 ± 0.2 s−1,k −2,obs = 0.49 ± 0.06 s−1, and ΔF ∞ = 0.104 ± 0.004 V.

The mechanisms for the unwinding reaction are being actively investigated in numerous laboratories (2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev.

Recent mechanistic studies on E. coli Rep helicase are forming the basis for a detailed understanding of the kinetic mechanism for DNA unwinding by a helicase (2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Lohman (6Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has classified the mechanism for helicase action as being either “active or ”passive.“ In a passive type mechanism, the enzyme binds preferentially to single-stranded DNA and unwinds double-stranded DNA by binding to single-stranded DNA that is formed transiently from the duplex as the result of thermal fluctuations. In contrast, an active mechanism requires that the enzyme bind to both double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA, and the enzyme destabilizes multiple base pairs during each catalytic step. This mechanism requires that the enzyme have multiple DNA-binding sites either on the same subunit or as an oligomeric protein. During catalysis, one DNA-binding site alternatively binds double-stranded and single-stranded DNA as the enzyme rolls along the double-stranded DNA. Whichever mechanism is operative for unwinding of double-stranded DNA, the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to translocation is crucial for the unwinding process. The coupling of ATP hydrolysis to conformational transitions of other domains in members of helicase superfamily I is being investigated by site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acids in each of the six motifs. For example, E. coli helicase II mutants D248N, K35M, and R284A greatly reduced the single-stranded DNA-stimulated ATPase activity (25Hall M. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18614-18620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently, site-specific substitutions in each of the six motifs of HSV helicase (superfamily 1) produced large effects when in motifs I and II and small effects when in motifs III–VI on DNA-dependent ATPase activity (28Graves-Woodward K.L. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4623-4630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To supplement these studies, our goal was to characterize the single-stranded DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of HCV helicase by steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic techniques. In particular, the kinetic competence of spectrofluorometrically observed intermediates was determined. HCV helicase quenched the fluorescence of HF16, whereas HF16 and the 16-mer quenched the intrinsic protein fluorescence. The kinetics for formation of these intermediates with modified fluorescence properties were compared with the values fork cat for ATP hydrolysis to decide whether or not the intermediates were kinetically competent for catalysis of ATP hydrolysis. The dissociation of DNA from the enzyme in the presence of ATP was too slow for this process to be an obligatory step in the catalytic cycle. The rate constants for dissociation of E·HF16 andE·16 in the presence of 2.0 mm ATP were 0.341 s−1 and 1.70 s−1, respectively, whereas the values of k cat were 2.73 and 36 s−1, respectively. Because DNA dissociated fromE·DNA infrequently during the catalytic cycle, the enzyme cycled primarily between E·DNA andE·DNA·ATP during ATP hydrolysis. IfE·DNA·ATP were on the pathway for hydrolysis of ATP, the pseudo first-order rate constant for the approach to the steady-state starting with E·DNA and a saturating concentration of ATP must be at least 4-fold greater than the value ofk cat.2 Furthermore, the concentration of ATP that resulted in 50% of the maximal amount of this intermediate must be greater than or equal to theK m for ATP. These conditions were not met by the pre-steady-state intermediate formed from E·DNA and ATP. For instance, the maximal value for the first-order rate constant for the approach to the steady-state concentration ofE·HF16·ATP starting with E·HF16 and ATP was 1.82 s−1, whereas k cat was 2.73 s−1. The minimal value for the rate constant for approach to the steady state at saturating concentration of ATP has to be 10.9 s−1 for this process to be on the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, the concentration of ATP that yielded 50% of the maximal amount of the intermediate for a saturating concentration of HF16 should be equal to the K m for the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis. The value of K m for the ATP at saturating concentrations of HF16 was 320 μm, whereas the concentration of ATP that yield 50% of the intermediate was only 3 μm. Thus, formation of this intermediate was not a competent step in the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis. These results suggested either that the formation ofE·DNA·ATP occurred independently of and was unrelated to the catalytic process or that formation of this species introduced the active form of the enzyme into the catalytic cycle. If the latter were the case, an isomerization step could be included in the kinetic mechanism such that reaction of enzyme with the first molecule of ATP was different than its reaction with subsequent molecules of ATP (Scheme I). In this model, steady-state ATP hydrolysis was mediated principally through cycling of 0HF16 (Scheme I), whereas the reaction monitored on the stopped-flow spectrofluorometer was conversion of E HF16 to 0HF16. These data have not addressed the fate of ATP in the conversion of E HF16 to 0HF16. Possibly a structural isomerization dependent on phosphorylation of the enzyme was involved that transformed inactive enzyme into a catalytically active form. If this were the case, formation of 0HF16 and its reversion to E HF16(<0.05 s−1 in Scheme I) could involve net hydrolysis of ATP. The data presented herein for hydrolysis of ATP by E·HF31 suggested that the first cycle of interaction of ATP withE·HF31 was unique relative to subsequent cycles of interaction of the enzyme with ATP. This concept has been suggested for other DNA unwinding proteins such as the E. coli Rep helicase and the E. coli Rec A protein. For Rep helicase, the approach to the steady state for the reaction of 1.0 mmATP with enzyme preloaded with 2-aminopurine-labeled dT(pT)15 appeared to be too slow for the formation of ternary complex to be a kinetically competent step during ATP hydrolysis (10Bjornson K.P. Wong I. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Wong and Lohman (14Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have suggested from studies on the K28I mutant of Rep helicase that a global conformation change of the protein occurs prior to the first turnover. Similar results have been described for a mutant E. coli Rec A protein (H163W) that catalyzed single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase. The fluorescence of the H163W protein was used to monitor conformational changes occurring during ATP hydrolysis (29Stole E. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The first cycle of interaction of the mutant protein with ATP was too slow to be on the catalytic pathway. Consequently, Stole and Bryant (29Stole E. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) proposed an isomerization model similar to that described in Scheme I. The steady-state hydrolysis of ATP by these DNA unwinding proteins was preceded by a unique isomerization of the initial ternary enzyme-DNA-ATP complex that may be a general phenomenon for all DNA unwinding proteins.

Inhibitors of these enzymes are medically important antidepressants, but the rational design of new inhibitor drugs is hampered by the lack of the active site structure and by remaining controversies in the catalytic mechanism.

In the chemical mechanism, there is still controversy about whether MAO-catalyzed oxidative deamination proceeds via a radical mechanism, hydride transfer, or oxidation of a carbanion intermediate. In the most extensively tested hypothesis (11Silverman R.B. Acc. Chem. Res. 1995; 28: 335-342Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the transfer of one electron from the amine to the enzyme (presumably to the flavin) is followed by the cleavage of the α-carbon-hydrogen bond to produce the amino radical. The substrate radical either passes a second electron to the flavin or combines with an unknown active site radical to give a covalent adduct that decomposes to the imine. However, no flavosemiquinone has ever been detected in the catalytic cycle (12Husain M. Edmondson D.E. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Tan A.K. Ramsay R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Yue K.T.

Soc. 1995; 117: 7830-7831Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When flavosemiquinone is generated by reduction with dithionite, the weak epr signal observed (about half that expected) suggested that there might be coupling of FAD radical with an unknown protein radical (14Yue K.T. Bhattacharyya A.K. Zhelyaskov V.R. Edmondson D.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). If such a putative non-FAD radical can be generated by reduction by dithionite, the number of electrons required to reduce the enzyme should be more than the two necessary for the FAD alone. The data presented in this paper demonstrate the presence of a second redox-active group in addition to the flavin in the active site of MAO. Human liver MAO A heterologously expressed in yeast and MAO B from beef liver were purified as previously reported (16Weyler W. Titlow C.C. Salach J.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The concentration of each sample was determined from the oxidized minus reduced extinction coefficient at 456 nm of 10,800 m−1 cm−1 for MAO A and 10,300 m−1 cm−1 for MAO B. Enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically using kynuramine (1 mm) for MAO A and benzylamine (3 mm) for MAO B. Kynuramine dihydrobromide, benzylamine, andd-amphetamine hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma. 4,4′-Dipyridyl disulfide (DPDS) (Aldrich) was recrystallized once from ethanol. All the experiments were carried out at 20 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.01% Brij-35. 4,4′-Dithio(bispyridine)-modified MAO A and MAO B were prepared by incubation of 10–15 μm of the enzyme with 50 μm DPDS. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken at intervals to measure the remaining enzyme activity. When the enzyme sample was inactivated by more than 95%, it was transferred into the anaerobic cuvette for dithionite titration. The titrations with sodium dithionite were carried out in a custom-made quartz anaerobic cuvette with a side arm, in an atmosphere of high purity argon. Dithionite standardized by titration of riboflavin was added via a gas-tight syringe attached to the cuvette. The spectra were recorded in a Shimadzu UV-2101PC spectrophotometer. Human liver MAO A was made anaerobic by equilibration with argon and titrated with standardized dithionite to count the electrons required for full reduction of flavin cofactor. Fig. 1 shows the spectral changes occurring during the anaerobic titration with dithionite. Theinset to Fig. 1 shows the changes in absorbance at 412 nm where the flavosemiquinone absorbs strongly and at 456 nm, the wavelength where bleaching is observed for both the one-electron reduction steps of a typical flavin. Full reduction required 2.0 ± 0.12 mol (n = 5) of dithionite per mol of flavin which is four electron equivalents (Fig. 1, inset), two more than expected for a flavin alone. The final spectrum was typical of the fully reduced enzyme (5Weyler W. Salach J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13199-13207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that there is a redox-active functional group in the active site of MAO in close proximity to flavin, which (i) interacts with the flavin resulting in some stabilization of the flavosemiquinone, (ii) has a redox potential close to that for the flavin, so that both the flavin and this group are reduced simultaneously, and (iii) is able to accept two extra electrons upon the dithionite titration. The likely candidate for this group is a disulfide, because cysteines are known to be essential for the activity of MAO. The potential for the cysteine-cystine redox couple is −220 mV (18Jocelyn P.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 2: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), close to that for FAD (−208 mV (19Draper R. Ingraham L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar)) and to that for MAO A (−210 mV) and MAO B (−220 mV) (20Ramsay R.R. Sablin S.O. Singer T.P. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and disulfide can be reduced by dithionite. Finally, there is an established precedent for flavin-dithiol interaction in the active sites of enzymes in the disulfide oxidoreductase family (21Schultz G.E. Bray R.C. Engel P.C. Mayhew S.G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, New York1984: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar). The sulfhydryl reagent, 4,4′-dipyridyl disulfide, is known to inactivate MAO A and B with the liberation of 2 mol of 2-thiopyridone per mol of enzyme inactivated, indicating that 2 thiols have been modified (5Weyler W. Salach J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13199-13207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).d-Amphetamine, a competitive inhibitor, protects against the inactivation, suggesting that the groups modified are located in the active site of the enzyme. We confirmed these observations using DPDS. Inactivation of MAO A was biphasic (data not shown), with second order rate constants of 34 ± 3 m−1s−1 and 19 ± 3 m−1s−1, for the fast and the slow phases, respectively, similar to those reported earlier for MAO A from human placenta (5Weyler W. Salach J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13199-13207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivation of MAO B was monophasic, with a rate constant of 32 ± 2 m−1 s−1. However, other sulfhydryl reagents, such as p-iodoacetamide incubated with MAO A for 2 h at 1 mm concentration or arsenite (which reacts with two free thiols in close proximity), neither inhibited the activity nor decreased the amount of dithionite required to fully reduce MAO, indicating that there is no thiol in close proximity to the flavin cofactor susceptible to arsenite or iodoacetamide in MAO. The dithionite titration of the DPDS-modified enzyme is shown in Fig.2. Clearly, there was no stable formation of semiquinone, as shown by the lack of an increase in the absorbance at 412 nm. It took a total of two electron equivalents to fully reduce the enzyme (Fig. 2, inset), the same as expected for flavin alone. Apparently, there is no interaction between the second redox group and flavin cofactor or the second redox group cannot be reduced in the modified enzyme. β-Mercaptoethanol, which reduces disulfides, inhibited MAO A (in agreement with Ref. 22Silverman R.B. Yamasaki R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1322-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The concentration required for 50% inhibition after 15 min in aerobic solution was 0.25m. The inhibition was fully reversible by dilution. Incubation of MAO A with β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm) under anaerobic conditions resulted in the reduction of the flavin cofactor. When oxygen is added to the reaction mixture containing reduced enzyme and β-mercaptoethanol, the flavin is reoxidized instantly. No reduction of free riboflavin was observed under the same conditions. This cannot be attributed to the difference in the redox potential between the free flavin in solution and the flavin in MAO because these are similar (19Draper R. Ingraham L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 20Ramsay R.R. Sablin S.O. Singer T.P. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We speculate that β-mercaptoethanol reduces the active site disulfide, which, in turn, reduces the cofactor. Reductive titration of MAO A in the presence of the inhibitor (or pseudo-substrate), d-amphetamine (Fig.3), gave completely different results from those obtained for the free native enzyme. It took two electron equivalents to reach the maximum absorbance at 412 nm, indicating the maximum formation of the semiquinone. No further significant spectral changes were observed even after the addition of more than eight electron equivalents and the incubation of the enzyme with dithionite for 5 h. There is no obvious explanation for why only the semiquinone of MAO is formed in the presence ofd-amphetamine. Amphetamine does not alter significantly the redox potential for the one-electron reduction of MAO A (20Ramsay R.R. Sablin S.O. Singer T.P. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), yet the presence of the inhibitor in the active site prevented further reduction of flavin. Consistent with the inhibition of reduction is the previous observation that d-amphetamine prevented reoxidation of pre-reduced MAO A (23Ramsay R.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4624-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The reductive titration of MAO B (not shown) gave results identical with those for MAO A (Figs. 1 and2). Four electron equivalents were required to reduce the native enzyme and two after treatment with DPDS. The redox stoichiometry for both MAO A and B is confirmed by the slopes of plots relating equilibrium concentrations of the enzyme and the reporter dye in redox potential measurements (20Ramsay R.R. Sablin S.O. Singer T.P. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 106: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The slopes for the enzyme alone were twice that expected (implying that 4 eq were required for full reduction, as demonstrated directly here) whereas those for the enzyme-substrate complex indicated the expected 2 equivalents. The data reported here suggest that MAO contains a redox-active disulfide in the active site and, therefore, may be a new type of disulfide oxidoreductase. We speculate that when an amine is oxidized, electrons pass from the amine to the disulfide and then to the flavin. The formation in MAO of a carboxyl-imidazole-disulfide triad, similar to that demonstrated for disulfide oxidoreductases, would result in an increased positive charge on the disulfide which would facilitate electron transfer from the amine substrate. Similarities with the disulfide oxidoreductase family of enzymes, which includes glutathione oxidoreductase, lipoamide dehydrogenase, and thioredoxin reductase, may be useful in elucidating the mechanism. However, although there are structural analogies between the N-terminal region of MAO and the nucleotide binding region of lipoamide dehydrogenase (24Wouters J. Ramsay R.R. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Brasseur R. Durant F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the dithiol sequence motif common to the disulfide oxidoreductase family (25Williams Jr., C.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) is not found in MAO."
https://openalex.org/W1968201351,"The pH dependence of the redox potentials for the oxidized/reduced couples of methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) and aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH) were determined. For each enzyme, a change of −30 mV/pH unit was observed, indicating that the two-electron transfer is linked to the transfer of a single proton. This result differs from what was obtained from redox studies of a tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) model compound for which the two-electron couple is linked to the transfer of two protons. This result also distinguishes the redox properties of the enzyme-bound TTQ from those of the membrane-bound quinone components of respiratory and photosynthetic electron transfer chains that transfer two protons per two electrons. This difference is attributed to the accessibility of TTQ to solvent in the enzymes. One of the quinol hydroxyls is shielded from solvent and thus is not protonated. The unusual property of TTQ enzymes of stabilizing the anionic form of the reduced quinol is important for the reaction mechanism of MADH because it allows stabilization of physiologically important reaction intermediates. Examination of the extent to which disproportionation of the MADH and AADH semiquinones occurred as a function of pH revealed that the equilibrium concentration of semiquinone increased with pH. This indicates that the proton transfer is linked to the semiquinone/quinol couple. Therefore, the quinol is singly protonated, and the semiquinone is unprotonated and anionic. It was also shown that the oxidation-reduction midpoint potential for AADH is 20 mV less positive than that of MADH over the range of pH values that was studied and that the TTQ semiquinone of AADH was less stable than that of MADH. This may be explained by differences in the active site environments of the two enzymes, which modulate their respective redox properties.

Redox reactions involving proteins are ubiquitous processes that are fundamental to respiration, photosynthesis, and reactions of intermediary metabolism. Enzyme-bound quinones and flavins are important cofactors of oxidoreductases that function in biological catalysis and electron transfer. These prosthetic groups, as well as membrane-bound components of respiratory electron transfer chains, are particularly important because they are able to couple the two-electron oxidation of substrates to single electron carriers during metabolism and respiration. Methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH; reviewed in Ref. 1Davidson V.L. Davidson V.L. Principles and Applications of Quinoproteins.

MADH is CH3NH2+H2O→CH2O+NH3+2e−+2H+ REACTION 1an H2L2 heterotetramer with subunit molecular masses of 47 and 15 kDa. The tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ; Fig. 1) (2McIntire W.S. Wemmer D.E. Christoserdov A.Y. Lindstrom M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) prosthetic group, which is located on each small subunit, is derived from two tryptophan side chains that are covalently cross-linked and contain an orthoquinone function through a post-translational modification. In autotrophic bacteria, such as Paracoccus denitrificans, the substrate-derived electrons are subsequently passed to a type I copper protein, amicyanin (3Husain M. Davidson V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14626-14629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), then to one or more c-type cytochromes (4Husain M. Davidson V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8577-8580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and finally to a membrane-bound cytochrome oxidase. The crystal structure of a ternary complex of MADH, amicyanin, and cytochrome c-551i from P. denitrificans has been determined (5Chen L. Durley R. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Science. 1994; 264: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The second TTQ-dependent enzyme to be characterized thus far is aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH) fromAlcaligenes faecalis (6Iwaki M. Yagi T. Horiike K. Saeki Y. Ushijima T. Nozaki M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 220: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Govindaraj S. Eisenstein E. Jones L.H. Sanders-Loehr J. Chistoserdov A.Y. Davidson V.L. Edwards S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It catalyzes the same reaction shown as Reaction 1, except that its preferred substrate is not methylamine but rather phenylethylamines. Like MADH, AADH uses a type 1 copper protein, in this case azurin, as an electron acceptor (8Edwards S.L. Davidson V.L. Hyun Y.-L. Wingfield P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4293-4298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Hyun Y.-L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These enzymes are members of a newly characterized class of primarily soluble enzymes, referred to as quinoproteins or quinoenzymes (1Davidson V.L. Davidson V.L. Principles and Applications of Quinoproteins. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 73-95Google Scholar, 10Klinman J.P. Mu D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 299-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar,11Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which utilize covalently or tightly bound quinones as prosthetic groups. That TTQ-dependent enzymes donate electrons to another protein that is a one-electron carrier is of interest for two reasons. (i) This requires that the oxidative half-reaction proceeds via a semiquinone intermediate. This means that electron transfer from TTQ to copper occurs from two different redox states of TTQ during the catalytic cycle. (ii) The electron acceptors for most oxidoreductases use small molecules such as NAD+ or O2. When these electron acceptors are present at the active site of the enzyme, it is possible to directly transfer protons, as well as electrons, from substrate or cofactor to acceptor. This cannot occur in these quinoproteins. Their electron acceptors are other proteins that cannot diffuse into the enzyme active site. The electron acceptors for MADH and AADH are reduced by long range electron transfer. Thus, protons and electrons cannot be transferred together. This raises questions as to the protonation states of the reduced and semiquinone forms of the TTQ cofactor during the catalytic cycle and the fate of the substrate-derived protons. It also suggests functional similarities with membrane-bound quinones in the respiratory chain, such as ubiquinone, which must also separate electron and proton transfer as a part of their physiologic redox reaction (12Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although much is known about the structure and reactivity of MADH, relatively little is known about its redox properties. The oxidation-reduction midpoint potential (E m) value for the two-electron oxidized/reduced redox couple of P. denitrificans MADH was determined to be +100 mV at pH 7.5 (14Husain M. Davidson V.L. Gray K.A. Knaff D.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4139-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A similar value was reported for MADH from bacterium W3A1 (15Burrows A.L. Hill H.A.O. Leese T.A. McIntire W.A. Nakayama H. Sanghera G.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, the redox properties of a TTQ model compound were reported (16Itoh S. Ogino M. Haranou S. Terasaka T. Ando T. Komatsu M. Oshiro Y. Fukuzumi S. Kano K. Takagi K. Ikeda T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 1485-1493Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It exhibited an E m value similar to that of MADH at pH 7.5. The E m value of the model compound was pH-dependent, and it was shown that two protons were transferred per two electrons during the conversion from fully oxidized to fully reduced. In this paper, we report for the first time the pH dependence of the redox potential for a quinoprotein. The E mvalues for the oxidized/reduced couples of MADH and AADH were each determined over a range of pH values, and the E mvalue of each enzyme exhibited a pH dependence different than that of the TTQ model compound and different from that which is typically observed for biologically active free and membrane-associated quinones. The relative dependence on pH of the one-electron oxidized/semiquinone and semiquinone/reduced couples of MADH and AADH was determined by examining the extent to which disproportionation of each semiquinone occurred as a function of pH. This allowed determination of the protonation states of the TTQ quinol and semiquinone in MADH and AADH. Differences in the redox properties of the protein-bound TTQ and the TTQ model compound and other biogenic quinones are explained by correlation with the crystal structure of MADH (17Chen L. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Huizinga E. Vellieux F.M.D. Duine J.A. Hol W.G.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Chen L. Doi M. Durley R.C.E. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lindstrom M.E. Davidson V.L. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The relevance of these findings to the reaction mechanisms of MADH and AADH is discussed. Comparison of the redox properties of MADH and AADH has also allowed us to infer that differences in the active site structures of the two enzymes further modulates their respective redox properties. Amicyanin (3Husain M. Davidson V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14626-14629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MADH (19Davidson V.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were purified from P. denitrificans (ATCC 13543) as described previously. MADH and amicyanin concentrations were calculated from known extinction coefficients (3Husain M. Davidson V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14626-14629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Husain M. Davidson V.L. Gray K.A. Knaff D.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4139-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The extinction coefficients of the different redox forms of MADH vary with pH (20Zhu Z. Davidson V.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 162-175Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and ionic composition of the buffer (21Kuusk V. McIntire W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26136-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purifications of AADH (7Govindaraj S. Eisenstein E. Jones L.H. Sanders-Loehr J. Chistoserdov A.Y. Davidson V.L. Edwards S.L.

Biol. 1988; 203: 1071-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) from A. faecalis (IFO 14479) were as described previously, and protein concentrations were calculated from previously determined extinction coefficients (7Govindaraj S.

Biochem. 1981; 120: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All reagents were obtained from Sigma. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Milton Roy Spectronic 3000 Array spectrophotometer. Redox titrations were performed at 25 °C in either 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer or 10 mm BisTris-propane buffer. All E m values are reported relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Control experiments indicated that the choice of buffer did not affect the experimentally determinedE m values. During redox titrations of MADH and AADH, phenazine methosulfate (PMS) was used to monitor the ambient redox potential. PMS is an ideal choice, because itsE m value is similar to that of MADH and AADH and because the absorption spectra of the oxidized and reduced forms of PMS are distinct and exhibit minimal overlap with the spectra of oxidized and reduced MADH and AADH (Fig.2 A). Given these absolute spectra, it was possible to deconvolute the spectra of mixtures of different redox forms of PMS and either MADH or AADH and to determine the concentration of each species (discussed under “Results”). Ratios of MADHox/MADHred and AADHox/AADHred were calculated so that theE m value could be determined from plots ofE versus log(ox/red) at each pH. The ambient potential was calculated from the ratios of PMSox/PMSred. The E mvalue for PMS is +80 mV at pH 7.0 and 25 °C, and it varies by 29.7 mV per pH unit over the range of pH studied, since the redox reaction involves the transfer of one proton per two electrons (24Prince R.C. Linkletter S.J.G. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 132-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The redox properties of PMS were verified by differential pulse voltammetry using a Cypress Systems electroanalytical system. PMS was stable over the range pH 6.0–8.5, which covers the physiologic pH range for these enzymes. In addition to PMS, phenazine ethosulfate (E m = +60 mV at pH 7.0) and 1,2-naphthaquinone (E m = +140 mV at pH 7.0) were also used as mediators. Under identical reaction conditions, titrations using the other mediators yielded results very similar to those obtained with PMS. PMS was the mediator of choice because it exhibited better spectral resolution and faster equilibration times than the other mediators over the range of pH examined. Reductive titrations were performed anaerobically. Anaerobic conditions were maintained as described previously (25Davidson V.L. Kumar M.A. Wu J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). During reductive titrations, either ascorbic acid or the substrate (methylamine for MADH and tyramine for AADH) was added incrementally. There is no direct reaction between either methylamine or tyramine and PMS, while methylamine will completely reduce PMS through MADH in less than 3 s. Oxidative titrations exploited the fact that mixtures of PMS with MADH or AADH are slowly oxidized by O2 in the dark under aerobic conditions. Air was introduced to the fully reduced sample, and spectra were recorded with time. Titration was performed in the dark to avoid light-induced side reactions of PMS (24Prince R.C. Linkletter S.J.G. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 132-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or enzyme (26Zhu Z. Davidson V.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The reactions were complete in 30 min for AADH and 3 h for MADH. E m values were determined from titrations in both the reductive and oxidative directions, and essentially identical results were obtained. The semiquinone forms of MADH and AADH were generated by the stoichiometric addition of sodium dithionite (7Govindaraj S. Eisenstein E. Jones L.H. Sanders-Loehr J. Chistoserdov A.Y. Davidson V.L. Edwards S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Husain M. Davidson V.L. Gray K.A. Knaff D.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4139-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These semiquinones are kinetically stabilized. With time, each semiquinone disproportionates to a mixture of oxidized and reduced enzyme. The extent to which disproportionation occurs depends on pH. The semiquinone samples were incubated for 12 h in 50 mmBTP buffer at pH 5.0, 7.0, 9.0, and 10.0. Spectra of each were recorded with time until the spectral changes had stabilized (i.e.the system had reached equilibrium). From the known spectrum of each redox form, the spectrum of each mixture was deconvoluted to estimate the equilibrium concentration of each redox form. PMS was used to monitor the ambient redox potential during redox titrations of MADH. The spectra of the fully oxidized and reduced forms of MADH and PMS are shown in Fig.2 A. MADH and PMS each exhibit an isosbestic point at approximately 361 nm. This is clearly seen during the redox titration of MADH (Fig. 2 B), and it provides a convenient reference point. To calculate the exact ratio of concentrations of the oxidized and reduced forms of each species, data files containing the recorded absorbance at each wavelength were analyzed. No semiquinone form of either MADH or PMS was observed during these titrations, so contributions to the spectra from those redox forms were not considered. Each recorded spectrum is viewed as a matrix that is a linear combination of the spectra of MADHox, MADHred, PMSred, and PMSox. These data sets were fit to Equation 1, [Total species]=Equation 1 k1[PMSox]+k2[PMSred]+k3[MADHox]+k4[MADHred]where k 1/k 2 is the ratio of PMSox/PMSred, andk 3/k 4 is the ratio of MADHox/MADHred. E was then calculated using Equation 2. E=Em,7,PMS+(2.3RT/nF)log(k1/k2)−(2.3RT/nF)(pH−7.0)Equation 2 For PMS, the E m value is +80 mV at pH 7.0 and 25 °C, and 2.3RT/nF = 29.7 mV. Over the range of pH values studied, the E m of PMS will vary by 29.7 mV/pH unit, since the redox reaction involves the transfer of one proton per two electrons (24Prince R.C. Linkletter S.J.G. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 132-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To calculate theE m value of MADH at any pH, log(k 3/k 4) was plotted against E (Fig. 3), and data were fit to Equation 3. Titrations were completely reversible, and the same E m values were obtained from the reductive and oxidative titrations (Fig. 3). E=Em+(2.3RT/nF)log(k3/k4)Equation 3 The E m value of MADH at pH 7.5 was determined to be 95 ± 5 mV. This is equivalent to the value of 100 ± 4 mV, which was determined by spectroelectrochemical titration of MADH at this pH (14Husain M. Davidson V.L. Gray K.A. Knaff D.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4139-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Titrations using phenazine ethosulfate and 1,2-naphthaquinone yielded the sameE m value as that obtained with PMS. In reductive titrations, essentially identical results were obtained when ascorbic acid or methylamine was used as a reductant. Reduction by ascorbic acid will yield a quinol form of MADH with oxygen bound to the C-6 of TTQ (O-quinol). Reduction by methylamine will yield an aminoquinol form of MADH with a substrate-derived amino group bound to C-6 of TTQ (N-quinol) (27Bishop G.R. Valente E.J. Whitehead T.L. Brown K.L. Hicks R.T. Davidson V.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12868-12869Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The identicalE m values obtained from reductive titrations using ascorbate and methylamine may be explained by the fact that these are equilibrium measurements. When N-quinol is oxidized to the quinone, the amino group is lost. Consequently, the oxidation-reduction of the N-quinol is not a reversible reaction. During the redox titrations, after equilibration the initially formedN-quinol will probably be converted to O-quinol. Therefore, the E m values reported in this study are that of the quinone/O-quinol couple, regardless of which reductant is used. Redox titrations of AADH were performed exactly as described above for MADH. The results of these studies were very similar with two notable differences. The equilibration time for AADH during the oxidative titration was approximately half of that for MADH. Also, theE m value of AADH at any given pH was less positive than that of MADH (see below). The E m values of MADH were determined over a range of pH. The plot of E m versus pH (Fig. 4) is linear over the range of pH examined and exhibits a slope −30.1 ± 1.5 mV per pH unit. This indicates that the two-electron redox reaction is linked to the transfer of one proton (24Prince R.C. Linkletter S.J.G. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 132-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Since the oxidized quinone is not protonated, this means that only one of the hydroxyl groups on the fully reduced quinol TTQ in MADH is protonated. Since the plot in Fig. 4 is essentially linear, with no inflection points on either end, it is not possible from these data to determine a pK a value for either the quinone or quinol. As with a ketone, the pK a for the quinone oxygens is expected to be very low, and it is not surprising that the acidic end of the curve remains linear. The oxidized cofactor is, therefore, unprotonated TTQ. For the reduced form, one may conclude from these data that the pK a value for the hydroxyl group that is protonated is greater than 8.5. The reduced cofactor is TTQH−. A pK a > 8.5 is expected for organic O-quinols and consistent with the pK a for the TTQ model compound of 10.1 (16Itoh S. Ogino M. Haranou S. Terasaka T. Ando T. Komatsu M. Oshiro Y. Fukuzumi S. Kano K. Takagi K. Ikeda T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 1485-1493Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the model compound, however, both hydroxyls are protonated. It was not possible to obtain pK a values for MADH, because exposure to nonphysiologic pH values outside the range used in this study causes denaturation or nonspecific structural perturbations of the enzyme. The E m values of AADH were determined at different values of pH (Fig. 4). The plot of E m versus pH for AADH is also linear and exhibits a slope that is essentially the same as that for MADH. Thus, for AADH as well, only one of the quinol hydroxyl groups is protonated in the fully reduced enzyme. The E m values for AADH were less positive than those for MADH by approximately 20 mV at each pH value. Although no semiquinone was observed during the redox titrations, semiquinone forms of these enzymes can be generatedin vitro and are of physiologic importance in vivo. Since the two-electron interconversion of quinone and quinol involves the transfer of only one proton, this raises the question of whether it is the quinone/semiquinone or semiquinone/quinol couple that is linked to the proton transfer. It was not possible to measure theE m values for the individual one-electron couples in this study. At physiologic pH, the semiquinone is kinetically, not thermodynamically, stabilized. In the presence of mediators it is unstable, because they facilitate the transfer of electrons between cofactors and enhance the rate of disproportionation. It was possible, however, to determine which of the one-electron couples is linked to proton transfer by examining the pH dependence of the extent of the disproportionation reaction of the semiquinone. If proton transfer is linked to the interconversion of quinol and semiquinone (Reactions 2), then the E m value for the quinone/semiquinone couple will be independent of pH, and theE m value for the semiquinone/quinol will vary with pH by approximately −60 mV/pH unit. TTQH−⇌TTQ·+H++e− TTQ·⇌TTQ+e− 2TTQ·+H+⇌TTQ+TTQH− REACTIONS 2–4If this were true, then for the disproportionation of the semiquinone (Reaction 4) the equilibrium concentration of TTQ⋅would increase with pH. The disproportionation reaction will proceed to a lesser extent at high pH than at low pH. If proton transfer is linked to the interconversion of semiquinone and quinone (Reactions 5 and 6), then the E m value for the quinone/semiquinone couple will vary with pH by approximately −60 mV/pH unit, and theE m value for the semiquinone/quinol will be independent of pH. TTQH−⇌TTQH·+e− TTQH·⇌TTQ+H++e− 2TTQH·⇌TTQ+TTQH−+H− REACTIONS 5–7If this were true, then for the disproportionation of the semiquinone (Reaction 7) the equilibrium concentration of TTQH⋅would decrease with pH. The disproportionation reaction will proceed to a lesser extent at low pH than at high pH. Because the semiquinone forms are kinetically stabilized, it is possible to generate a relatively stable semiquinone by titration with dithionite. With time, however, the semiquinone will disproportionate to the reduced and oxidized form until an equilibrium is established (Fig. 5 A). As discussed earlier, the semiquinone is not stable during redox titrations, because the presence of mediators significantly enhances the rate of disproportionation. The semiquinones of MADH and AADH were generated, and the composition of the final equilibrium mixture was monitored after incubation in buffers at pH 5, 7, 9, and 10 (Fig. 5 B). Essentially identical results were obtained for MADH and AADH. The only difference was that the rate of the disproportionation reaction of AADH was faster than that of MADH. The extinction coefficients for the different redox states of MADH and AADH vary with pH in the presence of monovalent cations (20Zhu Z. Davidson V.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 162-175Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Kuusk V. McIntire W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26136-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, BTP buffer was used. For each enzyme, the most semiquinone is observed in the equilibrium mixture at pH 10.0, and somewhat less is observed at pH 9.0. At pH 7.0 and 5.0 the semiquinone has completely disproportionated into a mixture of reduced and oxidized enzyme. Given the known spectrum of each redox form, it was possible to deconvolute the spectra in Fig. 5 Band then determine the concentrations of each redox form present in the mixture after equilibrium had been established. The pH dependence of the proportion of MADH semiquinone present at equilibrium is seen in Fig. 6 A. The equilibrium concentration of semiquinone increases at high pH. The solid line in Fig. 6 A is derived from Reactions 2 and describes the predicted fraction of semiquinone if proton transfer is linked to interconversion of the quinol and semiquinone. Thedashed line is derived from Reactions 5 and describes the predicted fraction of semiquinone if proton transfer is linked to interconversion of the semiquinone and quinone. From these data, it is evident that proton transfer is linked to the interconversion of the fully reduced quinol and semiquinone forms (Reactions 2). The semiquinone form must, therefore, be the unprotonated anionic semiquinone.Figure 6A, pH dependence of the disproportionation reaction of MADH. The fraction of MADH present as semiquinone after the disproportionation reaction had reached equilibrium was calculated by deconvoluting the spectra shown in Fig. 5 B using the known spectra of the oxidized, semiquinone, and reduced forms. The solid line is the fraction of semiquinone predicted to be present according to the model described by Reactions 2. The dashed line is the fraction of semiquinone predicted to be present according to the model described by Reactions 5. Eachline assumes a pK value of 10 for the reduced MADH quinol.

Davidson V.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11201-11202Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) by kinetic techniques at pH 7.5 at 10 °C to be +190 mV (semiquinone/reduced) and +14 mV (oxidized/semiquinone), which corresponds to an E m value of +102 mV for the two-electron couple. After correction for temperature differences, this value is within experimental error of the value determined at pH 7.5 in the present study. The results presented above indicate that for MADH the E m value of the oxidized/semiquinone couple will not vary with pH, and that of the semiquinone/reduced couple will vary by approximately 60 mV/pH unit (i.e. one proton transfer is linked to one electron transfer). Thus, while it was not possible to directly measure the E m value for each one-electron couple, the results obtained here do allow one to estimate these redox potentials over the range of pH studied (Fig.6 B). These results reveal the protonation states of the fully reduced and semiquinone forms of TTQ in MADH and AADH. The quinol is singly protonated, and the anionic semiquinone is unprotonated. It was also shown that the E m value for AADH is 20 mV less positive than that of MADH. An important aim of this study is to determine how the protein influences the redox properties of the TTQ prosthetic group and whether this influences the catalytic properties of the protein-bound quinone in the quinoprotein. Itoh et al. (16Itoh S. Ogino M. Haranou S. Terasaka T. Ando T. Komatsu M. Oshiro Y. Fukuzumi S. Kano K. Takagi K. Ikeda T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 1485-1493Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) performed a detailed analysis of the redox properties of a model compound of TTQ in which methyl groups are present at the positions where the rings are covalently attached to the protein. Differences in the redox properties of the protein-bound TTQ in MADH and the model compound may be interpreted in the context of the known crystal structure of MADH (17Chen L. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Huizinga E. Vellieux F.M.D. Duine J.A. Hol W.G.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Chen L. Doi M. Durley R.C.E. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lindstrom M.E. Davidson V.L. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These results raise important questions. (i) How do the protein environments of MADH and AADH effect the redox potential of TTQ? (ii) Why is the fully reduced quinol in the enzyme only protonated on one hydroxyl? (iii) What is the significance of the anionic quinol to the reaction mechanisms of these enzymes? The fact that the redox potential of AADH is more negative than that of MADH indicates that there must be some differences in the way the respective proteins interact with TTQ. It was reported (16Itoh S. Ogino M. Haranou S. Terasaka T. Ando T. Komatsu M. Oshiro Y. Fukuzumi S. Kano K. Takagi K. Ikeda T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 1485-1493Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that the dihedral angle of the two indole rings of TTQ could influence its redox properties. It is possible that the polypeptide could influence this angle in the enzymes. The more negative redox potential of AADH may also suggest that the cofactor resides in a less polar environment than it does in MADH. A polar environment would favor the more highly charged redox state (i.e. reduced). It is likely that the active site of AADH will be at least somewhat more hydrophobic than that of MADH based on their substrate specificities. MADH prefers methylamine (30Davidson V.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and AADH prefers phenylethylamines (9Hyun Y.-L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A less polar environment in the active site of AADH may also explain why the anionic semiquinone is less stable (i.e. disproportionates more rapidly) in AADH than in MADH. The conclusion that the semiquinone in MADH and AADH is unprotonated is consistent with results obtained with the TTQ model compound (16Itoh S. Ogino M. Haranou S. Terasaka T. Ando T. Komatsu M. Oshiro Y. Fukuzumi S. Kano K. Takagi K. Ikeda T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 1485-1493Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This conclusion is also reasonable because semiquinones typically exhibit pK a values <6. These results also support the results of electron nuclear double resonance and electron spin echo envelope modulation studies of the dithionite-generated MADH semiquinone (31Warncke K. Brooks H.B. Lee H. McCracken J. Davidson V.L. Babcock G.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10063-10075Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). From those studies, it was concluded that both oxygens of the radical were unprotonated and that the radical was negatively charged. The finding of the pH dependence of the disproportionation reaction of MADH and the conclusion that the semiquinone/reduced couple is linked to a proton transfer help to explain previously reported observations of the reactivity of MADH with amicyanin in the crystalline state. Single crystal polarized absorption spectroscopy of a binary protein complex of MADH and amicyanin revealed that the extent to which reduced MADH transferred an electron to amicyanin was dependent on pH (32Merli A. Brodersen D.E. Morini B. Chen Z. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Rossi G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9177-9180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Since the proteins are in complex in the crystal, after reduction of MADH one electron is transferred to amicyanin to yield an MADH semiquinone-reduced amicyanin complex, and the proteins can react no further. It was observed that the amount of MADH that was present as semiquinone rather than reduced and the amount of amicyanin that was present as reduced rather than oxidized increased with the pH in which the crystals were incubated. These results suggested that the difference in redox potentials for the TTQ semiquinone/reduced and amicyanin reduced/oxidized couples was pH-dependent. Our results here are consistent with and provide an explanation for those observations. Redox studies of the TTQ model compound indicate that the two-electron reduction of the quinone to the quinol is linked to the transfer of two protons. The reduced TTQH2 model compound exhibited a pK a value of 10.1. This value is in the range of what one would expect for a phenolic hydroxyl group. This indicates that the protein environment in MADH and AADH is somehow responsible for preventing the protonation of one of the quinol hydroxyls of TTQ in the enzyme. An explanation for this may be inferred from inspection of the crystal structure of MADH (Fig. 7). The structure, which is of the oxidized form of MADH, indicates that only the C-6 carbonyl is accessible to solvent in the active site. The C-7 carbonyl is not, and it is hydrogen-bonded to an amide hydrogen on the peptide backbone. These results indicate that the crystal structure presents an accurate view of the solvent accessibility of TTQ in MADH. Since the crystal structure is of the oxidized form of MADH, these results also suggest that the inaccessibility of the C-7 of TTQ to solvent does not change when the enzyme is reduced. The crystal structure of AADH has not yet been determined. These results indicate that the solvent accessibility of only C-6 and not C-7 must be true for AADH as well. This feature of orienting TTQ such that only one of the quinone oxygens is accessible in the active site is apparently a common and probably important feature that is conserved in these TTQ enzymes. The finding that the reduced form of the enzyme-bound TTQ is anionic is unusual and interesting. Studies of model compounds of the quinoprotein cofactors, TTQ (16Itoh S. Ogino M. Haranou S.

Noar J.B. Eberlein G.A. Bruice T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3328-3338Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and topaquinone (34Mure M. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7117-7127Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), each reveal that the interconversion of the fully oxidized and fully reduced forms is a two proton per two electron process. The same is true for ubiquinone (12Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of TTQ enzymes to stabilize the anionic singly protonated quinol may be relevant to the reaction mechanisms of MADH and AADH. It was shown for MADH (27Bishop G.R. Valente E.J.

Soc. 1996; 118: 12868-12869Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that during the catalytic reaction cycle, a substrate-derived amino group displaces the accessible quinone oxygen and is covalently attached at the C-6 position of the reduced TTQ cofactor. The physiologically relevant reaction intermediate is an aminoquinol. Reoxidation of the aminoquinol is a two-step process, since the electron acceptor for MADH is a copper protein that is a one-electron carrier. Spectroscopic (35Warncke K. Brooks H.B. Babcock G.T Davidson V.L. McCracken J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 6464-6465Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and kinetic (36Bishop G.R. Brooks H.B. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8948-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) studies further demonstrate that the substrate-derived amino group remains bound to the semiquinone form of TTQ, which is generated by the first one-electron oxidation of the aminoquinol. The presence of the amino group significantly influences the electron transfer properties of the aminoquinol MADH relative to quinol MADH (37Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12082-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13586-13592Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the aminosemiquinone MADH relative to semiquinone MADH (36Bishop G.R. Brooks H.B. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8948-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The ability of the TTQ enzymes to maintain a negative charge on the C-7 oxygen in reduced MADH is significant because it will stabilize the amino forms of the reduced cofactor against hydrolysis. The C-6 carbon in the anionic aminoquinol will be a much less electrophilic site than it would be in a neutral aminoquinol. In fact, in studies of the TTQ model compound it was possible to obtain information on amino forms of the cofactor only by incubating it in the presence of large concentrations of ammonia to compensate for the instability of this intermediate in the absence of the protein. Thus, the structural properties of TTQ enzymes that allow stabilization of the anionic fully reduced state of the cofactor appear to be a critical feature that allows TTQ to function as a cofactor in both catalysis and electron transfer."

We have argued that this should arise from separate catalytic and noncatalytic sites on the αβ protomer as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) blocks a high affinity ATP site on all α subunits and yet the modified Na,K-ATPase retains a low affinity response to nucleotides (Ward, D.

Micromolar concentrations of ATP are sufficient to achieve maximal steady-state phosphorylation of the enzyme (K 0.5< 1 μm) and yet, in the presence of K+, higher ATP concentrations further stimulate ATP hydrolysis more than 20-fold (K 0.5 ≈ 100–500 μm). This stimulation seems to arise, at least in part, from an acceleration of K+ release to the cytosol (5Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol.

It seems clear that there is one high affinity ATP binding site per α subunit (18Tran C.M. Huston E.E. Farley R.A. J. Biol.

However, where ATP binds to produce the low affinity regulatory effect has been the subject of much controversy, and the issue has been further complicated by uncertainties about the oligomeric structure of the membrane-bound enzyme. We have previously used C12E8 1The abbreviations used are: C12E8, octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether; FITC, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate; pNPP,p-nitrophenyl phosphate; pNP,p-nitrophenol; TNP-ADP, 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-diphosphate; TNP-8N3-ADP, 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)8-azidoadenosine 5′-diphosphate; TNBS, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid; NIPI, N-(2-nitro-4-isothiocyanophenyl)-imidazole; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein. 1The abbreviations used are: C12E8, octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether; FITC, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate; pNPP,p-nitrophenyl phosphate; pNP,p-nitrophenol; TNP-ADP, 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-diphosphate; TNP-8N3-ADP, 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)8-azidoadenosine 5′-diphosphate; TNBS, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid; NIPI, N-(2-nitro-4-isothiocyanophenyl)-imidazole; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein.(22Brotherus J.R.

Cavieres J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5332-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The implication is that the two ATP effects are intrinsic to the protomeric enzyme,i.e. that an interaction between α subunits is not required for the low affinity ATP binding. Two possible mechanisms, which need not be exclusive, could account for the high and low affinity ATP effects on the protomer: 1) multiple nucleotide interactions at a single site, at different stages of the reaction cycle, and 2) the existence of an allosteric, or regulatory, nucleotide site on the αβ protomer, which has not been identified so far because of the difficulties associated with its low affinity. The experiments presented in this report and in a previous publication (23Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were designed to explore the second option. Our rationale was that judicious block of the high affinity ATP site in every α subunit should also abolish low affinity nucleotide effects if only option 1 was applicable. Conversely, if low affinity effects of ATP, or ATP analogues, were demonstrable in Na,K-ATPase thus modified by a discriminating agent, then they should arise from binding at an allosteric site. We chose FITC as the high affinity site blocker. Under alkaline conditions FITC inactivates Na,K-ATPase from within the adenine binding subdomain of the high affinity site, forming a covalent bond with the ε-amino group of one of three lysines of the α chain (24Carilli C.T. Farley R.A. Perlman D.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5601-5606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Farley R.A. Tran C.M. Carilli C.T. Hawke D. Shively J.E. J. Biol.

The FITC modification abolishes high affinity binding of formycin triphosphate (a fluorescent ATP analogue), phosphorylation from ATP, and the overall reaction cycle (27Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, the fluorescein-enzyme can bind ouabain in the presence of Mg2+, can be phosphorylated by Pi, and retains its K+-stimulated phosphatase activity (27Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We recently reported (23Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that when FITC-modified enzyme was solubilized with C12E8 under nondenaturing conditions, the resulting soluble protomers were still unable to hydrolyze ATP. The K+-phosphatase activity of the FITC-modified αβ protomers was similar to that of the parent membrane-bound enzyme and, crucially, it could be inhibited by TNP-ADP, a tight-binding ATP analogue. We concluded that the nucleotide had to bind at a locus different from the catalytic site (23Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In a bid to incorporate an affinity probe in the available site, we have now found that TNP-8N3-ADP can photoinactivate FITC-modified αβ protomers after binding at equilibrium. It follows that FITC and TNP-8N3-ADP must be covalently attached to the same minimal enzyme unit. It then seems quite likely that TNP-8N3-ADP is blocking an allosteric ATP site on the protomeric fluorescein-enzyme. A preliminary communication has been presented (28Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 35-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). [γ33P]-ATP, [2,8-3H]-ATP, and 32Pi were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. ATP (disodium salt) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, FITC and TNP-ADP from Molecular Probes, and adenosine, uridine, UDP, 8N3-ATP, 8N3-ADP, TNBS, pNPP (Tris salt), pyridoxal phosphate, and materials for spectrophotometric Na,K-ATPase assays from Sigma. Dimethyl sulfoxide, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid, and trifluoroacetic acid were from Aldrich, NaBH4 was from Fisons and C12E8 from Nikko Chemicals. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Na,K-ATPase was purified from pig outer renal medulla with the zonal rotor method of Jørgensen (29Jørgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 36-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase activity ranged from 20 to 35 units/mg of protein at 37 °C. (One enzyme unit = 1 μmol·min−1). Na,K-ATPase activity was measured using the coupled-enzyme spectrophotometric assay at 37 °C. The reaction was run in 1 ml and followed at 340 nm and at 40-s intervals for 4 min. Conditions were: 148 mm NaCl, 25 mmhistidine (pH 7.4), 15 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 150 μm NADH, 10 unit each of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. With either the membrane-bound or the C12E8-solubilized enzymes, the K+-phosphatase activity was determined as linear time courses at 20 °C rather than at 37 °C, because of the limited thermal stability of the soluble protomers (22Brotherus J.R. Møller J.V. Jørgensen P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comun. 1981; 100: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Enzyme aliquots were mixed into an assay medium designed to give 20 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, and 2–20 mm pNPP. Samples of the reaction mixture were quenched at intervals with 1 mNaOH, and the absorbance was determined at 410 nm. The rate ofpNP release was determined from pNP calibration curves. Phosphorylation from inorganic phosphate was carried out in a total volume of 80 μl containing 10 μg of Na,K-ATPase, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ouabain, and 50 μm [32P]Pi. Phosphorylation was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 20 °C and was then quenched with 500 μl of a chilled solution containing 7% trichloroacetic acid and 5% phosphoric acid. The acid-denatured membranes were trapped on cellulose nitrate filters (Sartorius, 25 mm × 0.45 μm) and washed six times with 5 ml of chilled 5% trichloroacetic acid, 5% phosphoric acid. The filters were transferred to counting vials, scintillation fluid was added, and 32P disintegrations/min were determined. Blanks were run using boiled enzyme and deducted (less than 5% of total phosphorylation). Phosphorylation from ATP was carried out on ice by mixing 20 μl of Na,K-ATPase suspension (0.5 mg/ml) into 80 μl of a chilled solution providing (final concentrations): 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μm [γ-33P]ATP. Following a 10-s incubation at 0 °C, the reaction was stopped with a chilled solution containing 7% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mmNa4P2O7, and 10 mmNaH2PO4. The samples were filtered and washed with chilled 5% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm ATP. Membrane-bound Na,K-ATPase was suspended at 250 μg/ml in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 2 μm [3H]ATP and incubated at 20 °C for 10 min. The free [3H]ATP was determined in samples of the suspension obtained by suction through 0.22 μm cellulose nitrate syringe-tip filters (μStar, from Costar). Bound [3H]ATP was calculated from the difference between the radioactive concentration of the original suspension and the radioactive concentration of the filtrate and was referred to the protein concentration. Membrane-bound Na,K-ATPase was suspended at 1 mg of protein/ml in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 9.2), and 5 mm EDTA. FITC was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to give a final concentration of 50 μm. The enzyme/FITC mixture was incubated at 20 °C for 30 min in the dark, and the membranes were spun down, washed, and resuspended in fresh buffer. Control enzyme was processed in parallel, with the omission of FITC. In all cases, the FITC-treated enzyme retained less than 2% of the Na,K-ATPase activity of the parallel control. On average, 80% of the pNPPase activity was preserved. In the experiment of Fig. 2, the enzyme concentration was increased to 2.4 mg/ml, and the FITC concentration decreased to 20 μm to facilitate observation of the time course of inactivation. Equal volumes of detergent solution (2.4 mg of C12E8/ml of H2O) and enzyme suspension (800 μg of protein/ml in 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mmEDTA) were mixed and incubated at 20 °C for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifuging at 356,000 × gfor 15 min (Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge, TLA 100.2 rotor). The supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes, stored on ice, and used the same day. TNP-8N3 ADP was synthesized according to Seebregts and McIntosh (30Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture comprised 216 μl of an aqueous solution containing 90.8 mg of Na2CO3/ml and 62.9 mg of NaHCO3/ml, and 173 μl of a 5% solution of TNBS containing 18 mg of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). This mixture was added to 5 mg of solid 8N3-ADP (or UDP, uridine, or adenosine, as required) and left stirring overnight at room temperature and in the dark. The product was purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Hichrom). A linear gradient (0 to 100% methanol) was delivered over 60 min using two Pharmacia-LKB 2248 high performance liquid chromatography pumps with a Pharmacia-LKB LCC 2252 controller. The optical density of the eluate was followed with a Pharmacia-LKB VWM 2141 dual wavelength monitor. TNP-8N3-ADP peaked at 34 min; it was collected, lyophilized, dissolved in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA and stored at −80 °C. The yield was approximately 20%. All TNP-derivatives had the correct UV-visible absorption spectrum, TNP-8N3-ADP with maxima at 280, 408, and 468 nm (30Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TNP-adenosine at 259, 408, and 468 nm, and TNP-UDP and TNP-uridine at 262, 408, and 468 nm. TNP-8N3-ADP and TNP-UDP also had the correct A 408/acid-labile phosphate ratio (εM/Pi = 27.6 cm−1 · mm−2) (30Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each product migrated as a single peak when reapplied to the C18 column. Acid-labile phosphate was determined by the method of Fiske and Subbarow (31Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), following 10 min of boiling in 1 m HCl. The enzyme was suspended in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm EDTA (unless otherwise specified in the legends to the figures). The suspension, or the soluble enzyme, was pipetted into multiwell dishes to a depth of 2–3 mm and irradiated using a Flowgen VL-6MC UV lamp (6 W output, 312 nm setting) at a distance of 50 cm, inside a chamber at room temperature and constant humidity. Protein was precipitated with 7% trichloroacetic acid and assayed with the bicinchoninic acid method (32Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18579) Google Scholar) as described previously (4Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5332-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All enzyme activities were calculated from the regression coefficients of the least squares linear regression of product release time courses. Error bars represent the S.E.s on these regression coefficients and have been compounded where appropriate. Curves through photoinactivation time course data are single exponential functions with a variable infinity value, fitted using SigmaPlot 4.0. The error bars on the reciprocal data of the Dixon plot of Fig. 3 were calculated from the S.E. divided by the square of the original mean (33Wilkinson G.N. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2723) Google Scholar). The linear regressions of the reciprocal data of Fig. 3 were done with weights according to Wilkinson (33Wilkinson G.N. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2723) Google Scholar). Considering the effectiveness of TNP-ADP as an inhibitor of the K+-phosphatase activity of the FITC-modified enzyme (23Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,34Scheiner-Bobis G. Antonipillai J. Farley R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9592-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we decided to try TNP-8N3-ADP as a photoactivatable probe for the site of low affinity nucleotide binding in Na,K-ATPase. TNP-8N3-ADP has been used as a probe for the catalytic site of the Ca,Mg-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (35McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Berman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5301-5309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not with Na,K-ATPase, to our knowledge. Therefore, we first observed the photoinactivation by TNP-8N3-ADP of the Na,K-ATPase activity of native sodium pump and the result of this experiment is shown in Fig.1 A. With 5 μmTNP-8N3-ADP, more than 60% of the enzyme activity is lost within 20 min. On the other hand, in the absence of TNP-8N3-ADP, the enzyme appears to be reasonably stable in our irradiation conditions. The inactivating effect is more than half-maximal at 0.05 μm TNP-8N3-ADP, and can be abolished by addition of 100 μm TNP-ADP. The inactivation presumably occurs following reversible binding to the catalytic ATP site, due to covalent attachment of the reactive nitrene derivative generated by UV activation of the azido group (36Knowles J.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1972; 5: 155-160Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar), as is the situation with 8N3-ATP or 2N3-ATP (18Tran C.M. Huston E.E. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6558-6565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tran C.M. Scheiner-Bobis G. Schoner W. Farley R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4140-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,37Haley B. Hoffman J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3367-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38Scheiner-Bobis G. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 739-746Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As it happened with other probes, the time courses of inactivation were complex; they could be best fitted as single exponential decays, but with a non-zero infinity value. We decided on a protection strategy to discriminate in favor of a low affinity ATP site. The FITC block had earlier proved successful with the membrane-bound (34Scheiner-Bobis G. Antonipillai J. Farley R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9592-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the protomeric (23Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) enzymes, and we wished to see whether other ATP site blockers could be just as effective and selective. From our earlier results (23Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we should expect that low concentrations of 8N3-ATP be less deleterious to the K+-phosphatase activity than to high affinity ATP binding (and the overall reaction). This was substantiated by the result of Fig. 1 B, which shows that 8N3-ATP inactivates the Na,K-ATPase activity much more drastically than the K+-phosphatase activity. We also confirmed the results of Kaya et al. (39Kaya S.J. Tsuda T. Hagiwara K. Fukui T. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7419-7422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that pyridoxal phosphate treatment leaves an intact K+-phosphatase activity although it inactivates as much as 80% of the Na,K-ATPase activity, and found that either 8N3-ATP or pyridoxal phosphate treatment caused a 60–70% increase in the enzyme's K 0.5 towardpNPP (not shown). However, with this protocol these two probes seem unsuitable for the present purpose as about 25% of the Na,K-ATPase survives even after long times at 20 μm8N3-ATP or 200 μm pyridoxal phosphate, making it difficult to achieve a neat separation of nucleotide effects. We decided therefore to retain FITC as the high affinity site blocker, in the knowledge that it can cause nearly 100% inactivation of the Na,K-ATPase activity with little loss of K+-phosphatase activity (23Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We carried out the experiment of Fig. 2to verify that, in our hands, the FITC modification was indeed causing a total block of the high affinity ATP site. The results confirm and extend earlier findings (27Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) in that the FITC modification leaves intact the K+-phosphatase activity and the phosphorylation from Pi (E2 partial reactions), whereas high affinity ATP binding, phosphorylation by ATP (E1 partial reactions), and the Na,K-ATPase activity (overall reaction) can be reduced to levels below 10%. Hence, it seemed fair to assume that phosphorylation by, and hydrolysis of, ATP in the fluorescein-enzyme were inactivated because of obstructed access to the high affinity ATP site. This matter shall be taken up again under “Discussion.” As the low affinity precluded direct measurements of equilibrium binding of TNP-8N3-ADP to the fluorescein-enzyme, we decided to evaluate the interaction from the inhibition of the phosphatase reaction. Fig. 3 shows a Dixon plot of TNP-8N3-ADP inhibition of the K+-phosphatase activity of the fluorescein-enzyme, obtained at 20 mm K+. The experiment was conducted in dimmed light, to avoid photoinactivation of the enzyme. TheK i is 140 μm and as the fitted lines cross each other above the abscissa, the inhibition should be of the competitive or mixed types (40Dixon M. Webb E.C. Thorne C.J.R. Tipton K.F. Enzymes.3rd Ed. Longmans, London1979Google Scholar). This experiment shows that TNP-8N3-ADP behaves toward the fluorescein-enzyme in a manner similar to that of the parent compound, TNP-ADP (23Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The specificity of the effect of TNP derivatives on the fluorescein-enzyme was investigated in the experiment of Fig.4. Trinitrobenzenesulfonate caused little or no inhibition of the K+-phosphatase activity; considering also the poor effect of picrate (23Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the trinitrophenyl group can be excluded as the TNP-ADP domain responsible for the inhibition. The figure also shows that TNP-ADP and TNP-adenosine are equally effective. This was rather surprising and would indicate that, at least with the fluorescein-enzyme, the phosphate groups do not play a significant role in the binding of TNP derivatives (with the native enzyme, TNP-ADP, TNP-ATP, are TNP-AMP competitively inhibit phosphorylation by Pi with K i values of 1.0, 1.5, and 8.0 μm) (41Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2357-2366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TNP-UDP and TNP-uridine, again as effective as each other, were less potent than the adenine derivatives; this was to be expected as UTP is a poor substrate for the Na,K-ATPase reaction (42Siegel G.J. Goodwin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3630-3637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Karlish S.J.D. Glynn I.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 242: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It seems clear that a purine or pyrimidine base is essential for the interaction between the TNP-derivatives and the fluorescein-enzyme. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that, although the TNP group is instrumental at increasing the binding affinity (compare also Fig. 1, A andB), the fluorescein-enzyme binds TNP-ADP and TNP-8N3-ADP essentially because of their ATP-like properties and most probably at a site that normally accommodates ATP. We found that UV irradiation of the fluorescein-enzyme in the presence of TNP-8N3-ADP resulted in irreversible loss of the K+-phosphatase activity. The results presented in Fig.5 show that the extent of the photoinactivation depends on the cation composition of the medium. There is an absolute requirement for Na+ or Mg2+ ions, the latter being slightly more effective than the former; either will suffice, the effects being nonadditive. K+ ions do not support the TNP-8N3-ADP photoinactivation and counteract the effects of Na+ and Mg2+. Presumably Mg2+ and Na+stabilize an enzyme conformation with a high affinity for the probe, whereas K+ stabilizes a low affinity conformation. This interpretation seems to be supported by the experiment of Fig.6, which shows the TNP-8N3-ADP concentration dependence of the inactivation process in the presence of Na+ and Mg2+. The experiment involved a single inactivation time, with triplicate phosphatase determinations at each TNP-8N3-ADP concentration; the ordinate shows the natural logarithm of the fractional K+-phosphatase activity surviving, which should be proportional to the rate constant of ph"
https://openalex.org/W2146902440,"Matrilin-2 is a member of von Willebrand factor A containing extracellular matrix proteins in which the cDNA-derived sequence shows similar domain organization to cartilage matrix protein/matrilin-1, but information on the protein structure is limited. Here we studied the oligomerization potential of a synthetic peptide NH2-ENLILFQNVANEEVRKLTQRLEEMTQRMEALENRLKYR-COOH corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of mouse matrilin-2. The central portion of this sequence shows a periodicity of hydrophobic residues occupying positions a and d of a heptad pattern (abcdefg)n, which is characteristic for α-helical coiled-coil proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a high α-helical content, and the shape of the spectra is indicative for a coiled-coil conformation. Chemical cross-linking and size exclusion chromatography suggest a homotrimeric configuration. Thermal denaturation in benign buffer shows a single cooperative transition with ΔH 0 = −375 kJ/mol. Melting temperatures T m varied from 38 to 51 °C within a concentration range of 10 to 85 μm, which is about 35 °C lower than determined for a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal domain of matrilin-1. The data suggest that despite the low sequence identity within this region, matrilin-2 will form a homotrimer as matrilin-1 does. Matrilin-2 is a member of von Willebrand factor A containing extracellular matrix proteins in which the cDNA-derived sequence shows similar domain organization to cartilage matrix protein/matrilin-1, but information on the protein structure is limited. Here we studied the oligomerization potential of a synthetic peptide NH2-ENLILFQNVANEEVRKLTQRLEEMTQRMEALENRLKYR-COOH corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of mouse matrilin-2. The central portion of this sequence shows a periodicity of hydrophobic residues occupying positions a and d of a heptad pattern (abcdefg)n, which is characteristic for α-helical coiled-coil proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a high α-helical content, and the shape of the spectra is indicative for a coiled-coil conformation. Chemical cross-linking and size exclusion chromatography suggest a homotrimeric configuration. Thermal denaturation in benign buffer shows a single cooperative transition with ΔH 0 = −375 kJ/mol. Melting temperatures T m varied from 38 to 51 °C within a concentration range of 10 to 85 μm, which is about 35 °C lower than determined for a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal domain of matrilin-1. The data suggest that despite the low sequence identity within this region, matrilin-2 will form a homotrimer as matrilin-1 does. Matrilins form a subfamily of extracellular matrix proteins containing von Willebrand factor A-like domains. Its prototype member, matrilin-1 (also known as cartilage matrix protein), is specifically localized in some types of the hyaline cartilage (1Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) where it can interact with aggrecan and collagen type II fibrils (2Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem.

Its primary structure contains two N-terminal sequence segments with similarities to the von Willebrand factor A domain separated by an epidermal growth factor-like domain and a short unique C-terminal domain (6Argraves W.S.

Meanwhile, cDNA-derived sequences of two different gene products have been established that show a similar domain structure and are consequently named matrilin-2 and matrilin-3 (12Deák F. Piecha D.

Within the matrilin-2 sequence, the two von Willebrand factor domains are separated by 10 epidermal growth factor-like domains, whereas matrilin-3 lacks the second von Willebrand factor domain and contains four epidermal growth factor-like tandem repeats. In contrast to matrilin-1, matrilin-2 is absent from epiphyseal and other cartilages, but is found in high abundance in the limbs, calvaria, uterus, and heart and in lower amounts in skeletal muscle, brain, and skin (12Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Expression studies suggest a similar tissue distribution for matrilin-3 as found for matrilin-1. It mainly co-localizes with collagen type II, especially in the periphery of cartilage in sternum, femur, and trachea (13Belluoccio D. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Currently the oligomerization state of the new matrilins is unknown. Preliminary data from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run under nonreducing conditions revealed only that matrilin-2 is not a monomeric protein (12Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the overall sequence similarity between the different matrilins suggests a common evolutionary origin, it is lowest for the C-terminal domain. Only 11 and 13 of the 38 C-terminal residues of matrilin-2 and -3, respectively, are identical with those of matrilin-1 of the same species, and only two residues are identical in all known matrilin sequences in corresponding positions. To elucidate the oligomerization potential of matrilin-2, we synthesized a peptide corresponding to the 38 C-terminal residues of mouse matrilin-2 and analyzed it by circular dichroism (CD) 1The abbreviations used are: CD, circular dichroism; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; MTR2-C38, peptide corresponding to the 38 C-terminal residues of mouse matrilin-2; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: CD, circular dichroism; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; MTR2-C38, peptide corresponding to the 38 C-terminal residues of mouse matrilin-2; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.spectroscopy, chemical cross-linking, and gel filtration chromatography. Our data indicate that this sequence domain can assemble into a homotrimeric α-helical coiled coil similar to matrilin-1 although with a lower thermal stability.DISCUSSIONThe α-helical coiled coil is a ubiquitous structural domain found in many intra- and extracellular proteins within which it specifically serves as a region for polypeptide chain recognition and oligomerization (for recent reviews, see Refs. 24Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar and 33Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its relatively simple heptad sequence motif where hydrophobic residues are predominently located in a 3-4-3-4 spacing, it is difficult to predict the correct oligomerization state. Thus the multidimensional scoring approach for identifying and distinguishing between dimeric and trimeric coiled coils implemented in the MultiCoil program (20Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) favors a dimer assembly for matrilin-2 (Fig. 1) as well as for matrilin-1 (data not shown). For matrilin-1, different approaches have conclusively shown that it forms a homotrimeric α-helical coiled coil (4Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Hofer U. Chen Q. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23150-23154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Beck K. Gambee J.E. Bohan C.A. Bächinger H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the data presented here make this the most likely assembly state also for matrilin-2. Some important rules for predicting the association state of coiled coils were derived from the systematic exchange of hydrophobic residues in heptad positions a andd within the yeast transcription factor GCN4. The geometry of the Cα-Cβ bond of the core residues is parallel to the Cα-Cβ vector of the opposing hole in heptad position a and perpendicular in position d for the dimeric variant, whereas the trimeric variant shows acute geometry of these residues, and in the tetrameric one, a is perpendicular, and d is parallel (34Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Although the periodicity of hydrophobic residues is less regular within the matrilin C-terminal domains, the predominance of leucine residues assigned to positions a and daccording to these rules is consistent with a trimeric state. It has been shown, however, that a single residue, Arg-487 of the human matrilin-1 sequence, which is probably involved in an interchain ionic interaction with Glu-492, is crucial for trimer formation; when replaced by Gln within a peptide resembling the C-terminal domain, tetramer formation was observed at physiological pH and ionic strength (26Beck K. Gambee J.E. Kamawal A. Bächinger H.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3767-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the positively charged character of Arg-487 is conserved within all matrilin sequences. The corresponding residues of matrilin-2 studied here are Arg-945/Glu-950 (Fig. 1, thick bracket) and are identical both in the mouse and human sequence (12Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The matrilin-3 sequences contain a lysine instead of arginine in this position (13Belluoccio D. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).When compared with the peptide corresponding to the C terminus of matrilin-1, MTR2-C38 is considerably less stable withT m values about 35 °C lower, and the enthalpy change differs by ∼130 kJ/mol (11Beck K. Gambee J.E. Bohan C.A. Bächinger H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This is most probably due to the weakening in the stabilizing interactions between hydrophobic core residues. Matrilin-2 residues Ala-928, Met-942, and Met-946, which are assigned to heptad positions a and d (Fig. 1), are considerably less hydrophobic than the corresponding amino acids (Val-470, Val-484, Leu-488) of matrilin-1. Based on model peptides, it was found that depending on its position, an Ala-Ala interaction can decrease the stability by ΔΔG u ∼ 13 kJ/mol when compared with a Leu-Leu interaction (29Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although methionine residues are relatively rare in coiled-coil domains, their preference to occupy heptad positions a or d is less pronounced than observed for other hydrophobic amino acids (21Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3451) Google Scholar, 35Beck K. Spring J. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Engel J. Chiquet M. Taylor W.R. Patterns in Protein Sequence and Structure. Springer Verlag, Berlin1992: 229-254Google Scholar), which might indicate that their contribution to stability is weak.The most conserved residue pair within the currently known C-terminal sequences of matrilins is Phe-Gln-925 of matrilin-2 (exceptions: Phe-Glu in mouse matrilin-1; Leu-Gln in chicken matrilin-3). Interestingly, Gln is specifically found near the N terminus of many trimeric in contrast to dimeric coiled coils (36Woolfson D.N. Alber T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1596-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Indeed, Gln residues in the heptad position a are thought to specify a trimer assembly (37Gonzalez Jr., L. Woolfson D.N. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Heteronuclear NMR assignments for the chicken matrilin-1 C-terminal domain containing the two cysteine residues preceding the coiled-coil region indicate that they form symmetric disulfide bonds in which the first cysteine of one chain is linked to the second cysteine of a neighboring chain, contributing a stabilizing energy of ΔΔG u ∼ 4 kJ/mol. They are incompatible with a coiled-coil conformation, but this starts at the following residue and lasts up to near the C terminus (23Wiltscheck R. Kammerer R.A. Dames S.A. Schulthess T. Blommers M.J.J. Engel J. Alexandrescu A.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the reduced form, however, the N termini of this domain are less ordered (23Wiltscheck R. Kammerer R.A. Dames S.A. Schulthess T. Blommers M.J.J. Engel J. Alexandrescu A.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results suggest for MTR2-C38 that the ∼10 N-terminal residues are not well ordered and thus account for the less than fully α-helical structure as determined by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2). Matrilins form a subfamily of extracellular matrix proteins containing von Willebrand factor A-like domains. Its prototype member, matrilin-1 (also known as cartilage matrix protein), is specifically localized in some types of the hyaline cartilage (1Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem.

For matrilin-1, different approaches have conclusively shown that it forms a homotrimeric α-helical coiled coil (4Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol.

The corresponding residues of matrilin-2 studied here are Arg-945/Glu-950 (Fig. 1, thick bracket) and are identical both in the mouse and human sequence (12Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M.

Blommers M.J.J. Engel J. Alexandrescu A.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the reduced form, however, the N termini of this domain are less ordered (23Wiltscheck R. Kammerer R.A. Dames S.A. Schulthess T. Blommers M.J.J. Engel J. Alexandrescu A.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results suggest for MTR2-C38 that the ∼10 N-terminal residues are not well ordered and thus account for the less than fully α-helical structure as determined by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The α-helical coiled coil is a ubiquitous structural domain found in many intra- and extracellular proteins within which it specifically serves as a region for polypeptide chain recognition and oligomerization (for recent reviews, see Refs. 24Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar and 33Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its relatively simple heptad sequence motif where hydrophobic residues are predominently located in a 3-4-3-4 spacing, it is difficult to predict the correct oligomerization state. Thus the multidimensional scoring approach for identifying and distinguishing between dimeric and trimeric coiled coils implemented in the MultiCoil program (20Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) favors a dimer assembly for matrilin-2 (Fig. 1) as well as for matrilin-1 (data not shown). For matrilin-1, different approaches have conclusively shown that it forms a homotrimeric α-helical coiled coil (4Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Hofer U. Chen Q. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 256: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the data presented here make this the most likely assembly state also for matrilin-2. Some important rules for predicting the association state of coiled coils were derived from the systematic exchange of hydrophobic residues in heptad positions a andd within the yeast transcription factor GCN4. The geometry of the Cα-Cβ bond of the core residues is parallel to the Cα-Cβ vector of the opposing hole in heptad position a and perpendicular in position d for the dimeric variant, whereas the trimeric variant shows acute geometry of these residues, and in the tetrameric one, a is perpendicular, and d is parallel (34Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Although the periodicity of hydrophobic residues is less regular within the matrilin C-terminal domains, the predominance of leucine residues assigned to positions a and daccording to these rules is consistent with a trimeric state. It has been shown, however, that a single residue, Arg-487 of the human matrilin-1 sequence, which is probably involved in an interchain ionic interaction with Glu-492, is crucial for trimer formation; when replaced by Gln within a peptide resembling the C-terminal domain, tetramer formation was observed at physiological pH and ionic strength (26Beck K. Gambee J.E. Kamawal A. Bächinger H.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3767-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the positively charged character of Arg-487 is conserved within all matrilin sequences. The corresponding residues of matrilin-2 studied here are Arg-945/Glu-950 (Fig. 1, thick bracket) and are identical both in the mouse and human sequence (12Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The matrilin-3 sequences contain a lysine instead of arginine in this position (13Belluoccio D. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When compared with the peptide corresponding to the C terminus of matrilin-1, MTR2-C38 is considerably less stable withT m values about 35 °C lower, and the enthalpy change differs by ∼130 kJ/mol (11Beck K. Gambee J.E. Bohan C.A. Bächinger H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This is most probably due to the weakening in the stabilizing interactions between hydrophobic core residues. Matrilin-2 residues Ala-928, Met-942, and Met-946, which are assigned to heptad positions a and d (Fig. 1), are considerably less hydrophobic than the corresponding amino acids (Val-470, Val-484, Leu-488) of matrilin-1. Based on model peptides, it was found that depending on its position, an Ala-Ala interaction can decrease the stability by ΔΔG u ∼ 13 kJ/mol when compared with a Leu-Leu interaction (29Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although methionine residues are relatively rare in coiled-coil domains, their preference to occupy heptad positions a or d is less pronounced than observed for other hydrophobic amino acids (21Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3451) Google Scholar, 35Beck K. Spring J. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Engel J. Chiquet M. Taylor W.R. Patterns in Protein Sequence and Structure. Springer Verlag, Berlin1992: 229-254Google Scholar), which might indicate that their contribution to stability is weak. The most conserved residue pair within the currently known C-terminal sequences of matrilins is Phe-Gln-925 of matrilin-2 (exceptions: Phe-Glu in mouse matrilin-1; Leu-Gln in chicken matrilin-3). Interestingly, Gln is specifically found near the N terminus of many trimeric in contrast to dimeric coiled coils (36Woolfson D.N. Alber T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1596-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Indeed, Gln residues in the heptad position a are thought to specify a trimer assembly (37Gonzalez Jr., L. Woolfson D.N. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2000664747,"Class I major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) are heterotrimeric structures comprising heavy chains (HC), β2-microglobulin (β2-m), and short antigenic peptides of 8–10 amino acids. These components assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum and are released to the cell surface only when a peptide of the appropriate length and sequence is incorporated into the structure. The binding of β2-m and peptide to HC is cooperative, and there is indirect evidence that the formation of a stable heterotrimer from an unstable HC:β2-m heterodimer involves a peptide-induced conformational change in the HC. Such a conformational change could ensure both a strong interaction between the three components and also signal the release of stably assembled class I MHC molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum. A peptide-induced conformational change in HC has been demonstrated in cell lysates lacking β2-m to which synthetic peptides were added. Many features of this conformational change suggest that it may be physiologically relevant. In an attempt to study the peptide-induced conformational change in detail we have expressed a soluble, truncated form of the mouse H-2Db HC that contains only the peptide binding domains of the class I molecule. We have shown that this peptide-binding “platform” is relatively stable in physiological buffers and undergoes a conformational change that is detectable with antibodies, in response to synthetic peptides. We also show that the structural features of peptides that induce this conformational change in the platform are the same as those required to observe the conformational change in full-length HC. In this respect, therefore, the HC α1 and α2 domains, which together form the peptide binding site of class I MHC, are able to act independently of the rest of the molecule.

Glycoproteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; HC, heavy chain; β2-m, β2-microglobulin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; TBC, Tris-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; WT, wild type. class I locus present peptide antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. MHC class I molecules are transmembrane glycoproteins comprising a 45-kDa heavy chain (HC) with three extracellular domains (α1, α2, and α3), noncovalently associated with β2-microglobulin (β2-m). These subunits are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in association with peptide epitopes that are either derived from the cytosol and delivered to the ER by the transporter associated with antigen processing, or generated in the ER itself (see Refs. 1Heemels M.T. Ploegh H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 463-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar and 2Elliott T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 47-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for reviews). Biochemical evidence shows that when an appropriate peptide binds to the HC:β2-m heterodimer, the complex is stabilized (3Townsend A. Ohlen C. Foster L. Bastin J. Ljunggren H.G. Karre K.

Cell. 1990; 62: 285-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and that, in this respect, peptide binding and class I assembly are linked phenomena in so much as the formation of an MHC class I-peptide complex can be seen as the assembly of a trimolecular complex of HC, β2-m, and peptide. The crystal structures of several MHC class I-peptide complexes have now been solved (reviewed in Ref. 7Jardetzky T. Browning M. McMichael A. HLA and MHC: Genes, Molecules and Function. Bios Scientific, Oxford1996: 249-277Google Scholar) and support this view, showing that the peptide ligand is deeply buried in the peptide-binding cleft formed by the α1 and α2 domains. In some cases, as much as 80% of the peptide is buried (8Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and in two cases, a salt bridge forms over the bound peptide, between side chains of the α1 and α2 domains on either side of the cleft (9Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). It is difficult to envisage the diffusion of peptide in and out of this peptide-binding groove according to the classical image of a receptor-ligand interaction. Despite this, several attempts have been made to measure apparent equilibrium binding constants (10Cerundolo V. Elliott T. Elvin J. Bastin J. Rammensee H.G. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 11Cerundolo V. Braud V. Browning M. McMichael A. HLA and MHC: Genes, Molecules and Function. Bios Scientific, Oxford1996: 193-225Google Scholar). Also, dissociation rates have been measured for a variety of class I peptide complexes (10Cerundolo V. Elliott T. Elvin J. Bastin J. Rammensee H.G. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In only one report have both kinetic constants (k a and k d) and thermodynamic constant (K a) been measured in the same system, and this concluded that peptide-binding groove to which peptides bind is different from those from which they dissociate, the implication being that a conformational change occurs in the class I molecule upon peptide binding (12Cerundolo V. Elliott T. Townsend A. Prog. Immunol. 1992; 8: 175-180Google Scholar, 13Springer S. Doering K. Cerundolo V. Skipper J. Townsend A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3001-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such a conformational change has been observed indirectly in another system. In the absence of bound β2-m, free HC undergoes a conformational change that is detectable with antibodies (4Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Elvin J. Townsend A. Nature. 1991; 351: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14Elliott T. Elvin J. Cerundolo V. Allen H. Townsend A. Eur. J.

Nature. 1990; 344: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and similarities in the structural requirements for this conformational change and those for stable peptide binding to HC:β2-m heterodimers suggest that this conformational change may be related or identical to that proposed for the HC:β2-m complex upon peptide binding (12Cerundolo V. Elliott T. Townsend A. Prog. Immunol. 1992; 8: 175-180Google Scholar, 17Catipovic B. Talluri G. Oh J. Wei T. Su X. Johansen T.E. Edidin M. Schneck J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1753-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The relevance of such a conformational change is 2-fold. First, it provides a mechanism for the MHC class I binding site to bind a wide variety of peptide ligands with high affinity. It is more usual to observe receptor ligand interactions in which increased affinity is achieved only at the “expense” of greater specificity. Second, it provides a way in which the MHC class I molecule could signal its release from cofactors that are responsible for retaining incompletely assembled class I molecules in the ER. As a means of producing MHC class I molecules in a soluble form that could allow a study of the peptide-induced conformational change using high resolution techniques, we chose to make only the portion of a class I molecule that contains the peptide binding site. Given the apparent structural independence of this peptide-binding platform, our strategy was to express residues 1–193 of the murine MHC class I molecule H2-Db in Escherichia coli and to renature it after solubilization in 8 m urea. We show here the successful expression of this fragment and its ability to undergo a peptide-induced conformational change. pGMT7 is a 3.1-kilobase pair, pAR2067-based plasmid containing T7 promoter and terminators flanking a polylinker. E. coli strain BL21 DE(plys c)isamp r incorporates an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible gene for T7 RNA polymerase, allowing high level, inducible expression of transfected DNA. The monoclonal antibodies B22.249 and 27-11-13 (4Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Elvin J. Townsend A. Nature. 1991; 351: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Hammerling G. Hammerling U. Lemke H. Immunogenetics. 1979; 8: 433-439Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar) recognize the native conformation of the H2-Db heavy chain. Rabbit antiserum T18 was raised against D1–193b inclusion bodies. It recognizes epitopes on both Db and Kb heavy chains, which are lost upon β2-m binding but remain when heavy chains bind to peptides in the absence of β2-m. Full-length Db heavy chain corresponding to nucleotides 1–874 (amino acids 1–270, D1–270b), and a fragment of the Db heavy chain corresponding to nucleotides 64–642 (amino acids 1–193, D1–193b) were amplified by a polymerase chain reaction from cDNA made from the Rausher-transformed thymoma cell line RMA-S (19Ljunggren H.G. Karre K. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1745-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 20Ljunggren H.G. Paabo S. Cochet M. Kling G. Kourilsky P. Karre K. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2911-2917PubMed Google Scholar). The amplification incorporated a 5′-BamHI and 3′-HindIII recognition site and added nucleotides coding for four additional histidine residues at the C terminus of the fragment. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the vector pGMT7, and sequenced by the dideoxy method before being transferred into the BL21 strain of E. coli for expression. Transformed bacteria were grown in L broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to a density of 0.3–0.5 A 600 units before adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h to induce expression. Clones expressing over 20 mg of protein/ml of culture were isolated. Both D1–270b and D1–193b were expressed as inclusion bodies and were purified from protein-expressing BL21 transformants as follows. A washed cell pellet was lysed in a minimum volume of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25% sucrose, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol by sonication (14 μm on ice until the decrease in viscosity indicated that all DNA had been sheared). Following cell disruption, and the removal of cell debris by centrifugation, inclusion bodies were pelleted (5 min, 10,000 rpm). Inclusion bodies were then washed twice in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 2 m NaCl, 2m urea, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 8 m urea. D1–193b refolding was carried out by dilution into 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 m arginine as a stabilizer, and a redox couple consisting of 0.5 mm oxidized, 5 mm reduced glutathione to encourage appropriate formation of the intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys101 and Cys164. After concentration in a Centriprep C10(Amicon), the renatured product was purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 FPLC column equilibrated with TBS, using FPLC (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Fractions containing soluble, monomeric D1–193b were collected, pooled, and concentrated further by membrane filtration. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry. Small, experimental refolding reactions were carried out for analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which 50 μg of D1–193b or D1–270b inclusion bodies resuspended in 10 μl of 8 m urea were refolded in 2 ml of refolding buffer containing different concentrations of peptide for 48 h at 4 °C. Where appropriate, the refolding buffer also contained 1.36 μm recombinant β2-m. 1-ml samples of D1–193b containing 2–10 μg of protein were incubated at 4 °C with 50 μm of either the H2-Db-restricted influenza A nucleoprotein epitope residues 366–374 (ASNENMDAM), or the H2-Db and H2-Kb-restricted Sendai virus nucleoprotein epitope residues 324–332 (FAPGNYPAL) for 1 h. D1–193b was then immunoprecipitated by adding the antibodies (10 μg/ml for the monoclonal antibodies, 1/500 dilution for the antiserum), incubating for 90 min at 4 °C, then precipitating immune complexes with 50 μl of 10% w/v protein A immobilized on Sepharose 4B (Sigma) for 30 min. The precipitates were washed four times in TBS, then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 96 flat-bottomed well, UPVC plates were coated overnight with 200 μl of 1 μmsoluble D1–193b-ASNENMDAM complex in phosphate-buffered saline. Excess sites were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 2 h. 100 μl of unpurified refolding mix were preincubated at 4 °C for 2 h with BB7.2 at a final concentration of 250 ng/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, 2% bovine serum albumin, after which time the whole mixture was transferred to wells of the coated plate and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After removal of the mixture, the wells were washed three times in 200 μl TBS, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.4% bovine serum albumin, and 200 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) were added (1/1000 dilution in TBS) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Following a further three washes, 200 μl of substrate containing 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 200 μl of TBS were then added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min before readingA 405 on a Titertek Multiskan plate reader. The 193-amino acid fragment amplified from cDNA lacks the signal sequence (residues 1–22), most of the α3 domain, the transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains and is called D1–193b. In addition, the C terminus of the fragment was tagged with four additional histidine residues, which along with the two naturally occurring histidine residues at the C terminus of this fragment, could be used to purify the protein by nickel chelation chromatography. We chose this fragment rather than a shorter one encompassing only the α1 and α2domains in order to preserve a conserved salt bridge between Arg181 and Asp183, which we felt could be important in stabilizing the platform. Previous attempts to express slightly shorter fragments of other alleles have been unsuccessful in producing a soluble antigen binding platform. 2P. Bjorkman, personal communication. Following induction of expression for 5 h, most transformants expressed D1–193b as inclusion bodies. Clones expressing greater than 20 mg of protein per liter of culture were isolated and expanded. Fig. 1(lane a) shows that the crude inclusion body preparation contained a polypeptide of a size corresponding to D1–193b (20 kDa) in over 70% abundance. Following washing, greater than 95% of the urea-soluble material was D1–193b. Refolding, with the replacement of 8 m urea with a stabilizing salt (0.5ml-arginine), allowed the recovery of around 50% of the input polypeptide in a soluble form. This contained a mixture of products comprising approximately 10% disulfide bonded trimer, 40% disulfide-bonded dimers, and 50% monomer as determined by reducing and nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with very few high order soluble aggregates (data not shown). Thus, around 5 mg of soluble monomer per liter of culture, was recoverable by gel filtration in TBS, 0.5 m arginine. This was stable at around 1 mg/ml for at least 4 weeks. In the absence of the stabilizing solute, D1–193b was slightly less stable and tended to form dimers and trimers when stored at around 0.5 mg/ml at 4 °C for 4 weeks. Routinely, renatured D1–193b was purified and simultaneously transferred into TBS by FPLC gel filtration. A typical chromatogram is shown in Fig. 2. When 50 μmpeptide was included in the renaturation, the yield of monomeric D1–193b increased slightly when analyzed by gel filtration, with a corresponding decrease in the yield of dimers and trimers (Fig. 2). In contrast to D1–193b, full-length heavy chain (D1–270b) aggregates completely in the absence of any added peptide during the refolding reaction. This indicates that the formation of low order soluble aggregates is promoted by the presence of the α3 domain.Figure 2Purification of monomeric D 1–193b by FPLC gel filtration. After refolding in the presence (thin line) and absence (thick line) of 20 μm ASNENMDAM, concentrated D1–193b was fractionated on a Superdex 75, FPLC column. The column had previously been calibrated with standard proteins of 158, 44, and 17 kDa (marked). Fractions corresponding to monomeric D1–193b were pooled and concentrated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that, in the absence of β2-m, short peptides that specifically bind to Db can induce a conformational change in the heavy chain in cell lysates (4Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Elvin J. Townsend A. Nature. 1991; 351: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14Elliott T. Elvin J. Cerundolo V. Allen H. Townsend A. Eur. J.

We therefore investigated the ability of Db-binding peptides to induce a conformational change in D1–193b in solution. In TBS (and TBS/arginine), the soluble monomer was unreactive with two monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes present in the native conformation of H2 Db α1 and α2 domains (B22 and 27-11-13). It was, however, recognized by antiserum T18 which was raised to D1–193b (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 3 shows that, when either of the Db binding peptides (FAPGNYPAL or ASNENMDAM) were added to a final concentration of 50 μm, the conformation-sensitive epitope is recovered, and D1–193b could now be recognized by mAb B22.249. This is more readily observed for the latter peptide, which has a higher apparent K a for H2-Db, 3T. Elliott, unpublished observation. and strongly suggests that the peptides induce a conformational change in D1–193b upon binding. No such conformational change is observed when a control peptide (the H-2Kb-binding peptide SIINFEKL) was added to a concentration of 100 μm (Fig. 3, c andd). These results are consistent with those obtained for full-length and truncated heavy chains studied in detergent lysates of mammalian cells that do not express β2-m (4Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Elvin J. Townsend A. Nature. 1991; 351: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14Elliott T. Elvin J. Cerundolo V. Allen H. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2085-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3121-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These chains, unlike D1–193b, areN-glycosylated. Thus the absence of N-linked carbohydrate does not appear to influence the ability of the α1 and α2 domains to undergo this conformational change in response to optimal peptides. In an attempt to quantify the ability of peptide to induce the conformational change in both D1–193band D1–270b in solution, small scale refolding reactions were initiated in the presence of different concentrations of FAPGNYPAL (WT). The recovery of mAb B22-reactive D1–193b and D1–270b was then quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. mAb B22 was mixed with crude, unfractionated refolding reactions, and the mixture was applied to 96-well plastic plates coated with previously refolded, purified complexes of D1–270b + β2-m + ASNENMDAM. Soluble, folded Dbmolecules in the folding mix will block the B22 antibody, which is at limiting concentration, from interacting with the immobilized complexes, reducing the amount of antibody that can bind to the plate. Neither the soluble aggregates present in the refolding mix nor free β2-m or peptide can bind to mAb B22 (data not shown). The percentage maximum inhibition (compared with a folding to which no peptide has been added) is therefore proportional to the yield of correctly folded, B22-reactive material in each in vitrorefolding reaction. Fig. 4 ashows that, when β2-m is included in the folding reaction with D1–270b, the recovery of B22-reactive molecules is much more efficient than for either D1–193b or D1–270b in the absence of β2-m, requiring approximately 1000-fold less peptide to achieve the same yield of folded material. A similar observation has been made for the binding of peptides to full-length Dbheavy chains in cell lysates in the presence and absence of β2-m (4Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Elvin J. Townsend A. Nature. 1991; 351: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14Elliott T. Elvin J. Cerundolo V. Allen H. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2085-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3121-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The presence of β2-m did not affect the folding of D1–193b (data not shown). These experiments indicate that the α3 domain appears to contribute little to the ability of heavy chains to bind peptides when β2-m is not present, but increases the binding efficiency severalfold when β2-m is present, presumably by contributing to the β2-m binding site, allowing β2-m to stabilize the peptide-binding groove. These results are consistent with similar observations made for a Kb molecule with a deleted α3 domain expressed in β2-m-negative cells (21Elliott T. Elvin J. Cerundolo V. Allen H. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2085-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The influence of the anchor residues (asparagine 5 and leucine 9) on the ability of a peptide to induce the conformational change was assessed by initiating folding reactions in the presence of analogues of the WT peptide carrying alanine substitutions at positions 5 and 9 (Ala-5, FAPGAYPAL; and Ala-5 to Ala-9, FAPGAYPAA). Fig. 4 bshows that for D1–270b in the presence of β2-m, changing asparagine 5 to alanine had a relatively small effect compared with WT, reducing the efficiency with which peptide induces folding by less than 4-fold. Changing leucine 9 to alanine resulted in a further 3-fold reduction in folding. The asparagine 5 to alanine substitution had a more dramatic effect on the folding of D1–193b or D1–270b in the absence of β2-m (Fig. 4 c), reducing the recovery of folded molecules by almost 100-fold, and when leucine 9 was also changed to alanine no significant folding was seen within the range of peptide concentrations used (up to 760 mm, equivalent to a 1000-fold molar excess). There is therefore a more stringent requirement for both peptide anchor residues for the incorporation of peptide into refolded Db in the absence of β2-m. This is the first description of a soluble fragment of an MHC class I molecule comprising the two N-terminal domains of the protein that form the antigenic peptide-binding site. In the absence of peptides, this 193-amino acid fragment is reasonably stable in physiological buffers, but the two domains exist in a non-native conformation as judged by their inability to be recognized by monoclonal antibodies raised against the native whole molecule. A similar situation is seen for full-length heavy chains synthesized in mammalian cells that lack β2-m. Here, although the immunolglobulin-like α3 domain appears to be in a native conformation, the α1 and α2 domains do not. In detergent lysates, these molecules undergo a conformational change when they bind to antigenic peptides in the absence of β2-m (4Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Elvin J. Townsend A. Nature. 1991; 351: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14Elliott T. Elvin J. Cerundolo V. Allen H. Townsend A. Eur. J.

Nature. 1990; 344: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), such that the α1 and α2 domains acquire epitopes present in the native structure. We have also suggested that peptides bind to the non-native conformation of heavy chain and in doing so, initiate the conformational change (15Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3121-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This conformational change does not require the presence of the α3 domain (14Elliott T. Elvin J. Cerundolo V. Allen H. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2085-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), an observation which led us to speculate that it might be possible to observe the same conformational change in the isolated peptide-binding platform formed by the α1 and α2 domains. Our results show that this is indeed the case and open up the possibility of studying the conformational change by conventional biophysical techniques. Indeed, D1–193b is of a size which is compatible with two- dimensional NMR spectral analysis (22Clore G.M. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2315-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Remerowski M.L. Domke T. Gorenewegen A. Pepermans H.A.M. Hilbers C.W. van de Ven F.J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 257-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have suggested that the conformational change which we observe for free heavy chain, and now the isolated peptide-binding platform, may be related to a conformational change, which is thought to occur in the heavy chain when peptides bind to the assembled HC:β2-m heterodimer in vivo. This has been observed indirectly by fluorescence transfer between two MHC class I-bound mAb (17Catipovic B. Talluri G. Oh J. Wei T. Su X. Johansen T.E. Edidin M. Schneck J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1753-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and by immunoprecipitation of peptide receptive and peptide-bound H2-Ld molecules with mAb which discriminate between the two forms (24Smith J.D. Lie W.R. Gorka J. Kindle C.S. Myers N.B. Hansen T.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A more persuasive, but no less indirect, indication of the conformational change arose from a measurement of the kinetic and thermodynamic binding constants of H2-Db for Db-binding peptides (12Cerundolo V. Elliott T. Townsend A. Prog. Immunol. 1992; 8: 175-180Google Scholar, 13Springer S. Doering K. Cerundolo V. Skipper J. Townsend A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3001-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This study showed that, for an N-terminally extended peptide ligand, the measured association rate constant corresponded to that predicted from a simple one-step binding model in which K a =k a/k d. However, for the optimal length peptide, the measured association rate is two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted from the k d andK a. This led to the proposal that a conformational change in the class I molecule was responsible for the observed the mismatched kinetics of peptide binding, and that only peptides of the optimum length can bring it about. It is interesting to note that the conformational change seen in free heavy chains and D1–193b is also observed only in response to optimal length peptides, and that these appear toinduce the conformational change rather than simply stabilize the native conformer preferentially (15Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3121-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since the solution of the first MHC class I structure (25Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar), immunologists and structural biologists have been puzzled by the observation that the peptide ligand is so deeply buried in the peptide-binding groove as to be considered part of the MHC class I structure, and have found it difficult to visualize how peptides might diffuse into the binding site as it appears in the crystal structures. This is made all the more difficult when the relatively rapid association rates that have been measured are taken into account. A peptide-induced conformational change from a more “open” or “receptive” peptide-binding groove to the “closed” structure seen by x-ray crystallography would be consistent with these observations. The exact molecular dynamics that constitute this conformational change are entirely unknown at the present time, but a testable model has recently been proposed that involves a movement in the short α helix of the α2 domain (26Elliott T. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 375-379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A peptide-induced conformational change in the MHC class I molecule might also explain why newly assembled HC:β2-m heterodimers are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum until they become loaded with peptides of an appropriate length and sequence. It is possible that a cofactor in the ER with an ER-retention signal is able to bind to peptide-receptive but not peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules and that the ability to discriminate between the two forms is due to a peptide-induced conformational change. Indeed, in a nonphysiological experimental system, invariant chain (a cofactor molecule that is normally involved in the biogenesis of MHC class II molecules and not class I) has been shown to bind to H2-Dbin a peptide-sensitive manner (27Cerundolo V. Elliott T. Elvin J. Bastin J. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2243-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in vivo. Other, physiologically relevant candidates are the calcium-binding chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (28Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 29Suh W. Mitchell E.K. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Waneck G.L. Williams D.B. J. Exp.

The production of D1–193b and the demonstration that in the presence of specific optimal peptides it is recognized by conformation-sensitive mAb, provides, for the first time, a means of studying the peptide-induced conformational change by direct biophysical methods."
https://openalex.org/W1652974215,"In order to assess the role of β112 Cys in homo- and hetero-tetrameric hemoglobin formation, we expressed four β112 variants (β112Cys→Asp, β112Cys→Ser, β112Cys→Thr, and β112Cys→Val) and studied assembly with α chainsin vitro. β112 Cys is normally present at β1β2 and α1β1interaction sites in homo- (β4) and hetero-tetramers (α2β2). β4 formation in vitro was influenced by the amino acid at β112. β112 Asp completely inhibited formation of homo-tetramers, whereas β112 Ser showed only slight inhibition. In contrast, β112 Thr or Val enhanced homo-tetramer formation compared with βA chains. Association constants for homo-tetramer formation increased in the order of β112Cys→Ser, βA, β112Cys→Thr, and β112Cys→Val, whereas the value for β112Cys→Asp was zero under the same conditions. These β112 changes also affected in vitroα2β2 hetero-tetramer formation. Order of α2β2 formation under limiting α-globin chain conditions showed Hb βC112S > Hb A > Hb S = Hb βC112T = Hb βC112V >>> Hb βC112D. Hb β112D can form tetrameric hemoglobin, but this β112 change promotes dissociation into α and β chains instead of αβ dimer formation upon dilution. These results indicate that amino acids at α1β1 interaction sites such as β112 on the G helix play a key role in stable αβ dimer formation. Our findings suggest, in addition to electrostatic interaction between α and β chains, that dissociation of β4 homo-tetramers to monomers and hydrophobic interactions of the β112 amino acid with α chains governs stable α1β1 interactions, which then results in formation of functional hemoglobin tetramers. Information gained from these studies should increase our understanding of the mechanism of assembly of multi-subunit proteins. In order to assess the role of β112 Cys in homo- and hetero-tetrameric hemoglobin formation, we expressed four β112 variants (β112Cys→Asp, β112Cys→Ser, β112Cys→Thr, and β112Cys→Val) and studied assembly with α chainsin vitro. β112 Cys is normally present at β1β2 and α1β1interaction sites in homo- (β4) and hetero-tetramers (α2β2). β4 formation in vitro was influenced by the amino acid at β112. β112 Asp completely inhibited formation of homo-tetramers, whereas β112 Ser showed only slight inhibition.

Information gained from these studies should increase our understanding of the mechanism of assembly of multi-subunit proteins. Equimolar amounts of α- and β-globin chains of human hemoglobin self assemble to form α2β2tetramer. In addition, isolated β chains also assemble to form β4 homo-tetramers (1Bucci E. Fronticelli C. Chiancone E. Wyman J. Antonini E. Rossi-Fanelli A. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Extensive previous studies using naturally occurring variants and our recent studies using recombinant β chain variants showed that affinity between α and β chains is promoted by negatively charged β chains and is independent of charge location on the surface except at the α1β1interaction site (2Bunn H.F. McDonald M.J. Nature. 1983; 306: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Mrabet N.T. McDonald M.J. Turci S. Sarkar R. Szabo A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol.

Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that affinity is promoted by negatively charged β chains up to a maximum of two additional net negative charges (5Adachi K. Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Surrey S. Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that β112 Cys located at an α1β1 interaction site on the G helix is critical for facilitating formation of stable αβ dimers which then form functional hemoglobin tetramers. We also demonstrated that β112Cys→Asp inhibits formation of stable α1β1 and β1β2 interactions in α2β2 and β4 tetramers, respectively (5Adachi K. Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Surrey S. Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction analysis of β4 and α2β2 showed that β112 Cys on the G helix is involved in β1β2 and α1β1 subunit interactions, respectively, and that there is similarity between the quaternary structure of carbonmonoxy β4 and carbonmonoxy α2β2 tetramers (6Borgstahl G.E.O. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 817-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The detailed role of α1β1 interaction sites involving β112 Cys (G 14) in α2β2 and β4tetramer formation is, however, not clear. Assembly of hemoglobin tetramers at least in vitro occurs as shown in ReactionsI. (7McDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6487-6490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α chains are in monomer-dimer equilibrium and dissociation into monomers is favored, whereas the β chains are in monomer-tetramer equilibrium and association into tetramers is favored. It is generally assumed that dissociation of these oligomeric subunits (Reactions I and II) into monomers must occur before they can combine to form the αβ dimers (Reaction III). Two αβ dimers then associate to form tetrameric hemoglobin (Reaction IV). The dissociation of oligomeric β subunits is a first-order reaction, while assembly of αβ dimers from α and β monomers (Reaction III) is a second-order reaction (2Bunn H.F. McDonald M.J. Nature. 1983; 306: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Bunn H.F. Blood. 1987; 69: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7McDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6487-6490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of functional hemoglobin tetramers is dependent on these reactions (7McDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6487-6490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitroassembly of the liganded forms of α- and β-globin chains show that the rate of dissociation of β4 homo-tetramers is a rate-limiting step in formation of αβ hetero-tetramers (2Bunn H.F. McDonald M.J. Nature. 1983; 306: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, clarification of the role of β112 Cys at the α1β1 and β1β2interaction site on αβ and β4 formation, respectively, is critical in order to understand the mechanism of hemoglobin assembly. In this report, we expressed four β112 variants and characterized effects of these changes on α2β2 and β4 tetramer formation in vitro in order to further assess the role of β112 Cys on assembly of hemoglobin. Four β112 globin chain variants (e.g. β112 Ser, β112 Val, β112 Thr, and β112 Asp) were constructed and expressed using the pHE2β plasmid vector that contains cDNAs coding for each β chain variant and methionine aminopeptidase which was originally developed to express α and β chains at the same time (8Shen T-J.

The basic strategy for generation of these variants by site-specific mutagenesis of the normal β chain involves recombination/polymerase chain reaction as described previously (10Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis of the entire β-globin cDNA region using site-specific primers and fluorescently tagged terminators in a cycle sequencing reaction in which extension products were analyzed on an automated DNA sequencer. Plasmids were transfected into E. coli (JM 109) (Promega Co.), bacteria were grown at 30 °C, and soluble β-globin chain variants were isolated as described (5Adachi K. Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Surrey S. Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shen T-J. Ho N.T. Simplaceanu V. Zou M. Green B.N. Tam M.F. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of β-globin variants were basically as described previously (5Adachi K. Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Surrey S. Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shen T-J. Ho N.T. Simplaceanu V. Zou M. Green B.N. Tam M.F. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

However, cation-exchange chromatography on a Source 15 S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) instead of Superose 12 gel filtration was used for purification of the β chain variants. Authentic human hemoglobin, α-, βA (β6 Glu)- and βS(β6 Val)-globin chains were purified from erythrocyte lysates from normal controls and patients with sickle cell disease, respectively, according to previously described methods (11Ascoli F. Rossi-Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Removal ofp-mercuribenzoate from β chains was accomplished using 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; Hb, hemoglobin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. and globin chains were isolated using gel filtration on a Superose 12 column for the final purification step. Molecular mass and sample purity were assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Mutations in each purified β-globin chain variant were confirmed using mass spectral analysis. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed on a VG BioQ triple quadrapole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrincham, UK) using the multiple charged ion peaks from the α-globin chain (M r = 15,126.4) as reference for mass scale calibrations (13Shackleton C.H. Witkowska H.E. Desiderio D.M. Mass Spectrometry: Clinical and Biomedical Applications. 2. Plenum Press, New York1994: 135-199Crossref Google Scholar). Data analysis employed the MassLynx® software package (Micromass). Purified β-globin chains were also analyzed by cellulose acetate electrophoresis, and mobilities were compared with those of authentic human globin chains. Isoelectric focusing of purified β-globin variants, Hb A and Hb S, was performed on Ampholine PAG plates (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pH 5.5–8.5, using a Multiphor II system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After focusing for 2 h at a constant 25 watts at 4 °C, the gel plate was cut in half, one portion was stained using the JB-2 staining system (Isolab inc., Akron, Ohio) to detect heme proteins, and the other half was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma) to detect protein. Isoelectric point of each β-globin variant was estimated using a calibration curve prepared with isoelectric focusing standards (Bio-Rad). Absorption spectra of purified β-globins in the CO form were recorded using a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Instruments, Inc. Danbury, CT). Globin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 13.4 at 540 nm for carbonmonoxy hemoglobin (14Di Iorio E.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of β-globin variants were recorded using an Aviv model 62 DS instrument (Varian Analytical Instruments, San Fernando, CA) employing a 0.1-cm light path cuvette at 10 μm globin concentration. CD ellipticity of β-globin variants compared with normal βA was monitored between 190 and 260 nm. Oxygen dissociation curves of hemoglobin tetramers were determined in 50 mm Bis-Tris buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, at 20 °C using a Hemox Analyzer (TCS Medical Products, Huntingdon Valley, PA) (15Festa R.S. Asakura T. Transfusion. 1979; 19: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dissociation of β-globin homo-tetramers was studied by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a Superose 12 gel filtration column. β-Globin was mixed with blue dextran and vitamin B12, internal markers for determination of void volume (V 0) and total column volume (Vt), respectively. The final β-globin solution (1.5 to 75 μm) was injected into a Superose 12 column, and gel filtration was done using 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 4 °C. Elution coefficients were calculated using the following equation, whereVe represents elution volume of each sample. Kav=(Ve−V0)/(Vt−V0)Equation 1 α2β2 tetramer formation was assessed by mixing purified β chain variants (75 μ m) with varying amounts of α-globin chain in the CO form in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 25 °C (2Bunn H.F. McDonald M.J. Nature. 1983; 306: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 5Adachi K. Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Surrey S. Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and tetramer formation was monitored by FPLC using a Mono-S column. Assembled tetramers were characterized after separation from excess, free globin chains by FPLC using a Source 15 S column. Dissociation of in vitro assembled α2β2 tetramer into subunits was assessed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C by large zone chromatography using a Superose 12 gel filtration column (1 × 31 cm) as described previously (16Chiancone E.

Chem. 1977; 252: 74-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sample volumes of α2β2 variant tetramers (25 ml in 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) were equal to the column bed volumes. Elution was monitored at 405 nm using a 5-mm flow cell. Elution volume (Ve) was measured at the centroid of the ascending leading boundary (16Chiancone E. Gilbert L.M. Gilbert G.A. Kellett G.L. J.

Dissociation constants of α2β2 tetramers to αβ dimers were estimated by evaluation of the change inVe as a function of hemoglobin concentration (17Valdes Jr., R. Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 74-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandergriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We previously reported expression of β112Cys→Asp chains in bacteria (5Adachi K. Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Surrey S. Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to further define the role of β112 Cys in α2β2 and β4 tetramer formation, three additional β-globin chain variants (e.g. β112Cys→Ser, β112Cys→Thr, and β112Cys→Val) were expressed and characterized. Ser is similar in size to Cys, whereas Thr and Val are slightly larger. In addition, Ser and Thr are hydrophilic like Cys, whereas Val is highly hydrophobic. After DNA sequence confirmation, the three β-globin chain variants were expressed in bacteria and purified by a combination of two anion-exchange chromatography steps using DEAE-cellulose and Mono-Q columns (9Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Witkowska H.E. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26677-26683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Further purification was achieved using cation-exchange chromatography on a Source 15 S column. Purified βA chains migrate predominantly as 32-kDa dimers (9Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Witkowska H.E. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26677-26683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas the four β112 variants migrate mainly as 16-kDa monomers with small traces of dimers on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Addition of 20 mm DTT to the chains in solution prior to SDS-PAGE converts the dimers to monomers, indicating that small amounts of β93 Cys oxidize and form disulfide-linked dimers. Mass spectral analysis of the four β chain variants using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry resulted in values of 15,878.9, 15,850.3, 15,865.8, and 15,863.5 for β112Asp, β112Ser, β112Thr, and β112Val, respectively, which were in agreement with expected masses for the variant β-globin chains. Carbonmonoxy forms of all four variants showed typical absorption spectral characteristics of human hemoglobin chains with peaks at 568, 540, 419, 344, and 276 nm (14Di Iorio E.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), indicating correct heme insertion into the variant β-globin chains. CD spectra were also measured to examine structures of each β-globin variant compared with βA-globin chains (Fig.2). Ellipticities between 190 and 260 nm for the β-globin variants were almost identical to that of normal human and recombinant β-globin, but there are small differences in the region of the peak around 213 nm that are likely to be characteristic of these different β chains. Interestingly, the region of the peak of the spectrum for β112Val chains around 213 nm was slightly left shifted compared with those of βA, β112Asp, and β112Ser chains (Fig. 2). These CD results indicate that β-globin chain variants made in the E. coli were properly folded and had secondary structures similar to authentic β-globin. In addition, the differences in the spectrum for the β112Val chains may be a reflection of increased conformational changes. We previously reported that electrophoretic mobility on cellulose acetate of β112Cys→Asp chains was identical to βs chains (5Adachi K. Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Surrey S. Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that these chains migrate as monomers (charge of –2) rather than tetramers (charge of –4) like β4A chains (Fig. 3). In contrast, mobility of β112Cys→Val and β112Cys→Thr chains was identical to authentic human βA. These results indicate that conversion from Cys to Val or Thr at β112 does not cause significant changes in surface charge while conversion to Asp appears to increase net positive charge of the β-globin molecule because formation of monomers is favored rather than tetramers. Effect of β112 amino acid on β-globin charge was studied further by isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gel plates. β112Cys→Ser and β112Cys→Aspchains focused as sharp bands with pI values of 6.68 and 6.35, respectively, whereas β112Cys→Val and β112Cys→Thr chains had pI values of 6.30 and 6.68, respectively, but focused as diffuse bands possibly because they exist as mixtures of β chain monomer, dimer, and tetramer during electrophoresis (19Moulton D.P. Joshi A.A. Morris A. McDonald M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). β4 tetramer and β-monomer levels for each of the β chain variants were assessed by size-exclusion chromatography (17Valdes Jr., R. Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 74-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kawamura Y. Nakamura S. J.

A. 1978; 75: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). βA-Globin chains in solution exist as homo-tetramers (β4) rather than monomers in the absence of α-globin chains (1Bucci E. Fronticelli C. Chiancone E. Wyman J. Antonini E. Rossi-Fanelli A. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found previously that β112Cys→Asp chains exist as monomers rather than β4 tetramers (5Adachi K. Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Surrey S. Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to further characterize effects of the different β112 amino acids on tetramer formation, each β-globin variant was chromatographed on a Superose 12 gel-filtration column equilibrated with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 4 OC in order to separate tetrameric and monomeric species. The gel-filtration pattern of βA globin, which contains β112 Cys, depended on concentration and temperature. At 75 μm, βA chains eluted mainly as tetramers (86%) with a minor shoulder of monomers (14%) (Fig.4 a). The patterns of the variants depended on the β112 amino acid. When the same concentration as βA globin for each β chain variant was applied to the column, results showed that the β112Cys→Ser variant contained 51% tetramer and 49% monomer (Fig. 4 c), whereas the β112Cys→Thr variant contained a slightly higher percentage of tetramer than that of βA (Fig.4 d). The β112Cys→Val chains eluted only as tetramers when the concentration was 75 μm. Dilution of samples of the other β chain variants and βA chains decreased the amounts of tetramer while monomer amounts increased. In contrast, β112Cys→Asp chains eluted only as monomers at all hemoglobin concentrations used. The ratio of tetramer/monomer decreased as a function of β112 amino acid in the following order: β112Cys→Val > β112Cys→Thr > βA(112Cys) > β112Cys→Ser > β112Cys→Asp. Values for β112Cys→Thr and β112Cys→Val were 2- and 600-fold, respectively, higher than that for βA(112Cys) chains. Association constants for β4 homo-tetramer formation for the β112 variants was calculated using results from gel-filtration chromatography and are summarized in Table I. The βA-globin chain value (6 × 1016m−3) was similar to results reported previously (22Philo J.S. Lary J.W. Schuster T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 682-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The association constant for the β112Cys→Asp variant was 0 since this variant existed only as a monomer. It is interesting to note that dissociation of βS chains to monomers with decreasing concentrations was significantly less compared with that of βA. The tetramer association constant for βS chain monomers was about 30-fold higher than that of βA, indicating that the β6 Val mutation in βS also affects tetramer-monomer equilibrium and promotes homo-tetramer assembly.Table IHomo-tetramer/monomer association constants of purified β-globin variantsβ-Chain variantAssociation constant (m−3)βA(112Cys)6.03 ± 0.76 × 1016βS(112Cys)1.65 ± 0.16 × 1018β112Cys→Asp0β112Cys→Ser4.14 ± 0.80 × 1014β112Cys→Thr1.28 ± 0.35 × 1017β112Cys→Val3.78 ± 0.52 × 1019Association constants were calculated from monomer/tetramer ratios according to the equation, K = [β4]/[β]4 (20Kawamura Y.

Values were calculated from three to five independent experiments and represent the mean ± S.E. β-Globin readily forms hetero-tetramers (α2β2) in vitro in the presence of α-globin. Tetramers were formed in vitro, purified and separated from unreacted globins by chromatography, and then were analyzed by cellulose acetate electrophoresis (Fig. 3 B). We previously reported that β112 Asp chains did not form β4 tetramers but did form α2β2112Asp tetramers. All three new recombinant β-globin variants formed α2β2 tetramers in vitro. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis showed cathodic shifts in migration of tetramers compared with β chain variants upon binding of α-globin chains. It is interesting to note that, although individual β-globin chain variants migrated differently, all α2β2 tetramers containing the different β112 variants co-migrated to the same position as that of Hb A (Fig.3 B). We also performed functional studies of the variant tetramers in 50 mm BisTris buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 mNaCl at 20 °C in the presence and absence of 2,3-biphosphoglycerate and compared results with those of Hb A. Results of oxygen-binding properties for the β112 variant α2β2tetramers are summarized in Table II. Hb βC112S, Hb βC112T and Hb βC112V exhibited similar oxygen affinities and n values to those of Hb A tetramers. Oxygen affinity of recombinant Hb A was previously reported to be the same as that of normal human Hb A (5Adachi K. Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Surrey S.

Competition for α2β2hetero-tetramer formation between two different β-globin chains can be assessed by monitoring tetramer assembly in the presence of limiting amounts of α chains using 1:1 mixtures of the two different β-globin chains (3Mrabet N.T.

Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies in vitro showed that variant hemoglobin percentages were higher when using more negatively charged β chains like J-Baltimore (β16Gly→Asp) and N-Baltimore (β95Lys→Glu) (4Bunn H.F. Blood. 1987; 69: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Adachi K. Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Surrey S. Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggested that more negatively charged β chains bind positively charged α chains more readily than βA chains (2Bunn H.F. McDonald M.J. Nature. 1983; 306: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Mrabet N.T. McDonald M.J. Turci S. Sarkar R. Szabo A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol.

Blood. 1998; 91: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hb A tetramers formed twice as readily as Hb S, suggesting that βA chains interact with α chain more readily than βS under limiting α-globin conditions and that this was due to the positive net charge of Val instead of Glu at the β6 position (3Mrabet N.T.

In addition, our previous subunit competition studies with equimolar mixtures of βS and β112Cys→Asp chains in the presence of limiting α chains suggested that β112Cys (G14) is a key amino acid in formation of stable αβ dimers (5Adachi K.

On the basis of three-dimensional crystal structure analysis, we selected and analyzed six candidate sites interacting with the 3′-OH group of rNTP in T7 RNAP. We found that the Phe-644 and Phe-667 sites are responsible for the high selectivity of T7 RNAP for rNTPs. Also, we constructed the protein mutations of these residues, F644Y and F667Y, which display a >200-fold higher affinity than the wild type for 3′-dNTPs. These findings indicate that the phenylalanine residues of 644 and 667 specifically interact with the 3′-OH group. Thus, these mutants, F644Y and F667Y, with incorporation of 3′-dNTP terminators, which is similar to native rNTPs, can offer low backgrounds and equal intensities of the sequencing ladders in our method, called “transcriptional sequencing.” When analyzing the elongation mechanisms in T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP)by using site-directed mutagenesis and a protein expression system, we identified the recognition sites of the rNTP 3′-OH group in T7 RNAP.

T7 RNAP displays a stringent specificity for T7 promoter to initiate transcription. In T7 phage infection and the lytic cycle, T7 RNAP transcribes class II and III of the T7 phage genome (1Chamberlin M. Ring J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2245-2250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on three-dimensional structure analysis and mutagenesis of the Klenow fragment, the protein critical regions and structural motifs for polymerase activity have been suggested. Additionally, from sequence homologies of the Klenow fragment, Taq DNA polymerase, and T7 DNA polymerase, structural similarities have also been suggested in motifs A (532–555 aa), B (625–652 aa), and C (805–818 aa) (2Sousa R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 186-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). From mutagenesis analysis, the critical sites of primer recognition, metal ion binding, rNTP binding, and polymerase activity have been determined; however these do not necessarily coincide with the homologous motifs. Phenylalanine and tyrosine have been reported to play important roles in discriminating 2′- and 3′-OH groups inEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I (3Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 4Beese L.S. Friedman J.M. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14095-14101Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and TaqDNA polymerase (5Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the aromatic ring of phenylalanine or tyrosine is needed to discriminate the 2′- and 3′-OH groups. Using mutant characterization and three-dimensional structure analysis (6Sousa R. Chung Y.J. Rose J.P. Wang B.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), the catalytic domain of T7 RNAP was separated into the T7 promoter binding region (674–752 aa), Mg2+ binding sites (Asp-537, Asp-812), and essential regions of polymerase activity (motif A, motif B, motif C). To analyze the mechanism of the polymerase reaction, the interaction sites for the 2′- and 3′-OH group have been extensively examined (3Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 4Beese L.S. Friedman J.M. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14095-14101Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Recently, Tyr-639 in the active site has been reported to be a discrimination site for 2′-OH groups in T7 RNAP (7Sousa R. Padilla R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The Y639F mutant retains DNA and RNA polymerase activities but cannot discriminate rNTP from 2′-dNTPs. To further determine the mechanisms of the polymerase reaction, the 3′-OH discrimination site in the elongation step needed to be identified. However, details of the biochemical mechanism to discriminate the 3′-OH group of rNTPs by the T7 RNAP have not been clarified. Until now, Met-635 on T7 RNAP has been thought to be the interaction site of 3′-OH groups based on homology with the Klenow fragment. This has been the case because the affinity for the rNTP molecule decreases when mutation occurs on Met-635 (8Guajardo R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, Met-635 and Tyr-639 were thought to be the only discrimination sites of 2′- and 3′-OH groups, respectively. They were thought to be a part of the catalytic pocket due to their geometrical alignments. We found that the Phe-644 and Phe-667 sites that are located downstream of the Y639 site are important sites for interacting with the 3′-OH group of rNTPs in the T7 RNAP. These locations are the opposite of the location previously thought to be only one responsible for discriminating 2′- and 3′-OH groups. These findings suggest that the T7 RNAP may interact in several ways to the 3′-OH group of rNTPs in addition to Met-635. Our findings are in agreement with the reverse compensation theory of 2′- and 3′-OH groups proposed by Tabor and Richardson (5Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This discrimination mechanism of the 3′-OH group seems to have been conserved during the process of molecular evolution. Recently, we developed a novel sequencing method (transcriptional sequencing) using T7 RNAP. This reaction system was improved by the use of F644Y and F667Y mutants to incorporate 3′-dNTPs very efficiently (25Sasaki N. Izawa M. Watahiki M. Ohara E. Yoneda Y. Muramatsu M. Okazaki Y.

Before all of the experiments, the quantity of T7 RNAP enzyme was calibrated, and each sample was adjusted with respect to their protein quantities. Relative activity and processivity were assayed by measuring the amount of the radioactive substrates using DE81 paper binding assay as described elsewhere (7Sousa R. Padilla R.

Bacteriophage T7 RNAP catalyzes the phosphodiester bond formation between the 5′-phosphate group and the 3′-OH group of rNTP, resulting in elongation of the nascent RNA chain. To understand the sites to be mutated, we analyzed the three-dimensional structure, paying attention to the region of helix Y(625–634 aa), loop (635–648aa) – helix Z (649–658 aa), loop (658–684 aa) in T7 RNAP. It has been reported that the mutants of Lys-631, Tyr-639, Gly-640, Asp-812, and Asp-537 were characterized among the amino acid residues existing on the protein surface (14Osumi-Davis P.A. de Aguilera M.C. Woody R.W. Woody A.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Osumi-Davis P.A. Sreerama N. Volkin D.B. Middaugh C.R. Woody R.W. Woody A.Y. J. Mol.

Sousa R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25120-25128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among these residues, Asp-812 and Asp-537 were identified as being critical for binding to the metal ion (18Woody A.Y. Eaton S.S. Osumi-Davis P.A. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Lys-631, Tyr-639, and Gly-640 were located inside motif B or in its vicinity. The Tyr-639 site is known to be important for rNTP/dNTP discrimination (7Sousa R. Padilla R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). On the basis of the known sites interacting with the 2′- or 3′-OH group, we hypothesized the aromatic residues of polymerases to be 3′-OH group to be candidates for discrimination sites. This concept is supported by reports that the 2′- or 3′-OH discrimination sites are Phe-762 and Phe-766 of E. coli DNA polymerase I (3Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 4Beese L.S. Friedman J.M. Steitz T.A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and Tyr-737 of mycobacterium DNA polymerase I (20Valerie M. Huberts P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4845-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These studies have suggested that the aromatic moiety of phenylalanine and tyrosine residues can discriminate 2′- or 3′-OH groups. We further hypothesized that the para-H group of the aromatic ring of phenylalanine interacts with 2′- and 3′-OH groups of rNTP, and thepara-OH group in tyrosine interacts with 2′- and 3′-H groups, with hydrogen bond formation to stabilize these complexes. This stabilization triggers the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes to the catalysis-mediated transition state. With this in mind, we analyzed the aromatic residues in the 625–684 aa region in T7 RNAP and selected Phe-644, Phe-646, and Phe-667 as important candidates for discriminating the 3′-OH group. We then constructed the mutants of each site: F644Y, F646Y, and F667Y. We also selected other residues on the protein surface of the T7 RNAP catalytic domain and constructed the mutants F733Y, F782Y, and F882Y for comparative analysis. By sequencing several clones obtained by PCR, we found that our sequence was different form that present in the GenBank data base. Additionally, the sequence of T7 genome matched our data. For example, proline 665 was substituted by leucine in the region estimated for the rNTP binding. Since at site 665 there may be leucine in the sequencing at the T7 genome, we considered T7 RNAP with leucine at the 665 site to be the wild-type T7 RNAP. We also constructed an add-back mutant substituting with proline at Leu-665 (L665P) for comparison with respect to processivity and 2′- or 3′-OH discrimination efficiencies. No differences were noted between the L665P and wild type (data not shown). We analyzed the effects of processivity, relative activity, and 3′-dATP incorporation efficiencies in each mutant polymerase (Fig. 2, Table I, and TableII). Table I shows the correlation between the disruptive effects of the relative activity by the mutations. Among the constructed mutants, F882Y showed marked reduction in relative activity to the wild type. The Phe-882 site has been reported to be the contact site with the base of rNTP during the elongation process. The marked decrease in F882Y activity is thought to occur because the mutations affected the ability for extension, resulting in disruption of the elongation reaction (21Mookhtiar K.A Peluso P.S. Muller D.K Dunn J.J. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6305-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Some mutants show reductions in transcriptional activity, but these reductions were not drastic because the substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine is a small conformational change on T7 RNAP.Table IRelative activity of T7 RNA polymerase mutantMutation siteRelative activities of RNAP activity comparing with wild typeF882YNDF733Y0.65F782Y0.31F646Y0.39F644Y0.63F667Y0.56F644Y/F667Y0.45Y639F0.12Wild type1.00The relative activity of each RNA polymerase mutant was measured as the incorporated rate of [α-32P]UTP.

Fig. 2 shows the results of determination of mutant processivities, using closed circular reeler cDNA, which is the transcript responsible for reeler mouse mutant clone (22Hirotsune S. Takahara T. Sasaki N. Hirose K. Yoshiki A. Ohashi T. Kusakabe M. Murakami Y. Muramatsu M. Watanabe S. Nakao K. Katsuki M. Hayashizaki Y. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) as the template. Processivity values were determined from differences in the length of transcripts. We could not find any significant difference in the processivity of F667Y, F646Y, and Y639F mutants compared with the wild-type polymerase. No other changes were observed for the processivity of other mutants. As shown in Table II and Fig.3, the Phe-644 and Phe-667 residues specifically recognizing the 3′-OH group were determined by analyzing the 3′-dATP incorporation rate in polymerases. Table II shows the 3′-dATP incorporation efficiencies to the elongation chain with plasmid DNA pBS linearized with PvuII as the template. The different properties for recognizing the 3′-dATP substrate among the mutants were determined by analyzing the inhibitory effects by 3′-dATP on the extension of the elongation chains. This assay shows that the mutations of F644Y and F667Y affect the ability of the enzyme to recognize the structural differences between rNTPs OH and the 3′-dATP H groups. Thus, 3′-dATP is a good substrate for F644Y and F667Y mutants. In comparison, the substitution of tyrosine at 646 reduced the incorporation rate of 3′-dATP. With the F644Y and F667Y mutants, the incorporation rates of 3′-dATP differed and the specificity for recognizing the 3-OH group was better for the F644Y than for the F667Y mutant. This shows that the mechanism for recognizing the 3′-OH group differs between the two residues. Fig. 3 shows the quantitative comparison of inhibitory effects to the transcription of mutant and wild-type polymerases when the 3′-dATP was added to the transcriptional reaction using the closed circular reeler cDNA clones as the template (22Hirotsune S. Takahara T. Sasaki N. Hirose K. Yoshiki A. Ohashi T. Kusakabe M. Murakami Y. Muramatsu M. Watanabe S. Nakao K. Katsuki M. Hayashizaki Y. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The incorporation rates of wild-type polymerase for 3′-dATP as the substrate were clearly lower than those of F644Y. As shown in Table II, this mutant increases the 3′-dATP incorporation rates. Whereas transcripts produced by the wild-type enzyme extended almost to the terminal end of the template, most transcripts produced by F644Y polymerase terminated at approximately 100 base pairs, and the full-length transcript yield produced by F644Y decreased to a few percent of all transcripts produced (Fig. 3). Similar results were found with F667Y (data not shown). These results indicate that Phe-644 and Phe-667 are important sites for 3′-OH group discrimination in T7 RNAP. In a similar assay system using E. coli DNA polymerase I, Taq DNA polymerase, and T7 DNA polymerase, effects similar to those in Fig. 3were reported by Tabor and Richardson (5Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In our examination, F644Y and F667Y did not incorporate 2′-dNTP. This indicates that Phe-644 and Phe-667 might not be involved in the 2′-OH recognition (data not shown). Recently, Tyr-639 residue has been reported to be a discrimination site for 2′-OH groups in T7 RNAP (7Sousa R. Padilla R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this work, we also examined whether or not Y639F is a discrimination site for 3′-OH group of rNTPs. As a consequence, the Y639F mutant showed no differences in the incorporation rate between 3′-dATP and NTP (Table II), as reported recently by Huang et al. (23Huang Y. Eckstein F. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8231-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This mutant also showed no changes in its ability to discriminate and incorporate 3′-dCTP, 3′-dGTP, 3′-dUTP substrate (data not shown). Table III shows the differences of 3′-dNTP recognition rates among the wild type and the mutants. We determined the inhibitory effects on transcription by adding 3′-dATP at various concentrations and by using the closed circular reeler cDNA clone as the template. We found that the incorporation efficiencies of 3′-dNTP by F644Y and F667Y were affected by the structural differences in their base moieties. However, activities of 3′-dNTP incorporation for F644Y and F667Y were >100-fold greater than the wild-type polymerase.Table IIIRelative selectivity of F644Y, F667Y/L665P, and wild-type T7 RNA polymerase for 3′-dNTPs and rNTPs3′-dATP/rATP3′-dUTP/rUTP3′-dCTP/rCTP3′-dGTP/rGTPF644Y46.08–50.5383.89–86.11127.71–130.0141.61–44.10F667Y38.76–41.8168.23–70.32115.79–118.4334.92–37.1Wild type0.23–0.240.31–0.340.59–0.610.30–0.34The rates of each 3′-dNTP incorporation to rNTP are compared for F644Y and F667Y mutants and wild-type T7 RNA polymerase. The template and reaction buffer are given in Fig. 2 and Table I, respectively. 3′-dNTPs concentrations were 500 μm and 250 μm. Open table in a new tab The rates of each 3′-dNTP incorporation to rNTP are compared for F644Y and F667Y mutants and wild-type T7 RNA polymerase. The template and reaction buffer are given in Fig. 2 and Table I, respectively. 3′-dNTPs concentrations were 500 μm and 250 μm. The Tyr-639 mutant was similar to its wild-type T7 RNAP with respect to 3′-dNTP discrimination (data not shown). The scale of the effect of 3′-dNTP incorporation on F644Y and F667Y activity was 3′-dUTPs > 3′-dCTPs > 3′-dATP > 3′-dGTP. The F644Y mutant led to more efficient incorporation than the F667Y mutant with respect to the discrimination rate of 3′-dNTP versus rNTP. The relative affinity among 3′-dNTP and rNTP in the mutants was >100-fold greater than in comparison to the wild type. Similar findings were reported forE. coli DNA polymerase I (5Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In consideration of all these findings, we suggest that Phe-644 and Phe-667 are the key residues in 3′-OH discrimination. We recently developed a novel sequencing method (transcriptional sequencing) to resolve the problems encountered in existing sequencing methods using DNA polymerase (25Sasaki N. Izawa M. Watahiki M. Ohara E. Yoneda Y. Muramatsu M. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3455-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transcriptional sequencing offers the advantages of a high throughput, time savings, and automation for genome projects and clinical diagnosis. In transcriptional sequencing, the extension reaction is carried out with T7 RNAP, in contrast to existing methods that use T7 DNA polymerase orTaq DNA polymerase (24Vander Horn P.B. Davis M.C. Cunniff J.J. Ruan C. McArdle B.F. Samols S.B. Szasz J. Hu G. Hujer K.M. Domke S.T. Brummet S.R. Moffett R.B. Fuller C.W. Biotechniques. 1997; 22: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The method being reported on (25Sasaki N. Izawa M. Watahiki M. Ohara E. Yoneda Y. Muramatsu M. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3455-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) is based on the chain termination reaction, performed by using 3′-dNTPs as the terminator instead of dideoxy-NTPs in DNA polymerase-based sequencing. In the DNA chain termination reaction method, nativeTaq DNA polymerase had the problem of imbalance of incorporation efficiencies for dideoxy-NTPs on the elongation chain, leading to a loss of uniformity in the sequencing ladder, and consequently obtained signals that were difficult to analyze. Recently, these problems were overcome by thermo sequenase, which produces a better uniformity of incorporation (24Vander Horn P.B. Davis M.C. Cunniff J.J. Ruan C. McArdle B.F. Samols S.B. Szasz J. Hu G. Hujer K.M. Domke S.T. Brummet S.R. Moffett R.B. Fuller C.W. Biotechniques. 1997; 22: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transcriptional sequencing using F644Y and F667Y overcame problems in a similar fashion to those reported by Tabor and Richardson (5Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This improvement of the sequencing pattern can be seen from Fig.4, which presents the sequencing analysis of the human thyrotropin-β cDNA (13Hayashizaki Y. Miyai K. Kato K. Matsubara K. FEBS Lett. 1985; 188: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) PCR product by transcriptional sequencing with F644Y in comparison with its wild type. The use of F644Y mutant allowed us to obtain uniform and long sequence signals. These signals were similar to those obtained with the F667Y mutant (data not shown). In Fig. 4, the sequence signals indicated as arrowheads are high background signals, which did not change. Only the intensity of the correct signals increased for the F644Y mutant, thus yielding results of higher accuracy and confidence levels when the F644Y and F667Y mutants were used (25Sasaki N. Izawa M. Watahiki M. Ohara E. Yoneda Y. Muramatsu M. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3455-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the Phe-644 and Phe-667 sites on T7 RNAP are important for 3′-OH group discrimination. In the protein structure, Phe-644 is located in the region of the loop (635–647 aa) between helix Y(624–634 aa) and helix Z(648–658 aa) in the catalytic domain. The loop between helix Y and helix Z contains important residues discriminating the rNTP molecule because Tyr-639 is located in this loop. The Phe-667 site is located in the region of the loop (659–684 aa) between helix Z (648–658 aa) and helix AA685–700 aa). Three-dimensional analysis suggests that these loops are positioned in the neighborhood of the rNTP molecule. Thus, Phe-644 and Phe-667 in the two loops seem to closely interact to the 3′-OH group of the elongating rNTP molecule during the 3′-dNTP discrimination phase of the reaction. Experimental results using in vitro mutagenesis have shown that Met-635 (8Guajardo R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and Tyr-639 (7Sousa R. Padilla R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) interact with 3′-OH and 2′-OH groups, respectively. The geometries of Met-635 and Tyr-639 are very important to interact with 3′-OH and 2′-OH groups. However, our data indicated that the geometrical alignment of T7 RNAP and the rNTP molecule also lies downstream of Tyr-639. This geometrical alignment to Phe-644 and Phe-667 is the opposite of that between Met-635 and Tyr-639. These findings suggest that in T7 RNAP, there are at least two ways to access the 3′-OH group. This data agrees with the reverse compensation theory of the OH and H groups (5Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) on the polymerase-substrate complex, because the phenylalanine on T7 RNAP was found to be a very good target for discriminating the 3′-OH group. Thus, this mechanism, which makes use of the aromatic moiety, is conserved in the process of molecular evolution of polymerases. Mutation of Phe-644 and Phe-667 to tyrosine increased the 3′-dNTP incorporation, but F644Y showed better incorporation than F667Y and Phe-644, which is located in the neighborhood of the Tyr-639, which was reported to be the 2′-OH discrimination site (7Sousa R. Padilla R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This suggests that the Phe-644 directly interacts with the 3′-OH group, whereas the Phe-667 has indirect discrimination activity, such as that via metal ions. In addition, mutation of both sites to tyrosine (F644Y/F667Y) increased the incorporation rate of 3′-dATP better than that for F644Y or F667Y mutants. As shown in Tables II and III, these results suggest that Phe-644 and Phe-667 residues access the 3′-OH group from different directions. Until now, Met-635 on T7 RNAP was considered to be an important site for interacting with the 3′-OH group because of its sequence homology to E. coli DNA polymerases I and the fact that mutation of Met-635 to alanine on T7 RNAP causes a large increase inK m values for rNTP (8Guajardo R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, these results could not be confirmed directly for 3′-OH discrimination; only the mutant of this site, Met-635, has low affinity to rNTP, and the direct evidence has not yet been shown that Met-635 recognizes 3′-OH group directly. We found that Phe-644 and Phe-667 mutated to tyrosine, F644Y and F667Y, in order to incorporate 3′-dNTPs on the order of 100–270-fold greater in comparison to the wild type. Similar results were obtained when the 3′-OH discrimination residue in DNAP I (Phe-762) was mutated (5Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that two sites in T7 RNAP (Phe-644, Phe-667) are key residues for 3′-OH discrimination. This suggests that other DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases, and reverse transcriptases may have direct or indirect sites for 3′-OH discrimination and such residues have not yet been identified. Our observations suggest that further work on elongation analysis and 2′ and 3′-OH discrimination mechanisms is required. By using the F644Y and F667Y mutants, highly accurate and confident signals were obtained because of the lower discrimination between rNTPs and 3′-dNTPs. As reported (25Sasaki N. Izawa M. Watahiki M. Ohara E. Yoneda Y. Muramatsu M. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3455-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), transcriptional sequencing has advantages for the genome field.

We now show that, in both LEC18 and LEC14 cells, GlcNAc transfer is mediated by a distinctN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAc-T) activity.

Genet. 1989; 15: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) expresses GlcNAc-TIII (5Narasimhan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10235-10242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the N-glycans of glycoproteins made in LEC10 cells include a proportion that contain the bisecting GlcNAc (3Campbell C. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13370-13378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LEC11, LEC12, LEC29, and LEC30 CHO mutants each express an α(1,3)fucosyltransferase activity that is not detectable in parent CHO cells, and they synthesize N-glycans with fucose in O-3 linkage to the GlcNAc of lactosamine units (6Campbell C. Stanley P. Cell. 1983; 35: 303-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Potvin B. Stanley P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Howard D.R. Fukuda M. Fukuda M.N. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16830-16837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LEC14 and LEC18 CHO mutants are gain-of-function mutants that were obtained, after mutagenesis, by selection for resistance to pea lectin (9Ripka J. Stanley P. Som. Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). They have unique and distinct lectin resistance properties and behave dominantly in somatic cell hybrids formed with parent CHO cells (9Ripka J. Stanley P. Som. Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Structural analyses of complex N-glycans from LEC14 and LEC18 revealed that both add a specific sugar residue toN-glycans that is not present on N-glycans from CHO cell glycoproteins (10Raju T.S. Ray M.K. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30294-30302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Raju T.S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7484-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In LEC18 cells, a proportion of the complex, polylactosamine-containing N-glycans contain an additional GlcNAc in the core region at the O-6 position of the β(1,4)-GlcNAc adjacent to the β-linked core Man residue (Ref. 10Raju T.S. Ray M.K. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30294-30302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). This O-6-linked GlcNAc residue is absent from similarN-glycans of parental CHO cells and has not been observed on glycoproteins from other sources. In LEC14 cells, a proportion of the complex, polylactosamine-containing N-glycans contain an additional GlcNAc linked β(1,2) to the β(1,4)-Man residue of the core (Ref. 11Raju T.S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7484-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). CHO cells lack this modification, which has to date been observed only in N-glycans from LEC14 cells. The novel N-glycan cores, which are synthesized by LEC14 and LEC18 mutants, suggested that each mutant expresses a GlcNAc-T activity that is silent in parental CHO cells, in a manner analogous to the previously described gain-of-function CHO mutants (2Stanley P. Raju T.S. Bhaumik M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that this is indeed the case. These novel activities, termed GlcNAc-TVII (LEC14) and GlcNAc-TVIII (LEC18), generate in vitro, the N-glycan core characteristic of LEC14 and LEC18 glycoproteins, respectively. UDP-6-[3H]GlcNAc (6.1 Ci/mmol), concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose, and Sephadex G-25 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Pea lectin (PSA)-agarose was from Vector Laboratories. Bio-Gel P-2 (45–90 mesh), the Bradford protein reagent, and AG1-X4 resin (200–400 mesh, Cl− form) were from Bio-Rad.N-Acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidases (Diplococcus pneumoniae and bovine kidney), Pronase (Streptomyces griseus), and protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Boehringer Mannheim or Prozyme, and jack beanN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase was from Oxford GlycoSciences. d-(+)-Glc, d-(+)-Gal,d-(+)-Man, d-(+)-Fuc, d-(+)-GlcN,d-(+)-GalN, methyl α-d-mannoside (MM), methyl α-d-glucoside, GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP, Galβ1-O-pNP, Glcβ1-O-pNP, Manβ1-O-pNP, GalNAcβ1-O-pNP, GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP, GlcNAcβ1-S-pNP, GlcNAcβ1-O-benzyl, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GalNAc, ATP, Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, human IgG, human fibrinogen, chicken ovalbumin, chitin, chloramine T, potassium metabisulfite, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Sodium hydroxide (50%, w/v) and other reagent grade chemicals were from Fisher. Oligomannosyl glycopeptides were prepared from chicken egg ovalbumin as described (12Huang C.-C. Mayer Jr., H.E. Montgomery R. Carbohydr. Res. 1970; 13: 127-137Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar); biantennary N-linked glycopeptides (GnGn) with no fucose and terminating with GlcNAc were isolated from human fibrinogen as described (13Townsend R.R.

Chem. 1982; 257: 9704-9710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the corresponding glycopeptides with fucose (GnGn(Fuc)) were prepared from human IgG.N,N′-Diacetylchitobiose andN,N′,N""-triacetylchitotriose were isolated from chitin essentially as described by Rupley et al. (14Rupley J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 83: 245-255PubMed Google Scholar). Glycopeptides with the structures shown in Fig. 1 were obtained from glycoproteins of LEC14 and LEC18 cells as described (10Raju T.S. Ray M.K. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30294-30302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Raju T.S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7484-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown in suspension at 37 °C in complete α medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% bovine calf serum. Parent CHO (Pro−5) and Pro−LEC18.21B, Pro−LEC14.4A, and Pro−LEC10.3C mutant CHO cells were described previously (3Campbell C. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13370-13378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ripka J. Stanley P. Som. Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Postnuclear supernatant from LEC18, LEC14, and parent CHO cells was prepared essentially as described (15Chaney W. Sundaram S. Friedman N. Stanley P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2089-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (∼6 × 106) were washed two times with saline, followed by one wash with homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 250 mm sucrose), and incubated in 1 ml of homogenizing buffer on ice. After 20 min, the swollen cells were homogenized using a Balch Homogenizer (Industrial Tectonics Inc., Dexter, Michigan; basic diameter = 0.2489 inches, tungsten carbide, part p592492) at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Glycerol was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 20%, before storage at −70 °C. For preparation of microsomal membranes, postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h at 4 °C. For LEC10 cells, extraction after cell washing was in 1.5% Triton X-100, to which glycerol was added to 20% final volume before storage at −70 °C. Enzyme assays with cell extracts were carried out in 1-ml Eppendorf tubes in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 12.5 nmol of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (∼5500 cpm/nmol), 1.5 μmol of MnCl2, 0.5 μmol of ATP, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 μmol of sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, 5–10 μl of extract (∼50–100 μg of protein), and one of the following as acceptor molecule: 50 nmol of GlcNAc, GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP, Galβ1-O-pNP, Glcβ1-O-pNP, Manβ1-O-pNP, GlcNAcβ1-S-pNP, GlcNAcβ1-O-benzyl, or ∼74 nmol of GnGn or GnGn(Fuc) for 90 min at 37 °C. To assay GlcNAc-TIII activity, ∼50–100 μg of LEC10 extract was incubated in a final volume of 40 μl with ∼40–180 nmol of GnGn or GnGn(Fuc), in the presence of 50 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.0, protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim tablet) according to manufacturer's instructions, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.2m GlcNAc, and 24 nmol of UDP-GlcNAc (∼25,000 cpm/nmol) for 2 h at 37 °C. Assays lacking acceptor were used to determine incorporation into endogenous acceptors and degradation of donor sugar. After incubation at 37 °C for 15–120 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 950 μl of cold water. Reactions containing simple sugars or the glycopeptides, GnGn or GnGn(Fuc) were passed through a 1-ml column of AG1-X4 (Cl− form) that was subsequently washed with 3 ml of water. Eluate and washings were combined, mixed with 17 ml of Ecolume, and counted by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Reactions with GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP, GlcNAcβ1-S-pNP, and GlcNAcβ1-O-benzyl acceptors were passed through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters), and radiolabeled product was eluted with 50% aqueous methanol as described (16Wilkes C. Pierce M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. To characterize GlcNAc-T reaction products, terminated reactions were pooled, concentrated to 2 ml, and desalted on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (1.5 cm × 70 cm). The column was eluted under pressure with glass distilled water at a flow rate of 15–20 ml/h, and fractions of 2 ml were collected. Under these conditions, charged molecules may interact with the acrylamide and elute anomalously rather than according to molecular weight. A portion of each fraction (0.5 ml) was mixed with 5 ml of Ecolume, and radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Assay tubes, in which GnGn or GnGn(Fuc) were acceptors, were adjusted to 1 ml with cold water and passed through a 1-ml column of AG1-X4 resin (Cl− form) that was subsequently washed with 3 ml of water. Combined eluate and washings were concentrated to ∼250 μl, mixed with 2× ConA buffer (0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.02 mMgCl2, 0.02 m CaCl2, 0.02m MnCl2, 0.04% sodium azide, pH 7.3), and applied to a ConA-Sepharose column (0.5 cm × 20 cm). The column was washed with at least 10 column volumes of ConA buffer before bound glycopeptides were eluted with at least 4 column volumes of ConA buffer containing 10 mm methyl-α-d-glucoside, followed by ConA buffer containing 10 mm MM, and finally 200 mm MM in ConA buffer. Reaction products were also fractionated on PSA-agarose (0.5 cm × 20 cm) and eluted with ConA buffer followed by ConA buffer containing 200 mm MM. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and a portion was counted by scintillation spectroscopy. Pooled products from lectin columns were desalted on Bio-Gel P-2 (1.5 cm × 70 cm) and characterized by glycopeptide mapping using a Dionex HPAEC-PAD. Product analysis by HPAEC-PAD was performed using a Dionex Bio-LC gradient pump and a pulsed amperometric model PAD-2 detector (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) as described (17Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, GlcNAc-T reactions containing GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP acceptor were passed through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, and the 50% aqueous methanol eluant was dried using a Savant Speed Vac, resuspended in 50–100 μl of glass distilled water, passed through a Centrex filter (Schleicher & Schuell), and analyzed by HPAEC-PAD using a CarboPac PA-10 (4 mm × 250 mm) pellicular anion-exchange column equipped with a CarboPac guard column. The column was eluted with 15 mm NaOH generated from 15% eluant 1 (100 mm NaOH) and 85% eluant 2 (water) for 25 min, followed by eluant 3 (500 mm NaOH) for 10 min, at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. The following pulse potentials and durations were used: E 1 = 0.05 V (t 1 = 300 ms); E 2 = 0.65 V (t 2 = 180 ms); E 3 = −0.65 V (t 3 = 60 ms). Detection was with 1000 nm full scale. A Dionex Advanced Computer Interface connected to a Gateway 2000, 4SX-33V computer with Dionex AI-450 software (release 3.32.00) was used to collect the data. For radioactivity measurement, fractions of 0.5 min (0.45 ml), were collected, mixed with 5 ml of Ecolume, and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Transferase reactions containing GnGn or GnGn(Fuc) glycopeptide acceptors were passed through a 1-ml column of AG1-X4 resin (Cl− form) that was subsequently washed with 3 ml of water. The combined eluate and washings were concentrated to ∼1 ml, desalted on Bio-Gel P-2 (1.5 × 70 cm), dried, resuspended in 50–100 μl of glass distilled water, passed through a Centrex filter, and analyzed by HPAEC-PAD. A CarboPac PA-1 column (4 mm × 250 mm) was used with 100 mm NaOH (eluant 1) and 100 mmNaOH containing 1 m NaOAc (eluant 4). Elution was isocratic with 2% eluant 4 for 10 min, linearly increasing eluant 4 to 80% over 60 min and, finally, 80% eluant 4 isocratically for another 20 min. For radioactivity determination, fractions of 1 min were collected and counted by scintillation spectroscopy. The novel GlcNAc-T activity in LEC18 cells transferred GlcNAc to both GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP and to a glycopeptide substrate (see “Results”). To investigate whether a single GlcNAc-T performed both reactions, the activities were compared following treatment with increasing temperatures or with the oxidizing agent chloramine T (18Stanley E.R. Guilbert L.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1981; 42: 253-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For heat inactivation, LEC18 cell extracts (∼500 μg of protein in 50 μl of extraction buffer/tube in duplicate) were placed in a water bath set at the appropriate temperature for 10 min before being returned to 4 °C and then assayed at 37 °C under standard conditions with both GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP and glycopeptide acceptor GnGn, and in the absence of acceptor. For chemical inactivation, LEC18 cell extract (∼300 μg of protein in 30 μl of extraction buffer/tube in duplicate) were incubated on ice with 15 μl of buffer alone or 15 μl of buffer containing increasing concentrations of chloramine T. After 5 min at 4 °C, 15 μl of potassium metabisulfite at the same concentration as the chloramine T was added to stop the oxidation reaction. Subsequently, treated extracts were assayed under standard conditions with both GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP and GnGn acceptors, and in the absence of acceptor. Transferase reactions containing GnGn or GnGn(Fuc) acceptors were passed through a 1-ml column of AG1-X4 resin (Cl−form), washed with 3 ml of water, and the combined eluate was desalted on Bio-Gel P-2, dried, and redissolved in buffer appropriate for digestion with differentN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidases. Jack beanN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase digestion was performed in 50–100 μl of sodium citrate phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) at 37 °C under toluene for 48 h with a total of 50 milliunits of enzyme. D. pneumoniae or bovine kidneyN-acetyl-β-d-hexosaminidase digestion was performed in 50–100 μl of sodium citrate phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37 °C under toluene for 25–48 h with a total of 50–100 milliunits of enzyme. Digestion was stopped by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and products were desalted on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (1.5 cm × 70.0 cm) before analysis by HPAEC-PAD as described above for GnGn and GnGn(Fuc) product analysis. To determine if the LEC18 product from GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP was susceptible to digestion withN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, ∼3,500 cpm product was digested for 24 h under the conditions described above with N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase fromD. pneumoniae. As controls,N,N′-diacetylchitobiose,N,N′,N""-triacetylchitotriose, andN,N′-diacetylchitobioseβ1-O-pNP (100 μg each) were digested under the same conditions with either jack bean or bovine testis or D. pneumoniae N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase. Chitobiose and chitotriose digests were dried, resuspended in 15 μl of 15% aqueous acetic acid containing 9-aminopyrene 1,3,5-trisulfonate to which ∼5 μl of sodium cyanoborohydride in THF was added, and incubated at 65 °C for 2 h. The derivatization reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of cold water. The mixture was analyzed using a capillary electropherograph (P/ACE System 5000, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with an argon ion laser induced fluorescence detector and a coated capillary at 20 kV. The digests of LEC18 product from GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP and the chitobioseβ1-O-pNP standard were analyzed by Dionex HPAEC-PAD as described above. A subset of complex N-glycans in LEC18 glycoproteins carry a GlcNAc linked to the O-6 position of the core GlcNAc residue (Fig. 1). A GlcNAc-T capable of performing this transfer might act on simple monosaccharide acceptors, similar to chitin synthases (19Wagner G.P. EXS. 1994; 69: 559-577PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bakkers J. Semino C.E. Stroband H. Kijne J.W. Robbins P.W. Spaink H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7982-7986Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), or to the GlcNAc-T from the snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, that transfers GlcNAc in β1,4-linkage to simple GlcNAc derivatives and to terminal GlcNAc residues of N- and O-glycans (21Bakker H.

Therefore, extracts from LEC18 cells were tested for their ability to transfer GlcNAc to simple monosaccharide acceptors. Initial assays, under conditions similar to those used for the snail GlcNAc-T (21Bakker H. Agterberg M. van Tetering A. Koeleman C.A. Van den Eijnden D.H. van Die I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30326-30333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), revealed that, among a variety of simple sugars, GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP was the only significant acceptor of GlcNAc with LEC18 cell extract, and that parent CHO cell extract had no comparable activity. Interestingly, LEC18 extract had no detectable activity with GlcNAcβ1-S-pNP, whereas this acceptor is optimum for the snail GlcNAc-T (21Bakker H. Agterberg M. van Tetering A. Koeleman C.A. Van den Eijnden D.H. van Die I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30326-30333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LEC18 GlcNAc-T also did not transfer GlcNAc at significant levels under these assay conditions to free GlcNAc, chitobiose (GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc), or chitotriose (GlcNAcβ1,4Gl cNAcβ1,4GlcNAc), showing that it also differs from chitin synthase activities (19Wagner G.P. EXS. 1994; 69: 559-577PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bakkers J. Semino C.E. Stroband H. Kijne J.W. Robbins P.W. Spaink H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7982-7986Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several other simple oligosaccharides were also not acceptors (TableI), and neither UDP-Glc nor UDP-GalNAc could substitute for UDP-GlcNAc as a donor sugar (data not shown).Table ILEC18 cell extract transfers GlcNAc to GlcNAcβ1-O-pNPAcceptorSpecific activityParentLEC18nmol/mg/hGlcNAcβ1-O-pNP0.182.72GlcNAcα1-O-pNP0.010.01GlcNAcβ1-S-pNP0.10.14GlcNAcβ1-O-benzyl0.20.3GalNAcβ1-O-pNP0.20.23GalNAcα1-O-pNP0.010.01Glcβ1-O-pNP0.010.05Galβ1-O-pNP0.010.01Manβ1-O-pNP0.010.01Man5GlcNAc2Asn0.010.01GlcNAc0.30.3GalNAc0.10.1Gal0.030.03Glc0.020.02Man0.020.02Galβ1,4Glc0.010.01GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc0.050.05GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc0.050.05Cell extracts were incubated with ∼50 nmol of acceptor as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Duplicates were performed and the results shown are the average of at least two and up to six independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Cell extracts were incubated with ∼50 nmol of acceptor as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Duplicates were performed and the results shown are the average of at least two and up to six independent experiments. Conditions for optimal solubilization of the LEC18 GlcNAc-T were tested with 14 different detergents. At 0.5% final concentration, maximum activity was obtained with Triton X-100 followed by Surfactant Amps-PX, Lubrol, and Nonidet P-40. A dose-response curve showed that 0.5% was the optimal concentration for Triton X-100. In the absence of detergent, no activity was obtained, and, when microsomal membranes prepared by centrifugation from the postnuclear supernatant were assayed in 0.5% Triton X-100, 98–99% of the LEC18 GlcNAc-T activity was membrane-associated. A variety of organic buffers at 10 mm and pH 7.0 or 7.5 gave similarly good activity, but there was no activity in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0. In 20 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, LEC18 GlcNAc-T activity gave a relatively sharp optimum at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2 A), and had an absolute requirement for Mn2+, with a rather broad optimum between 20 mm and 60 mm (Fig.2 B). By contrast, the snail β(1,4)GlcNAc-T is strongly inhibited at 40 mm MnCl2 (21Bakker H. Agterberg M. van Tetering A. Koeleman C.A. Van den Eijnden D.H. van Die I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30326-30333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like the snail GlcNAc-T, the LEC18 GlcNAc-T requires the presence of ATP (Fig.2 C). In its absence no transfer was observed, and high concentrations were also inhibitory. The optimum concentration of ATP was 10 mm (Fig. 2 C). The transfer of GlcNAc to GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP by LEC18 cell extract was linear for 20 min and stayed constant from 40 to 100 min under the conditions used in Fig. 2 B. To determine apparentK m values, LEC18 extract was incubated with increasing concentrations of either acceptor or donor substrate (Fig.3, A and B). Maximal activity was obtained at ∼0.22 mmUDP-GlcNAc and ∼0.8 mm GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP. From Lineweaver-Burk plots, the apparentK m for UDP-GlcNAc was calculated as 1.1 mm (V max = 10 nmol/mg/h) and for GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP as 1.8 mm(V max = 20 nmol/mg/h), respectively. Under the optimal conditions established for LEC18 extract, parent CHO extract routinely produced a small amount of labeled material (Table I). However, fractionation on Bio-Gel P-2 showed that CHO “product” included a substantial amount of unutilized UDP-GlcNAc, as well as a small amount of material that eluted one fraction beyond the product from LEC18 extract (Fig.4 A). When the latter was analyzed on Dionex HPAEC-PAD, it was clear that CHO extract produced no oligosaccharide product, because all label eluting with product on Bio-Gel P-2 was found to elute at the position of free GlcNAc on Dionex HPAEC-PAD (Fig. 4 B). By contrast, LEC18 product from Bio-Gel-P2 eluted on Dionex HPAEC-PAD prior to the substrate GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP, and after authentic GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP, consistent with its being the predicted product, GlcNAcα/β1,6GlcNAcβ1-O-pNP, for which no standard was available. Digestion of the LEC18 product withN-acetyl-β-hexosaminidases from D. pneumoniaefailed to release GlcNAc (data not shown). However, this result is not surprising as digestion of chitobiose or chitotriose withN-acetylglucosaminidases from three sources also failed to release GlcNAc, as measured by capillary electrophoresis. It seems that the terminal GlcNAc in such linear oligosaccharides is highly resistant to removal by β-hexosaminidases. Attempts to identify a GlcNAc-T that transferred GlcNAc to simple sugar acceptors in LEC14 extracts failed (data not shown). Therefore, acceptors that could potentially be biosynthetic intermediates were tested. The novel GlcNAc residues found in the core of LEC14 and LEC18 N-glycans (Fig. 1) are somewhat analogous to the bisecting GlcNAc (Fig. 1), in the case of LEC14, and to a fucose that modifies the core GlcNAc (24Haslam S.M.

It has previously been established that parent CHO extract does not transfer GlcNAc to GnGn under assay conditions in which GlcNAc-TIII in LEC10 extract transfers the bisecting GlcNAc at a specific activity of 6–10 nmol/mg/h (3Campbell C.

https://openalex.org/W2085627528,"Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase consists of an amidotransferase domain or subunit (GLN) that hydrolyzes glutamine and transfers the ammonia to the synthetase component (CPS) where the biosynthetic reaction occurs. The CPS domain is composed of two homologous subdomains, CPS.A and CPS.B, that catalyze different ATP-dependent reactions involved in carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. When the individual CPS.A and CPS.B subdomains were individually cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (Guy, H. I., and Evans, D. R. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 13762–13769), they were found to be functionally equivalent and could each independently catalyze carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. The proposal was advanced that, although the monomers could catalyze the individual partial reactions, overall synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate required a homodimer of CPS.A or CPS.B. To test this hypothesis, the GLN-CPS.B dimer was reversibly dissociated at 1500 bar in a high pressure cell. Dissociation was accompanied by a loss of both glutamine- and ammonia-dependent CPSase activity. Activity was recovered once the protein was returned to atmospheric pressure. If the sample was cross-linked before exposure to high pressure, there was no dissociation and no loss of biosynthetic activity. In contrast, the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase and the carbamoyl phosphate-dependent ATP synthetase activities were largely unaffected by pressure-induced dissociation. These experiments confirmed the hypothesis that the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate requires the concerted action of the two active sites within the homodimer.

The CPS.A and CPS.B domains are in turn composed of three subdomains (32Kim H. Kelly R.E. Evans D.R. J Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 7177-7184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Guy H.I. Bouvier A. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29255-29262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) designated A1, A2, A3, and B1, B2, B3, respectively. The recent x-ray structure ofE. coli CPSase (34Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) confirmed the subdomain structure of the synthetase domain and showed that the tertiary structure of CPS.A and CPS.B is very similar. The A1-A2 and B1-B2 subdomains have an almost identical fold, whereas the structure of A3 and B3 is distinctly different. CPS.A and CPS.B interact extensively and are related within the complex by an approximate 2-fold axis of symmetry. The most remarkable aspect of the structure is a 96-Å long tunnel that leads from the active site of the GLN domain to the active site of CPS.B, where carbamoyl phosphate is formed and released from the complex. We recently made the unanticipated discovery (35Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13762-13769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that when the CAD CPS.A and CPS.B were separately cloned and expressed in E. coli, the individual domains are functionally equivalent and can catalyze both ATP-dependent partial reactions. Remarkably, the isolated domains also catalyze the overall synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate using ammonia as a nitrogen donor. The CPS.A and CPS.B domains were each fused to the mammalian CAD GLN domain in these recombinants. Both GLN-CPS.A and GLN-CPS.B could also use glutamine as a nitrogen donor, demonstrating that not only was glutamine hydrolyzed but the resulting ammonia was efficiently transferred to the synthetase domain. We subsequently cloned and expressed the E. coli CPS A2 and B2 subdomains (33Guy H.I. Bouvier A. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29255-29262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and found that these species could also catalyze both partial reactions and the overall ammonia-dependent synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate. Moreover, both A2 and B2 are hyperactive with turnover numbers appreciably higher than that of the intact molecule, confirming that they are the catalytic subdomains of CPS.A and CPS.B. To reconcile these results with previous studies which showed that the two CPS domains catalyze the two different ATP-dependent partial reactions, we proposed that the only active species is the homodimer. In this scheme, one of the monomers has the same function as CPS.A in the parent molecule, whereas the other assumes the role of CPS.B. In support of this idea, mammalian GLN-CPS.A and GLN-CPS.B, as well as the E. coli CPS subdomain B2, were found to be dimeric. However, definitive proof of this proposal requires that intact, correctly folded monomer be isolated and tested for catalytic activity. The CPSase activity is relatively labile, and conventional methods designed to dissociate oligomeric proteins might also be expected to disrupt the tertiary structure of the monomer. Previous pressure studies (36Heremans K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1982; 11: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 37Schade B.C. Rudolph R. Ludemann H.-D. Jaenicke R.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3295-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) showed than when oligomeric proteins are subjected to pressures exceeding about 1000 bar, they frequently dissociate into subunits. In general, no major perturbations of the tertiary structure occur until pressures in excess of 2000–3000 bar are attained. Consequently, we elected to use elevated pressure to dissociate the CPS.B and B2 dimers into monomers. This approach confirmed the hypothesis that the only species that can catalyze the overall synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate is the homodimer. The 6.0-kilobase plasmid pHG-GCB consists of the sequences coding for the mammalian GLN domain fused directly to the sequences encoding the CPS.B subdomain (35Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol.

Transformed L673 cells were grown, and the expression of the recombinant mammalian GLN-CPS.B protein was induced as described previously (43Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7702-7708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant protein B2 was isolated from 300-ml cultures of transformed L673 cells grown to stationary phase (42Guillou F.

The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol and broken by sonication for 2 min at 4 °C. The sonicate was centrifuged at 29,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Transformation was carried out by the Hanahan procedure (44Hanahan D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1985Google Scholar). Restriction digests, ligations, and other DNA methods were carried out using standard protocols (45Maniatis T. Fritsch E.R. Sambrook I. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

The procedure for the isolation of the GLN-CPS.B subdomain from pHG-GCB transformants was described previously (35Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol.

SDS-gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels followed the Laemmli procedure (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206276) Google Scholar). Carbamoyl- phosphate synthetase activity was assayed for 15 min, 37 °C as described previously (15Coleman P.F. Suttle D.P. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity and carbamoyl phosphate-dependent ATP synthetase activity were measured spectrophotometrically as described (26Post L.E. Post D.J. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7742-7747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for the following modifications. The ATPase reaction contained 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 m KCl, 4 mmATP, 6 mm MgCl2, 25 mmNaHCO3, and 3.5 mm glutamine (when used). The ATP synthetase assay buffer was the same except that 4 mmADP and 10 mm carbamoyl phosphate replaced the ATP and bicarbonate. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, the 0.5-ml reaction mixtures were quenched with 0.1 ml 5 m perchloric acid, neutralized with 0.1-ml 5 m NaOH, and analyzed according to the published protocol. The proteins were subjected to elevated pressure in an especially designed pressure apparatus (50Hui Bon Hoa G. Hamel G. Else A. Weill G. Herve G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) previously described. Pressures up to 4000 bar can be generated by a precisely machined hydraulic piston that fits into a stainless steel sample chamber (8–20 ml). The chamber is fitted with a pressure lock that allows samples to be withdrawn while the bulk of the solution remains at elevated pressure. The protein solution, 11–18 ml, was placed in the pressure chamber and brought to 1500 bar. Samples (0.3 ml) were taken out at timed intervals and immediately assayed at atmospheric pressure. The recombinant protein was cross-linked using dimethyl suberimidate following the procedure (15Coleman P.F. Suttle D.P. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6379-6385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,51Lee L. Kelly R.E. Pastra-Landis S.C. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6802-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) used for intact CAD. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.03 mg of cross-linking reagent and 10–20 μg of protein in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 0.1 m N-ethylmorpholinacetic acid, pH 8.5. The reaction, carried out at room temperature, was initiated by the addition of the cross-linking reagent and quenched by the addition of 1 m glycine to a final concentration of 0.1m. The extent of cross-linking was determined by densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. The Effect of Pressure on GLN-CPS.B—GLN-CPS.B, a recombinant protein in which the mammalian GLN domain is fused directly to CPS.B (Fig. 1), has previously been shown (35Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13762-13769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to be a dimer composed of 94-kDa subunits. Cell extracts of pHG-GCB transformants expressing GLN-CPS.B, prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were placed in the pressure apparatus and brought to 1500 bar within a few seconds. Samples were periodically withdrawn over the next hour at this pressure (Fig.2 A) and immediately assayed for GLN-dependent CPSase activity. After a short lag time, the initial high GLN-dependent CPSase activity began to gradually decrease. The half-life of inactivation was 20 min, and the activity was completely abolished after 1 h. In contrast, there was no loss of activity of an identical sample maintained at ambient pressure. After 1 h, the pressure was released, and the CPSase activity began to recover. The final sample taken after 120 min was as active as the control kept at atmospheric pressure, indicating that inactivation was completely reversible.Figure 2Effect of pressure on the CPSase activity of GLN-CPS.B. A, GLN-CPS.B was isolated from 500 ml of L673 cells transformed with pHG-GCB and resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 18-ml sample (•) was subjected to a pressure of 1500 bar in a specially designed pressure cell. Samples were taken at the indicated times, whereas the bulk of the solution remained under pressure, and the GLN-CPSase activity was assayed. Over the course of 1 h, the activity was gradually abolished. When the pressure was brought to about 1 atmosphere (↓), the activity was gradually restored, indicating that the process was reversible. ○ represents the control sample incubated at atmospheric pressure.B, GLN-CPS.B, purified according to the previously described procedure (35Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol.

Sampling was continued after the protein solution was returned (↓) to atmospheric pressure. The NH3-dependent CPSase activity of protein (•) that had been cross-linked (see “Experimental Procedures”) before exposure to the same high pressure was also assayed, as was the activity of control samples of uncross-linked (□) and cross-linked (○) protein incubated at atmospheric pressure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reversible inactivation-reactivation was interpreted as a pressure-induced dissociation of the GLN-CPS.B dimer. The effect of protein concentration on the rate of recovery of catalytic activity (Fig. 3) supported this explanation. Although the loss of activity at elevated pressure was independent of protein concentration (data not shown), the rate of recovery following release of the pressure was proportional to the concentration of the protein, as expected for a second order reassociation process. However, restoration of activity exhibited cooperativity, especially apparent at lower protein concentrations, and did not exactly conform to second order reaction kinetics. An alternative explanation for the pressure-induced loss of glutamine-dependent CPSase activity would be the disruption of the interactions between the GLN and CPS.B domain necessary for coupling glutamine hydrolysis with carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. Uncoupling might occur even though the GLN and CPS.B domains are fused and carried on a single polypeptide chain, as there are multiple noncovalent interactions between the domains. However, if this interpretation is correct, then the recovery phase would be expected to be first order and thus independent of protein concentration because the restoration of the linkage would be an intramolecular reaction. To further rule out the uncoupling of the GLN and CPS domains as an explanation for the loss of activity, a similar experiment (Fig.2 B) was carried out using the purified GLN-CPS.B in which the ammonia-dependent CPSase activity was measured. The CPS.B domain, independent of the GLN domain, can use ammonia directly as the nitrogen donor for the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate. As in the case of the Gln-dependent reaction, the NH3-CPSase (Fig. 2 B) exhibited reversible, pressure-induced inactivation. Although the shape of the curve differed somewhat, the half-life for inactivation was again 20 min. To confirm that the GLN-CPS.B dimer was dissociated, samples were also taken throughout this experiment (data not shown) for chemical cross-linking and analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. At atmospheric pressure, the protein was dimeric and remained dimeric during the 2-h incubation. However, the concentration of the monomer steadily increased at the expense of the dimer during the incubation at 1500 bar. After 1 h, all of the dimer had been converted to a monomer. The half-life for dissociation, where the protein existed as 50% monomer and 50% dimer, was approximately 20 min, in agreement with the time required for 50% inactivation. The pressure was released, and after 60 min at atmospheric pressure, the dimer had completely reformed and the activity was restored. If the loss of catalytic activity is exclusively coupled to the dissociation of the dimer, then a previously cross-linked dimer that is unable to dissociate should remain active after exposure to elevated pressure. Purified GLN-CPS.B cross-linked, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was found by SDS-gel electrophoresis to be exclusively dimeric. Cross-linking resulted in little loss (<10%) of the NH3-dependent CPSase activity. In contrast to the untreated protein, the NH3-dependent catalytic activity of cross-linked GLN-CPS.B was largely unaffected by high pressure. The slight loss of catalytic activity, about 8% observed after 1 h at 1500 bar, was completely restored when the protein was brought back to atmospheric pressure. Thus, the pressure-induced inactivation of GLN-CPS.B can, for the most part, be attributed to the dissociation of the dimer. These experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that the monomer can catalyze the partial reactions, but only the dimer can catalyze the overall reaction. The results reported above could also be explained by a pressure-induced disruption of the tertiary structure of the monomer, which abolished one or both of the ATP-dependent partial reactions (Reactions 2 and 4). The loss of either activity would result in the concomitant loss of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis activity. Consequently, the ATP-dependent partial reactions were measured during the pressure-induced dissociation of GLN-CPS.B. Following an experimental design identical to that described above, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was first measured when all of the substrates required for carbamoyl phosphate synthesis were present. When subjected to elevated pressure, the rate of ADP production (Fig.4, solid circles) decreased by half, from 0.4 nmol/min to 0.2 nmol/min, indicating that only a single ATP was being consumed by the monomer. This result suggested that the overall reaction was abolished but that ATP continued to be hydrolyzed as a result of formation and subsequent hydrolysis of carboxyl phosphate. This interpretation was confirmed by directly assaying the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity of GLN-CPS.B (Reaction 2, Fig. 4, solid squares). This reaction measures the rate of the first partial reaction, the activation of bicarbonate. At atmospheric pressure, the rate of ATP formation was 0.2 nmol/min. Pressure-induced dissociation decreased the ATPase activity slightly to 0.13 nmol/min, indicating that although the catalytic activity of the monomer was slightly impaired, it could still catalyze the partial reaction at a comparable rate. The bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity was restored to close its initial value when the molecule was returned to atmospheric pressure. The second partial reaction (Reaction 4), the phosphorylation of carbamate, was measured in the reverse direction as a carbamoyl phosphate-dependent ATP synthetase. Throughout the pressure cycle, ATP formation continued to proceed at a rate comparable with that observed at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 4, solid triangles), although there was again a small, reversible pressure-induced loss of activity in the fully dissociated molecule. No significant change in the catalytic activity of any of these reactions was observed when the same measurements were made on a control protein sample (open symbols) incubated at atmospheric pressure. A similar experiment (Fig. 5) was carried out on extracts of pHGB2 transformants, which express the B2 catalytic domain of E. coli CPSase. The B2 domain of the E. coliprotein, a dimer of 28-kDa polypeptides, is not as stable as the mammalian GLN-CPS.B domain as indicated by the 23% loss of ammonia-dependent CPSase activity that occurred during the 120-min incubation period at atmospheric pressure. However, when subjected to 1500 bar, the activity was rapidly abolished. In contrast to the situation with the larger molecules, the activity did not recover to a significant extent with the restoration of atmospheric pressure. This result is consistent with the dissociation of the B2 dimer, and the lack of reversibility is consistent with the slow inactivation observed at atmospheric pressure. Previous studies have shown that oligomers generally dissociate when subjected to elevated pressure because of a decrease in the volume of the system. Moreover, the tertiary structure of the monomer is usually preserved provided that pressures do not exceed 2500–3000 bars. We have taken advantage of high pressure methodology to study the function of monomers of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase domains under conditions least likely to disrupt the integrity of the monomer. Although the instrumentation allows assaying enzymatic activity at elevated pressure, all measurements were carried out after the sample had been returned to atmospheric pressure to avoid ambiguities associated with pressure-induced changes in the rate of the chemical reaction. Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase has a complex domain structure consisting of 40-kDa GLN and 120-kDa CPS domains or subunits. Each of the partial reactions involved in carbamoyl phosphate synthesis is catalyzed by different subdomains that have specialized functions and that interact to coordinate the reactions occurring at different sites within the molecule.

Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14362-14369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have provided compelling evidence that CPS.A catalyzes the activation of bicarbonate (Reaction 2), whereas CPS.B phosphorylates carbamate (Reaction 4) to form the final product carbamoyl phosphate. The x-ray structure ofE. coli CPSase supports this sequential scheme for carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. The GLN domain, the site of glutamine hydrolysis, is in contact with CPS.A where carboxyl phosphate is formed and presumably reacts with ammonia. In contrast, CPS.B, where carbamoyl phosphate is formed, is located at the other end of the molecule. The tunnel that threads its way through the center of the complex provides a means of sequestering the intermediates formed in the sequential mechanism, ammonia and carbamate, within the complex. Although the sequential mechanism represents the generally accepted view, an intriguing new mechanism has recently been proposed (52Kothe M. Eroglu B. Mazza H. Samudera H. Powers-Lee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12348-12353Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) which suggests that synthesis occurs at a single site. Their proposal was prompted by the structural (34Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and functional (35Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13762-13769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) equivalence of the CPS.A and CPS.B subdomains. In this alternative mechanism, carboxyl phosphate is formed in a reaction that is identical to the reaction (Reaction 2) proposed for the sequential mechanism. Ammonia then reacts with carboxyl phosphate to form a transient tetrahedral intermediate, which collapses to carbamoyl phosphate with the release of water. The most interesting aspect of this proposal is that ATP binding to the CPS.B domain acts as a “nucleotide switch,” which triggers the active conformation at the site of synthesis. The same reaction, formation of carboxyl phosphate, occurs on CPS.B, but because CPS.B cannot assume the activated conformation, the intermediate is subsequently hydrolyzed. The coupling of the hydrolysis of a second ATP to carbamoyl phosphate synthesis would make the biosynthetic reaction thermodynamically favorable. The authors argue that all of the data gathered in support of the sequential mechanism can be explained equally well or better by the nucleotide switch mechanism. Both models require the concerted action of two catalytic sites located on two distinct subdomains. Thus, the observation (35Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13762-13769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that CPS.A and CPS.B domains alone are able to catalyze the overall synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate may initially seem paradoxical. Moreover, the catalytic subdomains of CPS.A and CPS.B, which have a mass of only 31 and 28 kDa, respectively, are also fully functional (33Guy H.I. Bouvier A. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29255-29262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and can catalyze ammonia-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. The recently characterized CPSases from the archaebacteria,Pyrococcus furiosus (53Legrain C. Demarez M. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1093-1099Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Pyrococcus abyssi(54Purcarea C. Simon V. Prieur D. Herve G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), have a molecular mass of only 34 kDa and may be naturally occurring analogs of the recombinant CPS.A and CPS.B domains of mammalian carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase. To reconcile our findings with studies which showed that both CPS domains participate in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, we proposed that the CPS.A and CPS.B monomers could each catalyze all of the partial reactions, but catalysis of the overall synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate requires a dimer composed of two of the equivalent domains. We found that the molecules were in fact dimeric, but to definitively prove this proposal, it was necessary to show that the monomers can catalyze the partial reactions but not the overall synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate. The pressure studies reported here show that both glutamine- and ammonia-dependent CPSase activity is lost when the GLN-CPS.B was subjected to elevated pressure. The loss of glutamine-dependent activity cannot be solely attributed to disruption of the functional interactions between the GLN and CPS domains, as the ammonia-dependent activity that occurs independently of the GLN domain is also abolished at elevated pressure. On the other hand, we cannot dismiss the possibility that GLN-CPS interactions are diminished, as the domains are part of the same polypeptide chain, and these interactions would be expected to be quickly restored when the protein is returned to atmospheric pressure. However, the dissociation of the dimer was confirmed by measuring the dependence of the recovery on protein concentration and by chemical cross-linking. Moreover, there was no loss of catalytic activity if the molecule was prevented from dissociating by chemical cross-linking before exposure to high pressure. The monomers are still able to catalyze both partial reactions at an appreciable rate, indicating that they remain functional. Dissociation resulted in only a 35% decrease in activity of both the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase and the carbamoyl phosphate-dependent ATP synthetase reactions. The modest loss of activity could indicate that there is a small, reversible perturbation of the tertiary structure of the monomer when subjected to elevated pressure. Alternatively, there may be interdomain interactions between the monomers in the dimer that stimulate catalytic activity. The loss of these interactions on dissociation could also account for the small decrease in the rate of the partial reactions catalyzed by the monomer. Similar experiments suggest that the dimeric catalytic subdomain, B2 ofE. coli CPSase also dissociates at elevated pressure with loss of catalytic function. However, as the loss of activity was irreversible, we cannot be sure whether more profound structural changes were induced in the monomer. We have not as yet assayed the partial reactions in B2, an experiment that may provide a partial answer to this question. Although the nucleotide switch model was based in part on the functional equivalence of CPS.A and CPS.B, both this model and the sequential mechanism can account for the results reported here. In fact, the initial interpretation (35Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13762-13769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) of the functional equivalence of CPS.A and CPS.B was made within the context of the sequential mechanism. Functional equivalence of CPS.A and CPS.B alone cannot discredit the sequential model because the substrates and the two ATP-dependent reactions catalyzed by the two domains are very similar. Regardless of the mechanism, the two monomers of the CPS.B homodimer are assumed to occupy the same location and serve the same function as CPS.A and CPS.B in the native molecule. This proposal is plausible given the similarity of sequence and tertiary structure and the approximate 2-fold axis of symmetry that relates the CPS.A and CPS.B in the parent enzyme. The 2-fold symmetry is especially apparent at the interface between the two domains. In the sequential mechanism, formation of the CPS.B dimer reconstitutes the tunnel through which carbamate traverses the molecule from its site of formation to the site where carbamoyl phosphate is formed on the other domain. In the nucleotide switch model, one of the monomers serves as the site of synthesis, whereas the other uses ATP to drive the conformational change. In both mechanisms, only the dimer would be expected to catalyze the overall reaction. On the other hand, given the tenuous contacts between B2 and A2 in E. coli CPSase and the fact that the A1 and B1 subdomains participate in forming the tunnel, it is more difficult to visualize a carbamate channel in the B2 homodimer. Perhaps further studies of the isolated catalytic subdomains, A2 and B2, would help distinguish between the two mechanisms. Another unexpected result was the failure of the GLN CPS.B monomer to catalyze a carbamate kinase-like reaction. Bicarbonate and ammonia, substrates used to measure the ammonia-dependent CPSase activity, are in equilibrium with carbamate. Carbamate kinase, an enzyme in the arginine deiminase pathway found in several microorganisms (55Thorne K.J.I. Jones M.E. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1989; 179: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), catalyzes a reversible reaction identical to Reaction 4 in the sequential mechanism. The CPS.B monomer was shown here to catalyze the reverse reaction, carbamoyl phosphate-dependent ATP synthesis. This reaction is usually taken as a measure of carbamate phosphorylation (Reaction 4), but some authors (52Kothe M. Eroglu B. Mazza H. Samudera H. Powers-Lee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12348-12353Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 60Rubio V. Grisolia S. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have suggested that this may actually reflect a reversal of Reaction 2, the formation of carboxyl phosphate, with carbamoyl phosphate serving as a carboxyl phosphate analog. Although there are alternative explanations, it is somewhat surprising that the monomer cannot catalyze carbamoyl phosphate synthesis via Reaction 4 if carbamate is truly an intermediate as depicted in the sequential mechanism. This interpretation does not account for the evidence which clearly shows that in the intact molecule, the two functionally equivalent CPS.A and CPS.B have specialized functions. In the sequential model, CPS.A catalyzes bicarbonate activation, whereas CPS.B phosphorylates carbamate. In the nucleotide switch model, CPS.A catalyzes carbamoyl phosphate synthesis, whereas CPS.B functions as an energy transducer. In contrast to the intact molecule, we have proposed that the function of the two CPS.B monomers is not fixed in the homodimer. Rather, the function alternates in each catalytic cycle. The monomer that happens to bind the initial substrates ammonia, ATP, and bicarbonate activates bicarbonate, whereas the other, by default, assumes the role of carbamate phosphorylation. In this regard, the domains within the homodimer are reminiscent of mitochondrial ATPase catalytic subunits (61Boyer P. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) in that although intrinsically identical, they have different functions at any particular moment. We attribute (35Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13762-13769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) this result to juxtapositional specialization of function in which the specific reaction catalyzed by the domain is determined by its location within the complex and its interactions with neighboring domains. Specifically, the domain closest to the GLN domain catalyzes bicarbonate activation. This interpretation is consistent with the recent x-ray structure (34Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) of E. coli CPSase, which shows that the GLN domain is in intimate contact with CPS.A and far from CPS.B. We are currently constructing hybrid mutants of CPS.A and CPS.B to test this idea. We thank Dr. Carol Lusty for generous gifts of plasmids and strains and the staff of the Institute Calumet (Paris, France)."
https://openalex.org/W2043450981,"The antigen-binding receptor expressed on most T lymphocytes consists of disulfide-linked clonotypic alphabeta heterodimers noncovalently associated with monomeric CD3gamma,delta,epsilon proteins and disulfide-linked zeta zeta homodimers, collectively referred to as the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex. Here, we examined and compared the disulfide linkage status of newly synthesized TCR proteins in murine CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes and splenic T cells. These studies demonstrate that CD3delta proteins exist as both monomeric and oligomeric (disulfide-linked) species that differentially assemble with CD3epsilon subunits in CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes and splenic T cells. Interestingly, unlike previous results on glucose trimming and TCR assembly of CD3delta proteins in splenic T cells (Van Leeuwen, J. E. M., and K. P. Kearse (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 9660-9665), we found that glucose residues were not invariably removed from CD3delta glycoproteins prior to their assembly with CD3epsilon subunits in CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes. Finally, these studies show that calnexin associates with both monomeric and disulfide-linked CD3delta proteins in murine T cells. The data in the current report demonstrate that CD3delta proteins exist as both monomeric and disulfide-linked molecules in murine T cells that differentially associate with partner TCR chains in CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes and splenic T cells. These results are consistent with the concept that folding and assembly of CD3delta proteins is a function of their oxidation state."
