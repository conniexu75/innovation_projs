https://openalex.org/W2140547471,"Neutrophil migration inhibition factor from T lymphocytes (NIF-T) is a lymphokine that acts to localize granulocytes. Medium conditioned by the Mo human T-lymphoblast cell line was used to purify NIF-T, a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 22,000. The NIF-T was found to potently stimulate the growth of granulocyte and macrophage colonies from human bone marrow and colony formation by the KG-1 myeloid leukemia cell line. Thus a human lymphokine (NIF-T) that modulates the activities of mature neutrophilic granulocytes is also a colony-stimulating factor acting on precursors to induce growth and differentiation of new effector cells."

https://openalex.org/W2003796534,"Few and limited amino acid sequence homologies have been found among eight bacterial aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases whose primary structures are known. The entire 939-amino acid primary structure of Escherichia coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase is now reported. In a sequence of 11 consecutive amino acids matching a sequence in E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase, there are ten identical residues and one conservative change. This is the strongest homology recorded between any two aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. This part of the methionine enzyme's three-dimensional structure has been determined, and it occurs in a mononucleotide binding fold; a close three-dimensional structural homology of this part of the enzyme with Bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase has also been reported. The three synthetases probably fold identically in this region."
https://openalex.org/W1494180975,"1-Alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkyl-acyl-GPC) comprises 11% of the total phospholipids of rat alveolar macrophages. This endogenous pool of alkylacyl-GPC was prelabeled by incubating the macrophages with [1,2-3H]alkyllyso-GPC (54 Ci/mmol), which enters the cells and is acylated. The effect of various stimuli on the synthesis and release into the media of labeled alkylacetyl-GPC (platelet-activating factor) from the cells was used to establish the role of inactive alkylacyl-GPC as a precursor of the biologically active derivative. A phagocytic agent (zymosan, 100 micrograms/ml) and an ionophore (A23187, 2 microM) stimulated the release of both alkylacetyl-GPC and alkyllyso-GPC into the media at the expense of cellular alkylacyl-GPC. Phospholipase A2 activity (at pH 4.5 and in 1 mM EDTA) was also increased in the media. The stimulatory effect of zymosan and the ionophore on alkylacetyl-GPC release was prevented by mepacrine (0.1 mM), an agent that inhibits the release of fatty acids from phospholipids. These data indicate that phospholipase activity is required for the biosynthesis of alkylacetyl-GPC. However, since the inhibitory effect of mepacrine was not apparent when acetate was present, it appears that the acetylation step is rate limiting. Exposure of alveolar macrophages in culture to zymosan or A23187 stimulated acetyltransferase activity 250-300%. In contrast, phorbol myristate acetate (1.6 microM), which stimulated the accumulation of lysophospholipids but not the level of alkylacetyl-GPC in the media, did not substantially increase acetyltransferase activity. We conclude that alkylacyl-GPC serves as a precursor of alkylacetyl-GPC and that the production of this potent mediator by rat alveolar macrophages can be stimulated by agents that affect phospholipase A2 and acetyltransferase activities. The latter enzyme appears to have a regulatory function in the biosynthesis of alkylacetyl-GPC."
https://openalex.org/W1499922508,"Treatment of 10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts with 5-azacytidine, an inhibitor of mammalian DNA methylation, leads to the appearance of several new cell types, including adipocytes. We have isolated several such adipogenic cell lines and characterized two of them, TA1 and TA2. When subconfluent these cells resemble fibroblasts. After growth is arrested at high density, both clones express a functional adipose phenotype characterized by accumulation of lipid droplets. This in vitro differentiation is accompanied by a greater than 100-fold increase in glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase activity, an enzyme characteristic of mature adipocytes. Consistent with these morphologic and enzymatic changes, differentiated TA1 cells show a widespread alteration in protein composition as well as a substantial change in the pattern of secreted proteins. We have constructed a cDNA library of TA1 adipocytes and have isolated 12 different cDNA clones corresponding to mRNAs that are induced during adipogenesis. Among these RNAs, some are not expressed prior to initiating differentiation whereas others are expressed in 10T1/2 cells and TA1 preadipocytes. Treatment of TA1 cells with insulin and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone leads to an acceleration of the phenotypic changes observed during adipogenesis. We have found that hormone treatment leads to a precocious accumulation of specific RNA for all of the clones studied. Analysis of the temporal control of RNA accumulation during differentiation indicates that there are different categories of RNAs, some of which accumulate by day 1 after treatment while others are not apparent until day 3."

https://openalex.org/W1515298003,"The insulin receptor is a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. Upon binding of the hormone, the kinase is activated resulting in autophosphorylation of the receptor. This kinase activity has been postulated to be an early step in the transmembrane signaling produced by insulin. To evaluate the physiologic relevance of receptor phosphorylation, we have studied insulin binding and autophosphorylation properties using cells from an individual with a variant of the Type A syndrome of severe insulin resistance and acanthosis nigricans. Erythrocytes and cultured fibroblasts from this individual exhibited normal or near normal 125I-insulin binding. Receptors extracted from erythrocytes with Triton X-100 also exhibited normal 125I-insulin binding and competition curves. Despite this, receptors extracted from both erythrocytes and fibroblasts showed a 50% decrease in insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation. Partially purified receptors from the patient's fibroblasts also exhibited a 40% decrease in their ability to phosphorylate exogenous substrates. These data suggest that the insulin resistance in this syndrome is due to a genetic abnormality which impairs insulin receptor phosphorylation and kinase activity and further support the possible role of receptor phosphorylation and kinase activity in insulin action."

https://openalex.org/W1510871275,"Antibodies were produced in rabbits to homogeneous mouse kidney ornithine decarboxylase and used to determine the amount of this protein present in kidney extracts by a competitive radioimmunoassay procedure. The labeled ligand for this assay was prepared by reacting renal ornithine decarboxylase with [5-3H] alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor. The sensitivity of the assay was such that 1 ng of protein could be quantitated and the binding to ornithine decarboxylase of a macromolecular inhibitor (antizyme) or alpha-difluoromethylornithine did not affect the reaction. It was found that treatment of female mice with testosterone produced a 400-fold increase in ornithine decarboxylase protein in the kidney within 4-5 days. Exposure to cycloheximide or to 1,3-diaminopropane led to a rapid disappearance of the protein which paralleled the loss of enzyme activity. There was no sign of any immunoreactive but enzymatically inactive form of mouse kidney ornithine decarboxylase under any of the conditions investigated. The results indicate that fluctuations of the enzyme activity in this organ are mediated via changes in the amount of enzyme protein rather than by post-translational modifications or interaction with inhibitors or activators."
https://openalex.org/W1581591147,"We have examined the temporal relationship between arachidonate release and phosphatidic acid (PA) metabolism in human platelets stimulated with thrombin. Within 1 min of stimulation at 37 degrees C, platelets released up to 16 nmol of arachidonate/10(9) cells from membrane phospholipids and exhibited an increase of severalfold in PA mass. At 23 degrees C, arachidonate release was half-maximal by 10-30 s, but PA remained near control levels for 10-30 s, indicating that increased PA is not necessary for release. [3H]Glycerol-labeled platelets synthesized phospholipids from [3H]PA at a rate of 0.08-0.3 nmol/min/10(9) cells at 37 degrees C. This rate of [3H]glycerol-PA turnover was not enhanced by thrombin stimulation; thus, PA did not turn over rapidly enough to be an intermediate in the release of several nanomoles of arachidonate from phosphatidylinositol in the first few seconds of stimulation. When aspirin-treated platelets were prelabeled with [14C]- or [3H]arachidonate, the specific activity of phospholipid-bound arachidonate pools remained constant after thrombin stimulation. Released arachidonate had specific activity intermediate to that in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol. [14C]arachidonate in phosphatidylethanolamine had specific activity 6-fold less than released [14C]arachidonate; this phospholipid could therefore contribute only a small fraction of released fatty acid."

https://openalex.org/W1573231051,"We have purified S-100 protein from bovine brain using Ca2+-dependent affinity chromatography on N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7)-Sepharose (Endo, T., Tanaka, T., Isobe, T., Kasai, H., Okuyama, T., and Hidaka, H. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12485-12489). By essentially the same procedure, W-7-Sepharose binding protein has been purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine abdominal adipose tissue. Electrophoretically, the purified protein from adipose tissue co-migrated with brain S-100b protein both in the presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and the protein was indistinguishable from brain S-100b region in terms of amino acid composition, two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping and reactivity with anti-brain S-100b serum. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the existence of S-100b protein in the adipose cell where the protein seems to be located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Thus, the results indicate that the adipose cells contain the protein possibly identical with brain S-100b protein. In addition, the contents of S-100b protein in various rat tissues were measured by enzyme immunoassay method using the anti-bovine brain S-100b serum. Significant amounts of S-100b protein were found not only in the adipose tissue but also in the peripheral tissue such as trachea and skin. These observations suggest that S-100b protein should no longer be considered as a protein specific to nervous tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1605024684,"In red cell lysates, three soluble proteases hydrolyze insulin at pH 8.5. One of these enzymes was purified to homogeneity by conventional chromatographic techniques. It appears to be a metalloprotease since it is inhibited by EDTA, o-phenanthroline, and 8-hydroxyquinoline, the metal-depleted enzyme can be reactivated by micromolar levels of Zn2+, Co2+, or Mn2+, and it is not inhibited by reagents specific for carboxyl, serine or thiol proteases. This enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 300,000 +/- 25,000, and electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate indicates a single band with an Mr = 115,000 +/- 10,000. End group analysis and automated Edman degradation of the products of proteolysis showed that it is an endoprotease which cleaves on the NH2-terminal side of large hydrophobic amino acids. Although various small polypeptides with Mr = 2300-3500 are hydrolyzed (e.g. insulin chains, glucagon, and calcitonin), a variety of larger proteins are not degraded (e.g. casein and globin). The latter proteins, however, are converted to substrates for the metalloprotease by digestion with the ATP-stimulated endoprotease from erythrocytes. Thus, the metalloprotease may play a role in the ATP-dependent pathway for degrading proteins with abnormal structures and could account in part for the o-phenanthroline sensitivity of this process. A similar enzyme is found in humans, rabbits, and rats and is cytosolic in all tissues which have been examined including erythrocytes, reticulocytes, liver, kidney, brain, and skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1627617254,"Two new allophycocyanin-containing complexes were found among the products of partial dissociation of the phycobilisomes of Synechococcus 6301 strain AN112. These complexes were purified to homogeneity and characterized with respect to composition, stability, and spectroscopic properties. The structures of the complexes were established to be (alpha AP beta AP)3 . 10.5K and (alpha 1APB alpha 2AP beta 3AP) . 10.5 K, where alpha AP and beta AP are subunits of allophycocyanin, and alpha APB is the subunit of allophycocyanin B (see Lundell, D. J., and Glazer, A. N. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12600-12606), and 10.5K is an uncolored polypeptide of 10.5-kilodaltons. These complexes are derived from the core substructure of the phycobilisome. Electron microscopic studies of the morphology of the core of strain AN112 phycobilisomes (Yamanaka, G., Glazer, A. N., and Williams, R. C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11004-11010) as well as structural studies of an 18 S subassembly derived from the phycobilisomes by partial dissociation (Yamanaka, G., Lundell, D. J., and Glazer, A. N. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4077-4086) indicated that the core assembly consisted of two cylindrical elements each made up of the same four distinct trimeric biliprotein-containing complexes. Two such core components, (alpha AP beta AP)3 and alpha 2AP beta 2AP. 18.3K . 75K (where 18.3K and 75K are polypeptides of 18.3- and 75-kilodaltons), were shown to be contained within the 18 S subassembly (Lundell, D. J., and Glazer, A. N. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 894-901). The isolation of the two allophycocyanin-containing complexes described here completes the characterization of the four types of components in the Synechococcus 6301 phycobilisome core. Two lines of evidence indicate that each of the four complexes is present twice in the core: comparison of the compositions (and yields) of the complexes with that of the intact AN112 phycobilisome, and near-coincidence of the molar absorption spectrum of the phycobilisome with that generated by summing the spectra of the constituent complexes taken in appropriate molar proportions."
https://openalex.org/W1911325819,"The 18 S subassembly particles obtained by partial dissociation of phycobilisomes from Synechococcus 6301 (Anacystis nidulans) strain AN 112 contain approximately one-half of the mass of the phycobilisome and include core-rod junctions (Yamanaka, G., Lundell, D. J., and Glazer, A. N. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4077-4086). The polypeptide composition of 18 S complexes, determined by analysis of uniformly 14C-labeled phycobilisomes, gave the following stoichiometry: 75K:27K:18.3K:alpha beta allophycocyanin monomer: alpha beta phycocyanin monomer of 1:2:1:5:6; where 75K, 27K, etc. represent polypeptides of 75, 27 kilodaltons, etc. The 18.3K polypeptide is a hitherto underscribed biliprotein bearing a single phycocyanobilin. The NH2-terminal sequence of this subunit was determined to be homologous to that of the beta subunit of allophycocyanin. Chromatography of products resulting from limited trypsin treatment of the 18 S complex led to the isolation of three subcomplexes: a mixture of (alpha beta)3 . 22K and (alpha beta)3 . 24K phycocyanin complexes, an (alpha beta)3 allophycocyanin trimer, and an (alpha beta)2 . 18.3K.40K.11K allophycocyanin-containing complex. The 22K and 24K components were products of the degradation of the 27K polypeptides, whereas the 40K and 11K components were derived from the 75K polypeptide. The subcomplexes accounted for the composition of the 18 S complex. Determination of the composition, stoichiometry, and spectroscopic properties of the subcomplexes has led to a model of the polypeptide arrangement within the 18 S complex and of the pathway of energy transfer among these polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W1506959132,"Mouse kidney, a vitamin D target organ, was investigated for the presence of vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding proteins (CaBP). Mouse kidney cytosol was fractionated by several biochemical methods including gel filtration chromatography, gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography, and chromatofocusing. Mouse kidney was found to possess two CaBPs which completely differed biochemically and exhibited no cross-immunoreactivity. One had a molecular weight of 25,000 and a pI of 5.9. The other, with a molecular weight of 10,000 and a pI of 4.9, was biochemically identical with mouse duodenal 10,000 CaBP. In addition, mouse renal and duodenal 10,000 CaBPs were immunologically identical. Moreover, the 10,000 CaBP was the predominant CaBP in mouse kidney since the latter contained about twice as much 10,000 CaBP as 25,000 CaBP (in mol/mg of renal cytosolic protein). In vitro incorporation of [3H]leucine into renal 10,000 CaBP demonstrated that it is synthesized in situ by mouse kidney. Renal 10,000 CaBP was already present during fetal life, and reached its adult level during the first week after birth. The vitamin D dependency of both mouse renal 10,000 and 25,000 CaBPs was assessed by their decrease in vitamin D-deficient mice and subsequent rise after 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 injection. The concomitant presence of substantial amounts of two vitamin D-dependent CaBPs in mouse kidney is peculiar to this organ, which might consequently provide a unique model for studying the hormonal expressions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3."

The accumulation of certain mRNA's in other tissues has also been linked to insulin action.

Rather, insulin is essential for its synthesis in the presence of glucocorticoid and prolactin."
https://openalex.org/W2097905367,"We report the detection in vivo of precursors to the A and the B subunits of the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) in Escherichia coli. Both pre-LT A (Mr = 29,500) and pre-LT B (Mr = 13,500) are present in the spheroplast fraction of the bacteria after separation of the cells in spheroplasts and periplasm. Two smaller LT A related polypeptides (17 and 23 kDa) were also detected in the spheroplast fraction. Both were degraded with a half-time of about 40 s. Mature subunits (Mr = 27,500 for LT A, and 11,500 for LT B) are released from the spheroplasts soon after processing and occur freely in the periplasm not associated with the cytoplasmic or the outer membranes. Processing occurs mainly post-translationally for both the A and the B subunits. However, they show different kinetics of processing and subsequent segregation into the periplasm. Whereas pre-LT B is processed and released within seconds after chain termination, pre-LT A is processed and released more slowly, and a subfraction of mature LT A may reside in the cytoplasmic membrane for several minutes."
https://openalex.org/W1602945734,"Proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified lac carrier protein from Escherichia coli were ultra-rapidly frozen and examined by freeze-fracture-etch electron microscopy. The proteoliposomes are greater than 95% unilamellar, and the majority are 30-150 nm in diameter. Fracture faces of proteoliposomes (at a protein:lipid molecular ratio of about 1:2500) display 7.0-nm diameter globular intramembrane particles uniformly distributed on convex and concave surfaces. Calculations of particle composition suggest that each intramembrane particle probably contains one or two molecules of the 46.5-kDa transmembranous lac carrier protein, depending on the correction factor for the thickness of the metal deposited to form the platinum/carbon replicas. Etched surfaces of the proteoliposomes are smooth. Incubation of the proteoliposomes with monoclonal antibody 4B1, which binds to an epitope in the lac carrier on the exterior of the proteoliposomes, dramatically alters the intramembrane particle distribution. After incubation with antibody, the convex (inner monolayer) fracture faces are nearly devoid of intramembrane particles, and an overall 4-fold reduction in the total number of intramembrane particles is observed."

https://openalex.org/W1497700097,"Reconstitution of apolipoprotein A-I was found to occur readily with bovine brain sphingomyelin (BBSM), with a maximum rate occurring at a temperature of 28 degrees C, a temperature approximating the phase transition temperature for this naturally occurring phospholipid. At BBSM:A-I weight ratios of 7.5:1 or less, a single recombinant product was observed which contained three A-I molecules per particle, which had a BBSM:A-I molar ratio of 360 to 1 and which appeared in the electron microscope as a discoidal complex with a thickness of 68 A and a diameter of 217 A. By these criteria, as well as by gel filtration, this product appears very similar to that obtained by recombination of A-I with phosphatidylcholine at elevated ratios of phospholipid/protein. No evidence was found for the existence of any BBSM:A-I complexes comparable to the smaller lecithin:A-I complex containing 200-250 mol of phospholipid and two A-I molecules per complex which has been previously reported. At BBSM:A-I ratios of 15:1 (w/w), a new type of complex was observed which was discoidal by electron microscopy but possessed a larger diameter (390 A) and higher phospholipid:protein molar ratio (535:1) than has been observed previously for recombinant complexes. The BBSM:A-I complexes were found to be significantly more resistant to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride than the dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine:A-I recombinant complexes. It is concluded that the mechanisms of interaction between apolipoprotein A-I and either bovine brain sphingomyelin or phosphatidylcholines are similar, but that the nature of the protein-lipid interactions with BBSM are such as to produce larger and more stable complexes than are observed with the phosphatidylcholines."
https://openalex.org/W1546487185,"This paper reports a procedure for the specific radiolabeling of the amino termini of proteins. By Edman degradation, a protein is protected at all lysine amino groups while retaining a free amino terminus and such a modified protein is end-labeled by an amino group-specific reagent (radioiodinated Bolton-Hunter reagent). Partial proteolyses with a variety of specific amino acid cleaving reagents generate a series of fragments which predict the location of the specific amino acids in the primary structure. The amino acids determined so far include Arg, Asp, Cys, Glu, Met, Trp, and Asn-Gly. The procedure is demonstrated on beta-galactosidase and lambda immunity 434 repressor protein. One of the uses of the procedure, the identification and localization of point mutations within the sequence, is illustrated using lambda immunity 434 repressor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1586663908,"8 S RNA of Novikoff hepatoma was characterized by fingerprinting, sequencing gels, and by hybridization to rat ribosomal DNA clones. The data obtained show that 8 S RNA is 273 or 274 nucleotides long; ribosomal 5.8 S RNA is its 5'-terminal 156 nucleotides. All the post-transcriptional modifications found in 5.8 S rRNA were also found in 8 S RNA; no other modifications were found. The 3'-terminal 118 nucleotides were consistent with the adjoining internal transcribed spacer sequence in rDNA (Subrahmanyam, C. S., Cassidy, B., Busch, H., and Rothblum, L. (1982) Nucleic Acids Res. 10, 3667-3680). Based on its nucleolar localization, the finding that all the 8 S RNA is hydrogen-bonded to preribosomal RNA and its consistency in sequence to the cloned rat ribosomal DNA sequence, it appears that 8 S RNA is a relatively stable intermediate in the formation of 5.8 S rRNA from 45 S pre-rRNA. This stable intermediate RNA may be a useful substrate for studies on rRNA processing and for studies on eukaryotic rRNA-processing enzyme(s)."

https://openalex.org/W1557886984,"The uptake of dietary polyprenols was studied by administering, through a gastric tube, labeled alpha-saturated and alpha-unsaturated polyprenols, with 11 and 19 isoprene residues. The lipids appeared in all organs but mostly in the liver after 16 h where those with 11 isoprenes were in much higher concentration than the prenols with 19 isoprene residues; the distribution in the liver was studied in detail. About 45% of the polyprenols taken up were esterified with fatty acids. A part of the radioactivity (6-30%) appeared in the supernatant but mostly in water-soluble form. Among subcellular fractions, the highest uptake was found in the outer mitochondrial membranes. After 16 h, both 11- and 19-residue alpha-unsaturated injected prenols were present to a large extent as alpha-saturated compounds in liver homogenates and subcellular fractions. About 10-15% of the lipids were phosphorylated.

The soluble enzymes were precipitated with polyethyleneimine and subjected to chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, DEAE-Sephadex, and phosphocellulose. RNA polymerase I was subjected to an additional chromatographic step on CM-Sephadex. The procedure required 40 h and produced purified RNA polymerase forms IA, IIA, and III in yields of 5 to 40%. The specific activities of RNA polymerases IIA and III (on native DNA) were comparable to those reported from other eukaryotic sources, whereas that of form IA was severalfold greater than the specific activities reported for other purified class I RNA polymerases. The complex subunit compositions of chromatographically purified RNA polymerases IA, IIA, and III were distinct when analyzed by polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, although all three classes contained polypeptides with Mr = 29,000, 23,000, and 19,000.

https://openalex.org/W1513380989,"An enzyme activity which catalyzed the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to GM2 ganglioside was demonstrated in rat liver homogenate and enriched 38-fold in specific activity by preparation of Golgi membranes. This activity could be solubilized from Golgi membranes by sonication and extraction with 1% Triton X-100. The solubilized activity catalyzed the formation of GM1 ganglioside and was completely dependent upon the addition of acceptor. The rate of galactose incorporation was constant for up to 5 h at 30 degrees C. This enzyme activity was further purified by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose. The elution position on gel filtration corresponded to a molecular weight for the enzyme of 38,000 which was in good agreement with that obtained by sedimentation velocity studies. Ion exchange chromatography resolved GM2 ganglioside galactosyltransferase into two species. The more basic enzyme (I) comprising 28% of the recovered activity was not retarded by the column, whereas enzyme II was eluted from the resin following the application of a salt gradient. Net purification was 120- to 140-fold for each enzyme with a total recovery of 42%. Unlike the activity in the Golgi extract, the purified enzymes I and II were labile to freezing and could be stored at -20 degrees C only in the presence of 50% glycerol. Both enzymes I and II had similar molecular weights and Michaelis constants and both had a strict requirement for Mn2+. Properties which distinguish the two enzymes included pH optima (enzyme I 7.0, enzyme II 6.0) and surfactant requirements. Neither enzyme was active following removal of Triton X-100 from the preparation. Among a series of glycolipids tested for ability to serve as substrates for galactose transfer only GM2 and asialo-GM2 ganglioside served as acceptors."

Unmodified and methylated peptides were digested with trypsin or submaxillary protease, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of only arginyl bonds in proteins. Trypsin catalyzed the hydrolysis of the methylated apomyoglobin peptide only at the single arginyl residue and not at any of the four N epsilon,N-dimethyllysyl residues. Trypsin also failed to catalyze the hydrolysis of reductively methylated H-D-valyl-L-leucyl-L-lysyl-p-nitroanilide. Even a 17-fold molar excess of the methylated substrate did not appear to alter the rate of tryptic hydrolysis of the unmodified substrate. These results are discussed with regard to the interactions of substrates within the specificity site of trypsin."

https://openalex.org/W1565590096,"The glutamyl-tRNA synthetase from Bacillus subtilis has been purified to homogeneity. It is a monomer of Mr = 65,500 whose NH2-terminal sequence is Met-Asn-Glu-Val-Arg-Val-Arg-Tyr-Ser-Pro-Ser-Pro-Thr-Gly-His-Leu. The number of tryptic peptides indicates the absence of a significant amount of sequence duplication. Under certain conditions, this monomeric enzyme is co-purified with a polypeptide beta of Mr = 46,000, which increases the affinity of the enzyme about 10-fold for glutamate and for ATP, and stabilizes it against heat inactivation. gamma-Globulins prepared against the monomeric enzyme can inhibit completely the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase activity of a B. subtilis extract and precipitate from this extract both the monomeric enzyme and the regulatory factor beta. These anti-alpha immunoglobulins do nt precipitate pure beta. These results show that the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase of B. subtilis has a structure similar to that of the Escherichia coli enzyme (Lapointe, J., and Soll, D. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 4966-4974) and indicate that the beta factor has a function in the regulation of glutamyl-tRNA biosynthesis in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1582393662,"Regulation of acetylcholine metabolism varied in brain slices from hippocampus and septum which have different proportions of cholinergic nerve cell bodies and nerve endings. Anoxia (0% oxygen) inhibited acetylcholine synthesis (-77%) and its calcium-dependent release (-87%) from hippocampal slices but had no effect on synthesis or release by septal slices. [1,5-14C]Citrate incorporation into acetylcholine was higher in septum than in hippocampus, which suggested that citrate metabolism differs regionally. (-)Hydroxycitrate, a specific inhibitor of ATP citrate (pro3S)-lyase (EC 4.1.3.8), reduced [U-14C]glucose incorporation into acetylcholine more in septal than in hippocampal slices. 14CO2 production from glucose or citrate was similar in control and experimental conditions in the two regions. These findings indicate that acetylcholine metabolism varies regionally, which may partially explain the selective vulnerability of certain brain areas to anoxia and other metabolic insults."
https://openalex.org/W1672540499,"The glycosylation states of five rat hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 isozymes (cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, P-450c, P-450d, and P-450e) were examined by quantitative carbohydrate analysis. Carbohydrate content of the purified enzymes as determined by acid hydrolysis, reduction, and gas chromatography of the alditol acetates revealed only trace amounts of neutral and amino hexoses in each of the five isozymes. Levels of mannose ranged from 0.3 to 1.7 mol/mol of cytochrome P-450 whereas levels of galactose were less than or equal to 0.2 mol/mol of cytochrome P-450 for the five hemoproteins. The amino sugars glucosamine and galactosamine were usually present at levels less than or equal to 0.2 mol/mol of cytochrome P-450, although one preparation of cytochrome P-450b had as much as 0.5 mol of glucosamine/mol of cytochrome P-450. Other carbohydrate residues (xylose and arabinose) were not detected in significant quantities. Since N- and O-glycosylation of proteins occurs primarily through N-acetylglucosaminyl and N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues, respectively, the lack of significant amounts of these amino sugars indicates that these five cytochrome P-450 isozymes are not normally glycosylated in the native state. Purified NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, which functions as an electron donor for microsomal cytochrome P-450, contained no detectable quantities of hexose sugars."
https://openalex.org/W1636166565,"Preincubation of rat adipocytes with ATP further stimulated maximal insulin action on glycogen synthase. Half-maximum concentration of ATP was 5 X 10(-5) M. ATP, ADP, adenosine, inosine, and GTP were effective, while beta-gamma-methylene ATP was without effect. ADP and GTP were less potent than ATP, adenosine, or inosine. Inosine was active without insulin but was without effect in the presence of insulin. The mechanism of action of adenosine was clearly different from ATP. While ATP required both Mg2+ and Ca2+ for effectiveness, adenosine required only Ca2+. The effect of ATP, but not of adenosine, was preserved after cells were washed. The adenosine effect was completely blocked by theophylline, but the ATP effect was inhibited only 40%. The ATP effect was thus not due to adenosine generated by ATP breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W1513239007,"The hydroxylation of lysine in embryonic chick long bone and mandibular collagen was found to be approximately 3-fold greater than that of the collagens of adult animals. In contrast, no significant difference was found in extent of lysine hydroxylation of the collagens of frontal bones of embryos and postnatal animals. Both histochemical and biochemical evidence established that full thickness diaphyseal bone samples contained cartilage and, consequently, type II collagen which undoubtedly contributed to the higher hydroxylysine contents of young postnatal animals reported previously. DEAE ion exchange chromatography of the alpha 1(I) chains of lathyritic long bone and mandibular collagens isolated by carboxymethyl-cellulose ion exchange chromatography showed considerable heterogeneity, whereas the alpha 1(I) chains obtained from lathyritic frontal bone collagen did not. Three fractions of alpha 1(I) chains of long bones and mandibular collagen were isolated which differed significantly in their hydroxylysine contents. The relative proportion of the three peaks changed as a function of embryonic age and maturation: more of the alpha 1(I) chains with the highest hydroxylysine content was present in the collagen synthesized earliest during embryonic development. This is consistent with results which demonstrated that the collagens synthesized earliest during embryonic and postnatal development had the highest hydroxylysine contents."
https://openalex.org/W1535315953,"ATP synthesis was studied in ADP + Pi-loaded, right-side-out membrane vesicles from Bacillus megaterium and its uncoupler-resistant mutant strain, C8. Upon energization with ascorbate/phenazine methosulfate, more ATP synthesis was observed in C8 vesicles than in those from the wild type. ATP synthesis by C8 vesicles was more resistant to low levels (0.5-1.0 microM) of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone than was synthesis by wild type vesicles, whereas synthesis by both preparations was completely inhibited by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Upon energization by a valinomycin-induced potassium diffusion potential, vesicles from the wild type strain synthesized more ATP than vesicles from C8, but that synthesis was still lower than observed with electron donors. The results indicate that the characteristic bioenergetic properties exhibited by whole cells of C8 are retained in a vesicle system and thus cannot be attributed to a cytoplasmic, substrate level activity. Interestingly, lipophilic cations that were efficacious in measuring the transmembrane electrical potential of whole cells appeared to accurately measure artificially generated potentials across vesicle membranes, but were not taken up upon addition of ascorbate/phenazine methosulfate."

https://openalex.org/W1484463907,"In order to generate the molecular probes needed to investigate the seemingly coordinate expression of carbonic anhydrase (CA I) and beta-globin within erythrocytes during human development, CA I-containing polyribosomes have been isolated from rabbit reticulocytes by reaction with purified antibodies to CA I followed by immunoadsorption of immune complexes with formalin-fixed protein A-bearing bacteria. In the course of such isolation, a series of maneuvers were seen to have a markedly favorable influence on the level of purity attained. These maneuvers include the use of 5 mg/ml of heparin concentrations to attenuate nonspecific binding and entrapment of unwanted polyribosomes, the addition of 200 units/ml of placental ribonuclease inhibitor to augment recovery in reactions which by test already appeared RNase-free, and the preadsorption of polyribosomes with formalin-fixed bacteria prior to immunological reaction so as to remove a subset of polyribosomes seemingly predisposed to nonspecific binding. In the absence of all of the maneuvers, attained purity was no greater than a few per cent. When all were employed, CA I-mRNA derived from immunopurified polyribosomes was recovered with more than 80% purity and 20% yield, as evident from both immunoassays and electrophoresis of its cell-free products."
https://openalex.org/W1521650468,"Insulin was found to double the rate of incorporation of H14CO3- into protein by segments of rat epididymal adipose tissue provided the incubation medium contained a suitable energy substrate such as fructose. Overall protein synthesis was increased by insulin to a lesser extent, one-third as measured by tritiated water indicating that insulin also increased CO2 fixation into amino acids. The latter could be demonstrated only when the tissue amino acid pools were expanded by the addition of aspartate to the incubation medium. The pattern of labeling observed in the amino acids indicated that CO2 fixation occurred primarily at the pyruvate carboxylase step. Addition of pyruvate to the incubation medium also increased CO2 fixation and this effect was not additive with that of insulin, suggesting that insulin acted by increasing the availability of pyruvate to the carboxylase. No change in carboxylase activity could be measured. Mitochondria isolated from tissue exposed to insulin retained a higher capacity to fix CO2 into acid-soluble products provided they were not freeze-thawed or sonicated. Uptake of pyruvate by mitochondria incubated 1 min at 2 degrees C or 5 s at 15 degrees C was doubled by prior insulin treatment of the tissue. It is concluded that insulin increases the flux through pyruvate carboxylase in adipose tissue in part by increasing the transport of pyruvate through the inner mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1585555086,"We examine the effect of temperature on the export of ribosomal precursor particles from nuclei isolated from Tetrahymena. A new phenomenon is observed. Temperature does affect not only the export rate, but also the maximal portion of particles exported. At 8 degrees C, for example, the export kinetics reveals a significantly lower saturation plateau which does not equilibrate with the higher plateau at 28 degrees C even after 3 h. This nonequilibration is not due to (i) a different physical quality of the exported particles, (ii) a degradation of the nuclear rRNA, (iii) a backward import of exported particles into nuclei, (iv) an irreversible inactivation of potentially transportable nuclear ribosomal ribonucleoprotein (rRNP) particles, or (v) a thermodynamic equilibrium between transportable rRNP particles associated with nuclei and those exported from nuclei. We conclude, therefore, that potentially transportable rRNP particles are somehow locked in nuclei at low temperature and temperature raising induces a graded unlocking."
https://openalex.org/W1550356787,"An oxidative metabolism of glucose 6-phosphate was studied in rat liver microsomal fraction. Although radioactive 14CO2 was formed from [1-14C]glucose 6-phosphate in the microsomal fraction (Hino, Y., and Minakami, S. (1982) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 92, 547-557), the formation was negligible when [2-14C]glucose 6-phosphate was used as a starting substrate. These results indicated an inability of the microsomal fraction to rearrange [2-14C]glucose 6-phosphate to form [1-14C] glucose 6-phosphate, and it was expected that a certain compound derived from glucose 6-phosphate accumulated as an end-product of the reaction. We, therefore, have tried to identify the product by high performance liquid chromatography, and found that ribose accumulated as the end-product. The formation of ribose was inhibited in the same manner as that of 14CO2 by antibodies against rat liver microsomal hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the ratios of ribose to 14CO2 formed in the reaction were 0.5-0.8 on a molar basis. The finding of ribose formation further suggested the involvement of ribose phosphate isomerase and phosphatase activities in the reaction."
