https://openalex.org/W2913319952,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a class of covalently closed RNAs, derived from non-canonical splicing events, which are expressed in all eukaryotes and often conserved among different species. We previously showed that the circRNA originating from the ZNF609 locus (circ-ZNF609) acts as a crucial regulator of human primary myoblast growth: indeed, the downregulation of the circRNA, and not of its linear counterpart, strongly reduced the proliferation rate of in vitro cultured myoblasts. To deepen our knowledge about circ-ZNF609 role in cell cycle regulation, we studied its expression and function in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a pediatric skeletal muscle malignancy. We found that circ-ZNF609 is upregulated in biopsies from the two major RMS subtypes, embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS). Moreover, we discovered that in an ERMS-derived cell line circ-ZNF609 knock-down induced a specific block at the G1-S transition, a strong decrease of p-Akt protein level and an alteration of the pRb/Rb ratio. Regarding p-Akt, we were able to show that circ-ZNF609 acts by counteracting p-Akt proteasome-dependent degradation, thus working as a new regulator of cell proliferation-related pathways. As opposed to ERMS-derived cells, the circRNA depletion had no cell cycle effects in ARMS-derived cells. Since in these cells the p53 gene resulted downregulated, with a concomitant upregulation of its cell cycle-related target genes, we suggest that this could account for the lack of circ-ZNF609 effect in ARMS."

Frantoio) at the experimental farm of University of Pisa at Venturina (Italy) in 2015 to assess the ability of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with RGB-NIR cameras to estimate leaf area index (LAI), tree height, canopy diameter and canopy volume of olive trees that were either irrigated or rainfed. Irrigated trees received water 4–5 days a week (1348 m3 ha-1), whereas the rainfed ones received a single irrigation of 19 m3 ha-1 to relieve the extreme stress. The flight altitude was 70 m above ground level (AGL), except for one flight (50 m AGL). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated by means of the map algebra technique. Canopy volume, canopy height and diameter were obtained from the digital surface model (DSM) obtained through automatic aerial triangulation, bundle block adjustment and camera calibration methods. The NDVI estimated on the day of the year (DOY) 130 was linearly correlated with both LAI and leaf chlorophyll measured on the same date (R2 = 0.78 and 0.80, respectively). The correlation between the on ground measured canopy volumes and the ones by the UAV-RGB camera techniques yielded an R2 of 0.71–0.86. The monthly canopy volume increment estimated from UAV surveys between (DOY) 130 and 244 was highly correlated with the daily water stress integral of rainfed trees (R2 = 0.99). The effect of water stress on the seasonal pattern of canopy growth was detected by these techniques in correspondence of the maximum level of stress experienced by the rainfed trees. The highest level of accuracy (RMSE = 0.16 m) in canopy height estimation was obtained when the flight altitude was 50 m AGL, yielding an R2 value of 0.87 and an almost 1:1 ratio of measured versus estimated canopy height."
https://openalex.org/W2914386419,"Angiogenesis is a critical process in repair of tissue injury that is regulated by a delicate balance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors. In disease states associated with impaired angiogenesis, we identified that miR-135a-3p is rapidly induced and serves as an antiangiogenic microRNA (miRNA) by targeting endothelial cell (EC) p38 signaling in vitro and in vivo. MiR-135a-3p overexpression significantly inhibited EC proliferation, migration, and network tube formation in matrigel, whereas miR-135-3p neutralization had the opposite effects. Mechanistic studies using transcriptomic profiling, bioinformatics, 3′-UTR reporter and miRNA ribonucleoprotein complex -immunoprecipitation assays, and small interfering RNA dependency studies revealed that miR-135a-3p inhibits the p38 signaling pathway in ECs by targeting huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1). Local delivery of miR-135a-3p inhibitors to wounds of diabetic db/db mice markedly increased angiogenesis, granulation tissue thickness, and wound closure rates, whereas local delivery of miR-135a-3p mimics impaired these effects. Finally, through gain- and loss-of-function studies in human skin organoids as a model of tissue injury, we demonstrated that miR-135a-3p potently modulated p38 signaling and angiogenesis in response to VEGF stimulation by targeting HIP1. These findings establish miR-135a-3p as a pivotal regulator of pathophysiological angiogenesis and tissue repair by targeting a VEGF-HIP1-p38K signaling axis, providing new targets for angiogenic therapy to promote tissue repair.—Icli, B., Wu, W., Ozdemir, D., Li, H., Haemmig, S., Liu, X., Giatsidis, G., Cheng, H.

https://openalex.org/W2914642540,"The under-five mortality rate (U5MR) is a critical and widely available population health indicator. Both the MDGs and SDGs define targets for improvement in the U5MR, and the SDGs require spatial disaggregation of indicators. We estimate trends in the U5MR for Admin-1 subnational areas using 122 DHS surveys in 35 countries in Africa and assess progress toward the MDG target reductions for each subnational region and each country as a whole. In each country, direct weighted estimates of the U5MR from each survey are calculated and combined into a single estimate for each Admin-1 region across five-year periods. Our method fully accounts for the sample design of each survey. The region-time-specific estimates are smoothed using a Bayesian, space-time model that produces more precise estimates (when compared to the direct estimates) at a one-year scale that are consistent with each other in both space and time. The resulting estimated distributions of the U5MR are summarized and used to assess subnational progress toward the MDG 4 target of two-thirds reduction in the U5MR during 1990-2015. Our space-time modeling approach is tractable and can be readily applied to a large collection of sample survey data. Subnational, regional spatial heterogeneity in the levels and trends in the U5MR vary considerably across Africa. There is no generalizable pattern between spatial heterogeneity and levels or trends in the U5MR. Subnational, small-area estimates of the U5MR: (i) identify subnational regions where interventions are still necessary and those where improvement is well under way; and (ii) countries where there is very little spatial variation and others where there are important differences between subregions in both levels and trends. More work is necessary to improve both the data sources and methods necessary to adequately measure subnational progress toward the SDG child survival targets."
https://openalex.org/W2912518750,"Aberrant epigenetic reprogramming is a major factor of developmental failure of cloned embryos. Histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a histone mark for transcriptional repression, plays important roles in mammalian embryonic development and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation. The global loss of H3K27me3 marks may facilitate iPSC generation in mice and humans. However, the H3K27me3 level and its role in bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) reprogramming remain poorly understood. Here, we show that SCNT embryos exhibit global H3K27me3 hypermethylation from the 2- to 8-cell stage and that its removal by ectopically expressed H3K27me3 lysine demethylase (KDM)6A greatly improves nuclear reprogramming efficiency. In contrast, H3K27me3 reduction by H3K27me3 methylase enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex knockdown or donor cell treatment with the enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex—selective inhibitor GSK343 suppressed blastocyst formation by SCNT embryos. KDM6A overexpression enhanced the transcription of genes involved in cell adhesion and cellular metabolism and X-linked genes. Furthermore, we identified methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 3-like 2, which was reactivated by KDM6A, as a factor that is required for effective reprogramming in bovines. These results show that H3K27me3 functions as an epigenetic barrier and that KDM6A overexpression improves SCNT efficiency by facilitating transcriptional reprogramming.—Zhou, C., Wang, Y., Zhang, J., Su, J., An, Q., Liu, X., Zhang, M., Wang, Y., Liu, J., Zhang, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2913533850,"Photosystem I (PSI) is a large pigment-protein complex mediating light-driven charge separation and generating a highly negative redox potential, which is eventually utilized to produce organic matter. In plants and algae, PSI possesses outer antennae, termed light-harvesting complex I (LHCI), which increase the energy flux to the reaction center. The number of outer antennae for PSI in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is known to be larger than that of land plants. However, their exact number and location remain to be elucidated. Here, applying a newly established sample purification procedure, we isolated a highly pure PSI-LHCI supercomplex containing all nine LHCA gene products under state 1 conditions. Single-particle cryo-EM revealed the 3D structure of this supercomplex at 6.9 A resolution, in which the densities near the PsaF and PsaJ subunits were assigned to two layers of LHCI belts containing eight LHCIs, whereas the densities between the PsaG and PsaH subunits on the opposite side of the LHCI belt were assigned to two extra LHCIs. Using single-particle cryo-EM, we also determined the 2D projection map of the lhca2 mutant, which confirmed the assignment of LHCA2 and LHCA9 to the densities between PsaG and PsaH. Spectroscopic measurements of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex suggested that the bound LHCA2 and LHCA9 proteins have the ability to increase the light-harvesting energy for PSI. We conclude that the PSI in C. reinhardtii has a larger and more distinct outer-antenna organization and higher light-harvesting capability than that in land plants."
https://openalex.org/W2913992350,"Obesity is a highly prevalent and modifiable breast cancer risk factor. While the role of obesity in fueling breast cancer progression is well established, the mechanisms linking obesity to breast cancer initiation are poorly understood. A hallmark of breast cancer initiation is the disruption of apical polarity in mammary glands. Here we show that mice with diet-induced obesity display mislocalization of Par3, a regulator of cellular junctional complexes defining mammary epithelial polarity. We found that epithelial polarity loss also occurs in a 3D coculture system that combines acini with human mammary adipose tissue, and establish that a paracrine effect of the tissue adipokine leptin causes loss of polarity by overactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Leptin sensitizes non-neoplastic cells to proliferative stimuli, causes mitotic spindle misalignment, and expands the pool of cells with stem/progenitor characteristics, which are early steps for cancer initiation. We also found that normal breast tissue samples with high leptin/adiponectin transcript ratio characteristic of obesity have an altered distribution of apical polarity markers. This effect is associated with increased epithelial cell layers. Our results provide a molecular basis for early alterations in epithelial architecture during obesity-mediated cancer initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2924529414,"Pancreatic β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus is a serious challenge that results in an inability of the pancreas to produce sufficient insulin to properly regulate blood glucose levels. Trace amine–associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a G protein–coupled receptor expressed by β-cells that has recently been proposed as a potential target for improving glycemic control and suppressing binge eating behaviors. We discovered that TAAR1 is coupled to Gαs-signaling pathways in insulin-secreting β-cells to cause protein kinase A (PKA)/exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac)–dependent release of insulin, activation of RAF proto-oncogene, Ser/Thr kinase (Raf)–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, induction of cAMP response element–binding protein (CREB)–insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs-2), and increased β-cell proliferation. Interestingly, TAAR1 triggered cAMP-mediated calcium influx and release from internal stores, both of which were required for activation of a MAPK cascade utilizing calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), Raf, and MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2). Together, these data identify TAAR1/Gαs-mediated signaling pathways that promote insulin secretion, improved β-cell function and proliferation, and highlight TAAR1 as a promising new target for improving β-cell health in type 2 diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2911558244,"Exposure to early-life stress (ES) is associated with cognitive and metabolic deficits in adulthood. The role of early nutrition in programming these long-term effects is largely unknown. We focused on essential ω-3 and ω-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) and investigated whether ES affects central and peripheral FA profiles, as well as if and how an early diet with increased availability of ω-3 LCPUFA (via lowering ω-6/ω-3 ratio) protects against ES-induced impairments. ES exposure [limited nesting and bedding paradigm from postnatal day (P)2 to P9] altered central and peripheral FA profiles in mice. An early diet with low ω-6/ω-3 ratio from P2 to P42 notably prevented the ES-induced cognitive impairments, and the alterations in hippocampal newborn cell survival and in CD68+ microglia, without affecting the ES-induced metabolic alterations. Other markers for hippocampal plasticity, apoptosis, and maternal care were unaffected by ES or diet. Our findings highlight the importance of early dietary lipid quality for later cognition in ES-exposed populations.—Yam, K.-Y., Schipper, L., Reemst, K., Ruigrok, S. R., Abbink, M.

https://openalex.org/W2914313001,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent neoplastic diseases worldwide, and effective treatment remains a challenge. Here, we found that the macrolide antibiotic brefeldin A (BFA) exhibits considerable antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of complete autophagic flux is characterized as a key event in BFA-induced CRC suppression. Mechanistically, BFA provokes endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated binding immunoglobulin protein (Bip) expression, leading to increased Bip/Akt interaction and resultant decreased Akt phosphorylation, thereby activating autophagy. Autophagy inhibition or Bip suppression relieves BFA-induced cell death, suggesting a key role for Bip-regulated autophagy in the antitumor properties of BFA. Moreover, BFA acts synergistically with paclitaxel or 5-fluorouracil in CRC suppression. Collectively, our study provides an important molecular basis for BFA-induced autophagy and suggests that the antibiotic BFA could be repositioned as a potential anticancer drug for CRC treatment.—Zhou, L., Gao, W., Wang, K., Huang, Z., Zhang, L., Zhang, Z., Zhou, J., Nice, E.

In an effort to increase linkage to care (LTC) of HIV positive clients an innovative collaborative intervention between two non-governmental organisations was developed and implemented between 2016 and 2017. This paper investigated the outcome of this collaborative intervention.We used a mixed methods approach to assess the outcome of the innovative relationship. This was done by analysing routine programmatic quantitative data on LTC between 2015 and 2017 and qualitatively interviewing five programme managers, four programme implementers and five HIV positive clients on their perceived success/failure factors. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis while LTC rates were descriptively analysed. Two consultative meetings presented draft findings to programme managers (n = 7) and implementers (n = 10) for feedback, results verification and confirmation.In 2015 cumulative LTC rate was 27% and it rose to 85% two years post-intervention in 2017. Six themes emerged as success factors at the health system and structural levels and these include: provision of client escort services, health facility human resource capacity strengthening, inter and intra-organisational teamwork, onsite LTC, facilitated and expedited jumping of queues and shifting administrative tasks to non-clinical staff to protect nurses' time on ART initiation. These measures in turn ensured increased, affordable and swift ART initiation of clients while strengthening client support.We concluded that multi-faceted interventions that target both health system challenges including staff shortages, efficiencies, and extended facility opening times, and structural inadequacies, including client time and resource limitations due to poverty or nature of jobs, can help to increase LTC."

Moreover, ACE overexpression in monocytes and macrophages increases resistance of mice to tumor growth. ACE is composed of two independent catalytic domains. Here, to investigate the specific role of each domain in tumor resistance, we overexpressed either WT ACE (Tg-ACE mice) or ACE lacking N- or C-domain catalytic activity (Tg-NKO and Tg-CKO mice) in the myeloid cells of mice. Tg-ACE and Tg-NKO mice exhibited strongly suppressed growth of B16-F10 melanoma because of increased ACE expression in macrophages, whereas Tg-CKO mice resisted melanoma no better than WT animals. The effect of ACE overexpression reverted to that of the WT enzyme with an ACE inhibitor but not with an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist. ACE C-domain overexpression in macrophages drove them toward a pronounced M1 phenotype upon tumor stimulation, with increased activation of NF-κB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and decreased STAT3 and STAT6 activation. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is important for M1 activation, and TNFα blockade reverted Tg-NKO macrophages to a WT phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2911584197,"Human interleukin-12 (hIL-12) is a heparin-binding cytokine whose activity was previously shown to be enhanced by heparin and other sulfated glycosaminoglycans. The current study investigated the mechanisms by which heparin increases hIL-12 activity. Using multiple human cell types, including natural killer cells, an IL-12 indicator cell line, and primary peripheral blood mononuclear and T cells, along with bioactivity, flow cytometry, and isothermal titration calorimetry assays, we found that heparin-dependent modulation of hIL-12 function correlates with several of heparin’s biophysical characteristics, including chain length, sulfation level, and concentration. Specifically, only heparin molecules longer than eight saccharide units enhanced hIL-12 activity. Furthermore, heparin molecules with three sulfate groups per disaccharide unit outperformed heparin molecules with one or two sulfate groups per disaccharide unit in terms of enhanced hIL-12 binding and activity. Heparin also significantly reduced the EC50 value of hIL-12 by up to 11.8-fold, depending on the responding cell type. Cytokine-profiling analyses revealed that heparin affected the level, but not the type, of cytokines produced by lymphocytes in response to hIL-12. Interestingly, although murine IL-12 also binds heparin, heparin did not enhance its activity. Using the gathered data, we propose a model of hIL-12 stabilization in which heparin serves as a co-receptor enhancing the interaction between heterodimeric hIL-12 and its receptor subunits.

https://openalex.org/W2912325942,"Neuroblastoma cells highly express the disialoganglioside GD2, a tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen, which is only sparsely expressed on healthy tissue. GD2 is a primary target for the development of immunotherapy for neuroblastoma. Immunotherapy with monoclonal anti-GD2 antibodies has proven safety and efficacy in clinical trials and is included in the standard treatment for children with high-risk neuroblastoma. Strategies to modulate GD2 expression in neuroblastoma could further improve anti-GD2-targeted immunotherapy. Here, we report that the cellular sialylation pathway, as well as epigenetic reprogramming, strongly modulates GD2 expression in human and mouse neuroblastoma cell lines. Recognition of GD2 by the 14G2a antibody is sialic acid-dependent and was blocked with the fluorinated sialic acid mimetic Ac53FaxNeu5Ac. Interestingly, sialic acid supplementation using a cell-permeable sialic acid analogue (Ac5Neu5Ac) boosted GD2 expression without or with minor alterations in overall cell surface sialylation. Furthermore, sialic acid supplementation with Ac5Neu5Ac combined with various histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, including vorinostat, enhanced GD2 expression in neuroblastoma cells beyond their individual effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that Ac5Neu5Ac supplementation increased intracellular CMP-Neu5Ac concentrations, thereby providing higher substrate levels for sialyltransferases. Furthermore, HDAC inhibitor treatment increased mRNA expression of the sialyltransferases GM3 synthase (ST3GAL5) and GD3 synthase (ST8SIA1), both of which are involved in GD2 biosynthesis. Our findings reveal that sialic acid analogues and HDAC inhibitors enhance GD2 expression and could potentially be employed to boost anti-GD2 targeted immunotherapy in neuroblastoma patients."

These proteins share a high degree of homology and both can activate or repress transcription. Deficiency of either one of them in the non-cancer host cells was shown to reduce metastases. As ATF3 and JDP2 compensate each other’s function, we studied the double deficiency of ATF3 and JDP2 in the stromal tumor microenvironment. Here, we show that mice with ATF3 and JDP2 double deficiency (designated thereafter dKO) developed larger tumors with high vascular perfusion and increased cell proliferation rate compared to wild type (WT) mice. We further identify that the underlying mechanism involves tumor associated fibroblasts which secrete high levels of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in dKO fibroblasts. SDF-1 depletion in dKO fibroblasts dampened tumor growth and blood vessel perfusion. Furthermore, ATF3 and JDP2 were found to regulate SDF-1 transcription and secretion in fibroblasts, a phenomenon that is potentiated in the presence of cancer cells. Collectively, our results suggest that ATF3 and JDP2 regulate the expression of essential tumor promoting factors expressed by fibroblasts within the tumor microenvironment, and thus restrain tumor growth."

https://openalex.org/W2914001275,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the capacity for self-renewal to maintain the HSCs' pool and the ability for multilineage differentiation, which are responsible for sustained production of multiple blood lineages. The regulation of HSC development is controlled precisely by complex signal networks and hematopoietic microenvironment, which has been termed the HSCs' niche. The Wnt signaling pathway is one of a variety of signaling pathways that have been involved in HSC self-renewal and maintenance. Previous studies are indeterminant on the regulation of adult HSCs upon canonical Wnt signaling pathways because of the different experimental systems and models used. In this study, we generated the conditional knockout Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (Lrp5) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (Lrp6) mice in adult hematopoiesis via Vav-Cre Loxp system. Inactivation of Lrp5 and -6 in a hematopoietic system diminished the pool of HSCs, but there were no obvious defects in mature immune cells. Lrp5 and -6 double deficiency HSCs showed intrinsic defects in self-renewal and differentiation due to reduced proliferation and increased quiescence of the cell cycle. Analysis of HSC gene expression suggested that the quiescence regulators were significantly up-regulated, such as Egr1, Cdkn1a, Nr4a1, Gata2, Junb and Btg2, and the positive cell cycle regulators were correspondingly down-regulated, such as Ccna2 and Ranbp1. Taken together, we investigated the roles of Lrp5 and -6 in HSCs by functional and bioinformatic assays, and we demonstrated that Lrp5 and -6 are required for the self-renewal and differentiation of adult HSCs. The canonical Wnt pathway may contribute to maintaining the HSC pool and regulate the differentiation of adult HSCs by controlling cell cycle gene regulatory module.—Liu, J., Cui, Z., Wang, F., Yao, Y., Yu, G., Liu, J., Cao, D., Niu, S., You, M., Sun, Z., Lian, D., Zhao, T., Kang, Y., Zhao, Y., Xue, H.-H., Yu, S.

The introduction of clozapine in the 1970s was a major milestone in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia because clozapine appeared to demonstrate superior efficacy against both positive and negative symptoms, with significantly minimized risk of EPS (5Meltzer H.Y.

However, clozapine-induced agranulocytosis and metabolic side effects that increase risk for cardiovascular morbidity (5Meltzer H.Y. Update on typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.Annu. Rev.

Several second-generation APDs were developed by searching for molecules that shared pharmacological properties of clozapine that were distinct relative to the preceding first-generation drugs. A well-described property that was utilized in that effort is that clozapine displays reduced binding affinity for D2R and enhanced binding affinity for 5-HT2A serotonin receptors (5Meltzer H.Y. Update on typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.Annu. Rev. Med. 2013; 64 (23020880): 393-40610.1146/annurev-med-050911-161504Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms that have been proposed to differentiate first- and second-generation drugs include binding to subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, adrenergic receptors, or glutamate receptors as well as fast dissociation kinetics, low affinity, and transient occupancy at D2R (6Wenthur C.J. Lindsley C.W. Classics in chemical neuroscience: clozapine.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2013; 4 (24047509): 1018-102510.1021/cn400121zCrossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Seeman P.

However, evidence from both clinical trials and practice, reviewed in numerous papers (7Meltzer H.Y. Clozapine: balancing safety with superior antipsychotic efficacy.Clin. Schizophr. Relat.

For example, clozapine has the strongest evidence for utility in treatment-resistant schizophrenia and produces the greatest suppression of mortality in schizophrenia (5Meltzer H.Y. Update on typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.Annu. Rev. Med. 2013; 64 (23020880): 393-40610.1146/annurev-med-050911-161504Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 7Meltzer H.Y.

A recent meta-analysis, and one of the largest conducted with psychotropic drugs, showed that clozapine was the most effective APD at suppressing schizophrenia symptoms (12Leucht S. Cipriani A.

The same analysis also concluded that clozapine has the lowest liability for producing EPS. The favorable motor side-effect profile of clozapine is further highlighted by the fact that it is used more than any other APD for suppressing psychoses in Parkinson’s disease (13Friedman J.H. Parkinson disease psychosis: update.Behav. Neurol. 2013; 27 (23242358): 469-47710.1155/2013/645429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been said that, “patients treated with clozapine may occasionally experience an ’awakening’ characterized by a return to a near normal level of cognitive, interpersonal, and vocational functioning” (14Stahl S.M. Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: Neuroscientific Basis and Practical Applications.4th Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2013: 180Google Scholar). Accordingly, clozapine has been referred to as the “gold standard” for the treatment of schizophrenia (7Meltzer H.Y. Clozapine: balancing safety with superior antipsychotic efficacy.Clin. Schizophr. Relat. Psychoses. 2012; 6 (23006238): 134-14410.3371/CSRP.6.3.5Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Kang X. Simpson G.M. Clozapine: more side effects but still the best antipsychotic.J.

Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: Neuroscientific Basis and Practical Applications.4th Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2013: 180Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular explanations proposed for distinguishing first- and second-generation APDs cannot account for the distinct therapeutic profile of clozapine because they are properties shared by multiple first- and second-generation drugs. For instance, one proposed hypothesis for clozapine’s unique mechanism of clinical action is that it has relatively rapid dissociation kinetics from D2R (8Seeman P. Clozapine, a fast-off-D2 antipsychotic.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2014; 5 (24219174): 24-2910.1021/cn400189sCrossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, data from multiple studies indicate that the dissociation rate of clozapine from D2R is not significantly slower than that reported for some other APDs, including quetiapine, remoxipride, amisulpride, and sulpiride (8Seeman P.

It is now well-established that a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) can exist in more than just an “on” or “off” conformation. Moreover, different ligands could differentially stabilize each of these multiple GPCR conformations even though they bind to the same orthosteric site in a GPCR as described by the phenomenon of biased agonism (18Wisler J.W. Xiao K. Thomsen A.R.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent developments in biased agonism.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 27 (24680426): 18-2410.1016/j.ceb.2013.10.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Such distinct conformations may differently engage downstream effectors, but they could as well differentially modulate other biochemical properties, such as expression and trafficking of GPCRs. D2R supersensitivity or increases in brain D2R after chronic treatment with APDs have been suggested as underlying mechanisms for the development of resistance to pharmacotherapy in schizophrenia (19Samaha A.-N. Seeman P. Stewart J. Rajabi H. Kapur S. “Breakthrough” dopamine supersensitivity during ongoing antipsychotic treatment leads to treatment failure over time.J.

In addition, APD-induced up-regulation of D2R has been implicated in TD (21Seeman P. Tardive dyskinesia, dopamine receptors, and neuroleptic damage to cell membranes.J. Clin. Psychopharmacol. 1988; 8 (2906067): 3S-9S10.1097/00004714-198808001-00002Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Silvestri S. Seeman M.V. Negrete J.C. Houle S. Shammi C.M. Remington G.J.

Therefore, here we have investigated the actions of APDs on cell-surface up-regulation of D2R. We report that every APD that we tested, in the absence of dopamine, enhanced either cell-surface levels or cell-surface insertion of D2R relative to both clozapine and vehicle. Thus, our data suggest that further investigating the distinctive actions of clozapine on the trafficking and cellular processing of D2R, the common target of all APDs, could be a useful avenue for research into understanding the molecular basis for the distinct therapeutic profile of clozapine. D2R is known to be endogenously expressed in the prolactin-secreting, pituitary-derived MMQ cell line (23Judd A.M. MacLeod R.M. Dopamine receptor and adrenoceptor agonists inhibit prolactin release from MMQ cells.Eur. J.

Endocrinol. 1995; 14 (7669227): 375-38910.1677/jme.0.0140375Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We measured cell-surface levels of D2R, endogenously expressed in the MMQ cell after treatment with the first-generation APD, haloperidol, or with clozapine (10 μm, 24 h). The surface levels of endogenous D2R were evaluated by isolating cell-surface proteins through specific biotinylation of these proteins. D2R present in the pool of cell-surface proteins was then quantified using an anti-D2R antibody that was previously validated with tissue from D2R knockout and WT mice (25Trifilieff P. Rives M.-L. Urizar E. Piskorowski R.A. Vishwasrao H.D. Castrillon J. Schmauss C. Slättman M. Gullberg M. Javitch J.A.

We observed that, even in the absence of dopamine, haloperidol, but not clozapine, significantly enhanced surface levels of D2R (Fig. 1). We also evaluated the actions of haloperidol and clozapine on the cell-surface expression of a D2R construct stably expressed in a CHO cell line. The cell line was selected and evaluated to express D2R at a density equal to or lower than that observed in mouse brain, as described previously (26Guo W. Urizar E. Kralikova M. Mobarec J.C. Shi L. Filizola M. Javitch J.A. Dopamine D2 receptors form higher order oligomers at physiological expression levels.EMBO J. 2008; 27 (18668123): 2293-230410.1038/emboj.2008.153Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 27Klein Herenbrink C.

In this cell line, as in MMQ cells, haloperidol treatment significantly increased cell-surface D2R expression over vehicle, and no detectable increase in expression was observed after clozapine treatment (Fig. S1). Subsequently, we explored the use of a more tractable system for investigating the cellular mechanisms underlying the differential up-regulation of cell-surface D2R by haloperidol and clozapine. We found that haloperidol treatment (10 μm) produced a time-dependent enhancement of cell-surface expression of FLAG-tagged D2R transiently expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, using this system, we showed that the differential actions of haloperidol and clozapine treatment on up-regulating cell-surface expression of D2R were also observed with the short D2 isoform (D2SR) (28Monsma Jr., F.J. McVittie L.D. Gerfen C.R. Mahan L.C. Sibley D.R. Multiple D2 dopamine receptors produced by alternative RNA splicing.Nature. 1989; 342 (2480527): 926-92910.1038/342926a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). We generated concentration–response curves for APD-mediated enhancement of cell-surface FLAG-D2R expression after treatment (24 h) with haloperidol, clozapine, and the second-generation APD, olanzapine (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the APD-induced D2R cell-surface up-regulation response for clozapine plateaued at significantly lower levels compared with the other drugs at ∼30% of the haloperidol response. These data indicate that different APDs have different efficacies for up-regulating cell-surface D2R. We then performed a wider screen that compared the cell-surface D2R up-regulation produced by a larger number of APDs. We found that a saturating concentration of clozapine produced significantly less enhancement of cell-surface D2R than that which could be produced by all tested first- and second-generation APDs, with the exception of aripiprazole (Fig. 2D). Receptor-mediated cellular responses of ligands are a function of both the fractional occupancy of receptor by the ligand and the efficacy of the ligand–receptor complex for producing the cellular response. However, because APDs, except for aripiprazole, produced D2R cell-surface up-regulation greater than the maximum that was produced by clozapine, we may conclude that the efficacy of most APDs for producing cell-surface D2R up-regulation is greater than that of clozapine. We utilized a subset of five APDs to investigate whether the different efficacies of the APDs for up-regulating cell-surface expression of D2R were the result of corresponding influences on total cellular D2R. Total cellular FLAG-D2R levels were evaluated by probing cells, which were first made permeable with methanol, with anti-FLAG antibody. We found that that four of the five tested APDs, including clozapine, increased total cellular D2R to a similar extent (Fig. 2E). Hence, we may conclude that the significantly enhanced cell-surface D2R expression produced by other APDs relative to clozapine (Fig. 2D) involves post-translational mechanisms. Cell-surface D2R levels normalized against total receptor levels were lowest with clozapine, and furthermore, clozapine was the only APD for which cell-surface expression of D2R normalized to total receptor was significantly decreased (∼60% of vehicle) after drug treatment (Fig. 2F). Unlike what was observed with clozapine, total cellular FLAG-D2R levels were significantly lower in aripiprazole-treated cells compared with all other treatments (Fig. 2E). Consequently, cell-surface levels of FLAG-D2R after aripiprazole treatment were significantly higher than with clozapine when normalized against total cell-surface receptor. These data (Fig. 2, D–F) suggest that different mechanisms account for why clozapine and aripiprazole produced similar weak enhancements of surface D2R expression, compared with other APDs (Fig. 2D); aripiprazole did not significantly increase total D2R (Fig. 2E), whereas all other APDs, including clozapine, did. We also determined that whereas the APD-mediated promotion of D2R cell-surface expression was significantly enhanced as the total cellular expression level of D2R was increased, the differential actions of haloperidol and clozapine for up-regulating cell-surface D2R was preserved (i.e. the increase in cell-surface D2R produced by clozapine treatment as a fraction of that produced by haloperidol was not changed) (Fig. S2A). Neither haloperidol nor clozapine treatment up-regulated cell-surface or total cellular levels of the mutant D2R, D2RD114A (Fig. S3, A and B), which does not bind agonists or antagonists (29Han Y. Moreira I.S. Urizar E. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Allosteric communication between protomers of dopamine class A GPCR dimers modulates activation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5 (19648932): 688-69510.1038/nchembio.199Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Haloperidol and clozapine do not bind β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) or μ-opioid receptors (MOR) with significant affinity, and neither haloperidol nor clozapine produced cell-surface up-regulation of β2AR (Fig. S4A) or MOR (Fig. S4B). Taken together, the data indicate that APD-mediated up-regulation of cell-surface receptors requires direct receptor binding. Both haloperidol and clozapine have nanomolar affinities (KD of ∼120 and 9 nm, respectively) for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor (5Meltzer H.Y. Update on typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.Annu. Rev. Med. 2013; 64 (23020880): 393-40610.1146/annurev-med-050911-161504Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 30Peprah K. Zhu X.Y. Eyunni S.V.K. Setola V. Roth B.L. Ablordeppey S.Y.

Interestingly, both haloperidol and clozapine up-regulated cell-surface levels of the 5-HT2A receptor (Fig. S4C). With 5HT2A, however, clozapine treatment produced significantly greater enhancement of cell-surface receptor expression than the maximum that could be produced by haloperidol (Fig. S4C). Thus, the experiment with the 5-HT2A receptor further illustrates that the lower efficacy of clozapine for enhancing cell-surface expression of target receptors is specific to D2R. For every APD for which we generated concentration–response curves (Figs. 2C and 3), the potency for increasing cell-surface D2R expression was observed to be lower than their previously determined affinities for D2R (16Sykes D.A.

In other words, the concentration required to produce ∼50% of the maximal cell-surface D2R up-regulation response was higher than the concentration that binds 50% of cell-surface D2R. The low potency with respect to binding affinity is surprising because basic pharmacological principles suggest that concentration–response curves for GPCR-mediated cellular responses should either 1) coincide with the binding curve for the receptor ligand producing the response or 2) be shifted to the left of the binding curve, due to signal amplification that can occur with G protein pathways (32Arshavsky V.Y. Burns M.E. Current understanding of signal amplification in phototransduction.Cell. Logist. 2014; 4 (25279249)e2939010.4161/cl.29390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The -fold difference between affinity for D2R and potency for up-regulating D2R varied widely between the different APDs, differing from 10-fold for olanzapine and 100-fold for haloperidol (Fig. S5A, y axis). Interestingly, however, there was a correlation between the cell permeability of the different APDs, as determined previously by Dos Santos Pereira et al. (33Dos Santos Pereira J.N. Tadjerpisheh S. Abu Abed M. Saadatmand A.R. Weksler B. Romero I.A. Couraud P.-O. Brockmöller J. Tzvetkov M.V. The poorly membrane permeable antipsychotic drugs amisulpride and sulpiride are substrates of the organic cation transporters from the SLC22 family.AAPS J. 2014; 16 (25155823): 1247-125810.1208/s12248-014-9649-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the -fold difference between potency to increase cell-surface expression and affinity (Fig. S5A). In other words, the more membrane-permeable an APD, the lower the difference between the potency for increasing cell-surface D2R expression and D2R affinity. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that APD-mediated D2R cell-surface up-regulation is produced not by the APD molecules present in the extracellular solution that bind to extracellular D2R binding sites. Instead, they suggest that APD-mediated D2R cell-surface up-regulation is driven by the smaller proportion of the drug that penetrates the cell membrane and can diffuse into the cell to bind to an intracellular pool of D2R. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of co-expression of the organic cation transporter, OCT1 (33Dos Santos Pereira J.N. Tadjerpisheh S. Abu Abed M. Saadatmand A.R. Weksler B. Romero I.A.

Hence, we infer that amisulpride acted at an intracellular site to up-regulate cell-surface D2R, because enhancing transport of amisulpride into the cell significantly increased the potency for producing the response. Tiapride is not a substrate for OCT1, and co-expression of OCT1 had no effect on the tiapride-mediated cell-surface D2R up-regulation concentration curve (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we may conclude that the requirement of the various APDs to cross the cell membrane to bind to an intracellular pool of D2R is why higher concentrations of drug are required to enhance cell-surface D2R than would be predicted by their affinity for D2R. Whereas we observed a correlation between the cell permeability of different APDs and the -fold difference between potency to increase cell surface expression and affinity (Fig. S5A), we saw no such correlation between cell permeability and the efficacy of different APDs to increase cell surface expression (Fig. S5B). Together, these data indicate that whereas the cell permeability of APD"

Here, we show that EphA2 knockdown causes mitotic errors, including a delay in M-phase progression, asymmetric spindle positioning, multipolar spindles, and cell blebs. It has been known that EphA2 is phosphorylated at Tyr588, which is triggered by the ligand binding, and at Ser897 downstream of growth factor signaling. Upon mitotic entry, EphA2 is phosphorylated at Ser897, accompanied by a reduction in Tyr588 phosphorylation. This EphA2 phosphorylation at Ser897 is inhibited by MEK/ERK and 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) inhibitors and is induced by the introduction of active cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and cyclin B1. EphA2 knockdown-induced M-phase delay and cell blebs are rescued by wild type EphA2 expression but not by Ser897Ala mutant. The Ras homolog gene family member G (RhoG) guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ephexin4 interacts with EphA2 in a Ser897 phosphorylation–dependent manner, and its knockdown delays M-phase progression and causes RhoG delocalization. RhoG knockdown delays M-phase progression, and EphA2 knockdown-induced M-phase delay is partially rescued by the constitutively active RhoG mutant. These results suggest that, in EphA2-expressing cells, EphA2 phosphorylation at Ser897 participates in proper M-phase progression downstream of the Cdk1/MEK/ERK/RSK pathway because of its role in maintaining cortical rigidity via Ephexin4 and RhoG and thereby regulating mitotic spindle formation. —Kaibori, Y.

A screening method optimized to discover cytotoxic compounds selective for MLL-rearranged leukemia identified CCI-006 as a novel inhibitor of MLL-rearranged and CALM-AF10 translocated leukemias that share common leukemogenic pathways. CCI-006 inhibited mitochondrial respiration and induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and apoptosis in a subset (7/11, 64%) of MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines within a few hours of treatment. The unresponsive MLL-rearranged leukemia cells did not undergo mitochondrial membrane depolarization or apoptosis despite a similar attenuation of mitochondrial respiration by the compound. In comparison to the sensitive cells, the unresponsive MLL-rearranged leukemia cells were characterized by a more glycolytic metabolic phenotype, exemplified by a more pronounced sensitivity to glycolysis inhibitors and elevated HIF1α expression. Silencing of HIF1α expression sensitized an intrinsically unresponsive MLL-rearranged leukemia cell to CCI-006, indicating that this pathway plays a role in determining sensitivity to the compound. In addition, unresponsive MLL-rearranged leukemia cells expressed increased levels of MEIS1, an important leukemogenic MLL target gene that plays a role in regulating metabolic phenotype through HIF1α. MEIS1 expression was also variable in a pediatric MLL-rearranged ALL patient dataset, highlighting the existence of a previously undescribed metabolic variability in MLL-rearranged leukemia that may contribute to the heterogeneity of the disease. This study thus identified a novel small molecule that rapidly kills MLL-rearranged leukemia cells by targeting a metabolic vulnerability in a subset of low HIF1α/low MEIS1-expressing MLL-rearranged leukemia cells."

The spectral characteristics of PE are due to its prosthetic groups, or phycoerythrobilins (PEBs), that are covalently attached to the protein chain by specific bilin lyases. Only two PE lyases have been identified and characterized so far, and the other bilin lyases are unknown. Here, using in silico analyses, markerless deletion, biochemical assays with purified and recombinant proteins, and site-directed mutagenesis, we examined the role of a putative lyase-encoding gene, cpeF, in the cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon. Analyzing the phenotype of the cpeF deletion, we found that cpeF is required for proper PE biogenesis, specifically for ligation of the doubly linked PEB to Cys-48/Cys-59 residues of the CpeB subunit of PE. We also show that in a heterologous host, CpeF can attach PEB to Cys-48/Cys-59 of CpeB, but only in the presence of the chaperone-like protein CpeZ. Additionally, we report that CpeF likely ligates the A ring of PEB to Cys-48 prior to the attachment of the D ring to Cys-59. We conclude that CpeF is the bilin lyase responsible for attachment of the doubly ligated PEB to Cys-48/Cys-59 of CpeB and together with other specific bilin lyases contributes to the post-translational modification and assembly of PE into mature light-harvesting complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2911285848,"Image segmentation, as a key step of microarray image processing, is crucial for obtaining the spot expressions simultaneously. However, state-of-art clustering-based segmentation algorithms are sensitive to noises. To solve this problem and improve the segmentation accuracy, in this article, several improvements are introduced into the fast and simple clustering methods (K-means and Fuzzy C means). Firstly, a contrast enhancement algorithm is implemented in image preprocessing to improve the gridding precision. Secondly, the data-driven means are proposed for cluster center initialization, instead of usual random setting. The third improvement is that the multi features, including intensity features, spatial features, and shape features, are implemented in feature selection to replace the sole pixel intensity feature used in the traditional clustering-based methods to avoid taking noises as spot pixels. Moreover, the principal component analysis is adopted for various feature extraction. Finally, an adaptive adjustment algorithm is proposed based on data mining and learning for further dealing with the missing spots or low contrast spots. Experiments on real and simulation data sets indicate that the proposed improvements made our proposed method obtains higher segmented precision than the traditional K-means and Fuzzy C means clustering methods."
https://openalex.org/W2911669505,"Background Mental health stigma persists despite coordinated and widely-evaluated interventions. Socioeconomic, structural, and regional context may be important in shaping attitudes to mental illness, and response to stigma interventions. Regional differences in attitudes towards mental illness could be relevant for intervention, but have not been systematically explored. We evaluated regional variation in mental health stigma using nationally representative data from England, the Health Survey for England (HSE), from 2014. Methods A previously derived scale for mental health-related attitudes with 2 factors (i. tolerance and support, ii. prejudice and exclusion), and overall attitudes, were outcomes. Weighted linear regressions estimated contribution of individual characteristics and region of residence to inter-individual variability in mental health-related attitudes. Results London and southern regions tended to have more negative mental health-related attitudes. These differences were not fully or consistently explained by individual sociodemographic characteristics, or personal familiarity with mental illness. Conclusions Stigma policies could require refinements based on geographic setting. Regions may be in particular need of stigma interventions, or be more resistant to them. Regional differences might be related to media coverage of mental illness, funding differences, service availability, or accessibility of educational opportunities. Greater geographic detail is necessary to examine reasons for regional variation in stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental illness, for example through multilevel analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2913021968,"In the Benguela upwelling system, the environmental conditions are determined to a large extent by central water masses advected from remote areas onto the shelf. The origin, spreading pathways and fate of those water masses are investigated with a regional ocean model that is analysed using Eulerian passive tracers and on the basis of Lagrangian trajectories. Two major water masses influencing the Benguela upwelling system are identified: tropical South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) and subtropical Eastern South Atlantic Central Water (ESACW). The spreading of tropical waters into the subtropical Benguela upwelling system is mediated by equatorial currents and their continuation in the Southeast Atlantic. This tropical-subtropical connection has been attributed to signal propagation in the equatorial and coastal waveguides. However, there exists an additional spreading path for tropical central water in the open ocean. This mass transport fluctuates on a seasonal scale around an averaged meridional transport in Sverdrup balance. The inter-annual variability of the advection of tropical waters is related to Benguela Niños, as evidenced by the 2010/2011 event. The northern Benguela upwelling system is a transition zone between SACW and ESACW since they encounter each other at about 20°S. Both water masses have seasonal variable shares in the upwelled water there. To summarise the main pathways of central water mass transport, an enhanced scheme for the subsurface circulation in the Southeast Atlantic is presented."

Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a member of the STAT family of transcription factors, plays a pivotal role in inducing reactive astrocytes and glial scar formation. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoconstrictor peptide, and its levels increase in brain disorders and promote astrocytic proliferation through ETB receptors. To clarify the mechanisms underlying ET-1–mediated astrocytic proliferation, here we examined its effects on STAT3 in cultured rat astrocytes. ET-1 treatment stimulated Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 in the astrocytes, but Tyr-705 phosphorylation was unaffected, and ET-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation was reduced by the ETB antagonist BQ788. ET-1 stimulated STAT3 binding to its consensus DNA-binding motifs. Monitoring G1/S phase cell cycle transition through bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, we found that ET-1 increases BrdU incorporation into the astrocytic nucleus, indicating cell cycle progression. Of note, STAT3 chemical inhibition (with stattic or 5,15-diphenyl-porphine (5,15-DPP)) or siRNA-mediated STAT3 silencing reduced ET-induced BrdU incorporation. Moreover, ET-1 increased astrocytic expression levels of cyclin D1 and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), which were reduced by stattic, 5,15-DPP, and STAT3 siRNA. ChIP-based PCR analysis revealed that ET-1 promotes the binding of SAT3 to the 5′-flanking regions of rat cyclin D1 and SKP2 genes.

STAT3, a member of the Stat family of transcription factors, plays a role in the transcription of genes regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, and phenotypic conversion. The transcription activity of STAT3 is modulated by phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine residues.

Treatment with 100 nm ET-1 for 10–480 min did not largely affect either total or Tyr-705–phosphorylated STAT3 protein levels (Fig. 1A). Ser-727–phosphorylated STAT3 was increased 3–4-fold by treatment with ET-1 for 20–60 min, and the increased levels of Ser-727–phosphorylated STAT3 were maintained for 240 min (Fig. 1A). The effects of ET-1 on Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 were dose-dependent, where statistically significant increases were observed at higher concentrations than 10 nm (Fig. 1B). Ala1,3,11,15-ET-1, an ETB-selective agonist, increased Ser-727–phosphorylated STAT3 in cultured astrocytes (Fig. 2A). Increases in Ser-phosphorylated STAT3 were reduced by BQ788, an ETB antagonist, whereas FR139317, an ETA antagonist, had no effect (Fig. 2B). Immunocytochemical observations of nontreated astrocytes showed that large populations of cells had Tyr-705–phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleolus (Fig. 3A). Treatment with ET-1 did not increase the numbers of Tyr-705–phosphorylated STAT3-positive astrocytes. In contrast, cultured astrocytes showing Ser-727–phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleolus were increased by ET-1 (Fig. 3B). In the nucleus, phosphorylated STAT3 binds to the recognition DNA sequence of its target gene and serves as a transcription factor. Treatment with ET-1 increased the binding activity of astrocytic STAT3 to the consensus DNA fragment (Fig. 3C).Figure 2A, effects of Ala1,3,11,15-ET-1 on Ser-727 phosphorylation of astrocytic STAT3.

The basal level of STAT3 Ser phosphorylation was not affected by these kinase inhibitors at the concentrations used (Fig. S1A). Go6983, FR180204, and PP-1 did not affect the basal level of STAT3 Tyr phosphorylation, whereas ruxolitinib reduced it (Fig. S1A).

To examine an involvement of ETB receptors in the brain injury–induced phosphorylation of STAT3, effects of ETB antagonist were examined in a mouse model of TBI. Lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) to the mouse cerebrum increased protein levels of Tyr-705– and Ser-727–phosphorylated STAT3 5 days after the initial insult (Fig. 5), whereas total STAT3 protein levels were not altered. Repeated intracerebroventricular administration of BQ788 (15 nmol/day) from 2 days after FPI reduced the increases in Tyr-705– and Ser-727–phosphorylated STAT3 proteins (Fig. 5). The role of STAT3 in ET-induced cell cycle progression of cultured astrocytes was examined. Treatment with 100 nm ET-1 increased the numbers of cultured astrocytes taking up bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in the nucleus, which indicates the promotion of G1/S phase transition (Fig. 6, A and B). In the presence of Stat inhibitors (i.e. stattic (5 μm) and 5,15-diphenyl-porphine (5,15-DPP; 5 μm)), increases in BrdU-positive astrocytes by ET-1 were not observed. Transfection of STAT3 siRNA decreased STAT3 proteins in cultured astrocytes (control siRNA 100 ± 47.0% and STAT3 siRNA 25.0 ± 10.3% of control; means ± S.D., n = 6, normalized by expression levels of β-actin protein) (Fig. 6C). ET-induced increases in BrdU-positive astrocytes were reduced by STAT3 siRNA (Fig. 6, D and E). Cyclin D1 and SKP2 are cell cycle regulatory proteins that promote G1/S phase transition. Studies in animal models of brain injury showed that expression of cyclin D1 and SKP2 was increased in reactive astrocytes (44Di Giovanni S. Movsesyan V. Ahmed F. Cernak I. Schinelli S. Stoica B.

https://openalex.org/W2914774142,"Feeding intolerance (FI) is a common disease in preterm infants, often causing a delay in individual development. Gut microbiota play an important role in nutrient absorption and metabolism of preterm infants. To date, few studies have focused on the community composition of gut microbiota of preterm infants with feeding intolerance. In this study, we collected fecal samples from 41 preterm infants diagnosed with feeding intolerance and 29 preterm infants without feeding intolerance, at three specific times during the development and prevalence of feeding intolerance (after birth, when feeding intolerance was diagnosed, after feeding intolerance was gone), from different hospitals for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The gut microbiota community composition of preterm infants diagnosed with feeding intolerance was significantly different from that of preterm infants without feeding intolerance. At the time when feeding intolerance was diagnosed, the relative abundance of Klebsiella in preterm infants with feeding intolerance increased significantly, and was significantly higher than that of the preterm infants without feeding intolerance. After feeding intolerance was cured, the relative abundance of Klebsiella significantly decreased in the infants diagnosed with feeding intolerance, while the relative abundance of Klebsiella in preterm infants without feeding intolerance was not significantly altered during the development and prevalence of feeding intolerance. Furthermore, we verified that Klebsiella was effective in the diagnosis of feeding intolerance (AUC = 1) in preterm infants, suggesting that Klebsiella is a potential diagnostic biomarker for feeding intolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2911795067,"Increased vitamin A consumption is associated with decreased cortical bone mass and increased fracture risk in humans. Rodent studies have demonstrated that hypervitaminosis A increases cortical bone resorption, whereas the importance of the effects on bone formation is less well defined. We used an experimental model of increased bone formation by loading of the tibiae to investigate the effect of vitamin A on bone formation. Control [retinol activity equivalents (RAE) 4.5 µg/g chow] or vitamin A (RAE 60 µg/g chow) diets were given to female C57BL/6N mice for 4 wk, after which the tibiae were subjected to axial loading on alternate days for 2 wk, while the diets were continued. Vitamin A inhibited the loading-induced increase in trabecular and cortical bone volume. This was attributed to inhibition of loading-induced increase in osteoblast number and activity, and expression of osteoblastic genes Sp7, Alpl, and Col1a1 in cortical bone. Vitamin A., loading, and combination thereof also resulted in site-specific effects on bone composition measured by Raman spectroscopy. In summary, a clinically relevant dose of vitamin A suppresses the loading-induced gain of bone mass by decreasing bone formation. These observations may have implications for regulation of bone mass caused by physical activity and the risk of osteoporosis in humans.—Lionikaite, V., Henning, P., Drevinge, C., Shah, F.

https://openalex.org/W2911906350,"The balance of myogenic and adipogenic differentiation is crucial for skeletal muscle homeostasis. Given the vital role of membrane proteins (MBPs) in cell signal perception, membrane proteomics was conducted to delineate mechanisms regulating differentiation of adipogenic and myogenic precursors in skeletal muscle. Adipogenic and myogenic precursors with divergent differentiation potential were isolated from the longissimus dorsi muscle of neonatal pigs by the preplate method. A total of 85 differentially expressed MBPs ( P < 0.05 and fold change ≥1.2 or ≤0.83) between 2 precursors were detected via isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) assay, including 67 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated in myogenic precursors. Functional enrichment analysis uncovered that myogenic and adipogenic precursors showed significant differences in cytoskeleton organization, syncytium formation, environmental information processing, and organismal systems. Furthermore, key MBPs in regulating cell differentiation were also characterized, including ITGB3, ITGAV, ITPR3, and EPHA2. Noteworthily, EPHA2 was required for myogenic differentiation, and it may promote myogenic differentiation through ERK signaling. Collectively, our study provided an insight into the distinct MBP profile between myogenic and adipogenic precursors in skeletal muscle and served as a solid basis for supporting the role of MBPs in regulating differentiation.-Zhang, X., Wang, L., Qiu, K., Xu, D., Yin, J.

https://openalex.org/W2911881738,"ER protein 57 (ERp57), a thiol isomerase secreted from vascular cells, is essential for complete thrombus formation in vivo, but other extracellular ERp57 functions remain unexplored. Here, we employed a kinetic substrate-trapping approach to identify extracellular protein substrates of ERp57 in platelet-rich plasma. MS-based identification with immunochemical confirmation combined with gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that ERp57 targets, among other substrates, components of the lectin pathway of complement activation: mannose-binding lectin, ficolin-2, ficolin-3, collectin-10, collectin-11, mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1, and mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2. Ficolin-3, the most abundant lectin pathway initiator in humans, circulates as disulfide-linked multimers of a monomer. ERp57 attenuated ficolin-3 ligand recognition and complement activation by cleaving intermolecular disulfide bonds in large ficolin-3 multimers, thereby reducing multimer size and ligand-binding affinity. We used MS to identify the disulfide-bonding pattern in ficolin-3 multimers and the disulfide bonds targeted by ERp57 and found that Cys6 and Cys23 in the N-terminal region of ficolin-3 form the intermolecular disulfide bonds in ficolin-3 multimers that are reduced by ERp57. Our results not only demonstrate that ERp57 can negatively regulate complement activation, but also identify a control mechanism for lectin pathway initiation in the vasculature. We conclude that extensive multimerization in large ficolin-3 multimers leads to a high affinity for ligands and strong complement-activating potential and that ERp57 suppresses complement activation by cleaving disulfide bonds in ficolin-3 and reducing its multimer size."

However, it is uncertain how different levels of variable resistance affect the activation in the deadlift. The aim of the study was to compare the electromyographic activity of the gluteus maximus, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, vastus lateralis and erector spinae muscles during the barbell deadlift with free weights (FW) alone, with two (FW-2EB), and four elastic bands (FW-4EB) to deload some of the constant external resistance. Fifteen resistance-trained men participated in a cross-over design where resistance loadings were matched using two-repetition maximum loadings in the three different conditions. For the whole movement, both repetitions were analyzed. For the phase-specific analysis, the last repetition was divided into six parts, i.e. the lower, middle and upper phase in both the ascending and descending phase of the movement. The mean deloading contributions from FW-2EB and FW-4EB were 21% and 41%, respectively. In FW-4EB, the erector spinae was activated more in the whole movement (8%, ES = 0.31, p = 0.002) compared to FW-2EB. There was also a tendency towards higher activation in FW-4EB versus FW for the whole movement (5%, ES = 0.18, p = 0.072). There were no significant differences between the conditions in any of the other phases or muscles (p = 0.106–0.926). In summary, a high contribution from variable, external resistance seems to activate the back extensors more than a low contribution."
https://openalex.org/W2913723983,"Sea noise collected over 2003 to 2017 from the Perth Canyon, Western Australia was analysed for variation in the South Eastern Indian Ocean pygmy blue whale song structure. The primary song-types were: P3, a three unit phrase (I, II and III) repeated with an inter-song interval (ISI) of 170–194 s; P2, a phrase consisting of only units II & III repeated every 84–96 s; and P1 with a phrase consisting of only unit II repeated every 45–49 s. The different ISI values were approximate multiples of each other within a season. When comparing data from each season, across seasons, the ISI value for each song increased significantly through time (all fits had p << 0.001), at 0.30 s/Year (95%CI 0.217–0.383), 0.8 s/Year (95%CI 0.655–1.025) and 1.73 s/Year (95%CI 1.264–2.196) for the P1, P2 and P3 songs respectively. The proportions of each song-type averaged at 21.5, 24.2 and 56% for P1, P2 and P3 occurrence respectively and these ratios could vary by up to ± 8% (95% CI) amongst years. On some occasions animals changed the P3 ISI to be significantly shorter (120–160 s) or longer (220–280 s). Hybrid song patterns occurred where animals combined multiple phrase types into a repeated song. In recent years whales introduced further complexity by splitting song units. This variability of song-type and proportions implies abundance measure for this whale sub population based on song detection needs to factor in trends in song variability to make data comparable between seasons. Further, such variability in song production by a sub population of pygmy blue whales raises questions as to the stability of the song types that are used to delineate populations. The high level of song variability may be driven by an increasing number of background whale callers creating ‘noise’ and so forcing animals to alter song in order to ‘stand out’ amongst the crowd."
https://openalex.org/W2914825249,"Large numbers of lumpfish are produced for the Norwegian salmon industry and are used to combat sea lice infestations. Periodically high mortality of farmed lumpfish demonstrates the need to improve farming conditions and animal welfare. As part of such efforts, the present work tested the efficacy of three anaesthetic chemicals on lumpfish fries (average weight of 0.97 g). The anaesthetic impact from salinity (15 ppt-18 ppt), temperature (12°C versus 7 and 18°C), and fasting conditions (three days) was also examined. Surgical anaesthesia was induced within 3 to 5 min (preferred time) at concentrations of 18 mg/L (Aqui-S), 37.5 mg/L (Benzoak), and 60 mg/L (buffered MS-222). Safety margins were regarded as low when using Aqui-S; therefore, this chemical was not considered suitable for prolonged exposures. The lumpfish made a rapid recovery from both Benzoak and MS-222 even after 20 min of exposure. A 6°C increase in exposure temperature (reaching 18°C) was found to delay or inhibit recovery. The effect of a 5°C decrease (down to 7°C) significantly reduced induction time for MS-222 and was insignificant for Aqui-S, while it prolonged Benzoak induction time significantly and gave a longer recovery period. Fasting resulted in 70% recovery after 20 min of Aqui-S exposure compared to 0% in fed fish but had only minor effects on Benzoak and MS-222. Use of brackish water (15 ppt-18 ppt) gave 20% recovery from Aqui-S and significantly shorter recovery time from MS-222 exposure, while the effects on Benzoak were insignificant."
https://openalex.org/W2911503452,"Cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) is the best-studied enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of the Ca2+ messenger cyclic ADP-ribose. It is a single-pass transmembrane protein, but possesses dual orientations. We have documented the natural existence of type III CD38 in cells and shown that it is regulated by a cytosolic activator, calcium- and integrin-binding 1 (CIB1). However, how type III CD38 can be folded correctly in the reductive cytosol has not been addressed. Using the yeast two-hybrid technique with CD38's catalytic domain (sCD38) as bait, here we identified a chaperone, Hsp70-interacting protein (Hip), that specifically interacts with both the type III CD38 and sCD38. Immunoprecipitation coupled with MS identified a chaperone complex associated specifically with sCD38. Pharmacological and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Hsp90 chaperones decreased the expression levels of both sCD38 and type III CD38, suggesting that these chaperones facilitate their folding. Moreover, knockdown of Hsc70 or DNAJA2 increased the levels of both CD38 types, consistent with the roles of these proteins in mediating CD38 degradation. Notably, Hip knockdown decreased type III CD38 substantially, but only marginally affected sCD38, indicating that Hip was selective for the former. More remarkably, DNAJA1 knockdown decreased sCD38 but increased type III CD38 levels. Mechanistically, we show that Hsc70 mediates lysosomal degradation of type III CD38, requiring the lysosomal receptor Lamp2A and the C19-motif in the C terminus of CD38. Our results indicate that folding and degradation of type III CD38 is effectively controlled in cells, providing further strong support of its physiological relevance.

However, its validity has never been tested, a shortcoming we address in this preregistered study. In the first task, self-control strength was temporarily depleted in the depletion condition (n = 56) but remained intact in the control condition (n = 56). The attention control video served as the secondary task, and we assumed that the depletion condition would perform significantly worse compared to the control condition. Attention regulation was measured with an eye-tracking device. The results revealed that the gaze behavior in the two conditions differed statistically significantly; however, the actual difference was small, indicating that the attention control video may not be an optimal measure of self-control."
https://openalex.org/W2912030946,"The purpose of this study was to assess whether homology-based emphysema quantification (HEQ) is significantly associated with lung cancer risk. This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board. We included 576 patients with lung nodules (317 men and 259 women; age, 66.8 ± 12.3 years), who were selected from a database previously generated for computer-aided diagnosis. Of these, 283 were diagnosed with lung cancer, whereas the remaining 293 showed benign lung nodules. HEQ was performed and percentage of low-attenuation lung area (LAA%) was calculated on the basis of computed tomography scans. Statistical models were constructed to estimate lung cancer risk using logistic regression; sex, age, smoking history (Brinkman index), LAA%, and HEQ were considered independent variables. The following three models were evaluated: the base model (sex, age, and smoking history); the LAA% model (the base model + LAA%); and the HEQ model (the base model + HEQ). Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis and the associated area under the curve (AUC). Differences in AUCs among the models were evaluated using Delong's test. AUCs of the base, LAA%, and HEQ models were 0.585, 0.593, and 0.622, respectively. HEQ coefficient was statistically significant in the HEQ model (P = 0.00487), but LAA% coefficient was not significant in the LAA% model (P = 0.199). Delong's test revealed significant difference in AUCs between the LAA% and HEQ models (P = 0.0455). In conclusion, after adjusting for age, sex, and smoking history (Brinkman index), HEQ was significantly associated with lung cancer risk."

Most poverty alleviation programs have not been systematically evaluated to assess impact on women’s empowerment and nutrition outcomes. National Rural Livelihoods Mission’s poverty alleviation and livelihoods generation initiative is an opportune platform to layer women’s nutrition interventions being tapped by project Swabhimaan in three eastern Indian states—Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. A cross-sectional baseline survey covering 8755 mothers of children under-two years of age, one of the three primary target groups of program are presented. Standardized questionnaire was administered and anthropometric measurements were undertaken from October 2016 to January 2017. 21 indicators on women’s empowerment, Body Mass Index and Mid-upper Arm Circumference for nutrition status, food insecurity indicators as per the Food Insecurity Experience Scale and selected indicators for assessing women’s access to basic health services were included. National Rural Livelihoods Mission operates in contexts with stark social and gender inequalities. Self-help group members exhibited better control on financial resources and participation in community activities than non-members. Using Body Mass Index, at least 45% mothers were undernourished irrespective of their enrolment in self-help groups. Higher proportion of self-help group members (77%-87%) belonged to food insecure households than non-members (66%-83%). Proportion of mothers reporting receipt of various components of antenatal care service package varied from over 90% for tetanus toxoid vaccination to less than 10% for height measurement. Current use of family planning methods was excruciatingly low (8.2%-32.4%) in all states but positively skewed towards self-help group members. Participation in monthly fixed day health camps was a concern in Bihar. Layering women’s nutrition interventions as stipulated under Swabhimaan may yield better results for women’s empowerment and nutrition status under National Rural Livelihoods Mission. While this opportunity exists in all three states, Bihar with a higher proportion of matured self-help groups offers more readiness for Swabhimaan implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2913014167,"Because of their special organization, multifunctional enzymes play crucial roles in improving the performance of metabolic pathways. For example, the bacterium Prevotella nigrescens contains a distinctive bifunctional protein comprising a 3-deoxy-d-arabino heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS), catalyzing the first reaction of the biosynthetic pathway of aromatic amino acids, and a chorismate mutase (CM), functioning at a branch of this pathway leading to the synthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine. In this study, we characterized this P. nigrescens enzyme and found that its two catalytic activities exhibit substantial hetero-interdependence and that the separation of its two distinct catalytic domains results in a dramatic loss of both DAH7PS and CM activities. The protein displayed a unique dimeric assembly, with dimerization solely via the CM domain. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)-based structural analysis of this protein indicated a DAH7PS-CM hetero-interaction between the DAH7PS and CM domains, unlike the homo-association between DAH7PS domains normally observed for other DAH7PS proteins. This hetero-interaction provides a structural basis for the functional interdependence between the two domains observed here. Moreover, we observed that DAH7PS is allosterically inhibited by prephenate, the product of the CM-catalyzed reaction. This allostery was accompanied by a striking conformational change as observed by SAXS, implying that altering the hetero-domain interaction underpins the allosteric inhibition. We conclude that for this C-terminal CM-linked DAH7PS, catalytic function and allosteric regulation appear to be delivered by a common mechanism, revealing a distinct and efficient evolutionary strategy to utilize the functional advantages of a bifunctional enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2914051549,"Macrophages play central roles in immunity as early effectors and modulating adaptive immune reponses; we implicated macrophages in the anticolitic effect of infection with the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta. Here, gene arrays revealed that H. diminuta antigen (HdAg) evoked a program in murine macrophages distinct from that elicited by IL-4. Further, HdAg suppressed LPS-evoked release of TNF-α and IL-1β from macrophages via autocrine IL-10 signaling. In assessing the ability of macrophages treated in vitro with an extract of H. diminuta [M(HdAg)] to affect disease, intravenous, but not peritoneal, injection of M(HdAg) protected wild-type but not RAG1−/− mice from dinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis. Administration of splenic CD4+ T cells from in vitro cocultures with M(HdAg), but not those cocultured with M(IL-4) cells, inhibited DNBS-induced colitis; fractionation of the T-cell population indicated that the CD4+CD25+ T cells from cocultures with M(HdAg) drove the suppression of DNBS-induced colitis. Use of IL-4−/− or IL-10−/− CD4+ T cells revealed that neither cytokine alone from the donor cells was essential for the anticolitic effect. These data illustrate that HdAg evokes a unique regulatory program in macrophages, identifies HdAg-evoked IL-10 suppression of macrophage activation, and reveals the ability of HdAg-treated macrophages to educate (i.e., condition) and mobilize CD4+CD25+ T cells, which could be deployed to treat colonic inflammation.—Reyes, J.

https://openalex.org/W2914492275,"Engagement of an extended β-sheet is a common substrate/inhibitor interaction at the active site of serine proteases and is an important feature of Laskowski mechanism inhibitors that present a substrate-like loop to a target protease. This loop is cleaved but subsequently relegated forming a stable inhibitor/protease complex. Laskowski inhibitors are ubiquitous in nature and are used extensively in serine protease inhibitor design. However, most studies concentrate on introducing new sidechain interactions rather than the direct contributions of the substrate-like β-sheet to enzyme inhibition. Here we report the crystal structure of an simplified β-sheet inhibitory motif within the Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor (SFTI) in complex with trypsin. We show that the intramolecular hydrogen bond network of this SFTI variant (SFTI-TCTR) engages the inhibitor sidechains that would normally interact with a target protease, giving mainchain interactions a more prominent role in complex formation. Despite having reduced sidechain interactions, this SFTI variant is remarkably potent and inhibits a diverse range of serine proteases. Crystal structural analysis and molecular modelling of SFTI-TCTR complexes again indicates an interface dominated by β-sheet interactions, highlighting the importance of this motif and the adaptability of SFTI as a scaffold for inhibitor design."
https://openalex.org/W2915048826,"Background Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer carries high morbidity and mortality, particularly in older patients. Transthoracic esophagectomy allows formal lymphadenectomy, but leads to greater perioperative morbidity and pain than transhiatal esophagectomy. Epidural analgesia may attenuate the stress response and be less immunosuppressive than opioids, potentially affecting long-term outcomes. These potential benefits may be more pronounced for transthoracic esophagectomy due to its greater physiologic impact. We evaluated the impact of epidural analgesia on survival and recurrence after transthoracic versus transhiatal esophagectomy. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Patients aged ≥66 years with locoregional esophageal cancer diagnosed 1994–2009 who underwent esophagectomy were identified, with follow-up through December 31, 2013. Epidural receipt and surgical approach were identified from Medicare claims. Survival analyses adjusting for hospital esophagectomy volume, surgical approach, and epidural use were performed. A subgroup analysis restricted to esophageal adenocarcinoma patients was performed. Results Among 1,921 patients, 38% underwent transhiatal esophagectomy (n = 730) and 62% underwent transthoracic esophagectomy (n = 1,191). 61% (n = 1,169) received epidurals and 39% (n = 752) did not. Epidural analgesia was associated with transthoracic approach and higher volume hospitals. Patients with epidural analgesia had better 90-day survival. Five-year survival was higher with transhiatal esophagectomy (37.2%) than transthoracic esophagectomy (31.0%, p = 0.006). Among transthoracic esophagectomy patients, epidural analgesia was associated with improved 5-year survival (33.5% epidural versus 26.5% non-epidural, p = 0.012; hazard ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval [0.70, 0.93]). Among the subgroup of esophageal adenocarcinoma patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy, epidural analgesia remained associated with improved 5-year survival (hazard ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval [0.67, 0.96]); this survival benefit persisted in sensitivity analyses adjusting for propensity to receive an epidural. Conclusion Among patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy, including a subgroup restricted to esophageal adenocarcinoma, epidural analgesia was associated with improved survival even after adjusting for other factors."
https://openalex.org/W2914901342,"There is a north-south gradient in the body heights of Japanese children. A hypothesis had previously been proposed that differences in thyroid hormone activity induced by geographical differences in effective day length (duration of photoperiod exceeding a predetermined light intensity) might cause the differences in height. If thyroid hormone is involved, the effect should extend to body weight. This study examined whether geographical differences in body height and weight can be explained in terms of thyroid hormone activity induced by geographical differences in the photoperiodic environment using prefecture-level anatomical data and Japanese Mesh Climatic Data. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the combination of effective day length and weight was statistically significant as a predictor of height. Controlling for body weight revealed that effective day length was inversely correlated with height. Multiple regression analysis revealed that a combination of effective day length and height was statistically significant as a predictor of weight. Controlling for height demonstrated that effective day length was positively correlated with weight. Assuming an inverse correlation between effective day length and thyroid hormone activity, these results appear to show that short day-length will increase the activity of thyroid hormone and contribute to increasing height, but will inhibit weight gain; in contrast, long day-length will decrease the activity of thyroid hormone and contribute to increasing weight but will inhibit height gain. Geographical differences in height, and weight, and part of the prevalence of obesity in Japanese children and early adolescents may be explained by geographical differences in effective day length."
https://openalex.org/W2911727583,"Background Research has shown that adverse events during care transitions from hospital to home can have a significant impact on patients’ outcomes, leading to readmission, delayed healing or even death. Gaps exist in the ways of monitoring care during transition periods and there is a need to help organizations better implement and monitor safe person-and family-centered care. Value statements are a way to obtain narratives in lay terms about how well care, treatment and support is organized to meet the needs and preferences of patients/families. The purpose of this study was to identify the value statements that are perceived by decision-makers and patients/families to best signify safe person- and family-centered care during transitions from hospital to home. Methods Between January and September 2017, a web-based Delphi was used to survey key stakeholders in acute care and home care organizations across Canada. Results Decision-makers (n = 22) and patients/families (n = 24) from five provinces participated in the Delphi. Following Round 1, 45 perceived value statements were identified. In Round 2, consensus was received on 33/45 (73.3%) by decision-makers, and 30/45 (66.7%) by patients/families. In Round 3, additional value statements reached consensus in the decision-makers’ survey (3) and in the patients/families’ survey (2). A total of 30 high priority value statements achieved consensus derived from both the decision-makers’ and patients/families’ perspectives. Conclusion This study was an important first step in identifying key consensus-based priority value statements for monitoring care transitions from the perspective of both decision-makers and patients/families. Future research is needed to test their usability and to determine whether these value statements are actually suggestive of safe person-and family-centered care transition interventions from hospital to home."

https://openalex.org/W2913537139,"In arid ecosystems, desert bighorn sheep are dependent on natural waterholes, particularly in summer when forage is scarce and environmental temperatures are high. To detect waterholes in Sierra Santa Isabel, which is the largest area of desert bighorn sheep habitat in the state of Baja California, Mexico, we used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) from Sentinel-2 satellite images. Waterhole detection was based on the premise that sites with greater water availability, where NDVI was higher, can be identified by their density of vegetation greenness. For the detected waterholes, we estimated the escape terrain (presence of cliffs or steep, rocky slopes) around each by the vector ruggedness measure to determine their potential use by desert bighorn sheep based on the animals’ presence as documented by camera traps. We detected 14 waterholes with the NDVI of which 11 were known by land owners and 3 were unrecorded. Desert bighorn were not detected in waterholes with high values of escape terrain, i.e., flat areas. Waterhole detection by NDVI is a simple method, and with the assistance and knowledge of the inhabitants of the Sierra, it was possible to confirm the presence each waterhole in the field."

https://openalex.org/W2911366856,"People with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) often carry a deletion mutation ∆F508 on the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel. This mutation greatly reduces the CFTR maturation process and slows the channel opening rate. Here, we investigate whether residues near F508 contribute to these defects in ∆F508-CFTR. Most deletion mutations, but not alanine substitutions, of individual residues from positions 503 to 513 impaired CFTR maturation. Interestingly, only protein processing of ∆Y512-CFTR, like that of ∆F508-CFTR, was greatly improved by low-temperature culture at 27°C or small-molecule corrector C18. The 2 mutant Cl− channels were equally slow to open, suggesting that they may share common structural flaws. Studies on the H3-H4 loop that links residues F508 and Y512 demonstrate that G509A/V510G mutations, moving G5091 position backward in the loop, markedly enhanced ∆F508-CFTR maturation and opening rate while promoting protein stability and persistence of the H3 helix in ∆F508 nucleotide-binding domain 1. Moreover, V510A/S511A mutations noticeably increased ∆Y512-CFTR maturation at 27°C and its opening rate. Thus, loop abnormalities may contribute to ∆F508- and ∆Y512-CFTR defects. Importantly, correcting defects from G509 displacement in ∆F508-CFTR may offer a new avenue for drug discovery and CF treatments.—Chen, X., Zhu, S., Zhenin, M., Xu, W., Bose, S. J., Wong, M.

https://openalex.org/W2915051638,"Two classical multivariate statistical problems, testing of multivariate normality and the k-sample problem, are explored by a novel analysis on several resolutions simultaneously. The presented methods do not invert any estimated covariance matrix. Thereby, the methods work in the High Dimension Low Sample Size situation, i.e. when n ≤ p. The output, a significance map, is produced by doing a one-dimensional test for all possible resolution/position pairs. The significance map shows for which resolution/position pairs the null hypothesis is rejected. For the testing of multinormality, the Anderson-Darling test is utilized to detect potential departures from multinormality at different combinations of resolutions and positions. In the k-sample case, it is tested whether k data sets can be said to originate from the same unspecified discrete or continuous multivariate distribution. This is done by testing the k vectors corresponding to the same resolution/position pair of the k different data sets through the k-sample Anderson-Darling test. Successful demonstrations of the new methodology on artificial and real data sets are presented, and a feature selection scheme is demonstrated."
