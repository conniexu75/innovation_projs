https://openalex.org/W1993951035,"Cytogenetic analysis has identified chromosome 11p13 as the smallest overlap region for deletions found in individuals with WAGR syndrome, which includes Wilms tumour (a recessive childhood nephroblastoma), aniridia, genito-urinary abnormalities and mental retardation. The underlying loci have since been resolved into an aniridia (AN2) locus at a telomeric position, and a locus of closely spaced genes or a single pleiotropic gene involved in genito-urinary tract abnormalities and Wilms tumour at a more centromeric position. Pulsed-field gel analysis of the 11p13 region has revealed the presence of several putative CpG islands, structures which are frequently associated with the 5' ends of expressed sequences, mainly housekeeping genes and some tissue-specific genes. Starting from a CpG island, we have now isolated four neighbouring CpG islands, all within 650 kilobases (kb), by means of two consecutive bidirectional jumps in rare-cutting restriction-enzyme jumping libraries. In two instances, flanking sequences were conserved in other species and RNA transcripts were identified. A complementary DNA clone isolated for one of them derives from an RNA highly expressed in fetal kidney, and is predicted to encode a Krüppel-like zinc-finger protein that is probably a transcription factor. The entire cDNA region is included in two partially overlapping homozygous deletions found in Wilms tumour DNA samples. Cloning of the breakpoints in one tumour revealed a deletion size of 170 kb, one-third of which is covered by the cDNA. The expression pattern and sequence of this cDNA could point to an important role for its corresponding gene in the normal development of the renal system as well as in Wilms tumour."

https://openalex.org/W1603981767,"Exposure of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta ARs) to agonists causes rapid desensitization of the receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase response. Three main mechanisms have been implicated in this process: phosphorylation of the receptors by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), phosphorylation by the specific agonist-dependent beta AR kinase, and sequestration of the receptors away from the cell surface. By applying inhibitors of these processes to digitonin-permeabilized A431 cells we investigated their contributions to beta AR desensitization. Each process could be selectively inhibited: PKA-dependent phosphorylation by an inhibitor peptide (amino acids 1-24 of the heat-stable inhibitor of PKA (PKI], beta AR kinase-dependent phosphorylation by heparin, and sequestration by concanavalin A. In permeabilized cells, heparin plus PKI completely blocked agonist-induced phosphorylation of the beta ARs. Desensitization was assessed by quantitating the signal transduction efficacy of the system. At high agonist concentrations (approximately 1 microM) up to 70% desensitization occurred. Complete blockade of this desensitization required the concurrent inhibition of all three pathways. When individual pathways were blocked it could be demonstrated that either the PKA or beta AR kinase mechanisms alone resulted in 40-50% desensitization whereas sequestration alone caused 20-30% desensitization. At low agonist concentrations (approximately 10 nM), the PKA pathway was selectively activated. These data indicate that while desensitization mediated via the three different mechanisms can occur independently, the quantitative contributions are not additive. Such findings suggest distinct but overlapping physiological roles for each mechanism in controlling receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2076141157,"Confocal laser-scanned microscopy and long-wavelength calcium (Ca2+) indicators were combined to monitor both sustained and rapidly dissipating Ca2+ gradients in voltage-clamped sympathetic neurons isolated from the bullfrog. After a brief activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ spreads inwardly, and reaches the center of these spherical cells in about 300 milliseconds. Although the Ca2+ redistribution in the bulk of the cytosol could be accounted for with a radial diffusion model, local nonlinearities, suggesting either nonuniform Ca2+ entry or spatial buffering, could be seen. After electrical stimulation, Ca2+ signals in the nucleus were consistently larger and decayed more slowly than those in the cytosol. A similar behavior was observed when release of intracellular Ca2+ was induced by caffeine, suggesting that in both cases large responses originate from Ca2+ release sites near or within the nucleus. These results are consistent with an amplification mechanism involving Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release, which could be relevant to activity-dependent, Ca2(+)-regulated nuclear events."
https://openalex.org/W2128020612,"Substance P is a member of the tachykinin peptide family and participates in the regulation of diverse biological processes. The polymerase chain reaction and conventional library screening were used to isolate a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the rat substance P receptor from brain and submandibular gland. By homology analysis, this receptor belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The receptor cDNA was expressed in a mammalian cell line and the ligand binding properties of the encoded receptor were pharmacologically defined by Scatchard analysis and tachykinin peptide displacement as those of a substance P receptor. The distribution of the messenger RNA for this receptor is highest in urinary bladder, submandibular gland, striatum, and spinal cord, which is consistent with the known distribution of substance P receptor binding sites. Thus, this receptor appears to mediate the primary actions of substance P in various brain regions and peripheral tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1519074143,"Testicular mitochondria were previously shown to contain an abundance of peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition site(s)/receptor(s) (PBR). We have previously purified, cloned, and expressed an Mr 18,000 PBR protein (Antkiewicz-Michaluk, Mukhin, A. G., Guidotti, A., and Krueger, K. E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17317-17321; (Sprengel, R., Werner, P., Seeburg, P. H., Mukhin, A. G., Santi, M. R., Grayson, D. R., Guidotti, A., and Krueger, K. E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20415-20421); and in this report, we present evidence that PBR are functionally linked to Leydig cell steroid biosynthesis. A spectrum of nine different ligands covering a range of over 4 orders of magnitude in their affinities for PBR were tested for their potencies to modulate steroidogenesis in the MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cell line. The Ki for inhibition of [3H]1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide binding and the EC50 for steroid biosynthesis for this series of compounds showed a correlation coefficient of r = 0.95. The most potent ligands stimulated steroid production by approximately 4-fold in these cells. This stimulation was not inhibited by cycloheximide, unlike human chorionic gonadotropin- or cyclic AMP-activated steroidogenesis. The action of PBR ligands was not additive to stimulation by human chorionic gonadotropin or cyclic AMP, but was additive to that of epidermal growth factor, another regulator of MA-10 Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Moreover, PBR ligands stimulated, in a dose-dependent manner, pregnenolone biosynthesis by isolated mitochondria when supplied with exogenous cholesterol. This effect was not observed with mitoplasts (mitochondria devoid of the outer membrane). Cytochrome P-450 side chain cleavage activity, as measured by metabolism of (22R)-hydroxycholesterol, was not affected by PBR ligands in intact cells. Similar results were also obtained with purified rat Leydig cells. In conclusion, PBR are implicated in the acute stimulation of Leydig cell steroidogenesis possibly by mediating the entry, distribution, and/or availability of cholesterol within mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2056469720,"The alpha subunit of a voltage-sensitive sodium channel characteristic of denervated rat skeletal muscle was cloned and characterized. The cDNA encodes a 2018 amino acid protein (SkM2) that is homologous to other recently cloned sodium channels, including a tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive sodium channel from rat skeletal muscle (SkM1). The SkM2 protein is no more homologous to SkM1 than to the rat brain sodium channels and differs notably from SkM1 in having a longer cytoplasmic loop joining domains 1 and 2. Steady-state mRNA levels for SkM1 and SkM2 are regulated differently during development and following denervation: the SkM2 mRNA level is highest in early development, when TTX-insensitive channels predominate, but declines rapidly with age as SkM1 mRNA increases; SkM2 mRNA is not detectable in normally innervated adult skeletal muscle but increases greater than 100-fold after denervation; rat cardiac muscle has abundant SkM2 mRNA but no detectable SkM1 message. These findings suggest that SkM2 is a TTX-insensitive sodium channel expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2054264055,"Genetic elements involved in cell-specific expression of the type II sodium channel gene were revealed using transient expression assays. A chimeric reporter gene containing 1051 bp of the sodium channel 5' flanking region was active in neuroblastoma and PC12 cells, but inactive in nonneuronal cell types. Deletion of upstream sequences resulted in an 80-fold increase in reporter gene activity in skeletal muscle cells, suggesting the presence of negative elements. Although no homologies were found between sequences in the type II 5' flanking region and other negative elements or ""silencers,"" a small region common to the type II gene and other genes expressed in the nervous system was identified and may be involved in transcriptional regulation of neuronal genes."
https://openalex.org/W2075796579,"Sympathetic neurons differentiate from a developmentally restricted progenitor cell in the neural crest-derived sympathoadrenal lineage. We have isolated these progenitors by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immortalized them using a v-myc-containing retrovirus. The complement of antigenic markers expressed by these lines suggests that they have retained many of the properties of their normal counterparts.These lines initiate neuronal differentiation in response to basic FGF, but not to NGF, and do not contain NGF receptor mRNA. In NGF plus FGF, however, a small percentage of the cells differentiate to NGF-dependent postmitotic neurons. Furthermore, an induction of NGF receptor mRNA can be observed in response to FGF Thus, the development of sympathetic neurons may involve a relay, in which FGF both initiates differentiation and induces the NGF receptor, which in turn controls further maturation and survival."

https://openalex.org/W2125499229,"We investigated the kinetics of rat brain type III Na+ currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We found distinct patterns of fast and slow gating. Fast gating was characterized by bursts of longer openings. Traces with slow gating occurred in runs with lifetimes of 5 and 30 s and were separated by periods with lifetimes of 5 and 80 s. Cycling of fast and slow gating was present in excised outside-out patches at 10°C, suggesting that metabolic factors are not essential for both forms of gating. It is unlikely that more than one population of channels was expressed, as patches with purely fast or purely slow gating were not observed. We suggest that structural mechanisms for fast and slow gating are encoded in the primary amino acid sequence of the channel protein."
https://openalex.org/W1497732644,"Maltose is transported across the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli by a binding protein-dependent transport system. We observed a 10-fold increase in the level of transport activity in assays with membrane vesicles when the three membrane-associated components of the transport system (the MalF, MalG, and MalK proteins) were overproduced. In addition, we have successfully reconstituted maltose transport activity in proteoliposome vesicles from solubilized proteins using a detergent dilution procedure. The addition of ATP as an energy source was sufficient to obtain transport, and this activity was dependent on the presence of maltose binding protein and was not seen in proteoliposomes prepared from a strain with a deletion of the maltose genes. We determined that hydrolysis of ATP was directly coupled to maltose uptake. In the majority of these experiments, an average of 1.4 mol of ATP was hydrolyzed for each mole of maltose accumulated. However, in the remaining experiments, ATP hydrolysis was observed to be much higher and averaged 17 mol of ATP hydrolyzed per mol of maltose transported. Possible explanations for a variable stoichiometry are discussed. These results provide strong evidence that it is the hydrolysis of ATP by a component of the transport complex that provides the energy required for active maltose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1602431495,"The EPR and redox properties of the metal complexes in CO dehydrogenase (CODH) from Clostridium thermoaceticum were studied. Controlled potential coulometric reductive titrations of CODH were performed under argon and CO2 atmospheres. In the titrations performed under argon, five to eight electrons/dimer were required for reduction, and four distinct EPR signals appeared. These included a signal with gave = 1.82 (Em approximately -220 mV), two signals with the same g values but different linewidths at gave = 1.94 (Em approximately -440 mV), and a signal at gave = 1.86 (Em approximately -530 mV). All of the S = 1/2 EPR signals had low spin concentrations; values between 0.2 and 0.3 spins/dimer were typically obtained for each signal. Features between g = 6 and 4, typical of S = 3/2 states, were also observed, and these may account, at least to some degree, for the low spin concentration values. Under CO2, and at negative potentials, CODH served as an electrocatalyst in the reduction of CO2 to CO. The apparent half-maximal activity for this reduction at pH 6.3 occurred at -430 mV, a potential near the thermodynamic value. An EPR signal, arising from a complex containing Ni, Fe, and the carbon from CO/CO2 developed along with this activity. The reduction of this complex is probably the last step to occur prior to the catalysis of CO2 reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1524109609,"The proto-oncogene c-myb encodes a nuclear protein which binds to DNA. Here we find that bacterially synthesized c-myb protein binds to one site of the simian virus 40 enhancer. The c-myb protein purified from the human T-cell line, Molt4, was also shown to recognize the same sequence. In co-transfection experiments with a c-myb expression plasmid, tandem repeats of a c-myb-binding sequence were shown to function as a c-myb-dependent enhancer. These results indicate the c-myb protein is a simian virus 40 enhancer-binding protein that can positively regulate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1531547191,"Two cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase isozymes were purified from liver microsomes of cholestyramine-treated female rats by using anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. These two cytochrome P-450 isozymes were similar in electrophoretic mobility, immunocross-reactivity, and Vmax but differed in Km for cholesterol, turnover number, and charges. Antibody against the major isozyme was raised in rabbit. This antibody specifically inhibited microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Immunoblot of microsomal polypeptides indicated that microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme levels were increased in parallel with cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity upon the treatment of rats with diet supplemented with cholestyramine. Both cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and enzyme levels were drastically reduced immediately after the removal of cholestyramine from the diet. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was also detected in the microsomes of kidney, heart, and lung in about 7-27% of the level found in the liver. 3-Methylcholanthrene treatment induced cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and enzyme level. In contrast, pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile or dexamethasone treatment greatly depressed enzyme and activity in rats. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme level was 2-3-fold higher in liver microsomes of rats maintained under the reversed light cycle than under the normal light cycle. In genetically obese Zucker rats, cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and enzyme level did not respond to the change in the light cycle, however, were induced to the same levels as in the lean rats by cholestyramine treatment. This study provided the first direct evidence that the bile acid feedback regulation and circadian rhythm of microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity involved the induction of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme level."
https://openalex.org/W1969081203,C1300 mouse neuroblastoma cells are nonpermissive for infection with herpes simplex virus owing to a failure of viral immediate-early gene transcription following infection. The weak activity of the immediate-early gene promoters in these cells is mediated by the binding of a repressor factor to the octamer-related TAATGARAT motifs in these promoters. This repressor activity is specific to cells of neuronal origin (being absent in a range of permissive nonneuronal cells) and is also able to repress the activity of cellular octamer-containing promoters introduced into C1300 cells. The role of this repressor in the regulation of octamer-containing cellular genes in neuronal cells and in the control of latent infections with herpes simplex virus is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1488027025,"The promoter/regulatory region of the bovine CYP11A (P-450scc) gene was cloned from a bovine genomic library. One major start site of transcription was identified by primer extension analysis with a minor start site four nucleotides further upstream. A putative TATA box is located at position -31, and at position -68 resides a putative binding site for the transcription factor Sp1. Transient transfection of chimeric reporter gene constructs into mouse adrenal tumor Y1 cells was used to locate regions within the P-450scc 5'-flanking sequences that are important for basal and cAMP-dependent transcription of the reporter genes. While cAMP-dependent accumulation of mRNA derived from expression of the endogenous bovine P-450scc gene can be inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitors, transcription of reporter gene constructs containing the promoter/regulatory region of the P-450scc gene is not affected by cycloheximide following transient transfection of Y1 cells or primary bovine adrenocortical cells. Basal expression of these constructs as well as cAMP responsiveness is reduced upon deletion of sequences between -186 and -101, further deletion to -50 leading to loss of virtually all the remaining cAMP responsiveness. The sequence between -183 and -83 alone will direct both basal and cAMP-enhanced transcription when fused to a heterologous promoter and is equally active in either the correct or reverse orientation. No homology to the consensus cAMP-responsive element (CRE) or AP-2 binding site is found in this region whereas an activator protein 1-like sequence is found at position -116. It is concluded that the cAMP responsiveness of P-450scc gene expression is mediated by sequences different from canonical consensus regulatory elements. Whether or not there are sequences conferring cAMP responsiveness which are common both to P-450scc and the other steroidogenic P-450 genes remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1516130444,"Three structural classes of commonly used amiloride analogs, molecules derivatized at the terminal guanidino-nitrogen, the five-position pyrazinoyl-nitrogen, or di-substituted at both of these positions, inhibit binding of the L-type channel modulators diltiazem, gallopamil, and nitrendipine to porcine cardiac sarcolemmal membrane vesicles. The rank order of inhibitory potencies among the various derivatives tested is well defined with amiloride being the least potent. Saturation binding studies indicate that inhibition of ligand binding results primarily from effects on Kd. Ligand dissociation measurements suggest that amiloride derivatives do not associate directly at any of the known sites in the entry blocker receptor complex. In addition, these compounds do not compete at the Ca2+ coordination within the channel. However, studies with inorganic and substituted diphenylbutylpiperidine entry blockers reveal that amiloride analogs interact at a site on the channel where metal ions bind and occlude the pore. Photolysis experiments performed with amiloride photoaffinity reagents confirm that a specific interaction occurs between such probes and the channel protein. Upon photolysis, these agents produce concentration- and time-dependent irreversible inactivation of entry blocker binding activities, which can be protected against by either verapamil or diltiazem. 45Ca2+ flux and voltage-clamp experiments performed with GH3 anterior pituitary cells demonstrate that amiloride-like compounds inhibit L-type channels directly. Moreover, these compounds block contraction of isolated vascular tissue in pharmacological assays. Electrophysiological experiments indicate that they also inhibit T-type channels in GH3 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate unequivocally that amiloride analogs display significant entry blocker activity in both ligand binding and functional assays. This property, therefore, can seriously complicate the interpretation of many in vitro and in vivo studies where amiloride analogs are used to elicit inhibition of other transport systems (e.g. Na-Ca and Na-H exchange)."
https://openalex.org/W2074589363,"Transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with complementary DNA encoding the RIIA sodium channel alpha subunit from rat brain led to expression of functional sodium channels with the rapid, voltage-dependent activation and inactivation characteristic of sodium channels in brain neurons. The sodium currents mediated by these transfected channels were inhibited by tetrodotoxin, persistently activated by veratridine, and prolonged by Leiurus alpha-scorpion toxin, indicating that neurotoxin receptor sites 1 through 3 were present in functional form. The RIIA sodium channel alpha subunit cDNA alone is sufficient for stable expression of functional sodium channels with the expected kinetic and pharmacological properties in mammalian somatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1571404318,"We have purified an insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein from culture medium conditioned by the SV40-transformed human fibroblast line AG 2804. This protein (TFBP), of apparent Mr = 34,000 on gel electrophoresis, binds IGF-II with an affinity constant of 3 x 10(11) liters/mol, 100-fold higher than its affinity for IGF-I. Amino-terminal sequencing indicated no structural relationship to any previously characterized IGF binding protein or receptor. Like a protein in cerebrospinal fluid with selective affinity for IGF-II, TFBP does not bind IGF-I lacking the amino-terminal tripeptide. In contrast with binding proteins produced by normal human fibroblasts, TFBP does not cross-react in radioimmunoassays for the plasma protein IGFBP-3 or the amniotic fluid protein IGFBP-1; however, after affinity labeling with IGF-II, it is immunoprecipitable by an anti-IGFBP-3 antiserum. The cerebrospinal fluid binding protein is not precipitable by this antiserum and appears smaller than TFBP. TFBP reacts with wheat germ agglutinin, but not with concanavalin A, or with the acid-labile subunit of the high molecular weight serum IGF binding protein complex. Furthermore, since RNA from transformed fibroblasts does not hybridize with an IGFBP-3 cDNA probe, TFBP is not derived from the IGFBP-3 gene. We conclude that, although TFBP appears to share an epitope with IGFBP-3, it is distinctly different from any previously described IGF binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1552345748,"Polyclonal antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides whose sequences were from unique regions of the bovine gamma-aminobutyrateA receptor alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3 subunits. The anti-alpha 1 324-341, anti-Cys alpha 2 414-424, and anti-Cys alpha 3 454-467 antibodies all specifically immunoprecipitated [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding activities in parallel from Na+ deoxycholate extracts of bovine cerebral cortex. The maximum number of benzodiazepine binding sites immunoprecipitated by each antibody in three brain regions, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, was investigated. Differences were found for both the maximum number of sites immunoprecipitated by each antibody in one brain region and for the percentage of benzodiazepine binding sites immunoprecipitated by one specificity antibody between the different brain regions. Furthermore, it was found that co-immunoprecipitation with either anti-alpha 1 324-341, anti-Cys alpha 2 414-424, and anti-Cys alpha 3 454-467 or anti-alpha 1 324-341 and anti-Cys alpha 3 454-467 antibodies resulted in an increase in the percentage of benzodiazepine binding sites immunoprecipitated, the sum of which was equal to the percentages pelleted by the individual antibodies. These results demonstrate for the first time the existence in mammalian brain of gamma-aminobutyrateA receptor alpha subunit iso-oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W48759033,"Histamine is known to be a mediator of inflammation. In order to understand the role of histamine in platelets, we have examined the effects of histamine on arachidonic acid (AA) release, cAMP accumulation, inositol trisphosphate production, and serotonin secretion. Incubation of rabbit (and human) platelets with histamine resulted in rapid increase of [3H]AA release from the platelets prelabeled with [3H]AA. The effect of histamine was blocked by the addition of H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine. Histamine did not substantially affect the cAMP content and inositol trisphosphate production. Histamine-stimulated AA release was not observed in digitonin-permeabilized platelets, whereas histamine acted synergistically with GTP or GTP analog, guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate. Histamine-stimulated, and GTP analog-dependent AA release was inhibited by guanosine 5'-(2-O-thio) diphosphate. The effects of three receptor stimulants, thrombin, norepinephrine, and histamine were both diminished by 1 microgram/ml of pertussis toxin treatment and by the antiserum against GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) treatment. However, the antiserum against beta gamma subunits of G proteins inhibited the histamine effect, not thrombin effect. 4 beta-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment enhanced histamine-stimulated AA release and serotonin secretion but inhibited thrombin-stimulated reactions. The effect of PMA was dose dependent and was due to enhance the coupling of histamine receptors and G proteins. The results show the existence of H1 histamine receptors which couple phospholipase A2 activation via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Histamine actions differ in sensitivities to anti-beta gamma antiserum treatment and PMA treatment from thrombin actions."
https://openalex.org/W1650042168,"The mechanism for the increased association of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) with membranes of hepatocytes derived from choline-deficient, compared with choline-supplemented rats, has been investigated. The cells were maintained in culture for 4 h in a choline- and methionine-deficient medium. (Methionine is required for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) via methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine.) Afterward, the cells were incubated +/- choline for various times up to 4 h. In the presence, but not in the absence, of choline there was a translocation of CT activity from membranes to cytosol. During this time period there was no change in the amounts of unesterified fatty acids or diacylglycerol recovered from the hepatocytes. In addition, there was no evidence for a difference in the incorporation of 32P into CT or other cytosolic proteins isolated from hepatocytes +/- choline. In contrast, there was a highly significant correlation between the concentration of PC in the membranes and the increased activity of CT in the cytosol (R = 0.98) and the decreased activity in the membranes (R = 0.93). The concentration of PC could alternatively be altered by incubation of the choline-deficient hepatocytes with methionine or lyso-PC. With either of these supplementations highly significant correlation coefficients were observed between the concentration of PC in membranes and decreased activity of CT in membranes or increased activity in cytosol. The concentration of PC was reduced in the endoplasmic reticulum, but not the Golgi membranes, isolated from choline-deficient compared with choline-supplemented livers. The data suggest that the amount of PC in the endoplasmic reticulum feedback regulates the amount of CT associated with this membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1499341011,"The choline-deficient rat liver has been chosen as a physiologically relevant model system in which to study the regulation of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. When 50-g rats were placed on a choline-deficient diet for 3 days, the activity of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) was increased 2-fold in the microsomes and decreased proportionately in the cytosol. A low titer antibody to CT was obtained from chickens and used to identify the amount of CT protein in cytosol from rat liver. The amount of CT recovered from the choline-deficient cytosol was significantly less than in cytosol from choline-supplemented rats. When hepatocytes were prepared from choline-deficient livers, supplementation of the medium of the cells with choline caused CT to move from the membranes to cytosol within 1-2 h. The activity of another translocatable enzyme of glycerolipid metabolism, phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, was unchanged in cytosol from choline-deficient rat livers, and the microsomal activity of this enzyme was only minimally increased. When the livers were fractionated into endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, there was a 2-fold increase in the activity on the endoplasmic reticulum from choline-deficient livers but no change in activity associated with Golgi. Thus, the increased association of CT with endoplasmic reticulum in choline-deficient livers appears to be specific to that subcellular fraction, and the subcellular location of other enzymes may not be affected."
https://openalex.org/W1548858272,"It is now recognized that phorbol esters are negative inotropic agents in mammalian heart which presumably act via stimulation of Ca2(+)-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC). The goal in the present study was to identify the underlying cellular processes. Digitonin-permeabilized cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were used to study biochemical and functional effects of phorbol esters on cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These cells contracted spontaneously at 3 microM Ca2+. Beating was inhibited by 10 microM ryanodine and was insensitive to 1 microM nifedipine. Thus, beating behavior results from the phasic oscillation of Ca2+ transport by SR in this preparation. Phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), decreased frequency by 30%, suggesting that Ca2+ transport by SR had been reduced. Whereas cAMP stimulated the rate of oxalate-supported 45Ca2+ uptake 2-fold, phorbol esters, TPA, and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate inhibited this process by about 45%. The effects of phorbols were specific: (a) the alpha-analogues of TPA and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate were inactive; and (b) the phorbol esters had no effect on Ca2+ transport in cells that had been depleted of PKC. TPA decreased oxalate-stimulated Ca2+ uptake over the entire range of Ca2+ concentrations, from 0.1 to 10 microM, by at least 70% without shifting the half-maximal effective Ca2+ concentration. Taken together these results indicate that the effects of phorbol ester on cardiac contraction are due to decreased Ca2+ transport by the SR and that these responses are mediated by PKC. These studies support the interpretation that the negative inotropic effects of phorbol esters are due, in part, to decreased SR function."
https://openalex.org/W1992711027,"The atrionatriuretic peptide (ANP) is released from atrial cells in response to increased extracellular fluid volume and reduces sodium absorption by the kidney, thus reducing the blood volume. In this report, ANP suppressed the calcium and sodium currents in rat and guinea pig ventricular myocytes. The suppression of sodium current was caused by enhanced permeability of the sodium channel to calcium without significant changes in the kinetics or the tetrodotoxin sensitivity of the channel. Thus, ANP may regulate the sodium channel by altering its cationic selectivity site to calcium, thereby repressing the sodium current. The suppression of sodium and calcium channels and the resultant depressed excitability of the atrial cells may help to regulate ANP secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1666270286,"Delta 3,delta 2-Enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8), an obligatory auxiliary enzyme for the metabolism of double bonds at odd-numbered positions of fatty acids during their beta-oxidation, was studied in hearts and livers of normal and clofibrate-treated rats. Hepatic peroxisomal and mitochondrial isoenzymes were separable by dye-ligand chromatography. The mitochondrial one was further purified to apparent homogeneity. An isomerase was also purified from heart muscle, a peroxisome-poor tissue. These enzymes were dimeric basic proteins (pI 9.5) with a subunit molecular weight of 30,000. Both cis- and trans-enoyl-CoA served as substrates for the hepatic enzyme studied. The velocity ratio for the C6-, C10-, and C12-trans-3-enoyl substrates was 9:2.5:1. By immunoelectron microscopy the enzyme protein selected for purification was found to be mitochondrial both in liver and heart. Chromatographic evidence, immunoelectron microscopy, and immunoblotting indicated that in the liver but not in the heart, the enzyme underwent an induction of 1 order of magnitude during clofibrate treatment. Antibodies towards the rat isomerases detected cross-reactive proteins in bovine and pig liver and heart and human placenta. The estimated subunit sizes varied from species to species, being 31,000 in bovine liver and heart, 29,000 in pig liver and heart, and 30,000 in human placenta. The data are in accord with the notion of a dual location of the delta 3,delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase. Mitochondrial origin of one of the isoenzymes and its tissue-specific induction by clofibrate were verified by immunochemistry and the identity of the peroxisomal one revealed by the chromatographic behavior of the proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1560653093,"Studies were performed to examine a potential role for a guanine nucleotide-binding protein in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity. EGF increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in intact or saponin-permeabilized rat inner medullary collecting tubule (RIMCT) cells. Incubation of permeabilized cells with guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) enhanced and with guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) inhibited the response to EGF. GDP beta S had no effect on ionomycin-stimulated PGE2 production. Exposure of intact cells to 25 mM NaF + 10 microM AlCl3 enhanced both basal and EGF-stimulated PGE2 production. Pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylated a 41-kDa protein in RIMCT cell membranes. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml for 16 h) eliminated the response to EGF in intact cells and the response to EGF + GTP gamma S in permeabilized cells. Pertussis toxin had no effect on the response to ionomycin. The effect of pertussis toxin was not due to alterations in cAMP as cellular cAMP levels were unaffected by pertussis toxin both in the basal state and in the presence of EGF. PGE2 production in response to EGF was not transduced by a G protein coupled to phospholipase C (PLC) as neomycin, which inhibited PLC, did not decrease EGF-stimulated PGE2 production. Also, PGE2 production was not increased by inositol trisphosphate and did not require the presence of extracellular Ca2+. In contrast to EGF-stimulated PLC activity, stimulation of PLA2 by EGF was not susceptible to inhibition by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These results clearly demonstrate the existence of a PLA2-specific pertussis toxin-inhibitable guanine nucleotide-binding protein coupled to the EGF receptor in RIMCT cells."
https://openalex.org/W1499477548,"To study the mechanism of induction of human C-reactive protein (CRP) gene expression, we have utilized an in vitro liver cell system to analyze the cis-acting DNA sequences located within the 5'-flanking region of human CRP gene. Stable transfection of human hepatoma cells, PLC/PRF/5, by a CRP gene construct containing the 1 kilobase pair of upstream sequence of the CRP gene demonstrated that this region contained the inducible element(s) which regulated human CRP gene transcription. Dissection of this region by 5', 3' and internal deletion constructs of upstream region of the CRP gene fused to a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, indicated the presence of two inducible elements located proximal to the site of initiation of transcription, two constitutive enhancer-like elements located distal to the promoter, and a negative regulatory region located between the two inducible elements. We had previously shown that a protein factor from monocytes or HTLV1-infected T-cells, was responsible for CRP induction in hepatoma cells. We have found this factor to be synonymous with interleukin-6. By stable and transient transfection assays in hepatoma cells, recombinant interleukin-6 alone was sufficient to activate both inducible elements."
https://openalex.org/W1535121904,"The central helical region of calmodulin (CaM) includes amino acids 65-92 and serves to separate the two pairs of Ca2(+)-binding sites. This region may impart conformational flexibility and also interact with target proteins. The functional effects of deleting two, three, five, or eight amino acids from the central helix were monitored by examining the activation of phosphodiesterase, smooth muscle myosin light chain (MLC) kinase, and Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). CaMDM(-8), a calmodulin-deletion mutant with 8 amino acids deleted from the middle of the central helix, failed to activate MLC kinase, phosphodiesterase, or CaM kinase II at physiologically significant concentrations of activator but also had altered electrophoretic mobility and tyrosine fluorescence properties suggesting major changes in the structure of this mutant. Deletion of five amino acids (77-81) resulted in an increase in apparent Kact for phosphodiesterase (150-fold), CaM kinase II (25-fold), and MLC kinase (5-fold) relative to CaM. The maximal autophosphorylation activity of CaM kinase II was also diminished 70% with CaMDM(-5). For phosphodiesterase activation, CaMDM(-2) has a 15-fold increase in apparent Kact while CaMDM(-3) had an apparent Kact value only 3-fold higher than native CaM. In contrast, the activation of MLC kinase by the two (79-80)- and three (79-81)-amino acid deletion mutants were indistinguishable from each other or native CaM. CaMDM(-2) and CaMDM(-3) stimulated CaM kinase II autophosphorylation to 85 and 70%, respectively, of native CaM with less than a 2-fold increase in Kact. Therefore, all deletions in the central helix of CaM reduce the efficiency of phosphodiesterase activation as reflected by substantial alterations in Kact. MLC kinase activation, however, is relatively insensitive to small two or three amino acid deletions. CaM kinase II interacts with the central helix deletion mutants in a complex manner with alterations in both the Kact and the maximum activity. The data suggest the central helix of CaM may serve as a flexible tether for MLC kinase (and to a lesser extent CaM kinase II) but that an extended conformation of CaM, as predicted from the crystal structure, may be required for phosphodiesterase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2095354707,"The complex formed in solution by native and chemically modified cytochrome c with cytochrome b5 has been studied by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Contrary to predictions of recent theoretical analysis, 1H NMR spectroscopy indicates that there is no major movement of cytochrome c residue Phe82 on binding to cytochrome b5. The greater resolution provided by 13C NMR spectroscopy permits detection of small perturbations in the environments of cytochrome c residues Ile75 and Ile85 on binding with cytochrome b5, a result that is in agreement with earlier model-building experiments. As individual cytochrome c lysyl residues are resolved in the 1H NMR spectrum of N-acetimidylated cytochrome c, the interaction of this modified protein with cytochrome b5 has been studied to evaluate the number of cytochrome c lysyl residues involved in binding to cytochrome b5. The results of this experiment indicate that at least six lysyl residues are involved, two more than predicted by static model building, which indicates that cytochrome c and cytochrome b5 form two or more structurally similar 1:1 complexes in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1603077773,"Previous studies have shown that the nuclear envelope of avian erythrocytes contains a 58-kDa integral membrane protein (p58) which serves as a receptor for the karyoskeletal protein lamin B (Worman, J. H., Yuan, J., Blobel, G., and Georgatos, S. D. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 8531-8534). We now demonstrate that p58 is phosphorylated in vivo at serine residues and that its phosphorylation is stimulated by isoproterenol in a dose-dependent fashion. We further show that dephosphorylation of p58 reduces significantly its binding to lamin B. These data suggest that phosphorylation may constitute one of the major mechanisms regulating the lamina-nuclear membrane interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1485407235,"The actin-activated Mg2(+)-ATPase activities of myosins I from Acanthamoeba castellanii are fully expressed only when a single amino acid on their heavy chain is phosphorylated by myosin I heavy chain kinase. Here we show that kinase isolated by a procedure designed to minimize its phosphorylation during purification can incorporate up to 7.5 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme when incubated with ATP, possibly by autophosphorylation. The rate of phosphorylation is enhanced about 20-fold by phosphatidylserine but is unaffected by calcium ions. Phosphorylation increases the rate at which the kinase phosphorylates the regulatory site of myosin I by about 50-fold. These results suggest that (auto?)phosphorylation may regulate the activity of myosin I heavy chain kinase in vivo. The stimulation of kinase phosphorylation by phosphatidylserine (other phospholipids have not yet been tested) is of particular interest because myosin I has been shown to be tightly associated with membranes, especially the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1479766358,"We demonstrated previously that Na+/H+ exchange activity was enhanced in rat parotid acinar cells following muscarinic (carbachol) or alpha-adrenergic (epinephrine) stimulation and that this activation of the exchanger was preserved in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from these cells (Manganel, M., and Turner, R. J. (1989) J. Membr. Biol. 111, 191-198). The carbachol dose dependence of this effect as determined here in intact acini is in good agreement with the carbachol dose dependence of the fluid secretory response in this tissue (K0.5 approximately 3 microM). In addition, we show here that the stimulation of the exchanger by secretagogues cannot be mimicked by active diacylglycerol analogues, nor can it be prevented by the protein kinase inhibitors H7 and HA1004, arguing strongly against the involvement of protein kinase C in this effect. However, stimulation of the exchanger is observed in both intact acini treated with the calcium ionophore A23187 and in vesicles prepared from these acini. Moreover, carbachol, epinephrine, and A23187 are without effect when extracellular calcium is not present during acinar pretreatment. These results indicate that the stimulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger studied here is a consequence of agonist (or A23187)-induced increases in intracellular calcium levels due to calcium influx from the extracellular solution. The calmodulin inhibitors trifluoperazine and W7 (10(-4) M) prevented the stimulation of the exchanger induced by carbachol or epinephrine, but W7 could not block the stimulation produced by A23187 arguing against the involvement of calmodulin in this effect. Taken together with previous data from this and other laboratories, these results strongly indicate that the Na+/H+ exchanger and its regulation are intimately involved in the fluid secretory response of the rat parotid."
https://openalex.org/W1558354506,"A 216-base pair promoter fragment of the 19-kDa zein storage protein gene pMS1, containing the CCAAT and TATA boxes, was analyzed for its in vitro interactions with purified high mobility group (HMG) proteins from maize endosperm tissue. It was found that the HMG proteins display a preferential binding of A/T-rich DNA regions like their animal counterparts, although the A/T content seems not to be the only determinant for binding specificity. Surprisingly, a specific binding of the HMG proteins occurs at the CCAAT and the TATA boxes as indicated by footprinting experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1579210103,"Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were used to study events in the postsynthetic processing and cell surface delivery of Na,K-ATPase. The photoactivable 2-nitro-5-azidobenzoyl (NAB) derivative of ouabain and an anti-ouabain antibody were employed in experiments designed to determine the time intervals required for newly synthesized Na,K-ATPase to achieve the capacity to bind ouabain and to arrive at the cell surface. Ouabain-binding capacity was assessed in Madin Darby canine kidney cells which were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine. At various chase intervals cells were disrupted by probe sonication and the resultant vesicles were permeabilized. Vesicles were incubated with NAB-ouabain and, following UV photolysis, solubilized and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-ouabain antibody. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography of immunoprecipitates revealed that newly synthesized Na,K-ATPase can carry out type II (Mg2+ and Pi supported) ouabain binding throughout the course of its postsynthetic processing. In contrast, the ability to carry out type I (Na+, Mg2+, and ATP-supported) ouabain binding is not attained until 10 min after the completion of the sodium pump's synthesis. Experiments in which intact pulse-labeled cells were incubated with NAB-ouabain revealed that the Na,K-ATPase arrives at the cell surface as soon as 50 min after its synthesis. These results suggest that postsynthetic processing is required before the newly synthesized Na,K-ATPase can display its full repertoire of catalytic functions. This processing seems to be complete prior to the newly synthesized sodium pump's arrival at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1914241072,"Accumulation of cyclic GMP in cultured rat lung fibroblasts was used to test the hypothesis that N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells produce an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF)-like activity. By using this assay, the production of an EDRF-like activity in homogenates and cytosolic fractions of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells was observed. Detection of the activity required the presence of superoxide dismutase and was inhibited by hemoglobin. Production of the EDRF-like factor was dependent on L-arginine and NADPH. The apparent Km for L-arginine was 1.25 microM and the apparent Km for NADPH was 1.67 microM. The production of the EDRF-like activity was inhibited by the L-arginine analogs, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and NG-nitro-L-arginine, with apparent Ki values of 1.0 and 0.3 microM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1526046011,"We tested the hypothesis that the adenylate cyclase system and Na+, K(+)-ATPase are reciprocally related in rat pancreatic islets. We studied the effect of theophylline, caffeine, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP on Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity in a membrane preparation from collagenase-isolated rat islets. Theophylline, caffeine, or dibutyryl cyclic AMP, in concentrations of 1 mM, all inhibited Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity (44,62, and 43%, respectively). Kinetic analysis indicated that theophylline and dibutyryl cAMP inhibit Na+, K(+)-ATPase by different mechanisms; theophylline decreased Vmax and decreased apparent Km (ATP), whereas dibutyryl cAMP decreased Vmax and increased apparent Km (ATP). Similar inhibition of Na+, K(+)-ATPase by theophylline or dibutyryl cAMP was noted in a particulate fraction from rat kidney and in a purified porcine brain Na+, K(+)-ATPase preparation. The adenylate cyclase system and Na+, K(+)-ATPase may act reciprocally in pancreatic islets and in other tissues. In the beta cell this relationship may be essential in coordinating consumption of ATP in the stimulated, as opposed to the rest, state."
https://openalex.org/W1583577237,"A human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (undifferentiated HL-60 cells) as well as a granulocyte form of HL-60 cells induced in vitro by exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide were examined for binding, metabolism, and biological responses to platelet-activating factor (PAF). Undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells each exhibit a high capacity to incorporate and metabolize [3H]PAF at 37 degrees C; however, the amount of [3H]PAF that is assimilated by both cell populations is greatly reduced and its metabolism abolished at less than or equal to 4 degrees C. At 0 degrees C HL-60 granulocytes bind more [3H]PAF than their undifferentiated counterparts. Binding to differentiated cells reaches equilibrium within 80 min and is saturable, reversible and specific; PAF receptor antagonists WEB 2086, L-659,989, BN 52021, and kadsurenone abolish this specific [3H]PAF binding. In contrast, [3H]PAF uptake by undifferentiated HL-60 cells is neither saturable nor sensitive to specific receptor antagonists. Scatchard analyses reveal 5850 +/- 850 binding sites per differentiated HL-60 cell with a dissociation constant of 0.66 +/- 0.15 nM. In the presence of cytochalasin B, PAF (200 nM) induces degranulation only in differentiated cells and this response also is blocked by PAF receptor antagonists. Our results demonstrate that HL-60 cells develop specific and functionally active PAF receptors only after chemically induced differentiation into granulocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1480688599,"The vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra of metal-free phosvitin are presented as a function of pH and analyzed both qualitatively and by using a factor analysis approach referenced to a protein data set. The qualitative pattern of both the IR and VCD changes is consistent with a coil-to-sheet transition occurring as pH is progressively decreased to values lower than 3. A similar transition was seen in commercial preparation of phosvitin which still contained metal ions, but there the transition was more gradual and occurred at somewhat different pH values. Such a gradual change is also evident in the solution phase absorption band profile but is made clearer using Fourier deconvolution. Based on VCD results, the low pH transition appears to occur with two distinct manifestations of the beta-sheet form. However, at the lowest pH values the sample may precipitate. These two forms are not distinguishable with Fourier transform infrared alone and may be due to a twist of the beta-sheet form or to aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1593895189,"The asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor undergoes constitutive endocytosis through the coated pit/coated vesicle pathway in hepatocytes. Studies on HepG2 cells have shown that the receptor is phosphorylated at serine under control conditions and following protein kinase C stimulation. This study examined whether the ASGP receptor could also serve as a substrate for a tyrosine kinase in HepG2 cells. 32P labeling was performed in membrane preparations, in permeabilized cells at 4 degrees C, and in intact cells at 37 degrees C. The phosphorylated ASGP receptor was isolated by immunoprecipitation, hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl at 110 degrees C, and analyzed by two-dimensional high voltage electrophoresis. The receptor isolated from a membrane preparation incubated in vitro with [gamma-32P]ATP incorporated radiolabel predominantly (greater than 90%) into phosphotyrosine. ASGP receptor phosphorylation at both tyrosine and serine was detected in intact cells incubated with phosphatase inhibitors for 60 min at 37 degrees C. The presence of both phenylarsine oxide (20 microM) and sodium orthovanadate (200 microM) was required for tyrosine phosphorylation. Use of these inhibitors together resulted in a 16.4-fold increase in phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated ASGP receptor, whereas phosphorylation of total HepG2 membrane proteins was not significantly augmented by this procedure. Selective proteolytic digestion of ASGP receptors in isolated vesicles demonstrated that the phosphorylation site identified in these studies is located at tyrosine 5 in the cytoplasmic tail."
https://openalex.org/W2097120524,"Spinach leaf phosphoribulokinase is sensitive to modification by ATP analogs that react with lysine residues. The 2',3'-dialdehyde derivative of ATP (oATP) inactivates enzyme in a slow, time-dependent fashion. The process follows first-order kinetics (kinact = 0.07 min-1), and the concentration dependence of inactivation indicates tight inhibitor binding (Ki = 106 microM). ATP offers good protection against inactivation (Kd = 67 microM), suggesting that oATP is directed toward the catalytic site. This conclusion is supported by the fact that oATP functions as an alternate substrate (Km = 0.55 mM). Inactivation of phosphoribulokinase by [14C]oATP results in a modification stoichiometry of 0.7/site. The 14C-labeled enzyme is stable to dialysis, suggesting that the covalent adduct formed between protein and oATP is not a simple Schiff's base. Adenosine di- and triphosphopyridoxals (Ado-P2-Pl and Ado-P3-Pl, respectively) also inhibit spinach phosphoribulokinase in a time-dependent fashion. In this case, activity loss is reversible unless the inhibited species is borohydride-reduced, suggesting that Ado-P2-Pl and Ado-P3-Pl form Schiff's bases with an amino group on the enzyme. Protection is afforded by the substrate ATP, suggesting that modification is active site-directed. Prolonged incubation of enzyme with these inhibitors does not result in complete inactivation of phosphoribulokinase. Residual activity is dependent on inhibitor concentration, as would be expected if equilibrium is established between the noncovalent E.I complex and the covalent (Schiff's base) E-I species. Kinetic data analysis indicates Ki values of 175 and 11 microM for Ado-P2-Pl and Ado-P3-Pl, respectively. Thus, the ATP-binding domain can easily accommodate the pyridoxal moiety which is tethered to the polyphosphate chain. The phosphorylated ATP analogs employed in this study exhibit substantially tighter binding to phosphoribulokinase than does fluorosulfonyl-benzoyladenosine (Ki = 4.8 mM), which we have previously demonstrated to be useful in selectively modifying the ATP-binding domain (Krieger, T. J., and Miziorko, H. M. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 3496-3501; Krieger, T. J., Mende-Mueller, L. M., and Miziorko, H. M. (1987) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 915, 112-119). Although the adduct formed between oATP and enzyme was unsuitable for structural analysis, borohydride reduction of the Schiff's base formed between enzyme and Ado-P3-[3H]Pl produced a species useful for investigation by protein chemistry techniques. A radiolabeled tryptic peptide was prepared, isolated, and sequenced; the data indicate that lysine 68 is the residue modified by Ado-P3-[3H]Pl."
https://openalex.org/W1566985634,"The purified endonuclease of bovine heart mitochondria extensively degrades a variety of DNA templates in vitro but shows a remarkably strong preference to nick within one specific evolutionarily conserved sequence block of 12 consecutive guanine residues which resides just upstream from the heavy strand origin of mitochondrial DNA replication (Low, R. L., Cummings, O. W., and King, T. C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16164-16170). If the enzyme serves to provide an important nicking function at this site in vivo, then mitochondrial factors likely exist which further enhance the enzyme's recognition of this locus and prevent cleavage at other less favored sites. In this study, we report that specific membrane phospholipids appear to exert such effects in vitro. In standard endonuclease assays, low levels of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine (0.5 mM) stimulate the purified enzyme activity 10-20-fold. However, at moderate levels (20-40 mM), these phospholipids largely inhibit widespread degradation of duplex DNA while still allowing site-specific nicking at the conserved guanine target in the mitochondrial genome. These findings suggest that an interaction of the endonuclease with major lipid components of the inner membrane could be an important determinant of the enzyme's specificity for mitochondrial DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1493052047,"The dissimilatory nitrite reductase, cytochrome cd1, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 19429) was irreversibly inactivated by methyl- or phenylhydrazine but was only reduced by hydrazine itself. The reaction required oxygen and several turnovers, approximately four, of the cytochrome acting to transfer reducing equivalents from phenylhydrazine to oxygen. The reaction with methyl- or phenylhydrazine altered the visible spectrum of the cytochrome. Bands characteristic of reduced heme c appeared plus new features that were not characteristic of either oxidized or reduced heme d1. Extraction of the heme from phenylhydrazine-treated cytochrome yielded a covalently modified form of the original heme d1. Visible, 1H NMR, and mass spectra were obtained on the purified modified heme and on the metal-free esterified derivative. The spectroscopic data indicate that the modification was the regiospecific substitution of the 5 meso-proton by a phenyl group."
