The 2640 botanists with bachelor's degrees from American colleges represent 401 undergraduate institutions, but more than half of them are alumni of a group of 37 large universities supported by public funds and 14 privately endowed colleges. More than 86 percent of the botanists have taken doctorates from 92 graduate schools, but 12 of the largest ones, located chiefly in the state universities, have provided two-thirds of these degrees; more than three-fourths of the candidates came from other colleges for their advanced training. Their fields of employment are predominantly in education and in government service, but appreciable numbers are doing research work for industry or in nonindustrial laboratories."

The flora of these bogs has been previously described (6, 7). In most cases the water was collected by cutting a shallow cavity in the sphagnum and dipping up the water which accumulated within a few minutes. In a few cases during the dry season, water could not be obtained in this way. It was then obtained by squeezing it from handfuls of sphagnum obtained a few inches beneath the surface of the bog. Details of the experiments here reported as well as an account of other work on this water now in progress will be reported later. I. When they were filtered through filter paper, then saturated with NaCl, MgSO4, Na2HPO4, or (NH4)2S04 and allowed to stand over night the samples tested have all shown a precipitate. 2. When this precipitate was filtered off and the filtrate dialyzed in a dialyzing tube in running water until it no longer showed a precipitate with BaC12, this filtrate did not prove toxic to root hairs on Tradescantia cuttings placed in it, while controls in bog water allowed only a very poor development of root hairs on cuttings of this species. 3. When 500 cc. of filtered bog water was distilled until the residue was only 8o cc., the distillate was colorless and was not toxic to root hairs on Tradescantia cuttings while the residue was much darker in color than bog water and almost entirely inhibited the formation of root hairs on these cuttings. 4. When saturated with (NH4)2S0O4 and allowed to stand over night the above distillate gave no precipitate while the residue gave a much heavier precipitate than untreated bog water did. 5. All samples of bog water tested were acid to litmus and to phenolphthalein. 6. The acidity of the residue mentioned in 3 was greater than that of the untreated bog water while the acidity of the distillate 436"

A reader informs us that Stevens Institute of Technology offered such a program in 1956-57."
