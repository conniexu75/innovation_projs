https://openalex.org/W2083479805,"The recent discovery of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has played a pivotal role in changing our view of carcinogenesis and chemotherapy. Based on this concept, CSCs are responsible for the formation and growth of neoplastic tissue and are naturally resistant to chemotherapy, explaining why traditional chemotherapies can initially shrink a tumor but fails to eradicate it in full, allowing eventual recurrence. Recently, we identified a CSC population in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) characterized by their CD133 phenotype. However, the molecular mechanism by which it escapes conventional therapies remains unknown. Here, we examined the sensitivity of these cells to chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin and fluorouracil) and the possible mechanistic pathway by which resistance may be regulated. Purified CD133+ HCC cells isolated from human HCC cell line and xenograft mouse models survived chemotherapy in increased proportions relative to most tumor cells which lack the CD133 phenotype; the underlying mechanism of which required the preferential expression of survival proteins involved in the Akt/PKB and Bcl-2 pathway. Treatment of CD133+ HCC cells with an AKT1 inhibitor, specific to the Akt/PKB pathway, significantly reduced the expression of the survival proteins that was normally expressed endogenously. In addition, treatment of unsorted HCC cells with both anticancer drugs in vitro significantly enriched the CD133+ subpopulation. In conclusion, our results show that CD133+ HCC cells contribute to chemoresistance through preferential activation of Akt/PKB and Bcl-2 cell survival response. Targeting of this specific survival signaling pathway in CD133+ HCC CSCs may provide a novel therapeutic model for the disease."

https://openalex.org/W2002112358,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by reduced levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN together with Gemins2-8 and unrip proteins form a macromolecular complex that functions in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) of both the major and the minor splicing pathways. It is not known whether the levels of spliceosomal snRNPs are decreased in SMA. Here we analyzed the consequence of SMN deficiency on snRNP metabolism in the spinal cord of mouse models of SMA with differing phenotypic severities. We demonstrate that the expression of a subset of Gemin proteins and snRNP assembly activity are dramatically reduced in the spinal cord of severe SMA mice. Comparative analysis of different tissues highlights a similar decrease in SMN levels and a strong impairment of snRNP assembly in tissues of severe SMA mice, although the defect appears smaller in kidney than in neural tissue. We further show that the extent of reduction in both Gemin proteins expression and snRNP assembly activity in the spinal cord of SMA mice correlates with disease severity. Remarkably, defective SMN complex function in snRNP assembly causes a significant decrease in the levels of a subset of snRNPs and preferentially affects the accumulation of U11 snRNP—a component of the minor spliceosome—in tissues of severe SMA mice. Thus, impairment of a ubiquitous function of SMN changes the snRNP profile of SMA tissues by unevenly altering the normal proportion of endogenous snRNPs. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that SMN deficiency affects the splicing machinery and in particular the minor splicing pathway of a rare class of introns in SMA."
https://openalex.org/W1964834461,"The retromer complex is required for the sorting of acid hydrolases to lysosomes, transcytosis of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, Wnt gradient formation, iron transporter recycling and processing of the amyloid precursor protein. Human retromer consists of two smaller complexes: the cargo recognition VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 heterotrimer and a membrane-targeting heterodimer or homodimer of SNX1 and/or SNX2 (ref. 13). Here we report the crystal structure of a VPS29-VPS35 subcomplex showing how the metallophosphoesterase-fold subunit VPS29 (refs 14, 15) acts as a scaffold for the carboxy-terminal half of VPS35. VPS35 forms a horseshoe-shaped, right-handed, alpha-helical solenoid, the concave face of which completely covers the metal-binding site of VPS29, whereas the convex face exposes a series of hydrophobic interhelical grooves. Electron microscopy shows that the intact VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 complex is a stick-shaped, flexible structure, approximately 21 nm long. A hybrid structural model derived from crystal structures, electron microscopy, interaction studies and bioinformatics shows that the alpha-solenoid fold extends the full length of VPS35, and that VPS26 is bound at the opposite end from VPS29. This extended structure presents multiple binding sites for the SNX complex and receptor cargo, and appears capable of flexing to conform to curved vesicular membranes."

https://openalex.org/W2153537261,"Myostatin is a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. Therefore, myostatin inhibition offers a novel therapeutic strategy for muscular dystrophy by restoring skeletal muscle mass and suppressing the progression of muscle degeneration. The known myostatin inhibitors include myostatin propeptide, follistatin, follistatin-related proteins, and myostatin antibodies. Although follistatin shows potent myostatin-inhibiting activities, it also acts as an efficient inhibitor of activins. Because activins are involved in multiple functions in various organs, their blockade by follistatin would affect multiple tissues other than skeletal muscles. In the present study, we report the characterization of a myostatin inhibitor derived from follistatin, which does not affect activin signaling. The dissociation constants (K(d)) of follistatin to activin and myostatin are 1.72 nM and 12.3 nM, respectively. By contrast, the dissociation constants (K(d)) of a follistatin-derived myostatin inhibitor, designated FS I-I, to activin and myostatin are 64.3 microM and 46.8 nM, respectively. Transgenic mice expressing FS I-I, under the control of a skeletal muscle-specific promoter showed increased skeletal muscle mass and strength. Hyperplasia and hypertrophy were both observed. We crossed FS I-I transgenic mice with mdx mice, a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Notably, the skeletal muscles in the mdx/FS I-I mice showed enlargement and reduced cell infiltration. Muscle strength is also recovered in the mdx/FS I-I mice. These results indicate that myostatin blockade by FS I-I has a therapeutic potential for muscular dystrophy."

The present study showed that leptin, a centrally acting hormone secreted by adipocytes, rescued dopaminergic neurons, reversed behavioral asymmetry, and restored striatal catecholamine levels in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of dopaminergic cell death. In vitro studies using the murine dopaminergic cell line MN9D showed that leptin attenuated 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic markers, including caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and cytochrome c release. ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK1/2) was found to be critical for mediating leptin-induced neuroprotection, because inhibition of the MEK pathway blocked both the pERK1/2 response and the pro-survival effect of leptin in cultures. Knockdown of the downstream messengers JAK2 or GRB2 precluded leptin-induced pERK1/2 activation and neuroprotection. Leptin/pERK1/2 signaling involved phosphorylation and nuclear localization of CREB (pCREB), a well known survival factor for dopaminergic neurons. Leptin induced a marked MEK-dependent increase in pCREB that was essential for neuroprotection following 6-OHDA toxicity. Transfection of a dominant negative MEK protein abolished leptin-enhanced pCREB formation, whereas a dominant negative CREB or decoy oligonucleotide diminished both pCREB binding to its target DNA sequence and MN9D survival against 6-OHDA toxicity. Moreover, in the substantia nigra of mice, leptin treatment increased the levels of pERK1/2, pCREB, and the downstream gene product BDNF, which were reversed by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Collectively, these data provide evidence that leptin prevents the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons by 6-OHDA and may prove useful in the treatment of Parkinson disease.

Although the mechanism that triggers neurodegeneration in PD is unknown, there is evidence that decreased neuro-trophin production and signaling in the brain may be a contributing factor (1Cowen T. Auton. Neurosci. 2002; 96: 20-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 2Enwere E. Shingo T. Gregg C. Fujikawa H. Ohta S. Weiss S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8354-8365Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Certain growth factors can indeed protect dopaminergic neurons from neurotoxic insults in both in vitro and in vivo PD models (3Tomac A. Lindqvist E. Lin L.F.H. Ogren S.O. Young D. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Nature. 1995; 373: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 4Ding Y.M. Jaumotte J.D. Signore A.P. Zigmond M.J. J.

Recently, neuroprotective activity has been ascribed to growth factors having primary functions that were at first thought to be limited to peripheral tissues, including erythropoietin (6Signore A.P. Weng Z.F. Hastings T. Van Laar A.D. Liang Q.H. Lee Y.J. Chen J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (7Solaroglu I. Cahill J. Jadhav V. Zhang J.H. Stroke. 2006; 37: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Investigation into the neuroprotective activity of these factors was partly spurred on by evidence that the localization of their receptors in the brain did not correlate with their known functions (8Digicaylioglu M. Bichet S. Marti H.H. Wenger R.H. Rivas L.A. Bauer C. Gassmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3717-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 9Schneider A. Kruger C. Steigleder T.

Invest. 2005; 115: 2083-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Leptin is another growth factor for which the broad distribution of its receptors in the brain does not correlate with its currently recognized roles in diet and energy metabolism (10Mutze J. Roth J. Gerstberger M. Matsumura K. Hubschle T. Neurosci. Lett. 2006; 394: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Mercer J.G. Hoggard N. Williams L.M. Lawrence C.B. Hannah L.T. Trayhurn P.

Neurol. 1998; 395: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar).Leptin is synthesized and released from adipocytes into the bloodstream and has significant biological activity in the central nervous system. Uptake of leptin into the brain occurs via the choroid plexus, which transfers leptin into the extracellular milieu of the brain (13Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Huang W.T. Jaspan J.B. Maness L.M. Peptides. 1996; 17: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), and concentrates it to ∼0.7 nm (11.8 ng/ml) in the cerebral spinal fluid (14Kurrimbux D. Gaffen Z. Farrell C.L. Martin D. Thomas S.A. Neuroscience. 2004; 123: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis are well known physiological actions that are mediated by leptin acting via the hypothalamus (15Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Rabinowitz D. Lallone R.L. Burley S.K. Friedman J.M. Science. 1995; 269: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (4199) Google Scholar, 16Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4483) Google Scholar) and the ventral tegmental area (17Fulton S. Pissios P. Manchon R.P. Stiles L. Frank L. Pothos E.N. Maratos-Flier E. Flier J.S. Neuron. 2006; 51: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 18Hommel J.D. Trinko R. Sears R.M. Georgescu D. Liu Z.W. Gao X.B. Thurmon J.J. Marinelli M. DiLeone R.J. Neuron. 2006; 51: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The wide expression of the leptin receptor in brain, however, suggests that leptin may have other functions in addition to the control of feeding. Two functionally distinct groups of dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalon are rich in leptin receptor expression (12Elmquist J.K. Bjorbaek C. Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Saper C.B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 395: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 19Figlewicz D.P. Evans S.B. Murphy J. Hoen M. Baskin D.G. Brain Res. 2003; 964: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The medial group, comprising the ventral tegmental area, is known to help regulate food intake and reward pathways (18Hommel J.D. Trinko R. Sears R.M. Georgescu D. Liu Z.W. Gao X.B. Thurmon J.J. Marinelli M. DiLeone R.J. Neuron. 2006; 51: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 20Hyman S.E. Malenka R.C. Nestler E.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 565-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Located laterally are the dopaminergic neurons of the SNc, which are involved in the modulation of peripheral motor control and, more specifically, in PD. The lack of participation of the SNc in the control of appetitive behaviors and the presence of the leptin receptor suggests that leptin has a novel role in these dopaminergic neurons.Leptin mediates intracellular signaling via the JAK-STAT pathway (21Hegyi K. Fulop K. Kovacs K. Toth S. Falus A. Cell Biol. Int. 2004; 28: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The expression of JAK-2 and STAT3, the specific JAK-STAT proteins activated by leptin, are found in the SNc (22Berhow M.T. Hiroi N. Kobierski L.A. Hyman S.E. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 8019-8026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The JAK-STAT pathway has many functions in neurons, including activation by ligands possessing neuroprotective activity in the brain, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor and erythropoietin (23Imada K. Leonard W.J. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Considering the lack of any known physiological roles ascribed to leptin signaling in the SNc, it is plausible that leptin may influence the viability of dopaminergic neurons. We therefore investigated whether leptin itself is neuroprotective for dopaminergic neurons. Using both in vivo and in vitro models of PD, we found that exogenously administrated leptin can reverse dopaminergic cell loss and functional behaviors induced by the dopamine-neuron destroying toxin, 6-OHDA via the MEK/ERK signaling pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Neurotoxin Exposure—Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, including rat leptin. Culturing of cells, DNA laddering, and caspase activity were performed according to previously published procedures (6Signore A.P. Weng Z.F. Hastings T. Van Laar A.D. Liang Q.H. Lee Y.J. Chen J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, MN9D cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) using Primaria culture dishes (BD Biosciences). Neuronal differentiation was induced for 4 days using 1 mm n-butyrate before cells were used for experiments. Primary mesencephalic neuronal cultures were made from E17 rat pups as previously described (6Signore A.P. Weng Z.F. Hastings T. Van Laar A.D. Liang Q.H. Lee Y.J. Chen J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).The neurotoxin 6-OHDA·HBr was made fresh for each experiment in a non-oxidizing vehicle (4Ding Y.M. Jaumotte J.D. Signore A.P. Zigmond M.J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 776-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Before toxin was added to the cultures, serum-containing media was removed and replaced with media without serum. Cells were exposed to 50 or 100 μm 6-OHDA for 30 min, followed by 2 washes of serum-free media, and fed for 24 h with serum-containing media. The leptin receptor antagonist used is a mutein form of leptin containing three mutated amino acids (L39A/D40A/F41A), as characterized previously (24Gertler A. Trends Endocr. Metab. 2006; 17: 372-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Cell Viability—Cell viability was measured with the oxidation of the compound XTT using the Procheck cell viability assay kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY) (23Imada K. Leonard W.J. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). All values were averaged from at least six wells from three independent experiments. Cell viability in some experiments was also measured using Hoechst 33258 staining (6Signore A.P. Weng Z.F. Hastings T. Van Laar A.D. Liang Q.H. Lee Y.J. Chen J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Liang Q.H. Liou A.K.F. Ding Y.M. Cao G.D. Xiao X. Perez R.G. Chen J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Western Blots—Protein extracts were prepared using standard methods (26Chen J. Nagayama T. Jin K. Stetler R.A. Zhu R.L. Graham S.H. Simon R.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4914-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity was semi-quantified by gel densitometric scanning and analyzed with the MCID image analysis system (Imaging Research, Inc., St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada). The primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: mouse tyrosine hydroxylase, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), rabbit ERK1/2, pERK1/2, β-actin, active caspase-3 and -9, CREB, pCREB (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), rabbit cytochrome c, ObR-H-300 for leptin receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse Cox-IV (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). TUNEL staining was performed using a kit (Roche Applied Science).BDNF Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Measurements of BDNF levels in MN9D cultures were performed using the ChemiKine™ BDNF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Chemicon), which has the sensitivity of 7.8 pg/ml. Media supernatants were collected and concentrated 50-fold using dialysis membranes (Chemicon) prior to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Caspase Activity—Measurement of caspase activity was made using cell lysates and the fluorogenic DEVD substrate for caspase-3 and LEHD for caspase-9 (Chemicon). Changes in fluorescence were quantified every 20 min with a luminescence spectrometer (Winlab, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Shelton, CT; excitation 400 nm and emission 505 nm).Gene Transfection of MN9D Cells—Transfection of shRNA or cDNA for enhanced green fluorescent protein, dominant negative, or wild-type MEK plasmids into MN9D cells was performed using the nucleofection electroporation system (27Leclere P.G. Panjwani A. Docherty R. Berry M. Pizzey J. Tonge D.A. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 142: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). This transfection method resulted in >95% transfection efficiency in MN9D cells. Mammalian expression plasmids directing the transcription of shRNA were constructed according to the principles described previously (28Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar) and using our published protocols (29Chu C.T. Zhu J. Cao G.D. Signore A. Wang S.P. Chen J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids used the pcDNA3.1(+) backbone. For JAK/GRB2 shRNA, inserted into the plasmid SpeI/EcoRV cloning sites, was the H1-RNA promoter followed by the gene-specific targeting sequence. For each of the targeted genes, a scramble sequence containing the same nucleotide composition but in a randomized order was also constructed and used as control. Additional controls also included the shRNA-targeting green fluorescent protein (5′-AACAGCTGCTAGGATTACACA-3′). Upon construction, all inserts were verified by the sequencing reaction on both strands. For nucleofection-mediated transfection, 5-6 × 106 cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using the manufacturer’s recommended cell type-specific settings, then plated into either 100-mm culture dishes (2 × 106 cells/dish) or 96-well plates (6 × 104 cells/well) (Primaria, BD Biosciences). The cells were induced for neuronal differentiation for 4 days before use. For each of the targeted proteins, two shRNA targeting sequences were used in separate experiments, and all targeting sequences listed below were confirmed in preliminary studies for their effectiveness of knocking down the targeted genes: Jak1: 1, TCAAGAAGACTGAGGTGAA; 2, AGAAGGATGATGAGAGAAA; Jak2: 1, GAGAATAGCTAAGGAGAAA; 2, CAGAACAGTTTGAAGTAAA; and GRB2: 1, TGAATGAGCTGGTAGATTA; 2, AGGCAGAACTCAATGGGAA. The Western blot data presented used the first sequence from the above.EMSA—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as described previously (30Luo Y.M. Yin W. Signore A.P. Zhang F. Hong Z. Wang S.P. Graham S.H. Chen J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were extracted from cultured cells, and the protein content in nuclear fractions was measured using the Bradford method (Bulletin 1177, Bio-Rad). To perform EMSA, the CRE sense (5′-GAACCGTGTGACGTTACGC-3′) and antisense (5′-GCGTAACGTCACACGGTTC-3′) oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified using the QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen), and then annealed. The DNA·protein binding reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing the binding assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, pH 7.6), 0.0175 pmol of labeled double-stranded probe (>10,000 cpm), 10 μg of nuclear protein, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis for 2 h in a non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE (22.5 mm Tris borate and 0.5 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The specificity of CRE-binding activity was determined by performing both competition assays and supershift assays. For the competition assays, 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide of the CRE binding site was used as a specific competitor. For supershift assays, 2.5 μg of antibody against CREB was added 30 min before the addition of the oligonucleotide probe.In some experiments, we investigated the functional role of CREB in leptin neuroprotection using a CRE decoy oligonucleotide. Neuronal differentiated MN9D cells were transfected for 6 h with CRE decoy oligonucleotide (5′-TGACGTCAGAGAGCGCTCTGACGTCA-3) or control CRE mismatch sequence (5′-TAGCTGCAGAGAGCGCTCTCTGCAGCTA-3′) at the concentration of 0.1 μmol/liter (all linkages phosphorothioate protected, Bio-Synthesis Inc., Lewisville, TX). Transfection was done using Lipofectamine 2000 (0.3 μmol/liter) according to the manufactures' instructions.In Vivo Studies—All animal experiments were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male C57/BL6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) weighing 25g were placed in a stereotaxic device (Kopf, Tujunga, CA) while under 1.5% isoflurane anesthesia. Animals first received either 0 or 6.25 μg (5 μl) of leptin in physiological saline or saline alone (5 μl), into the right substantia nigra at a rate of 5 μl/30 min, using the coordinates 2.75-mm caudal and 0.8-mm lateral to bregma, at a depth of 3.7 mm from the dural surface. Thirty minutes later, 3 μg of 6-OHDA (in 1.4 μl of saline) or saline alone was injected into the right striatum. Some animals received 2.0 μl of PD98059 (0.2 mm) or Me2SO (0.2 mm) in saline into the right lateral ventricle 30 min before 6-OHDA at coordinates 0.3-mm rostral and 1.0-mm lateral to bregma, at a depth of 2.5 mm.Behavioral Testing—Previously published protocols were followed (6Signore A.P. Weng Z.F. Hastings T. Van Laar A.D. Liang Q.H. Lee Y.J. Chen J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Apomorphine-induced rotations were monitored 1 week before lesioning and then at 3 and 8 weeks following 6-OHDA lesioning. Mice were given a subcutaneous injection of apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg in physiological saline) (31Bensadoun J.C. Deglon N. Tseng J.L. Ridet J.L. Zurn A.D. Aebischer P. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 164: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and then placed individually in plastic beakers (diameter: 13 cm) and videotaped from above for 30 min. Analyses of completed (360°) left and right rotations were made offline.For spontaneous turning, the corner test procedures of Zhang et al. were used (32Zhang L. Schallert T. Zhang Z.G. Jiang Q. Arniego P. Li Q.J. Lu M. Chopp M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2002; 117: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Each trial consists of the preference, right or left, an animal spontaneously rears when encountering a 30-degree corner. Mice were tested 1 week before lesioning and then at 8 weeks following lesioning. Each testing period consisted of 10 trials.Measurements of catecholamine levels were made by removing the striata of mice and immediately freezing them on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C, 3 and 8 weeks after lesioning. High performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection was used to measure dopamine and its metabolites (33Larsen K.E. Fon E.A. Hastings T.G. Edwards R.H. Sulzer D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8951-8960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Catecholamine concentrations are expressed as picomoles per mg of fresh striatal tissue.Stereological Cell Counting—The Bioquant Image Analysis program was used to count SNc dopaminergic neurons that were immunopositive for TH. The Bioquant Software is interfaced with a stage encoder to interpret x-, y-, and z-axis movement of the microscope stage. The entire SNc from a given section was captured with a color charge-coupled device camera, and grid squares of 50 × 50 μm were generated over the region of interest. The optical dissector method requires that 100-150 cells be counted in a given structure to estimate the total number (34Gundersen H.J. J. Microsc. 1986; 143: 3-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar, 35Simic G. Kostovic I. Winblad B. Bogdanovic N. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 379: 482-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The number of points needed within the outlined area was empirically determined by prior studies: a 25 × 25 μm counting frame and a focus depth of 25 μmina 40-μm section (a dissector) should be used. An average of nine dissectors per section yields the desired number of counted neurons throughout the SNc at the levels of the dorsal hippocampus. The rostral-caudal length of the SNc was 4 mm, and every fourth section was counted. The total number of neurons was calculated using the optical dissector, equal to the quotient of the total number of neurons counted and the product of the fractions for sampling section frequency (SSF, fraction of sections counted), area section frequency (ASF, sampling area/area between dissectors), and thickness section frequency (TSF, dissector depth/section thickness), or n =∑neurons counted × 1/SSF × 1/ASF × 1/TSF). For our study, SSF = 1/4 sections, ASF = 25 × 25 mm/50 × 50 mm, and TSF = 25 mm/40 mm.Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least 6-9 measurements per data point, from three independent experiments. * or # denotes p < 0.05, ** or ## p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 obtained from analysis of variance and protected least significant difference.RESULTSLeptin Protects Dopaminergic Neurons from 6-OHDA Neurotoxicity in Vivo—To determine if leptin is neuroprotective for dopaminergic neurons, we injected leptin intranigrally in a murine PD model. The unilateral 6-OHDA neurotoxin paradigm induces specific degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the SNc. As shown in Fig. 1a, immunohistochemical staining of the SNc demonstrated that the 6-OHDA-induced loss of TH-positive neurons is reversed by leptin pre-treatment. Stereological quantification of the number of TH-positive neurons 3 or 8 weeks after 6-OHDA lesioning showed that leptin-treated animals had a greater number of immunopositive TH-positive neurons in the SNc compared with animals treated with vehicle (Fig. 1b).Functional behavioral outcomes were also examined using behavioral paradigms that measure the functional status of the motor aspects of the lesioned nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Apomorphine-induced asymmetrical rotations contralateral to the side of 6-OHDA injection were significantly decreased by leptin administration compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 1c). Mice lesioned with 6-OHDA developed a preference for turning toward their right, which was also significantly attenuated in animals treated with leptin (Fig. 1d).Analysis of dopamine and its primary metabolites was measured from the primary target of the SNc, the striatum. As shown in Fig. 1e, a significant drop in both dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels occurred 3 and 8 weeks post-lesioning, whereas homovanillic acid was significantly decreased 8 weeks after 6-OHDA lesioning as well. Treatment with leptin resulted in dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid concentrations that were significantly elevated compared with vehicle treatment at both 3 and 8 weeks following lesioning. Similarly, leptin significantly raised homovanillic acid levels 8 weeks after 6-OHDA.Leptin Is Neuroprotective against 6-OHDA Toxicity in Dopaminergic Neurons in Vitro—We next investigated the signaling mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of leptin using neuronal differentiated MN9D cells, a murine dopaminergic cell line that is susceptible to 6-OHDA toxicity. Leptin (10-50 μg/ml) protected MN9D cells from 6-OHDA (50-100 μm)-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2a). The efficacy of leptin protection was greater against 50 μm 6-OHDA, with maximal effects at 20-30 μg/ml. The neuroprotection afforded by leptin was also dependent on the time and sequencing of leptin and 6-OHDA exposure; the greatest protection was achieved when leptin was added 1-6 h before exposure of MN9D cells to 6-OHDA (Fig. 2b).FIGURE 2Neuroprotection by leptin attenuates 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic features in MN9D cells. a, exposure of neuronal differentiated MN9D cells to leptin 6 h before 6-OHDA exposure (50 or 100 μm for 30 min) reduced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Cell viability was measured using the XTT assay 24 h after exposure to 6-OHDA. b, cell survival measured after the addition of leptin (30 μg/ml) at various times before (Pre) or after (Post) 50 μm 6-OHDA exposure. * or #, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus vehicle-treated controls (Veh).

A current model for the catabolism of globin-derived oligopeptides invokes peptide transport out of the food vacuole followed by hydrolysis to amino acids by cytosolic aminopeptidases. To test this model, we have examined the roles of four parasite aminopeptidases during the erythrocytic cycle. Localization of tagged aminopeptidases, coupled with biochemical analysis of enriched food vacuoles, revealed the presence of amino acid-generating pathways in the food vacuole as well as the cytosol. Based on the localization data and in vitro assays, we propose a specific role for one of the plasmodial enzymes, aminopeptidase P, in the catabolism of proline-containing peptides in both the vacuole and the cytosol. We establish an apparent requirement for three of the four aminopeptidases (including the two food vacuole enzymes) for efficient parasite proliferation. To gain insight into the impact of aminopeptidase inhibition on parasite development, we examined the effect of the presence of amino acids in the culture medium of the parasite on the toxicity of the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin. The ability of bestatin to block parasite replication was only slightly affected when 19 of 20 amino acids were withdrawn from the medium, indicating that exogenous amino acids cannot compensate for the loss of aminopeptidase activity. Together, these results support the development of aminopeptidase inhibitors as novel chemotherapeutics directed against malaria.

Guerra C.A. Noor A.M. Myint H.Y. Hay S.I. Nature. 2005; 434: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar), the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum continues to present an enormous public health challenge. Clinical manifestations of infection appear as the parasite replicates within host erythrocytes. During this replication cycle, the parasite endocytoses and catabolizes large amounts (up to 75%) of host hemoglobin to constituent amino acids (2Krugliak M. Zhang J. Ginsburg H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 3Loria P. Miller S. Foley M. Tilley L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This process makes available large quantities of free amino acids for parasite protein synthesis (4Sherman I.W. Tanigoshi L. Int. J. Biochem. 1970; 1: 635-637Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and may also modulate the osmotic environment of the host cell (5Lew V.L. Tiffert T. Ginsburg H. Blood. 2003; 101: 4189-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and/or create space inside the red cell for parasite growth (6Allen R.J. Kirk K. Trends Parasitol. 2004; 20: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Amino acids derived from hemoglobin catabolism are also important for the uptake of isoleucine from the extracellular environment (7Martin R.E. Kirk K. Blood. 2007; 109: 2217-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As hemoglobin catabolism is essential for parasite replication and is currently a major focus of anti-malarial drug development efforts, a comprehensive understanding of the biochemistry of this pathway is an urgent priority. Hemoglobin catabolism occurs in an acidic, degradative organelle termed the food vacuole (FV) 2The abbreviations used are: FV, food vacuole; AMC, amidomethylcoumarin; AP, aminopeptidase; APP, aminopeptidase P; PfDAP, P. falciparum aspartyl aminopeptidase; DPAP1, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 1; E-64, N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-l-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide; HA, hemagglutinin; PfLAP, P. falciparum leucyl aminopeptidase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; βNA, β-naphthylamine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PfA-M1, P. falciparum aminopeptidase N; PM II, plasmepsin II; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; AA, amino acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl) propane-1,3-diol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: FV, food vacuole; AMC, amidomethylcoumarin; AP, aminopeptidase; APP, aminopeptidase P; PfDAP, P. falciparum aspartyl aminopeptidase; DPAP1, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 1; E-64, N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-l-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide; HA, hemagglutinin; PfLAP, P. falciparum leucyl aminopeptidase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; βNA, β-naphthylamine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PfA-M1, P. falciparum aminopeptidase N; PM II, plasmepsin II; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; AA, amino acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl) propane-1,3-diol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein. or digestive vacuole. In the lumen of the FV, endopeptidases of diverse catalytic mechanism and specificity (plasmepsin (PM) I, II, and IV, histo-aspartic protease, falcipain-2, -2′, and -3, and falcilysin) contribute to the hydrolysis of the α- and β-globin chains to oligopeptides (8Goldberg D.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 295: 275-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 9Rosenthal P.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These oligopeptides are further hydrolyzed to dipeptides by the FV exopeptidase dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 1 (10Klemba M. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43000-43007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The fate of these di- and oligopeptides is unclear. A widely cited model holds that the terminal stages of hemoglobin degradation occur in the cytosol, with peptides exported from the FV for hydrolysis by cytosolic aminopeptidases (11Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This model is based largely on the apparent lack of aminopeptidase (AP) activity in extracts of enriched FVs (12Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), on the localization of two P. falciparum APs to the cytosol (13Allary M. Schrevel J. Florent I. Parasitology. 2002; 125: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Stack C.M. Dalton J.P. J. Biol.

Wang X. Liu X. Wang Y. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Support for this model is weakened, however, by the absence of experimental evidence for peptide export from the FV, and by the presence of uncharacterized AP homologs in the P. falciparum genome sequence that could play a role in vacuolar peptide catabolism. To test this model, we have examined the roles of four P. falciparum AP homologs. These four enzymes were selected because, to the best of our knowledge at the time of this study, they constituted the entire repertoire of AP activities encoded by the P. falciparum genome, excluding the housekeeping methionine aminopeptidases. To gain insight into the functions of these four APs, we have determined the subcellular distribution of each. We have attempted to inactivate each AP by disrupting its coding sequence to assess their importance for intraerythrocytic growth and to determine their utility as potential drug targets. To further probe the roles of APs in peptide catabolism and parasite growth, the effect of exogenous amino acids on the toxicity of the AP inhibitor bestatin was examined. Generation of Constructs—The green fluorescent protein allele gfpmut2 (17Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar) was converted to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) allele Citrine (18Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) by introduction of the mutations A65G, Q69M, and T203Y using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutation A206K was also introduced to eliminate the weak tendency of GFP to dimerize (19Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). The Citrine sequence, preceded by the tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (ENLYFQS) and followed by the Softag1 epitope tag GSLAELLNAGLGGS (20Thompson N.E. Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was introduced into the AvrII/NotI sites of the plasmid pPM2GT (21Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to produce pPM2CIT2. To create plasmids for the generation of chromosomal AP-YFP fusions, 3′-1-kb fragments of PfAPP, PfDAP, PfA-M1, and PfLAP coding sequence up to but not including the stop codon were PCR-amplified from P. falciparum 3D7 genomic DNA and cloned into the XhoI/AvrII sites of pPM2CIT2. HA tag constructs were produced by excising the AvrII/NotI YFP fragment from the AP-YFP plasmids and cloning in-frame a sequence encoding GGGYPYDVPDYA (HA tag underlined) into the same sites. For gene disruption constructs, a kilobase of sequence from the 5′ end of each AP coding sequence was cloned into the XhoI/AvrII sites of pPM2CIT2. Sequences of primers used for PCR amplification of AP sequences are provided in supplemental Table S1. Parasite Culture and Transfection—P. falciparum clone 3D7 was grown in human O+ erythrocytes in RPMI medium supplemented as described previously (21Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). RPMI containing 148 μm isoleucine as the only amino acid (I medium) was prepared as described (22Liu J. Istvan E.S. Gluzman I.Y. Gross J. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8840-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cultures were synchronized by sorbitol treatment (23Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). Parasites were transfected with 75-100 μg of plasmid DNA using low voltage electroporation conditions (24Fidock D.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10931-10936Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), and 10 nm WR99210 was added after 48 h. Resistant parasites appearing after 18-24 days were subjected to drug cycling whereby WR99210 was removed from the media for 21 days and then applied until resistant parasites reappeared. After two drug cycles, populations of parasites expressing PfDAP-YFP, PfAPP-YFP, and PfLAP-YFP were obtained. All parasites in each population appeared to possess a chromosomal AP-YFP chimera, as nonfluorescent parasites were no longer observed. In contrast, after two drug cycles only a low percentage of parasites expressed PfA-M1-YFP, as determined microscopically; this necessitated the isolation of clonal fluorescent parasite lines by limiting dilution. Clone F11 was used for this study. Parasites stably transfected with gene disruption episomes were cycled off/on drug two (PfDAP) or three times (PfAPP, PfLAP, and PfA-M1). Clonal parasite lines containing a disrupted PfDAP gene were obtained by limiting dilution; clone C2 was used for this study. Southern Blot Analysis of Transfected Parasites—To detect targeted integration of the episome in parasite lines that were expressing YFP or HA fusions or were transfected with gene disruption constructs, genomic DNA was isolated from saponin-treated parasites using the QiaAmp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen), digested with one or two restriction enzymes (enzymes used for YFP fusion and gene disruption lines are indicated in supplemental Figs. S1 and S8, respectively), and resolved on a 0.6% agarose gel. After transfer to a Nytran+ membrane (GE Biosciences) and blocking, AP loci were detected using probes complementary to the episomal AP targeting sequences. Probe labeling and detection were carried out using the AlkPhos direct labeling kit (GE Biosciences). Fluorescence Microscopy—For live imaging of parasites expressing AP-YFP fusions, cultures were mounted under a coverslip after addition of the vital nuclear stain Hoechst 33342 (5 μm). Images were collected on a Zeiss AxioImager equipped with an MRm Axiocam digital camera using a 100×/1.4NA objective lens. For HA tag localization, parasites were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.0075% glutaraldehyde, permeabilized, and blocked, as described previously (25Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and then incubated with an affinity-purified rabbit anti-HA antibody (Invitrogen) followed by an Alexa 594-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Cells were then allowed to settle onto polyethyleneimine-coated coverslips and were mounted with ProLong Gold containing the nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). Images were converted to TIF files, and contrast was adjusted using Adobe Photoshop CS2. Trophozoite and FV Isolation and Preparation of Extracts—Trophozoites were isolated from infected erythrocyte cultures by treating with 1 mg/ml saponin in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min on ice. Parasites were recovered by centrifugation at 1940 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed once with cold PBS, and then stored at -80 °C. Extracts used in Fig. 5C were prepared by resuspending parasite pellets in 500 μl of 25 mm sodium MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl and sonicating three times for 10 s. Soluble extracts were generated by centrifuging the crude lysate at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. For normalization of enzyme rate data, the parasitemia of infected erythrocyte cultures was determined from a Giemsa-stained thin smear and used to calculate the number of parasites in the extract. To prepare extracts for immunoblotting, synchronized trophozoite and schizont parasites were isolated by saponin treatment as described in the above paragraph and stored at -80 °C. Frozen parasite pellets were resuspended in PBS containing the following protease inhibitors: 10 μm pepstatin, 10 μm N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-l-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide (E-64), 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium EDTA. Inclusion of these inhibitors was required to prevent artifactual proteolysis of AP-YFP fusions during sample preparation. Reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the sample was mixed and immediately placed in a boiling water bath for 3 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min. Food vacuoles were prepared from a parasite line expressing PM II-GFP (21Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) as described previously (26Saliba K.J. Folb P.I. Smith P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼5 × 109 saponin-treated trophozoites were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of cold water that had been adjusted to pH 4.5 with HCl. Resuspended parasites were triturated four times through a 27-gauge needle. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 2 min, parasites were resuspended in cold uptake buffer (25 mm HEPES, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4). DNase I was added (5 μl of a 5 mg/ml solution), and the preparation was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 2 min, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of cold uptake buffer, added to 1.3 ml of 42% Percoll, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, triturated twice as described above, and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The material at the bottom of the tube was washed once with uptake buffer, resuspended in 100 μl of uptake buffer, and then subjected to a second Percoll enrichment step. The second enrichment, which was carried out exactly as the first, reduced contamination with unlysed trophozoites. The presence of intact, GFP-containing FVs was confirmed microscopically. Isolated vacuoles were stored at -80 °C. Extracts of FVs and trophozoites (for Fig. 3) were prepared by suspension in 25 mm sodium MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoblotting—Parasite extracts were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with affinity-purified anti-GFP antibody 6556 (Abcam, 1:10,000 dilution) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (GE Biosciences). Chemiluminescent signal was developed with the ECL kit (GE Biosciences). Blots were stripped and reprobed with rabbit anti-BiP (1:10,000 (27Kumar N. Koski G. Harada M. Aikawa M. Zheng H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 48: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)) to assess relative loading levels. Enzyme Assays—Peptidase assays were carried out in 96-well plates with fluorogenic substrates as follows: (i) DPAP1 with 200 μm Pro-Arg-amidomethylcoumarin (PR-AMC; Bachem) as described previously (10Klemba M. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43000-43007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); (ii) PfA-M1 with 200 μm Ala-AMC (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (Ala-AMC is efficiently hydrolyzed by PfA-M1 but not PfLAP (15Stack C.M. Lowther J. Cunningham E. Donnelly S. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Teuscher F. Grembecka J. Mucha A. Kafarski P. Lua L. Bell A. Dalton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2069-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)); (iii) PfAPP with 200 μm lysine(Nϵ-2-aminobenzoyl)-Pro-Pro-4-nitroanilide (Bachem (28Stockel-Maschek A. Stiebitz B. Koelsch R. Neubert K. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 322: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 10 μm bestatin; (iv) PfDAP in a coupled assay (29Wilk S. Wilk E. Magnusson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15961-15970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) containing 100 μm Asp-Ala-Pro-β-naphthylamide and 0.2 units/100 μl of rabbit kidney dipeptidyl peptidase IV in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 μm bestatin. When enzyme extracts were prepared with Triton X-100 (Fig. 3), 0.1% Triton X-100 was included in all assays. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was detected spectrophotometrically at 650 nm in a lactate oxidation assay (30Makler M.T. Hinrichs D.J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1993; 48: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 100 mm lactate, 1 mm 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, 2 mm phenazine ethosulfate, 1 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Enzyme rates were calculated by linear regression using Kaleidagraph 4.0. Enrichment of DPAP1 and Ala-Pro-Ala-βNA Assays—Approximately 108 trophozoite-stage parasites were suspended in 50 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.0, and lysed by sonication. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatant was loaded onto a MonoQ column equilibrated in 50 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.0, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing DPAP1 were identified using the substrate PR-AMC as described under “Enzyme Assays.” Assays for Ala-Pro-Ala-βNA hydrolysis contained either clarified FV lysate, prepared as described above, or 5 μl of a MonoQ fraction enriched in DPAP1 supplemented with 0, 0.3, 1, or 3 μg of purified recombinant PfAPP 3K. Bompiani and M. Klemba, manuscript in preparation. in 50 mm sodium MOPS, pH 5.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaCl, and 500 μm Ala-Pro-Ala-βNA (Bachem). Assays of FV extract also contained 0.1% Triton X-100. When inhibitors were included in the assay, concentrations were as follows: 1 μm E-64, 10 μm bestatin, 1 μm pepstatin, or 1 μm Pro-Arg-fluoromethyl ketone (PR-FMK). All inhibitors were obtained from commercial sources except PR-FMK, which was custom-synthesized (Enzyme Systems Products). Bestatin Treatment—P. falciparum 3D7 parasites were cultured for at least three generations in I medium. Aliquots of a synchronous ring-stage parasite culture were centrifuged at 860 × g for 3 min, and infected cell pellets were resuspended in either fresh I medium or in regular RPMI medium containing all 20 amino acids. Bestatin was added to 200-μl aliquots of cultures in 96-well flat-bottom culture dishes to give a concentration range of 0.03-30 μm. A separate aliquot of culture was resuspended in RPMI medium lacking all amino acids to induce amino acid starvation. All assays were carried out in triplicate. Parasite cultures were incubated for 65 h and then fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS. After permeabilization of cells with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS and staining of DNA with 400 nm YOYO-1 (Invitrogen) in PBS, parasite fluorescence was determined on a Coulter Epics XL MCL flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm laser. Flow cytometry histogram overlays, parasitemias, and mean fluorescence intensities were generated using FlowJo version 8.3 (Treestar). Aminopeptidases in the P. falciparum Genome—The four APs studied here were identified through molecular biological (31Florent I. Derhy Z. Allary M. Monsigny M. Mayer R. Schrevel J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and bioinformatic (16Wu Y. Wang X. Liu X. Wang Y. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) approaches. The designated names and nearest homologs of these sequences are listed in Table 1. One of them, aminopeptidase N (PfA-M1), has broad specificity at the substrate P1 position (13Allary M. Schrevel J. Florent I. Parasitology. 2002; 125: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas that of leucyl aminopeptidase (PfLAP) is restricted to hydrophobic P1 residues (15Stack C.M. Lowther J. Cunningham E. Donnelly S. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Teuscher F. Grembecka J. Mucha A. Kafarski P. Lua L. Bell A. Dalton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2069-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). (The convention of Schechter and Berger (32Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4738) Google Scholar) is used to designate the positions of residues in the substrate and the corresponding binding sites in the peptidase.) Aminopeptidase P (PfAPP) and aspartyl aminopeptidase (PfDAP) have not yet been characterized but are predicted by homology to have highly restricted P1′ and P1 specificities, respectively (Table 1). Thus, each P. falciparum AP appears to have a distinct specificity range, and together they represent the apparent sum total of AP activities that could play a role in peptide catabolism. Four methionine APs encoded in the genome (16Wu Y. Wang X. Liu X. Wang Y. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) were not considered likely to participate directly in oligopeptide catabolism, as they function in the co-translational removal of methionine from the N termini of newly synthesized proteins (33Bradshaw R.A. Brickey W.W. Walker K.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 263-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). These methionine APs were therefore not analyzed in this study.TABLE 1P. falciparum aminopeptidases examined in this studyNameGene IDNearest homologSpecificitySignal peptideLocalizationPfAPPPF14_0517Aminopeptidase PX-ProYesFV, CytPfA-M1MAL13P1.56Aminopeptidase NBroad P1YesFV, NucPfLAPPF14_0439Leucyl aminopeptidaseHydrophobic P1NoCytPfDAPPF11570cAspartyl aminopeptidaseAsp/Glu-XNoCyt Open table in a new tab Aminopeptidase Localization—Stable parasite lines expressing each AP in Table 1 as a fusion with the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) allele Citrine were generated. As depicted in Fig. 1A, each chromosomal AP gene was modified to encode an AP-YFP fusion by homologous recombination with a transfected episome (see also supplemental Fig. S1). Transcription of each single copy AP-YFP chimera was controlled by the respective endogenous AP promoter; therefore, physiologically relevant patterns of AP expression were expected to be maintained, as observed previously with this approach (21Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All four AP-YFP parasite lines exhibited fluorescence during the asexual erythrocytic cycle (Fig. 1B and supplemental Figs. S2-5). Two APs were observed in the parasite's food vacuole, the site of hemoglobin catabolism: PfAPP (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2) and PfA-M1 (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S3). Interestingly, both of these APs also accumulated in a second compartment as follows: the cytosol (PfAPP) and the nucleus (PfA-M1). The two other APs (PfDAP and PfLAP) appeared in the cytosol throughout the erythrocytic cycle (Fig. 1B and supplemental Figs. S4 and S5). Both PfDAP and PfLAP were clearly excluded from the FV, and PfDAP also appeared to be excluded from the nucleus. In addition to its cytosolic location, PfLAP appeared in punctate structures in mature schizonts (Fig. 1B). The cellular location of these fluorescent spots is not clear; they did not co-localize with markers for rhoptries, micronemes, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, the apicoplast, or the mitochondrion (supplemental Fig. S6). Localization assignments for all APs are summarized in Table 1. SDS-soluble protein extracts from each AP-YFP parasite line were subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-YFP antibody to assess the number and sizes of YFP-containing polypeptides (Fig. 2). Both PfLAP-YFP and PfDAP-YFP were present as intact fusions in their respective extracts. PfLAP-YFP exhibited a higher mobility than would be expected for the full-length fusion protein (Fig. 2). The apparent decrease in size of ∼15 kDa is consistent with loss of the N-terminal asparagine-rich region (15Stack C.M. Lowther J. Cunningham E. Donnelly S. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Teuscher F. Grembecka J. Mucha A. Kafarski P. Lua L. Bell A. Dalton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2069-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, removal of this region was required for the expression of active recombinant PfLAP (15Stack C.M. Lowther J. Cunningham E. Donnelly S. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 2069-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); our data suggest that the asparagine-rich region is absent from PfLAP in vivo. Intact fusion protein was also observed in extracts of PfAPP-YFP and PfA-M1-YFP parasites; however, a 25-kDa YFP species was present that presumably reflects cleavage of YFP from the fusions. This is not a surprising outcome considering that both of these AP-YFP fusions are targeted to the FV and exposed to high levels of aspartic and cysteine endopeptidase activities. Cleavage of GFP was previously observed with fusions to the resident FV peptidases PM II and d"
https://openalex.org/W2160994404,"ADAM10 is a disintegrin metalloproteinase that processes amyloid precursor protein and ErbB ligands and is involved in the shedding of many type I and type II single membrane-spanning proteins. Like tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM17), ADAM10 is expressed as a zymogen, and removal of the prodomain results in its activation. Here we report that the recombinant mouse ADAM10 prodomain, purified from Escherichia coli, is a potent competitive inhibitor of the human ADAM10 catalytic/disintegrin domain, with a Ki of 48 nm. Moreover, the mouse ADAM10 prodomain is a selective inhibitor as it only weakly inhibits other ADAM family proteinases in the micromolar range and does not inhibit members of the matrix metalloproteinase family under similar conditions. Mouse prodomains of TACE and ADAM8 do not inhibit their respective enzymes, indicating that ADAM10 inhibition by its prodomain is unique. In cell-based assays we show that the ADAM10 prodomain inhibits betacellulin shedding, demonstrating that it could be of potential use as a therapeutic agent to treat cancer.

They function as sheddases by cleaving type I and type II integral single membrane proteins to generate soluble mature forms (1Moss M.L. Bartsch J.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7227-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 3Black R.A.

Symp. 2003; 70: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ADAM family members typically contain several domains as follows: a prodomain, a catalytic and cysteine-rich disintegrin domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (4Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M. Nature. 1992; 356: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Prodomains are required for successful production of ADAM family members. For example, TACE and ADAM12 require their prodomains for efficient transport, folding, and expression (5Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13427-13433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Similarly, the prodomain of ADAM10 acts as a molecular chaperone to allow the expression of catalytically active ADAM10 (8Fahrenholz F. Gilbert S. Kojro E. Lammich S. Postina R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). ADAM family members are expressed as zymogens with the prodomains maintaining the enzymes in a latent state. Isolated prodomains have been shown to inhibit the proteolytic activity of ADAM family proteins in vitro (9Gonzales P.E. Solomon A. Miller A.B. Leesnitzer M.A. Sagi I. Milla M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31638-31645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, not all prodomains are good inhibitors. For example, although the prodomain of TACE suppresses the activity of its catalytic domain with a Ki of 50 nm (9Gonzales P.E. Solomon A. Miller A.B. Leesnitzer M.A. Sagi I. Milla M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31638-31645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is only a high micromolar inhibitor against the TACE construct, including both the catalytic and disintegrin domains. Because the catalytic and disintegrin domains are both retained in membrane-bound TACE, the prodomain, once removed, most likely does not negatively affect TACE activity in vivo. ADAM family members are zinc metalloproteinases, and their catalytic activity depends on the activation of the zinc-bound water and subsequent nucleophilic attack on the amide backbone of a protein substrate. The inhibitory mechanism, in which the prodomain interferes with metalloproteinase activity by replacing the zinc-bound water with a cysteine residue, is known as “the cysteine switch” and was originally described for members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family (10Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). For ADAM12, the cysteine is required for inhibition of the catalytic activity when an α2-macroglobulin assay is used to assess catalytic activity (7Loechel F. Overgaard M.T. Oxvig C. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13427-13433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, mutation of the corresponding cysteine to alanine in the putative cysteine switch region of TACE does not diminish the inhibitory properties of the prodomain, suggesting that the cysteine switch hypothesis is invalid for this family member (9Gonzales P.E. Solomon A. Miller A.B. Leesnitzer M.A. Sagi I. Milla M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31638-31645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Biologically important substrates of ADAM10 include epidermal growth factor (EGF) (11Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), betacellulin (11Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), Notch (12Pan D. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and amyloid precursor protein (APP) (13Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Consequently, mis-regulation of ADAM10 catalytic activity is implicated in Alzheimer disease and carcinogenesis. For example, α-secretases such as ADAM10 and other metalloproteinases can carry out the first cleavage reaction of APP (14Kojro E. Fahrenholz F. Subcell. Biochem. 2005; 38: 105-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of ADAM10 activity has been shown to decrease the level of soluble nonamyloidogenic APP both in vivo and in cell-based assays (15Postina R. Schroeder A. Dewachter I. Bohl J. Schmitt U. Kojro E. Prinzen C. Endres K. Hiemke C. Blessing M. Flamez P. Dequenne A. Godaux E. van Leuven F. Fahrenholz F. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1456-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), suggesting that maintaining ADAM10 activity may play a protective role in Alzheimer disease for processing of APP via the α-secretase pathway. In contrast, excess ADAM10 activity may promote cell growth in cancer proliferation assays because of enhanced production of soluble mature forms of several ErbB ligands such as betacellulin (BTC) and EGF (2Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 11Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Blocking EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling in cancer by EGFR kinase inhibitors or antibodies that neutralize EGFR are current ways to regulate tumor growth (16Huovila A.P. Turner A.J. Pelto-Huikko M. Karkkainen I. Ortiz R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 17Zhou B.B. Fridman J.S. Liu X. Friedman S.M. Newton R.C. Scherle P.A. Exp. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2005; 14: 591-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A novel way to repress EGFR signaling could be through inhibition of ADAM10-dependent substrate processing of soluble ErbB ligands because ADAM10 is a known sheddase of BTC and EGF (11Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), and soluble forms activate EGFR by causing receptor dimerization (2Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). As a result, specific and potent inhibitors of ADAM10 could be used to suppress tumor progression in vivo. We have undertaken studies to express, purify, and test a prodomain construct based on the mouse ADAM10. A number of parameters were varied to obtain high expression levels of soluble protein. To study the cysteine switch mechanism, we introduced a mutation by exchanging the cysteine to serine in the ADAM10 prodomain. We show that the C173S mutation does not impair the inhibitory potency of the prodomain against ADAM10. Measurements of the inhibition of ADAM10 prodomains against ADAM8–10 and -17 and MMPs demonstrate that the wild type and mutant prodomain are selective inhibitors against ADAM10. ADAM10 prodomain inhibits betacellulin shedding in cell-based assays in vitro, and thus may become an attractive approach for the treatment of various cancers. Human ADAM10, ADAM9, and TACE protease containing the catalytic/disintegrin domains were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The following enzymes were generously donated to us: TACE catalytic domain from Marcos Milla, University of Pennsylvania; MMP-1 and -3 from Hideaki Nagase, Imperial College London; MMP-2 and -9 from William Stetler-Stevenson, NCI, National Institutes of Health; MMP-13 and -14 from Gillian Murphy, Cambridge University. All fluorescent-labeled peptides were either purchased from SynPep Corp. (Dublin, CA) or obtained from BioZyme Inc. (Apex, NC). Dinitrophenyl-labeled peptides were purchased from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, peptide synthesis laboratory. All oligonucleotides for PCR and directed mutagenesis were ordered from IDT DNA (Coralville, IA). Cloning of ADAM Family cDNA—A DNA fragment containing ADAM10 prodomain (residues 23–213) was cloned into the pRSET vector (Invitrogen) between BamHI and EcoRI sites to produce an N-terminal His-tagged protein, or cloned into a modified pET30a vector (EMD Biosciences, Madison, WI) between NdeI and BamHI sites as a C-terminal His-tagged protein. The modified pET30a vector encodes His6 between BamHI and EcoRI sites to produce a protein with a C-terminal His tag. DNA primers were as follows: N-terminal and C-terminal His tag 23–213, 5′ primer, GGA GCC GGA TCC AAT CCT TTA AAT AAA TAT ATT, and 3′ primer, GGA GCC GAA TTC TTA GCG TTT TTT CCT CAG GAG CTC; N-terminal and C-terminal His tag 23–213, 5′ primer, GGA GCC CAT ATG AAT CCT TTA AAT AAA TAT ATT, and 3′ primer, GGA GCC GGA TCC TTT TTT CCT CAG GAG CTC AGG; and C-terminal His tag 23–181, GGA GCC CAT ATG AAT CCT TTA AAT AAA TAT ATT, and 3′ primer, GGA GCC GGA TCC CCT TTC AAA AAC GGA GTG ATC. The wild type 23–213 C-terminal His-tagged ADAM10 prodomain was used as a template to mutate cysteine 173 to serine. The DNA primers for site-directed mutagenesis were 5′ primer, AAA TAC GGC CCA CAG GGC GGC TCT GCA GAT CAC TCC GTT TTT GAA, and 3′ primer TTC AAA AAC GGA GTG ATC TG AGA GCC CC CTG GG GCC GTA TTT. For prodomains of TACE 18–214 and ADAM8 18–186, mouse full-length cDNAs were used as templates to prepare fragments that were subcloned into the same vector as described for ADAM10. For truncated prodomains 23–176 and 23–181, the 23–213 construct was used as a template, and the fragments were subcloned into the same C-terminal His vector as described above. For prodomain 18–176, the full-length ADAM10 was used as a template, and fragments were subcloned into either N- or C-terminal His constructs. Expression and Purification—The appropriate constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)STAR cells. For a typical sample preparation, bacteria were grown in 1 liter of Luria Broth at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.4. The culture was incubated at 20 °C for 30 min before adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) to induce protein expression. Cells were harvested after 16 h by spinning at 4 °C for 30 min at 4000 rpm in a Sorvall JA 10 rotor. The supernatant was removed, and pellets were either stored at –20 °C or used directly. Cell pellets were lysed by French press at 1100 p.s.i. in 25 ml of buffer containing 50 mm phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl at 4 °C or lysed with the same buffer with cell lytic from Sigma (3 ml of a 10× concentrated solution), benzonase (1500 units), and lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml). For the wild type constructs, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol was added to each buffer to minimize oxidation of cysteine. Lysed bacteria were spun at 21,500 rpm in a Beckman JA 25.50 rotor for 30–60 min. The cleared supernatant was applied to a 15-ml Ni2+-NTA column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. After two 30-ml washes with a solution containing 50 mm phosphate, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl, the protein was eluted with a solution containing 50 mm phosphate, pH 8.0, 250 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl. The eluted protein was concentrated to less than 2 ml using an Amicon ultrafiltration device (molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa) from Millipore (Billerica, MA) and further purified with a Superdex-75 column (150 ml) on an Akta FPLC system at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. FPLC buffers contained 25 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, or 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. Fractions containing protein were concentrated and passed through an Endotrap column from Profos to remove any residual endotoxin and then stored as glycerol stocks at –80 °C. Monomer concentration was determined based on a calculated extinction coefficient at A280 for the prodomain using the program ExPASy. Ultracentrifugation—The molecular weight of ADAM10 prodomain in 25 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl was estimated by sedimentation equilibrium at 15,000 and 20,000 rpm and at 25 °C on a Beckman model XL-A analytical Ultracentrifuge. The v¯ of the protein and ρ of the solvent were estimated to be 0.7216 and 1.005, respectively, by the SEDNTRP program. The protein was examined at several concentrations (0.45, 0.9, and 1.8 mg/ml) and was monitored by the absorbance at 286 nm. The nonlinear least square curve was generated by the IDE-AL1 program (Beckman). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—A 30 μm sample of the 23–213 ADAM10 construct in a buffer containing 25 mm phosphate and 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, was used to obtain a CD spectrum on an Aviv 202 CD spectrometer. A wavelength scan from 200 to 300 nm was collected in a 1-mm quartz cuvette at 25 °C. Scans were obtained in 1-nm increments with a signal averaging time of 5 s. Background noises from the buffer were subtracted from the raw CD signal. Inhibition Assays with TACE and ADAM10—Activity of TACE catalytic/disintegrin, TACE catalytic, or ADAM10 catalytic/disintegrin constructs was monitored at 3-min intervals using the fluorescent substrate, dabcyl-LAQAHomoPhe-RSC(fluorescein)-NH2 (18Moss M.L. Rasmussen F.H. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 366: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm. The substrate was diluted from a 10 mm stock in Me2SO to 10 μm in assay buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 6 × 10–4% Brij-35. Reactions were run in a 96-well black-coated plate with either ADAM10 prodomain (10 nm to 1.0 μm) alone or with enzyme. Concentrations of enzyme ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 nm for TACE and from 5 to 15 nm for ADAM10. For assays with TACE and ADAM8 prodomain, the range of concentrations varied from 1 to 4.7 μm. Inhibition Assays with MMPs—The fluorescent substrate dabcyl-GPLGMRGC(fluorescein)-NH2 (19Rasmussen F.H. Yeung N. Kiefer L. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. Vitek M.P. Moss M.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2987-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in assay buffer (10 μm) containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 μm ZnSO4, and 0.01% Brij-35 was used to monitor enzyme activities. MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -13, and -14 (0.1–20 nm) were incubated with substrate in the absence or presence of prodomain (3–30 μm). Fluorescence intensities were measured every 3–5 min at an emission wavelength of 530 nm (excitation 485 nm). Inhibition Assays with ADAM9—The fluorescent substrate, dabcyl-PchaGC(Me)HAK(5-carboxyfluorescein)-NH2 (10 μm) (18Moss M.L. Rasmussen F.H. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 366: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 6 × 10–4% Brij-35, was used to measure human ADAM9 catalytic/disintegrin domain activity. The ADAM9 was provided as a 0.1 μg/μl stock solution, from which 3 μl was added to start the reaction in the absence or presence of ADAM10 prodomain (78–5000 nm). Fluorescence intensities were measured every 10–20 min at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. Inhibition Assays with ADAM8—The ADAM 8 catalytic domain was expressed and purified from E. coli as described (20Naus S. Reipschlager S. Wildeboer D. Lichtenthaler S.F. Mitterreiter S. Guan Z. Moss M.L. Bartsch J.W. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A substrate based on the L-selectin cleavage site, dinitrophenylalanyl-INorleuQKLDKSFSMIKE-NH2, was used to monitor enzyme activity with a fluorescamine assay. From a concentrated 50 mm solution in Me2SO, the substrate was diluted 1:500 in 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 6 × 10–4% Brij-35. To 100 μl of diluted substrate was added either 5 μl of buffer (Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl) or 5 μl of ADAM10 prodomain (1–10 μm). Zero time points were taken by diluting 12.5 μl of the reaction mixture into 100 μl of fluorescamine buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.01 m CaCl2, 0.01% Brij-35) in a 96-well black-coated plate. Before measuring fluorescence, 3 μl of a 1% solution of fluorescamine in Me2SO was added to each well. The plate was allowed to incubate for 10 min in the dark before measuring fluorescence (excitation wavelength at 390 nm and emission wavelength at 485 nm). For assays with TACE and ADAM8 prodomains, dabcyl/5-carboxyfluorescein fluorescent substrates were used to monitor activity at concentrations of prodomains ranging from 1 to 4.7 μm (18Moss M.L. Rasmussen F.H. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 366: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Calculation of Inhibition Constants—The amount of activity was calculated by subtracting the prodomain control from the prodomain with enzyme. All inhibition assays were performed at room temperature and the data fit to Equation 1 using Sigma Plot software, If=I(I+Ki)(Eq. 1) If is fractional inhibition; I is the inhibitor concentration, and Ki is the inhibition constant. Mechanism of Inhibition—ADAM10 was diluted 1:100 in buffer 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 6 × 10–4% Brij-35, and 10 μl was then added to 88 μl of substrate (20–100 μm), dabcyl-LAQAHomoPheRS-C(fluorescein)-NH2 (21Moss M.L. Lambert M.H. Essays Biochem. 2002; 38: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm. Prodomain, 2 μl, in 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, and 50 μm CaCl2 was added to the substrate before addition of enzyme. The final concentration of prodomain ranged from 17 to 170 nm. The fluorescence versus time was plotted, and slopes were taken from straight line fits of initial velocities. The reciprocal of the velocities was plotted versus the reciprocal of substrate squared because the normal Lineweaver Burke plot gave curved lines. The initial velocities versus substrate concentrations were fit as a family of curves to several allosteric models. The data fit best to a pure competitive model as described in Equation 2 (2Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) where binding of inhibitor prevents substrate from binding to both sites. v=V×(SKs+S2Ks2)/(1+2SKs+S2Ks2+IKi)(Eq. 2) In this equation, v is the velocity obtained from the fluorescence units versus time plot; V is the maximum velocity; S is the substrate concentration; I is the inhibitor concentration; Ks is the dissociation constant for substrate binding to enzyme; and Ki is the inhibition constant. Ligand Shedding Assays—The conditionally immortalized pancreatic epithelial (IMPE) cell line (22Koizumi M.D.R. Mori T. Kami K. Ito D. Tulachan S. Toyoda E. Masui T. Kawaguchi M.N.S. Tsuiji S. Whitehead R.H. Fujimoto K. Imamura M. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 245-246PubMed Google Scholar) was stably transduced with the retrovirus pBM BTC-HA IRES Puro expressing human BTC cDNA with a C-terminal HA tag as described previously (23Sanderson M.P. Erickson S.N. Gough P.J. Garton K.J. Wille P.T. Raines E.W. Dunbar A.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1826-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or with pBM AR IRES Puro expressing human amphiregulin. Cells were routinely cultured at 33 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 5% bovine growth serum/penicillin/streptomycin/nonessential amino acids and 5 units/ml IFNγ and 2 μg/ml puromycin. For BTC shedding assay, cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and grown for 48 h to confluence at 33 °C in medium containing IFNγ and then for an additional 36 h at 37 °C in medium lacking IFNγ and puromycin. For all shedding assays, cells were pretreated for 30 min at 37 °C with serum-free DMEM containing vehicle control (Me2SO), varying quantities of GI254023X and GW280264X or different concentrations of either buffer control or ADAM10 prodomain. For analysis of constitutive shedding, media were then replaced with fresh serum-free media using the same experimental treatments and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. To evaluate stimulated ligand shedding, media were then replaced with fresh media using the same experimental treatments containing 2 μm A23187 and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Conditioned media (CM) and cell lysates were then harvested as described previously (23Sanderson M.P. Erickson S.N. Gough P.J. Garton K.J. Wille P.T. Raines E.W. Dunbar A.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1826-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Specific human BTC and human AR sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (R & D Systems) were used to quantify BTC and AR levels, respectively, in CM and cell lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant human BTC and human AR (R & D Systems) were used as standards for their respective assays. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results, and a representative figure is presented. Values for each experiment are expressed as the means ± S.E. of quadruplicate determinations. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the prodomain peptide (YGNPLNKYIRHYEGL) and a peptide representing the cytoplasmic domain (QPIQQPPRQRPRESY) of ADAM10. Antibodies were further purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. Cell Culture—COS1 cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% glutamine. Transient transfections were performed with the DEAE-dextran method (24Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—COS1 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with the construct encoding full-length mouse ADAM10. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. To detect ADAM10, the polyclonal antibodies a-A10cyt (1:200) and a-A10pro (1:200) were used as primary antibodies. As secondary antibodies, we used either goat anti-rabbit-Cy3 (1:500, Sigma) or goat anti-rabbit-Alexa488 (1:500, Dako). Double stainings were performed sequentially. Between individual stainings, samples were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG (1:50, Sigma) to saturate excess binding sites. Images were acquired by confocal laser scanning microscopy (TCS SP2, Leica, Germany). Immunoprecipitation Experiments—5 × 105 COS1 cells were transfected with 5 μg of DNA using the DEAE-dextran method (20Naus S. Reipschlager S. Wildeboer D. Lichtenthaler S.F. Mitterreiter S. Guan Z. Moss M.L. Bartsch J.W. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in Co-IP buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies in concentrations of 5 μg/ml. After binding of precipitated material to protein-G-Sepharose, eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting. Proteins were detected using either a-A10cyt or a-A10pro antibodies (1:1000, respectively) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase as secondary antibody (1:5000; Sigma). Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Full-length Prodomain—Based on the work presented for the TACE prodomain (9Gonzales P.E. Solomon A. Miller A.B. Leesnitzer M.A. Sagi I. Milla M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31638-31645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we prepared a construct encoding amino acids 23–213 of mouse ADAM10 prodomain. We constructed the 23–213 ADAM10 prodomain with either the N- or C-terminal His tag to ensure that the location of the His tag did not interfere with inhibition of ADAM10. Both of these constructs exclude the N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence region and end at the furin cleavage site. Initial induction tests of the ADAM10 prodomain at 37 °C showed that the expression level was low and that most of the protein was found in an insoluble pellet. By reducing the induction temperature from 37 to 20 °C, we were able to obtain milligram quantities of soluble ADAM10 prodomain after inducing for 16 h with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The prodomain was purified via a Ni2+-NTA column followed by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column (Fig. 1A). The wild type prodomains 23–213, containing either the N- or C-terminal His tags, were both efficient inhibitors of ADAM10 (Table 1), with inhibition constants of 75 and 48 nm, respectively. We conclude that the ADAM10 prodomain inhibition does not depend on the location of the His tag.TABLE 1Inhibitory properties of ADAM10 prodomain 23-213InhibitorCatalytic/disintegrin human ADAM10Catalytic/disintegrin human TACECatalytic human TACECatalytic murine ADAM8Catalytic/disintegrin human ADAM9MMP-1-3, -9, -13, -14Pro-A10 WT 23-213 (N-terminal His tag)75 ± 15 nm>3 μm>11 μmNDaND means not determined.ND>2 μmPro-A10 WT 23-213 (C-terminal His tag)bThe inhibition constant was calculated from the initial velocities plot versus substrate concentration at varying concentrations of prodomain (see “Experimental Procedures”).48 ± 36 nm>10 μm>11 μm50% at 10 μm45% at 1 μm>2 μmProA10 C173S 23-213 (C-terminal His tag)36 ± 9 nm>3 μm>3 μm50% at 10 μm>1 μm>2 μma ND means not determined.b The inhibition constant was calculated from the initial velocities plot versus substrate concentration at varying concentrations of prodomain (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab Cysteine Switch Hypothesis—For metalloproteinases that exist as zymogens, the presence of a cysteine in their prodomains is often necessary for inhibition of catalytic activity. The cysteine is proposed to chelate the active site zinc ion of the metalloproteinase, causing the enzyme to remain in an inactive state. For some of the ADAM family members, the cysteine is required for efficient inhibition of the enzyme. We tested whether the cysteine in the putative cysteine switch of the ADAM10 prodomain affected the potency of i"

Eukaryotic primase contains two subunits, p48 and p58, and is normally tightly associated with DNA polymerase α. Despite the fundamental importance of primase in DNA replication, structural data on eukaryotic DNA primase are lacking. The p48/p58 dimer was subjected to limited proteolysis, which produced two stable structural domains: one containing the bulk of p48 and the other corresponding to the C-terminal fragment of p58. These domains were identified by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. The C-terminal p58 domain (p58C) was expressed, purified, and characterized. CD and NMR spectroscopy experiments demonstrated that p58C forms a well folded structure. The protein has a distinctive brownish color, and evidence from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, UV-visible spectrophotometry, and EPR spectroscopy revealed characteristics consistent with the presence of a [4Fe-4S] high potential iron protein cluster. Four putative cysteine ligands were identified using a multiple sequence alignment, and substitution of just one was sufficient to cause loss of the iron-sulfur cluster and a reduction in primase enzymatic activity relative to the wild-type protein. The discovery of an iron-sulfur cluster in DNA primase that contributes to enzymatic activity provides the first suggestion that the DNA replication machinery may have redox-sensitive activities. Our results offer new horizons in which to investigate the function of high potential [4Fe-4S] clusters in DNA-processing machinery.

The p180 subunit has the DNA polymerase catalytic activity and binds to both the p68 and p58 subunits. The p68 subunit has a regulatory function that is not completely understood. It is required for initiation of yeast chromosomal replication (3Foiani M. Marini F. Gamba D. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Foiani M.

Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5669-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of p68 alters the activity of polprim in SV40 replication (6Schub O. Rohaly G. Smith R.W.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The p48 subunit contains the catalytic site (12Schneider A. Smith R.W. Kautz A.R. Weisshart K. Grosse F. Nasheuer H.P. J. Biol.

The p58 subunit stabilizes p48 and participates in initiation, elongation, and “counting” the ribonucleotides polymerized (13Zerbe L.K. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4891-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p58 is also involved in transferring the RNA strand directly into the active site of the associated p180 subunit, which extends the growing nucleotide with dNTPs to complete the formation of the RNA-DNA primer (1Hubscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 14Arezi B. Kirk B.W. Copeland W.C. Kuchta R.D.

Knowledge of the molecular basis for regulation of the length of RNA portion of the primer and internal transfer to the p180 subunit is very limited. Despite the fundamental importance of primase in DNA replication, the only structural information available for a heterodimeric primase is for an archaeal (Sulfolobus solfataricus) primase that does not form a pol-prim complex (16Lao-Sirieix S.H.

Trends Genet. 2005; 21: 568-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments reveal homology between the p48 subunits and the N-terminal half of the p58 subunit. In the crystal structure of the S. solfataricus primase core, the p48 subunit assembles with the N-terminal half of p58 (16Lao-Sirieix S.H. Nookala R.K. Roversi P. Bell S.D. Pellegrini L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in human p58, both the N- and C-terminal regions have contacts with p48 (18Copeland W.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C-terminal half of p58 also contains a region with homology to a DNA polymerase β domain; this region was determined to be important for primer synthesis (13Zerbe L.K. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4891-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but how it functions is not known. DNA primase serves as a key target for regulation of DNA replication initiation, telomere maintenance, and response to DNA damage or fork stalling, in part through its physical interactions with other proteins involved in DNA replication and in checkpoint signaling (19Foiani M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 424-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Primase interacts physically with the viral helicase SV40 large T antigen, eukaryotic replication protein A (20Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 1042-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but its interaction partners are not known. To better understand the role of human primase in these pathways, it will be vital to elucidate its structure and interactions with partner proteins. This strategy has been useful in determining the roles of the SV40 large T antigen-replication protein A interaction in the context of SV40 DNA replication (30Arunkumar A.I. Klimovich V. Jiang X.

To facilitate similar experiments with human DNA primase, we sought to characterize the domain architecture of DNA primase. The p58 and p48 subunits can be expressed and purified independently of the other two subunits and retain primase activity in vitro at levels similar to those observed for the intact heterotetramer (12Schneider A. Smith R.W. Kautz A.R. Weisshart K. Grosse F. Nasheuer H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21608-21615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Copeland W.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Working from bacterially expressed primase protein, a structured domain in the C terminus of the p58 subunit (p58C) was identified. Biophysical analysis of this construct showed that the domain is folded and has the characteristics of a [4Fe-4S] high potential iron protein (HiPIP). The conservation of four cysteines across several species suggests a critical role for the cluster, and this was confirmed by in vitro experiments that demonstrate that the [4Fe-4S] cluster is required for primase activity. Primase Construct Design—The recombinant human p48/p58 primase expression plasmid used in this study has been previously described (18Copeland W.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Full-length p48 cDNA was amplified using the dimer plasmid as the template. Using BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes, it was then inserted into the in-house pBG100 vector (L. Mizoue, Center for Structural Biology, Vanderbilt University), which contains an N-terminal His6 tag. A p58-(266–509) construct (p58C) was subcloned from the dimer plasmid into pET15b (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI. This construct also contains an N-terminal His6 tag. Mutations were generated in the p58C expression plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene), and verified by DNA sequencing. An SphI-BglII fragment of p58C containing the mutation was then used to replace the corresponding wild-type fragment in the dimer p48/p58 expression plasmid. Protein Expression and Purification—Each construct was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB to an A600 of ∼0.6. The temperature was then lowered to 22 °C, and the cells were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. Expression was induced using 1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 4 h postinduction. Pelleted cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 3 mm 2-mer-captoethanol (BME), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, ∼10 mg of DNase I, and one Complete Mini EDTA-Free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by sonication at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The primase polypeptides were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. The bound proteins were eluted using a linear imidazole gradient ranging from 20 mm to 250 mm. Fractions containing the primase polypeptides were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C into buffer containing 30 mm MES (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 3 mm BME. The sample was then further purified using a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient to 1 m NaCl. Limited Proteolysis—p48/p58 and p48 primase preparations were exchanged into buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 3 mm BME. Digestions using proteinase K were performed at room temperature using a 1:1000 ratio of protease:protein. At several time points over the 24-h course of the digestion, an aliquot was removed, mixed with SDS sample loading buffer, and boiled for 10 min. The aliquots were then stored on ice until the end of the experiment, when they were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Bands of interest were excised and submitted for in-gel trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry analysis, or they were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and submitted for Edman degradation. CD—p58C was buffer exchanged into 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 3 mm BME. The protein concentration was ∼10 μm. The far-UV CD spectrum was scanned at room temperature from 190 to 260 nm using a Jasco J-180 spectrophotometer (Easton, MD). Secondary structure content was estimated using the K2d web server (32Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). NMR—To obtain 15N-enriched p58C, the protein was expressed in M9 minimal media with 15NH4Cl as the nitrogen source. The protein was buffer-exchanged into 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm BME, and 5% D2O. 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. A total of 64 scans was recorded in the direct (1H) dimension for each of the 128 points sampled in the indirect (15N) dimension. The data were processed using NMRPipe (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed and displayed using NMRView (34Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). UV-visible Spectrophotometry—Spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary 100 Bio spectrophotometer. Samples were scanned from 550 to 250 nm at room temperature in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 3 mm BME. EPR—Samples were prepared at 0.5 mm p58C in 20 mm MES (pH 6.5) and 50 mm NaCl, then freshly oxidized with 2.5 mm potassium ferricyanide. Spectra were recorded at X-band (∼9.05 GHz) on a Varian E-122 spectrometer. The data were acquired from frozen glasses at ∼15 K using an Air Products Helitran cryostat with liquid helium. The magnetic fields were calibrated with a Varian NMR Gauss meter, and the microwave frequency was measured with an EIP frequency meter. Multiple Sequence Alignment—Amino acid sequences of p58 from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were aligned using ClustalX (35Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). Primase Assay—The activity of wild-type and mutant primases was tested on M13mp18 ssDNA (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH). Reactions (20 μl) contained 0–8 pmol of primase, 100 ng of M13 DNA, in reaction buffer (30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 4 mm ATP, 0.2 mm UTP, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.01 mm CTP) and 20 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Reactions were assembled on ice and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Reaction products were precipitated with 2% NaClO4 in acetone, washed with acetone, and dried. Reaction products were dissolved in formamide loading buffer (45% v/v formamide, 5 mm EDTA) at 65 °C for 10 min and resolved by denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for 4–5 h at 500 V, monitored using 0.08% w/v xylene cyanol and 0.08% bromphenol blue as markers. The reaction products were visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging. Primase Domain Architecture—Proteins involved in DNA replication are often modular, containing several independent domains tethered together (36Stauffer M.E. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30915-30918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In many cases, it is possible to map the location of these structural domains by subjecting the intact protein to very limited proteolytic digestion, then using mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing to identify the fragments. To test whether DNA primase contained any structured domains, the p48/p58 dimer was subjected to limited proteolysis with proteinase K. Digestion products were monitored as a function of reaction time by using denaturing gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1A, two stable fragments were produced corresponding to molecular masses of ∼42 kDa (band a) and ∼28 kDa (band b). Bands were excised from the gel and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequencing to determine the identity of the two fragments. The 42-kDa band was found to be the result of a C-terminal truncation of roughly 60 residues from p48. Proteinase K digestion of isolated p48 produced the same fragment (Fig. 1B), which confirmed that the 42-kDa fragment is a stable domain of p48. The 28-kDa fragment corresponds to the C-terminal half of p58, residues Gly-266 to Ser-509. Production of Primase Domain Expression Constructs—To evaluate the potential primase domains further, they were subcloned into bacterial expression vectors. Two p48 constructs (Met-1–Ser-361 and Met-1–Glu-366) were subcloned into bacterial expression vectors but did not produce soluble protein, suggesting the C terminus is an integral part of the protein. Apparently, p48 contains a solvent-exposed loop in the vicinity of the proteinase K cleavage site. Although a stable fragment was not detected in the experiments for the N-terminal half of p58, sequence analysis suggested it should form a structured domain: sequence alignment reveals homology between the N-terminal half of p58 and the region of the large subunit from S. solfataricus that has previously been crystallized (16Lao-Sirieix S.H. Nookala R.K. Roversi P. Bell S.D. Pellegrini L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In an effort to produce and characterize a p58N construct, a wide range of sub-cloning experiments was performed, but none yielded soluble protein. A similar observation was made for the full-length p58 subunit. In contrast to p58N, p58C has no significant homology to proteins whose structure is known. However, an extensive amount of secondary structure was predicted for this stable fragment. In fact, the p58C domain expressed well and was very soluble, even to very high concentrations (∼30 mg/ml). A combination of CD and NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the structural integrity of p58C. Minima observed at 208 and 222 nm in the far-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 2A) indicate a significant amount of α-helical content in p58C. Analysis of the CD spectrum using the K2d program provided an estimate of 31% helix, 14% β-sheet, and 55% coil. The 600-MHz 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectrum of p58C is shown in Fig. 2B. The spectrum contains relatively narrow line widths and very good dispersion, which are indicative of a well folded structural domain. An Iron-Sulfur Cluster in p58C—Interestingly, when either the primase dimer or p58C was purified, the protein solution had a golden-brown color. The color intensified as the protein was concentrated, becoming very dark at high concentrations. A UV-visible spectrum of p58C contained a broad peak at 400 nm, similar to spectra from proteins containing iron-sulfur clusters (Fig. 3A) (e.g. Ref. 37Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The primase dimer also had this property, whereas isolated p48 did not (data not shown). To further investigate the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster in p58C, the protein was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which enables the content of metal ions to be quantified. This analysis provided an estimate of 3.09 mol of iron per mole of protein, which is consistent with the presence of 4 iron atoms in the cluster. A stoichiometry considerably lower than 4 is typical for proteins containing [4Fe-4S] clusters (38Hinks J.A. Evans M.C. De Miguel Y. Sartori A.A. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8397-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and is attributable to the loss of one iron in the cluster during protein purification and analysis. EPR spectroscopy is now a well accepted means to confirm the presence of iron-sulfur clusters in proteins and assign them to specific cluster types and oxidation states. The 9.05-GHz X-band EPR spectra of p58C acquired directly on the purified protein lacked any appreciable signal. Reduction of p58C with sodium dithionite produced only a weak, broad signal. However, oxidation of the protein resulted in a strong signal characteristic of a low spin S = ½ iron-sulfur cluster (Fig. 3B). The signal is highly rhombic with g1 = 2.087, g2 = 2.040, and g3 = 2.013. Simulation of the EPR spectrum with SIMPOW6 software (40Hemminga M.A. Berliner L.J. ESR Spectroscopy in Membrane Biophysics. Springer, New York2007: 261-281Google Scholar) revealed two slightly different forms were present in solution, one with g1 = 2.0870, g2 = 2.0405, and g3 = 2.0126 and a second weaker form with g1 = 2.0872, g2 = 2.0311, and g3 = 2.0094 and broader line widths. Similar results reported for oxidized HiPIPs have been interpreted as resulting from the presence of multiple isomeric states (e.g. Ref. 41Dilg A.W. Mincione G. Achterhold K. Iakovleva O. Mentler M. Luchinat C. Bertini I. Parak F.G. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The average EPR g-factor of 2.046 observed for p58C is much more typical of a [4Fe-4S]3+ cluster than a [3Fe-4S]+ cluster, because the latter normally exhibit an average g-factor of 2.015 and relatively smaller g anisotropy (39Boal A.K. Yavin E. Lukianova O.A. O'Shea V.L. David S.S. Barton J.K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8397-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 42Le Pape L. Lamotte B. Mouesca J. -M. Rius G. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7246-7254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum has many properties that suggest the [4Fe-4S] cluster is HiPIP-like. Like typical HiPIP clusters, the iron-sulfur cluster in p58C is only visible by EPR when oxidized, has an average g-value greater than two, is observed best below 30 K, and the signal does not readily saturate. Although the observed g-values deviate somewhat from the prototypical HiPIP cluster, such differences may be attributable to changes in the environment around the [4Fe-4S] cluster or distortion of the cluster by the protein environment (44Coldren C.D.

Schurmann P. Knaff D.B. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11425-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In summary, the biophysical data on p58C are consistent with assignment to the class of high potential iron proteins, thus adding to the growing list of DNA-processing proteins with this unique cofactor. Identification of Iron-Sulfur Ligands in p58C—Iron-sulfur clusters are typically bound to proteins via four cysteine residues, and p58C contains six cysteine residues. Following the strategy used for other DNA-processing proteins that contain an iron-sulfur cluster, potential cysteine ligands were identified from a multiple sequence alignment of p58 from five different species using ClustalX (35Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). The alignment in Fig. 4A reveals that four of the cysteine residues (Cys-287, Cys-367, Cys-384, and Cys-424) are conserved. These are residues most likely responsible for cluster binding. To test this hypothesis, each of the four cysteine residues in p58C was individually mutated to serine. Although the mutant constructs expressed well, they were poorly soluble and degraded rapidly (data not shown). Consequently, an alternate strategy was used involving mutation in the context of the p48/p58 dimer. Data are shown here for the C367S mutant primase dimer, which expressed at levels comparable to the wild-type primase, remained soluble, and co-purified with the p48 subunit (Fig. 4B). Analysis of this mutant primase dimer by UV-visible spectroscopy provided a spectrum in which the broad peak at 400 nm was clearly absent (Fig. 4C), confirming this mutant primase does not contain an iron-sulfur cluster. A Role for the Iron-Sulfur Cluster in Primase Function—To initially assess the functional relevance of the iron-sulfur cluster in p58, the primase activity of wild-type and p48/C367S-p58 primase dimers on a natural ssDNA template was assayed as a function of protein concentration. Radiolabeled CTP was incorporated into RNA primers of 8–10 nucleotides by the wild-type primase (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–3), and small amounts of larger products were detectable, as observed previously (14Arezi B. Kirk B.W. Copeland W.C. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12899-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Copeland W.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). No RNA primers were observed in the absence of enzyme (Fig. 5A, lane 7). Products of the mutant primase that lacks the iron-sulfur cluster were barely detectable above background (Fig. 5A, lanes 4–6), and the level of reaction product was not proportional to the amount of mutant primase in the reaction. Quantification of the products as a function of primase concentration revealed that the specific activity of the mutant primase was reduced at least 5-fold (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the iron-sulfur cluster in p58 is crucial for the primase activity of p48/p58 in this assay. Our studies show that DNA primase contains a structured domain in the C terminus of the p58 subunit and that this domain contains an iron-sulfur cluster. This is the first report of an iron-sulfur cluster in a DNA replication protein. Analysis of p58C by ICP-MS, UV-visible, EPR, and phylogenetic amino acid sequence comparisons are consistent with the presence of a HiPIP [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated by four conserved cysteine residues. Iron-sulfur clusters have been reported in DNA repair proteins, including DNA glycosylases MutY (46Michaels M.L. Pham L. Nghiem Y. Cruz C. Miller J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3841-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), endonuclease III (47Cunningham R.P. Asahara H. Bank J.F. Scholes C.P. Salerno J.C. Surerus K. Munck"

When tethered to DNA via their zinc finger motifs, KRAB-ZFPs recruit the KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1) corepressor (also known as TIF1β, transcription intermediary factor 1β; KRIP1, KRAB-interacting protein 1; or TRIM28, tripartite motif protein 28) via their KRAB domain. KAP1 is characterized by the presence of a RING finger, B-boxes, a coiledcoil region, a PHD finger, and a bromodomain (5Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G.

The first three of these motifs define the so-called RBCC or TRIM domain, which is both necessary and sufficient for homo-oligomerization and direct binding to KRAB. Upon recruitment to DNA loci, KAP1 functions as a scaffold for the formation of a multimolecular complex comprising HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1), histone deacetylases, and histone methyltransferases, which induces transcriptional repression through the formation of heterochromatin (8Ayyanathan K.

The primordial importance of this process from the earliest stage of mammalian development is supported by the embryonic lethality of the mouse KAP1 knock-out, which results in failure to gastrulate and death at day E5.5 (10Cammas F. Mark M. Dolle P. Dierich A. Chambon P. Losson R. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 2955-2963PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the obvious importance of KRAB-mediated gene control, it is quite remarkable that only very few gene targets of the KRAB-containing ZFPs have so far been identified (11Zheng L. Pan H.

We described previously a conditional gene regulation system based on the use of the tetracycline-controllable trans-repressor tTRKRAB, a chimeric protein built by fusing KRAB with the DNA binding domain of the Escherichia coli tetracycline repressor (tetR). Upon binding tetracycline operator (tetO) sequences, tTRKRAB induces transcriptional repression, which can silence RNA polymerase I, II, and III promoters situated within a radius of a few kilobases, thus allowing for doxycycline-regulated gene expression and knockdown (12Deuschle U.

Using lentiviral vectors as vehicles for this system, we demonstrated that KRAB-induced silencing is fully reversible in vitro and in vivo even after prolonged periods of repression in diverse contexts such as in a variety of established human and murine cell lines, in primary cells, including mouse ES cells, and in the brain of rats injected with a vector expressing the tTRKRAB repressor and a tetO-controlled target (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence revealing that, in sharp contrast to all these other settings, KRAB-mediated repression results in irreversible gene silencing through promoter DNA methylation if it acts during the first few days of mouse development. During early embryogenesis, the mouse genome undergoes an orderly cycle of demethylation-remethylation (16Jaenisch R. Bird A. Nat.

After fertilization of the oocyte, methylation is erased from both paternal and maternal alleles except in regions of imprinted genes, with DNA methylation levels reaching their lowest level in the blastocyst at embryonic day E3.5. After implantation, although the DNA of extra-embryonic cells remains hypomethylated, the bulk of the genome becomes hypermethylated in the embryonic ectoderm and mesoderm through active de novo methylation, except in so-called CpG islands (CGIs). CGIs are G + C-rich regions that overlap with either repeats such as Alu or with the transcriptional start sites of promoters (in which case they are called start CGIs), notably promoters active during early embryogenesis (21Ponger L. Duret L. Mouchiroud D. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1854-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mechanisms behind this patterning remain incompletely characterized, although a critical role for the DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a and -3b in de novo DNA methylation has been demonstrated through gene knock-out experiments in the mouse (22Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4532) Google Scholar). The data presented here raise the possibility that KRAB-containing ZFPs play an important role in shaping these DNA methylation patterns established during this early embryonic period. Lentiviral Vector Construction and Production—The LVCT-tTRKRAB vector was described previously (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). LVC-tTRKRAB was constructed by first replacing the EF-1α promoter in pWPXL with the CAG promoter and then substituting the GFP cDNA for one encoding tTRKRAB. In LVUT.GFP, tetO sequences were introduced upstream of the ubiquitin C promoter (UbiC). For LVUT.GFP.IRES.tTRKRAB, an IRES-tTRKRAB cassette was placed downstream of the GFP marker of LVUT.GFP (23Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D.

Transgenesis—LVCT.GFP, LVC.tTRKRAB, LVCT.tTRKRAB, and LVUT.tTRKRAB transgenic mice were generated by perivitelline injection of lentiviral vectors as described previously (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The E14 ES cells were cultured as described (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The blastocyst transfer was performed according to standard techniques (25Nagy A. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 453-504Google Scholar). Doxycycline (dox) was administered in drinking water at a concentration of 2 g/liter supplemented with 5% sucrose. The generation and genotyping of floxed KAP-1 mice have been described previously (26Weber P. Cammas F. Gerard C. Metzger D. Chambon P. Losson R. Mark M. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2329-2337PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-based Experiments—Both mES E14 cell culture and ear fibroblast isolation have been described previously (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). For drug-based studies, fibroblasts were plated at low density in medium containing dox (1 mg/liter) and treated with 5-Aza (7.5 μm) or TSA (300 nm) for 24 h before analyzing by FACS for GFP 24 h later. DNA and RNA Studies—Southern blot analyses were performed by subjecting tail DNA to BssHII and BglII digestion, before gel electrophoresis, transfer to membranes, and hybridization with 32P-labeled probes specific for the RRE region, as described (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Quantitative real time PCR using SYBR green was performed using standard procedures. Data were normalized against β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels. Bisulfite sequencing was done using the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Chemicon) according to the supplier's recommendations. For each PCR, 1 μl of bisulfite-treated DNA was used. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR-amplified products were cloned into a TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen), and between 12 and 20 clones from each PCR were then sent for sequencing (Microsynth, Switzerland). Sequence data were analyzed using BiQ analyzer (27Bock C. Reither S. Mikeska T. Paulsen M. Walter J. Lengauer T.

Primer sequences are available upon request. tTRKRAB Induces Irreversible Silencing during Early Development—With the long term goal of engineering transgenic animals that allow for externally controllable gene knockdown and transgene expression, we previously exploited the tTRKRAB system within the context of lentiviral vectors (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 15Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that when such vectors were used to engineer transgenic mice by transduction of fertilized oocytes, the resulting animals exhibited controllable transgene expression as long as the KRAB-containing regulator was prevented from binding its target DNA during pregnancy. However, our preliminary analyses also revealed that if tTRKRAB was left to bind its target during early development, then the transgene was irreversibly silenced (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To investigate this phenomenon further, we injected a lentiviral vector expressing tTRKRAB under the control of the ubiquitous CAG promoter (LVC. tTRKRAB) into the perivitelline zone of fertilized oozytes, which we re-implanted into foster mothers as described previously (23Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar, 28Pfeifer A. Ikawa M. Dayn Y. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). We then transduced ear fibroblasts from the pups with a lentiviral vector containing a GFP reporter downstream of a polymerase II promoter juxtaposed with tetO sites. Animals whose cells displayed fully doxycycline-controllable GFP expression, indicative of a functional tTRKRAB system, were kept for further studies (data not shown). In parallel, we generated transgenic mice with a lentiviral vector that expressed GFP under the control of the CAG promoter and contained tetO sequences in the LTR (LVCT.GFP). CAG is a chimeric promoter comprising the CMV immediate early enhancer linked to the chicken β-actin promoter and first intron, which was previously found to be strongly active in transgenic mice (28Pfeifer A. Ikawa M. Dayn Y. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 29Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the LVCT.GFP mice displayed high levels of GFP expression in all tissues (data not shown). We generated dually transgenic animals by crossing LVC.tTRKRAB males with LVCT.GFP females (Fig. 1A). We divided the population into four groups, depending on the time point from which dox was administered (e.g. E0.5, E6.5, or E13.5 or from birth). Then we tested the dox responsiveness of GFP expression in ear fibroblasts harvested from 6-week-old pups from all groups (Fig. 1C). GFP was expressed only in cells derived from the group of animals that had received dox from E0.5, whereas it remained undetectable in cells from animals in the other groups that received the antibiotic only from later time points, even after prolonged dox treatment (Fig. 1D). These results suggested that binding of tTRKRAB to the provirus during the first days of development resulted in irreversible silencing of the CAG promoter. KRAB-induced Irreversible Silencing Is Caused by DNA Methylation—To investigate the likely epigenetic mechanism of the silencing in GFP-negative animals, we treated their fibroblasts with selective inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases (5-azacytidine, 5-Aza) and histone deacetylases (TSA) (Fig. 2A). TSA had no effect, whereas 5-Aza restored dox-induced GFP expression in these cells, consistent with a primary role for DNA methylation in the silencing. In support of this hypothesis, Southern blot and PCR-based analyses of genomic DNA digested with a methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease revealed that the provirus was methylated in regions corresponding to the CAG promoter in fibroblasts from all animals, except in those exposed to dox since day E0.5 (data not shown). To confirm these data with a more quantitative approach, we performed a bisulfite sequencing analysis of genomic DNA from mice harboring silenced or expressed proviruses. Because amplification of the CAG promoter turned out to be technically difficult, we generated new animals using the LVUT.GFP. IRES.tTRKRAB vector, which contains all parts of the KRAB system, including a tetO site and a human ubiquitin promoter-GFP cassette driving the expression of a tTRKRAB-ires-GFP cassette in a self-regulatory fashion, as described previously (Fig. 2B) (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In these animals as in their LVC.tTRKRAB/LVCT.GFP counterparts, GFP was irreversibly repressed when dox was omitted during early development (data not shown). This result indicated that KRAB-induced silencing was not restricted to the CAG promoter. Bisulfite sequencing of the ubiquitin promoter region of the provirus revealed that in animals left off dox during early embryogenesis, there was an almost complete methylation of the 23 CpG dinucleotides contained in this fragment (Fig. 2C, Dox-, left; 96.4 and 98.3% methylated CpG dinucleotides in 14 and 10 clones, respectively, amplified from two mice). In contrast, the animals that had been kept on doxycycline all harbored completely unmethylated ubiquitin promoter sequences, albeit mixed with partially and even some completely methylated sequences (Fig. 2B, Dox+, left; 55% unmethylated CpG in 30 fragments amplified from two mice). We also performed bisulfite analysis of the transgene coding sequence (GFP). Interestingly, we found that this region was highly methylated in both sets of animals (Fig. 2B, right). We also found complete methylation of the GFP sequence in all LVC.tTRKRAB/LVCT.GFP mice, whether they had been kept “on” or “off” doxycycline during early development, and of the LTR region of the proviruses, in which transcriptional sequences were deleted because of the “self-inactivating” design of the vector, in both groups of animals (supplemental Fig. 1). These data indicate that, following lentivector-mediated transgenesis, the provirus becomes methylated over its entire sequence except in region(s) corresponding to active promoter(s). Our results also suggest that binding of a KRAB-containing repressor during the early embryonic period overrides factors that normally prevent the methylation of CpG-rich promoters. tTRKRAB-induced DNA Methylation Is Restricted to the Earliest Days of Development—These results suggested that KRAB-induced DNA methylation of promoters contained in lentiviral vectors paralleled the physiological wave of genome-wide methylation taking place during the first days of mammalian embryogenesis. We performed a series of experiments to study this in more detail. We crossed wild type females with transgenic males generated with the LVCT.GFP.IRES.tTRKRAB vector, which contains both a tetO-CAGGFP conditional expression cassette and the tTRKRAB repressor (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We then treated the pregnant females with dox starting at day E0.5 or at each consecutive day up to E8.5, and we examined GFP expression in embryos harvested at E14.5 (Fig. 3, B and C). Embryos were strongly GFP-positive as long as dox had been administered at day E2.5 or earlier. With later time points of dox introduction, we found a progressive decrease of GFP expression with no GFP expression detected when doxycycline administration was started at E6.5 or later. Southern blot analysis revealed that this loss of GFP expression was accompanied by increased DNA methylation of the promoter sequences (data not shown). Together, these experiments show that if tTRKRAB binding is prevented before E3.5, GFP expression is fully restored at E14.5. However, if KRAB is left to bind between E0 and E3.5, GFP expression as measured at E14.5 is reduced, at levels that are inversely proportional to the duration of the dox-off, KRAB-bound period, with complete silencing if the repressor is allowed to bind until E7.5. Therefore, these results identify a time window during which KRAB-induced irreversible silencing occurs. To confirm that KRAB-induced DNA methylation can be reversed during early development, we crossed LVCT.GFP. IRES.tTRKRAB-transgenic, GFP-suppressed males with wild type females, which we then treated with dox from the beginning of their pregnancy (Fig. 4A). The offspring expressed GFP at high levels (Fig. 4B). Correspondingly, Southern blot analyses confirmed that methylation of the CAG promoter, present in the fathers, was reversed in the F1 generation when dox prevented tTRKRAB binding during early embryogenesis (Fig. 4C). Of note, animals produced in this fashion exhibited fully reversible silencing of the transgene even after up to 12 months without doxycycline (data not shown). ES Cells and ES Cell-derived Mice Exhibit Reversible KRAB-mediated Repression—These results demonstrate that KRAB induces de novo DNA methylation if tethered to promoter sequences during early embryogenesis. It is well established that de novo methylation can be carried out by the DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b (22Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4532) Google Scholar). These enzymes are highly expressed in murine embryonic stem cells, a setting in which endogenous retroelements are irreversibly silenced through mechanisms that involve DNA methylation (30Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we previously noticed that KRAB-induced silencing does not lead to DNA methylation in mES, even after prolonged repression (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A concern with this experiment was that the autoregulatory design of the LVCT.GFP.IRES.tTRKRAB vector implies that levels of the trans-repressor are low in the silenced state. Thus, to confirm that tTRKRAB does not induce DNA methylation in ES cells, we generated clones of E14 mES cells stably expressing tTRKRAB (by transduction with LVC. tTRKRAB). These cells were then transduced with lentiviral vectors harboring tetO sites either in the LTRs or next to the internal promoter and expressing GFP from the CAG, the ubiquitin, or the human PGK promoters. In all cases we observed fully reversible, dox-mediated regulation, with no sign of irreversible silencing (Fig. 5A). We then injected mES cells transduced with the LVCT.GFP.IRES.tTRKRAB vector that had been kept off dox for 2 weeks into blastocysts, and we transferred those to foster mothers that we kept off doxycycline. We then examined the resulting pups. Blood samples from these chimeric mice contained GFP-expressing cells if the animals received dox after birth (data not shown). Furthermore, analysis of ear fibroblasts harvested from 6-week-old mice revealed fully dox-responsive GFP expression (Fig. 5B). Thus, KRAB-induced silencing is not accompanied by irreversible silencing when it is triggered in ES cells, even when these are re-implanted in vivo. It suggests that the epigenetic pathway responsible for KRAB-induced DNA methylation in early embryos is not present in ES cell lines, and it is not re-activated when these are placed in the environment of a pre-implantation blastocyst. KAP-1 Is Essential for tTRKRAB-mediated Transcriptional Repression—It has been demonstrated that the KAP1 corepressor is essential for KRAB-mediated repression in human cells (9Sripathy S.P. Stevens J. Schultz D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8623-8638Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To confirm that our experimental system, which relies on a fusion of the human KOX1 protein KRAB domain with the tetR from E. coli, functions through similar mechanisms, we generated primary fibroblasts from mice carrying loxP site-modified KAP1 alleles (26Weber P. Cammas F. Gerard C. Metzger D. Chambon P. Losson R. Mark M. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2329-2337PubMed Google Scholar). To inactivate KAP1, we transduced these cells with a lentiviral vector expressing the CRE recombinase (24Cudre-Mauroux C. Occhiodoro T. Konig S. Salmon P. Bernheim L. Trono D. Hum. Gene Ther. 2003; 14: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Genotyping of the resulting cell population 1 week later confirmed that the LoxP-flanked sequence had been efficiently excised, which resulted in an almost complete loss of KAP1 transcripts, as assessed by real time PCR (Fig. 6, A and B). When we transduced these cells with the LVCT.GFP.IRES.tTRKRAB vector in the presence or absence of doxycycline, we did not observe any KRAB-mediated repression of the GFP transgene (Fig. 6C). This result confirms that our system completely depends on KAP1, as is thought to occur with endogenous KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins. Here, we demonstrate that tethering a KRAB-containing protein to chromosomal DNA during the first few days of mouse embryonic development triggers CpG methylation in nearby promoters. These results were obtained in the context of lentiviral integrants subjected to control by a tet repressor-KRAB fusion protein. Considering that the natural targets of KRAB-containing ZFPs are mostly unknown, one can only speculate about the importance of this observation for the methylation events that occur during the earliest period of vertebrate embryogenesis. However, the strict KAP1 dependence of our system supports its physiological relevance. It appears from our cumulated data that KRAB-mediated repression has distinct consequences depending on the context. Although we systematically observed that tTRKRAB induced irreversible promoter silencing because of promoter CpG methylation if tethered to a lentiviral integrant during the first few days of mouse embryogenesis, we always observed that tTRKRAB-induced repression was reversible outside of this time period. Similarly, in transduced murine or human cell lines or primary cells as well as in the brain of rats injected with a tTRKRAB-controllable lentiviral vector, target promoters could be turned on and off through addition or removal of doxycycline (14Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 15Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). It is unclear why we found KRAB-induced irreversible silencing in embryos but not in mES cells considering that the de novo methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are known to be highly expressed and active in mES cells (22Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4532) Google Scholar). It may be that an as yet unidentified factor links KAP1 to the de novo DNA methylation machinery and that this factor is missing in mES cells. Our results contrast with a previous report revealing that KRAB can induce CpG methylation and irreversible polymerase II promoter silencing in plasmid-transfected NIH3t3 cells (8Ayyanathan K. Lechner M.S. Bell P. Maul G.G. Schultz D.C. Yamada Y. Tanaka K. Torigoe K. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1855-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). One explanation could be that our lentivector-based approach introduced at most two tTRKRAB-binding sites in the vicinity of targeted promoters, whereas in this other study stable cell lines were generated with plasmids, most likely resulting in the immediate juxtaposition of many KRAB-binding sites and in turn in heterochromatin-forming complexes, perhaps above a critical threshold. Furthermore, lentiviral vector-mediated transduction can yield several integrants per cell, increasing the chance that one at least will be fully regulatable. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that even in the absence of tTRKRAB binding during development, only about half of the active promoters remained unmethylated. This suggests that lentiviral integrants are subjected to epigenetic modifications and that a significant fraction of them are inactivated by DNA methylation, along a pattern presumably influenced by the integration site of the vector. Interestingly, it was only in the promoter region that we found unmethylated proviral DNA, whereas the coding sequences and the inactivated LTRs were always methylated. Thus, the pattern of lentiviral provirus DNA methylation mimics that of cellular genes, where the coding sequence is usually methylated irrespective of the state of the promoter. The strong housekeeping promoters present in the lentivectors used in this study all harbor start CGI. It is unclear why CpG islands are not methylated during early development, although the correlation between start CGIs and expression during early embryogenesis suggests that expression per se might prevent this modification (21Ponger L. Duret L. Mouchiroud D. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1854-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our data would support such an interpretation. Because they were obtained in the unnatural context of the tTR-KRAB/tetO lentivector-based system, our results do not allow us to implicate formally KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins in the wave of DNA methylation that characterizes the mammalian early embryonic period. Noteworthy, many conditional transgenic mice lines have been established based on a tetR-containing transactivator, the functionality of which eliminates the possibility that the presence of a tetR domain be in itself responsible for triggering CpG methylation (31Fedorov L.M. Tyrsin O.Y. Krenn V. Chernigovskaya E.V. Rapp U.R. Transgenic Res. 2001; 10: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 32Gossen M. Bujard H. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 2002; 13: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our results thus warrant experiments aimed at determining whether a lack of KRAB-mediated DNA methylation contributes to the early embryonic lethality of KAP1 knockouts. More specific analyses will have to await the unequivocal identification of KRAB-KAP1 functional targets. No less than 7000 KAP1-binding sites were recently identified in the human genome through chromatin immunoprecipitation studies (35O'Geen H. Squazzo S.L. Iyengar S. Blahnik K. Rinn J.L. Chang H.Y. Green R. Farnham P.J. Plos Genet. 2007; 3: e89Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the remarkably subtle phenotypes of several conditional KAP1 knock-out mice recently established in our laboratory 5J. Jakobsson and D. Trono, unpublished observations. suggest that this number is a gross overestimation of bona fide KRAB/KAP1 functional targets. Independently of these considerations, our data open interesting leads for the development of new genetic tools. For instance, variations of our system, e.g. through the site-specific introduction of tTRKRAB-binding sites by homologous recombination or via the fusion of KRAB with natural or artificial zinc fingers (36Blancafort P. Segal D.J. Barbas III, C.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), could be used to induce methylation at virtually any place in the genome, whether to knock out genes or to try modulating the function of cis-acting elements such as enhancers or trans-acting elements such as transposons (37Ikeda R.

These systems contain an essential periplasmic component that is important for assembly of the protein complex. We show here that the periplasmic protein CusB from the Cus copper/silver efflux system has a critical role in Cu(I) and Ag(I) binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments demonstrate that one Ag(I) ion is bound per CusB molecule with high affinity.

Gel filtration chromatography demonstrates that upon binding metal, CusB undergoes a conformational change to a more compact structure.

Efflux systems of the resistance nodulation division (RND) 2The abbreviations used are: RND, resistance, nodulation, division; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; HAE, hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux; AHT, anhydrotetracycline; DW, Debye Waller. family are key players in the intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance of Gram-negative bacteria (1Poole K. Srikumar R. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These systems confer resistance to otherwise lethal concentrations of drugs and metal ions, and they also mediate efflux of bacterial products such as siderophores, peptides, and quorum-sensing signals (2Piddock L.J.V. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 3Yang S. Lopez C.R. Zechiedrich E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2386-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). With antibiotic-resistant pathogens representing a growing threat to human health, understanding these efflux systems is of significant importance. RND-type efflux systems form a transenvelope complex comprised of three fundamental components: an energy-utilizing inner membrane protein (4Tseng T.T. Gratwick K.S. Kollman J. Park D. Nies D.H. Goffeau A. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 107-125PubMed Google Scholar), an outer membrane factor, and a periplasmic component (5Dinh T. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inner membrane components are proton-substrate antiporters of the RND protein superfamily, which are subclassified on the basis of their exported substrate (4Tseng T.T. Gratwick K.S. Kollman J. Park D. Nies D.H. Goffeau A. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 107-125PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the heavy metal efflux subfamily of RND transport systems are highly substrate-specific, with the ability to differentiate between monovalent and divalent ions (4Tseng T.T. Gratwick K.S. Kollman J. Park D. Nies D.H. Goffeau A. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 107-125PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux (HAE) subfamily of RND protein systems has significantly broader substrate recognition. Members of the HAE-RND systems transport a wide range of structurally unrelated molecules, including antibiotics, dyes, detergents, bile salts, organic solvents, and antimicrobial peptides (6Poole K. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2004; 10: 12-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Insights into the functions of the three fundamental components of RND efflux systems have been gathered from studies of a variety of RND systems. By far, the most information at the structural and biochemical levels is known for the inner and outer membrane proteins. The overall picture that has emerged is that the inner and outer membrane proteins form a channel that spans the periplasmic space (7Touze T. Eswaran J. Bokma E. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8Eswaran J. Koronakis E. Higgins M.K. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The substrate is taken up from either the inner membrane, cytoplasm, or periplasm, depending on the properties of the substrate and the particular efflux system (9Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The RND protein drives substrate export through the channel formed by the outer membrane protein utilizing the proton gradient across the inner membrane. Although the periplasmic component is an essential part of RND efflux systems (10Franke S. Grass G. Rensing C. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), the role it plays in the efflux process is much less clear. Several functions have been postulated for the periplasmic component. It is often termed an adaptor protein, which may have a function in bridging the inner and outer membrane components. This role is supported by biochemical experiments that have shown a direct interaction between this component and the inner and outer membrane proteins (7Touze T. Eswaran J. Bokma E. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). More recent studies suggest that the periplasmic component could contribute to the regulation of the open and closed states of the outer membrane protein. Evidence for this function of the periplasmic adaptor protein is given by the observation of conformational variants in the crystal structure of the periplasmic protein AcrA from the AcrAB-TolC HAE-RND efflux system (11Mikolosko J. Bobyk K. Zgurskaya H.I. Ghosh P. Structure (Lond.). 2006; 14: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and observation of direct interactions between the coiled regions of the periplasmic protein and outer membrane protein (12Lobedanz S. Bokma E. Symmons M.F. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4612-4617Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the periplasmic protein likely has a further functional role, because even a constitutively open mutant of an outer membrane protein requires the periplasmic component (13Augustus A.M. Celaya T. Husain F. Humbard M. Misra R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1851-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In a reconstituted system without the outer membrane protein, the periplasmic adaptor AcrA is essential to the function of the RND pump AcrD (14Aires J.R. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which further supports the hypothesis that the periplasmic proteins can play an active role in substrate capture and extrusion. CusCFBA, the Cu(I) and Ag(I) efflux system from Escherichia coli, consists of CusB, the periplasmic protein, CusA, the inner membrane proton/substrate antiporter of the heavy metal efflux-RND family, and CusC, the outer membrane protein (10Franke S. Grass G. Rensing C. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 15Franke S. Grass G. Nies D.H. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16Munson G.P. Lam D.L. Outten F.W. O'Halloran T.V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5864-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition to the three fundamental proteins, the Cus system has a fourth component, the small periplasmic metal-binding protein CusF, which has homologs only in putative monovalent metal ion resistance systems (10Franke S. Grass G. Rensing C. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In addition to conferring Ag(I) resistance (15Franke S. Grass G. Nies D.H. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the CusCFBA system has been shown to be important for copper resistance primarily under anaerobic conditions, suggesting that its other physiologically relevant substrate is Cu(I) (17Outten F.W. Huffman D.L. Hale J.A. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30670-30677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Copper and silver belong to the same group of the periodic table; therefore, Cu(I) and Ag(I) have similar coordination chemistries and can be treated interchangeably in many cases (18Solioz M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 688-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, silver is predominantly found in the Ag(I) oxidation state under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, whereas Cu(I) only predominates under anaerobic conditions. To address the role of the periplasmic component, we examined CusB from the CusCFBA system as a representative of the periplasmic proteins of RND efflux systems. Protein Expression and Purification—Genomic DNA from E. coli strain W3110 was used to amplify the cusB gene. The primers used for the PCR contained unique restriction sites at the 5′ end (EcoRI) and 3′ end (XhoI). After restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR product, it was ligated into the pASK-IBA3 (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) vector. The result was a construct that contained the full-length cusB gene followed by region encoding a short cloning artifact (LEVDLQGDHGL) and a C-terminal Strep affinity tag (SAWSHPQFEK). The cusB-containing plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21-(DE3). Cells were grown in LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until they reached an A600 of 0.6–1.0, then induced with 200 μg/liter of anhydrotetracycline (AHT), and grown at 30 °C for another 6–8 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at –20 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl per liter of cell culture. Protease inhibitors (leupeptin (final concentration 2 μg/ml), pepstatin (final concentration 2 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration 0.5 mm)) and DNase I (∼150 units)) were added, and then cells were lysed by a French press. CHAPS (0.1% w/v) (MP Biomedicals) was added to the lysate, and cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 31,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto Strep-Tactin-resin (IBA GmbH) affinity column. After washing the column with 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl buffer, protein was eluted using the same buffer, plus 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. The fractions were dialyzed versus 50 mm Tris (pH 9.0) buffer and loaded onto a Mono Q 10/100 GL anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. CusB was eluted from the column by a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris (pH 9.0). Aliquots of the fractions were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie to determine purity. CusB protein was also verified by Western blot analysis using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody specific to the Strep tag (IBA GmbH). The N-terminal sequence of CusB was confirmed by sequencing. Fractions >95% pure were pooled and dialyzed in appropriate buffer and concentrated using Amicon concentrators with a 5-kDa molecular weight cut-off. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) for all the experiments except EXAFS for which the Bradford assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad) was used. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC measurements were performed on a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter (North-ampton, MA), typically at 25 °C. The titrant solution was made by mixing appropriate amounts of stock metal solution (90 mm AgNO3 in nanopure Milli-Q water) with buffer retained from the final dialysis of the protein sample. CusB was extensively dialyzed in 50 mm cacodylate (pH 7.0). Both protein and titrant were thoroughly degassed in a ThermoVac apparatus (Microcal). For a titration experiment, ∼1.7 ml of 22 μm CusB was placed in a reaction cell and injected over 20 s with 10 μl of 300 μm AgNO3 solution with a 5-min interval between each injection. The titrations of the CusB mutants M21I, M36I, M38I, and M283I were carried out as described for wild-type CusB, using protein concentrations of 18.0, 19.0, 20.0, and 24.7 μm, respectively. To ensure adequate mixing of the titrand and the titrant, the reaction cell was continuously stirred at 300 rpm. A total of 25 injections was made. The heat because of dilution, mechanical effects, and other nonspecific effects were accounted for by averaging the last three points of titration and subtracting that value from all data points (20Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 21Kittleson J.T. Loftin I.R. Hausrath A.C. Engelhardt K.P. Rensing C. McEvoy M.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11096-11102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Data were fitted using a single-site binding model in the Origin software package (MicroCal). The software uses a nonlinear least squares algorithm and the concentrations of the titrant and the titrand to fit the enthalpy change per injection to an equilibrium binding equation. The binding enthalpy change ΔH, association constant Ka, and the binding stoichiometry n were permitted to float during the least squares minimization process and taken as the best fit values. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy—Samples for EXAFS were prepared in an anaerobic chamber. CusB was first dialyzed in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0). Ascorbate solution buffered at pH 7.0 was then added to argon-purged protein at a final concentration of 50 mm. CuCl2 was added such that the ratio of CusB to Cu(I) was 1:1. The protein was further dialyzed against 20 mm MOPS, 10 mm ascorbate (pH 7.0), to remove unbound copper. The final concentration of protein was determined using the Bradford assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). 80 μl of CusB-Cu(I) was mixed with 20 μl of ethylene glycol, transferred to EXAFS vials, and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Collection and Analysis of XAS Data—CuK-edge (8.9 keV) EXAFS and x-ray absorption near edge structure data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory operating at 3 GeV with currents between 100 and 50 mA. All samples were measured on beam line 9-3 using a Si(220) monochromator and a rhodium-coated mirror upstream of the monochromator with a 13 keV energy cutoff to reject harmonics. A second rhodium mirror downstream of the monochromator was used to focus the beam. Data were collected in fluorescence mode using a high count rate Canberra 30-element germanium array detector with maximum count rates below 120 kHz. A 6-μ Z-1 nickel oxide filter and Soller slit assembly were placed in front of the detector to reduce the elastic scatter peak. Six scans of a sample containing only sample buffer were collected, averaged, and subtracted from the averaged data for the protein samples to remove Z-1 Kβ fluorescence and produce a flat pre-edge base line. The samples (80 μl) were measured as aqueous glasses (>20% ethylene glycol) at 10 K. Energy calibration was achieved by reference to the first inflection point of a copper foil (8980.3 eV) placed between the second and third ionization chamber. Data reduction and background subtraction were performed using the program modules of EXAFSPAK (22George G.N. Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. Menlo Park, CA1990Google Scholar). Data from each detector channel were inspected for glitches or dropouts before inclusion in the final average. Spectral simulation was carried out using the program EXCURVE 9.2 (23Binsted N. Gurman S.J. Campbell J.W. EXCURVE. 9.2 Ed., Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1998Google Scholar, 24Gurman S.J. Binsted N. Ross I. J. Phys. Chem. 1984; 17: 143-151Google Scholar, 25Gurman S.J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Growth Inhibition Studies of CusB—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to alter the individual methionines to isoleucines in CusB. Plasmid pASK3 containing the cusB gene was used as a template. Primer pairs used to introduce the point mutations were antiparallel and overlapping. PCR products were treated with DpnI to digest the dam-methylated template plasmid. The correct mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The purified PCR product containing the point mutation was transformed into EC950 (ΔcueO ΔcusB) strain (10Franke S. Grass G. Rensing C. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) of E. coli. Wild-type cusB and an empty pASK3 vector (without the cusB gene) were also transformed into EC950 to use as controls in the growth inhibition studies. For growth inhibition experiments, mutants, wild type, and the cells containing empty vector were grown overnight in LB medium. Cells were diluted 1:100 in fresh media and grown at 37 °C until they reached an A600 of ∼0.5. At this point, the cells were subjected to two different protocols. For one set, cells were induced for CusB expression at the same time as they were exposed to copper by streaking the cells directly on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/liter AHT, and varying concentrations of CuCl2 (0.0, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 mm). For the second set, the cells were induced to express CusB before subjecting them to metal stress. The cells at an A600 of 0.5 were induced with 50 μg/liter AHT and grown at 30 °C until they reached an A600 of ∼1.0. At this point, cells were streaked on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and varying concentrations of CuCl2 (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 mm) but no AHT. All plates were incubated at 30 °C for ∼18 h. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed in a Beckman Optima XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge using an An-60Ti rotor and an absorbance optical system. A six-channel equilibrium centerpiece equipped with sapphire windows was used to run three sample-solvent pairs simultaneously. Sample and solvent volumes were 110 and 125 μl, respectively. Data were collected at 4 °C at speeds of 15,000, 20,000, and 25,000 rpm on samples at three concentrations ranging from 5 to 14 μm for apo-CusB and 5 to 14 μm CusB with 10–28 μm AgNO3 for CusB-Ag(I). Samples were allowed to equilibrate for 12 h at each speed, after which five replicate scans were taken every 4 h in a step size of 0.005 cm. These scans, spaced 4 h apart, were overlaid to determine whether equilibrium had been established. Final equilibrium scans were then performed in a step size of 0.001 cm, and absorbance was monitored at 280 and 255 nm. Fifteen replicate scans were taken and averaged at every radial increment. The SEDNTERP program (28Laue, T. M., Shah, B. D., Ridgeway, T. M., and Pelletier, S. L. (1992) in Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science (Harding, S. R., Rowe, A. J., and Horton, J. C., eds) pp. 90–125, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UKGoogle Scholar) was used to calculate the partial specific volume (0.7318 ml/g) and the buffer density (1.00605 g/ml) at 4 °C. The base-line offset was constrained to ∼0.04 for all the data sets. The distribution of single ideal species and monomer-dimer/monomer-trimer equilibrium species was analyzed according to equations described by McRorie and Voelker (29McRorie, D. K., and Voelker, P. J. (1993) Self-associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge, pp. 1–61, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CAGoogle Scholar). All fits were done by nonlinear least square analysis of the primary data using the general curve fit function of Kaleidagraph version 3.51 (Synergy Software). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 10/300GL analytical column (Amersham Biosciences) on an Akta Prime System (Amersham Biosciences). 60–70 μl of protein at a concentration of 180 μm was loaded onto the column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The column was run at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and absorbance was measured at 280 nm. Fractions of 500 μl were collected. For Ag(I)-CusB, AgNO3 dissolved in water was added to the protein at a 2-fold molar excess. The size exclusion column was calibrated with the following globular protein markers (molecular mass and retention volumes are reported): thyroglobulin (669 kDa, 9.7 ml), ferritin (440 kDa, 11.2 ml), catalase (232 kDa, 13.0 ml), aldolase (158 kDa, 13.5 ml), albumin (67 kDa, 14.4 ml), ovalbumin (43 kDa, 15.3 ml), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa, 17.1 ml), and ribonuclease (13.7 kDa, 17.7 ml). To investigate whether CusB could play a role in substrate binding, we employed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to study the binding of Ag(I) by CusB in vitro. ITC detects changes in the heat absorbed or released during a binding event (i.e. the binding enthalpy change). The titration of Ag(I) into the solution of apo-CusB showed a change in binding enthalpy that was not seen in the control titrations without CusB protein, clearly indicating a binding event (Fig. 1). The large exothermic peaks eventually diminished into just the heat of dilution after ∼11 injections. A single-site binding model was used to fit the data, yielding a Ka value of 4.04 × 107 m–1 (corresponding to a Kd of 24.7 nm) and a stoichiometry of Ag(I) to CusB of 0.72 ± 0.01. The dissociation constant should be treated as an approximate value as it is at the lower limits of measurement by ITC. This affinity is similar to that measured for the periplasmic copper- and silver-binding protein CusF from the Cus system (21Kittleson J.T. Loftin I.R. Hausrath A.C. Engelhardt K.P. Rensing C. McEvoy M.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11096-11102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and it clearly demonstrates that CusB is a metal-binding protein. To identify the potential metal ligands in CusB, we performed x-ray absorption spectroscopy of CusB bound to Cu(I). X-ray absorption spectroscopy data were collected on two independent samples of copper-loaded CusB and gave identical results within experimental error. The absorption edge region of the spectrum (Fig. 2, inset) shows a weak feature at 8983.7 eV with intensity equal to 0.62 of the normalized edge height. The position and intensity of this peak is characteristic of Cu(I) bound to the protein, in a 3-coordinate environment (30Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Blackburn N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23163-23170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Pickering I.J. George G.N. Dameron C.T. Kurz B. Winge D.R. Dance I.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9498-9505Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the Fourier transform and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) for a representative sample. The spectrum consists of intense oscillations extending beyond k = 12.8 Å–1, the energy cutoff used to avoid background errors because of small amounts of contaminating zinc in the sample. The first shell of the phase-corrected Fourier transform maximizes at ∼2.3 Å (characteristic of Cu(I)-thioether or thiolate coordination). The best fits to the data were obtained with three Cu-S scattering interactions with Cu-S bond length of 2.287 Å and a Debye Waller factor (DW, 2σ2) of 0.011 Å2 (F = 0.43). We also tested fits that utilized two and four Cu-S interactions. These gave similar Cu-S bond lengths but had uniformly worse F values (0.70 and 0.56, respectively). Because the simulated bond lengths remained close to those expected for 3-coordination, this analysis confirmed the 3-coordinate assignment. A fit using two Cu-S and one Cu-O/N interaction had a more acceptable F value (0.51), with two Cu-S at 2.300 Å (2σ2 = 0.006 Å2) and Cu-O/N at 2.050 Å (2σ2 = 0.017 Å2), but the large DW term for the single low-Z copper scatterer suggested this latter model was less reasonable than the three Cu-S fits. However, the 3 sulfur fit also has a high DW for the Cu-S shell suggesting some heterogeneity in the Cu-S distances. Splitting these distances did not lead to improvements in the F value. We conclude that the most reasonable model to fit the data is three slightly differing Cu-S interactions at an average distance of 2.29 Å from the central Cu(I) atom. Because CusB does not contain any cysteine residues, the sulfur-containing species in CusB that coordinate Cu(I) are methionine residues. The unusually long Cu-S bond length of 2.29 Å is in agreement with this conclusion, because 3-coordinate Cu-cysteinate ligated sites typically exhibit Cu-S bond lengths in the 2.23–2.28-Å range (30Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Blackburn N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23163-23170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Pickering I.J. George G.N. Dameron C.T. Kurz B. Winge D.R. Dance I.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9498-9505Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here the weaker donor properties of the thioether ligand appear to lead to lengthening of the Cu-S(Met) bonds. Methionines are commonly used in periplasmic proteins for metal coordination because the oxidizing environment of the periplasm renders cysteine less effective. However, few good models exist for 3-coordinate methionine-coordinated Cu(I), and the CusB site represents the first such structure to be described for a metalloprotein. To identify candidates for the three metal-coordinating methionines detected from the EXAFS data, the conservation of the methionines in CusB was examined. From a BLAST search with the mature CusB sequence, the top 51 sequences (considering only one sequence from each genus) were selected for alignment. The alignment, generated with ClustalW using the default parameters, shows that of the nine methionines in the mature sequence of CusB, four methionines (Met-21, Met-36, Met-38, and Met-283) are well conserved in these proteins (supplemental Fig. 1). Methionine is always found at position 21, with one exception where it is histidine. Position 36 is always a methionine, except for one occurrence where it is an aspartate. Position 38 is always conserved as a methionine. Position 283 is usually found as methionine (47 of 52 sequences) but is also found as a leucine, threonine, or alanine. Furthermore, in more extensive alignments (data not shown) methionines 21, 36, and 38 are primarily conserved in the periplasmic proteins of putative monovalent metal resistance systems, although Met-283 is conserved among periplasmic proteins exporting a variety of substrates. The other methionine positions, 162, 199, 213, 296, and 370, show much greater variability in the homologs and do not consistently have the appropriate properties for metal coordination. These positions are usually occupied by hydrophobic residues. Therefore, of the methionines in CusB, three of the four well conserved methionines are likely candidates for the metal-coordinating methionines. To identify which three of the four methionines are involved in metal binding, ITC was used to determine the ability of the four individual CusB mutants M21I, M36I, M38I, and M283I to bind Ag(I) in vitro (Fig. 3, A–D). CusB M21I showed a 10-fold reduction in the binding affinity for Ag(I) as compared with wild-type CusB, with a dissociation constant of 0.2 μm. CusB M36I and M38I showed no specific binding to Ag(I). The affinity of CusB M283I for Ag(I) was the same as wild type, with a dissociation constant of 20 nm. Thus, the most significant e"
https://openalex.org/W2079910432,"In yeast, the long-chain sphingoid base phosphate phosphohydrolase Lcb3p is required for efficient ceramide synthesis from exogenous sphingoid bases. Similarly, in this study, we found that incorporation of exogenous sphingosine into ceramide in mammalian cells was regulated by the homologue of Lcb3p, sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphohydrolase 1 (SPP-1), an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein. Sphingosine incorporation into endogenous long-chain ceramides was increased by SPP-1 overexpression, whereas recycling of C6-ceramide into long-chain ceramides was not altered. The increase in ceramide was inhibited by fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, but not by ISP-1, an inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, the rate-limiting step in the de novo biosynthesis of ceramide. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that SPP-1 expression increased the incorporation of sphingosine into all ceramide acyl chain species, particularly enhancing C16:0, C18:0, and C20:0 long-chain ceramides. The increased recycling of sphingosine into ceramide was accompanied by increased hexosylceramides and, to a lesser extent, sphingomyelins. Sphingosine kinase 2, but not sphingosine kinase 1, acted in concert with SPP-1 to regulate recycling of sphingosine into ceramide. Collectively, our results suggest that an evolutionarily conserved cycle of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation regulates recycling and salvage of sphingosine to ceramide and more complex sphingolipids.

Because of their inter-convertibility and opposing effects, the dynamic balance between S1P and ceramide/sphingosine has been proposed to be an important factor that determines cell fate (2Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that the S1P/ceramide balance is ultimately regulated by the relative activities of enzymes controlling the turnover of these sphingolipid metabolites. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of intracellular levels of these sphingolipids are not yet fully understood. Cellular levels of S1P are kept low by tight spatio-temporal regulation of its synthesis and degradation. Sphingosine kinases (SphKs) catalyze the synthesis of S1P by phosphorylation of sphingosine. Two distinct SphK isoforms, SphK1 and SphK2, have been cloned and characterized in mammals (2Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). Diverse external stimuli, particularly growth and survival factors, stimulate SphK1, generating S1P that has been implicated in their mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects (4Taha T.A. Hannun Y.A.

In contrast to SphK1, rather than promoting growth and survival, overexpression of SphK2 suppressed growth and enhanced apoptosis (6Okada T. Ding G. Sonoda H. Kajimoto T. Haga Y. Khosrowbeygi A.

Degradation of S1P is mediated either by irreversible cleavage to ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal by a pyridoxal-dependent S1P lyase or by reversible dephosphorylation to sphingosine by specific S1P phosphohydrolases (SPPs) (8Le Stunff H.

Both belong to the superfamily of lipid phosphatases that also include the type 2 lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases (LPPs) (13Brindley D.N. English D. Pilquil C. Buri K. Ling Z.C. Biochim. Biophys.

LPPs are magnesium-independent, membrane-associated, and N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive and include three isoforms, LPP1, LPP2, and LPP3 (15Pyne S. Long J.S. Ktistakis N.T. Pyne N.J. Biochem. Soc.

Except for the conserved residues within three domains present in the active sites of LPPs (14Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the two S1P phosphatases have little overall homology to other known LPPs, and in contrast to the broad specificity of the other LPPs (13Brindley D.N. English D. Pilquil C. Buri K. Ling Z.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), they are specific sphingoid base phosphate phosphatases. SPP-1 and SPP-2 are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they degrade S1P to terminate its actions (11Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These findings have far reaching implications as the ER also contains the enzymes of ceramide biosynthesis, suggesting an important role for SPPs in the regulation of ceramide levels. Indeed, we have previously found that SPP-1 functions in an unprecedented manner to enhance ceramide levels and apoptosis (17Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased intracellular and secreted S1P due to down-regulation of SPP-1 regulates “inside-out” S1P signals through its cell surface receptors (18Johnson K.R. Johnson K.Y. Becker K.P. Mao C. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34541-34547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In agreement, regulation of intracellular levels of S1P by SPP-1 plays an important role in epidermal growth factor-directed cell movement (19Le Stunff H. Mikami A. Giussani P. Hobson J.P. Jolly P.S. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34290-34297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Biosynthetic pathways of sphingolipids are highly conserved between yeasts and mammals (20Futerman A.H. Riezman H. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Sphingosine is not an intermediate in the biosynthesis of ceramide and is predominantly generated in the endocytic pathway from turnover of membrane complex sphingolipids. Sphingosine can be metabolized to ceramide or S1P by ceramide synthase and SphKs, respectively. In yeast, it has been found that exogenous sphingoid bases are converted to ceramides indirectly by a cycle of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (20Futerman A.H. Riezman H. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown previously that the yeast SPP-1 homologue, Lcb3p, is required for the incorporation of exogenous dihydrosphingosine into sphingolipids (21Qie L. Nagiec M.M.

Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Moreover, the major yeast sphingoid base kinase, Lcb4p, but not Lcb5p, regulates synthesis of ceramide from exogenously added dihydrosphingosine. Moreover, Lcb4p is tightly associated with membranes and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum where it may work in concert with Lcb3p (24Funato K. Lombardi R. Vallée B. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7325-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether a similar cycle of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulates the metabolism of exogenous sphingosine into ceramide and sphingolipids in mammalian cells. Our data reveal that SPP-1 is critical for conversion of exogenous sphingosine into ceramide and consequently into glycosphingolipids but not sphingomyelin and suggests that concerted action with SphK2 but not SphK1 may be an evolutionarily conserved pathway for regulating salvage of sphingosine. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP, [3H]pal-miticacid,[3H]stearicacid,[3H]sphingosine, and l-3-[3H]serine were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Sphingosine, fumonisin B1 (FB1), myriocin (ISP1), N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), and 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Recombinant diacylglycerol kinase was from Calbiochem. The internal standards for quantitation of the sphingolipids by ESI-MS/MS were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Serum and medium were from Biofluids (Rockville, MD). G418 was obtained from Invitrogen. Other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture and Plasmids—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293, ATCC CRL-1573) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (17Le Stunff H.

Mammalian expression vectors for SPP-1, SphK1, SphK1-G82D, SphK2, and SphK2-G213E were described previously (7Maceyka M. Sankala H. Hait N.C. Le Stunff H. Liu H. Toman R. Collier C. Zhang M. Satin L.

Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed with premixed primer-probe sets using the ABI 7800 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Measurement of Mass Levels of Ceramide—HEK 293 cells (5 × 105) were seeded in 6-well poly-l-lysine-coated plates. Mass levels of sphingosine and ceramide and total phospholipids in cellular lipid extracts were measured essentially as described previously (10Le Stunff H. Peterson C. Thornton R. Milstien S. Mandala S.M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8920-8927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Ceramide levels are expressed as pmol/nmol phospholipids. Lipid Labeling—Cells were incubated with [3H]sphingosine (1 μCi/ml) or [3H]palmitic acid (10 μCi/ml) as indicated. After the indicated times and treatments, cells were scraped in 2× 600 μl of methanol/concentration of HCl (200:2, v/v). Extracts were sonicated and vortexed after addition of 600 μl of chloroform and 500 μl of H2O. Phases were then separated by addition of 600 μl of 2 m KCl and 600 μl of chloroform with vigorous vortexing. To analyze sphingolipids, an aliquot of the lipid extract (5 × 106 cpm) was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis in 0.2 m KOH in methanol for 2 h at 37°C to degrade glycerolipids prior to TLC separation with chloroform, methanol, 20 mm CaCl2 (60:20:4, v/v). For determination of ceramide, aliquots of the organic phases (5 × 106 cpm) were separated by TLC on silica gel plates developed in chloroform/acetic acid (9:1, v/v) (17Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Labeled phospholipids were also resolved by TLC with chloroform, methanol, 20 mm CaCl2 (60:20:4, v/v) as the developing solvent. Radioactive bands were quantified with a Bioscan AR-2000 scanner (Washington, D.

Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Sphingolipids and Metabolites—Cells were serum-starved for 18 h and incubated without or with sphingosine (5 μm) for the indicated time. Cells were then washed extensively with PBS and released by trypsinization. An aliquot of cells was taken for protein. To the rest, internal standards were added, lipids extracted, and individual ceramide acyl chain species quantified by liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, as described previously (27Sullards M.C. Merrill A.H. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : L1Google Scholar). Expression of SPP-1 Increases the Incorporation of Exogenous Sphingosine into Long-chain Ceramides—As was previously found in A549 lung carcinoma cells (28Ogretmen B. Pettus B.J. Rossi M.J. Wood R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12960-12969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), treatment of HEK 293 cells with C6-ceramide caused a significant increase in endogenous long-chain ceramide levels (Fig. 1A). However, this increase was not affected by expression of SPP-1 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, increased ceramide due to sphingosine treatment was drastically further elevated by overexpression of SPP-1 (Fig. 1A). The increase in ceramide levels in SPP-1-transfected cells was dependent on the concentration of added sphingosine (Fig. 1B) and was detected within 30 min (Fig. 1C), reaching a maximum after 2 h and remaining elevated for at least 6 h (Fig. 1C). One h of treatment with exogenous sphingosine followed by incubation in its absence reduced the increase in ceramide levels by 20 and 76% at 6 and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 1D). Incorporation of exogenous [3H]sphingosine into long-chain ceramides (C16-C18), and to a lesser extent into very long-chain ceramides (C24-C26), was increased in SPP-1-expressing cells compared with vector transfectants (Fig. 2A). Moreover, sphingosine addition to SPP-1-transfected cells predominantly increased levels of long-chain ceramide species as determined by conversion to ceramide 1-phosphates with diacylglycerol kinase (Fig. 2B). In agreement with our previous studies (17Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), very little incorporation of [3H]palmitate, a substrate for serine palmitoyltransferase, into ceramide was detected in the absence of exogenous sphingosine. However, sphingosine significantly increased incorporation into 3H-labeled C16-ceramide after 6 and 24 h, which was markedly enhanced by overexpression of SPP-1 (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that SPP-1, like its yeast counterpart Lcb3p (21Qie L. Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol.

We next examined the effects of SPP-1 on ceramide mass levels by high performance liquid chromatography ESI-MS/MS, as this is the method of choice to simultaneously determine the degree of saturation of the sphingoid base and the chain length of the fatty acids (29Merrill Jr., A.H. Sullards M.C. Allegood J.C. Kelly S. Wang E. Methods (San Diego). 2005; 36: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Treatment with sphingosine increased total ceramide mass in vector- and SPP-1-transfected cells by 1.6- and 3.5-fold, respectively. In agreement with previous studies (7Maceyka M. Sankala H. Hait N.C. Le Stunff H. Liu H. Toman R. Collier C. Zhang M. Satin L. Merrill Jr., A.H. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Exogenous sphingosine increased the mass of all ceramide acyl chain species, most obviously enhancing C16- and C18-cer-amides (Fig. 3A). It is also evident that when the subspecies distributions are compared in “donut” diagrams, treatment with sphingosine increased the proportion of long-chain ceramides, particularly C16 and C18, and reduced the proportion of very long-chain ceramides (C24:0 and C24:1). Cells overexpressing SPP-1 increased the incorporation of sphingosine into all ceramide acyl chain species, most notably enhancing the C16:0-, C18:0-, and C20:0-ceramides (Fig. 3, A and B). Cellular sphingosine levels measured by ESI-MS/MS were unaffected by expression of SPP-1, indicating that uptake of sphingosine was not altered (Fig. 3C). Moreover, as expected, when cells were treated with sphingosine, there were also increases in S1P mass (Fig. 3D). However, although uptake of sphingosine was unaffected by expression of SPP-1, levels of S1P were markedly decreased by its expression (Fig. 3D), consistent with its enzymatic activity. Involvement of Ceramide Synthase(s) in Ceramide Accumulation Induced by SPP-1—To determine whether the increase in long-chain ceramides results from enhanced de novo biosynthesis or salvage and recycling of sphingosine, cells were pretreated with myriocin (ISP1), a specific inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, the rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis or with fumonisin B1 (FB1), an inhibitor of dihydroceramide/ceramide synthases that acylate sphingoid bases. In SPP-1-expressing cells, ISP1 had no effect or even slightly increased incorporation of added sphingosine into ceramide (Fig. 4A), whereas FB1 significantly reduced the increase in ceramide levels resulting from treatment with exogenous sphingosine (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained when incorporation of sphingosine into ceramide was examined by [3H]palmitate labeling (Fig. 4C). The elevation of C16-ceramide was significantly attenuated by FB1 but not by ISP1 (Fig. 4C). Effect of SPP-1 on Ceramide Metabolism—There was an increase in the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into long-chain hexosylceramides and to a much lesser extent into sphingomyelin in vector- and SPP-1-transfected cells treated with sphingosine (Fig. 5A). Expression of SPP-1 potentiated the increase in labeled long-chain hexosylceramides (Fig. 5A). There was also an increase in total mass of hexosylceramides in SPP-1-transfected cells treated with sphingosine as determined by ESI-MS/MS. Analysis of subspecies of complex sphingolipids revealed that the increase was mainly in C16:0-, C18:0-, and C20:0-hexosylceramides (Fig. 5B). Because the total amount of sphingomyelin in cells is much greater than hexosylceramide or ceramide, overexpression of SPP-1 caused only small changes in sphingomyelin mass levels, as expected (Fig. 5C). To further substantiate that SPP-1 is involved in salvage and recycling of sphingosine back to ceramide and glycosphingolipids, cells were treated with (R,R)-(d-threo)-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), an analogue of glucosylceramide and a potent inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (34Shayman J.A. Lee L. Abe A. Shu L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PDMP augmented the elevated ceramide accumulation induced by sphingosine in SPP-1 transfectants (Fig. 6A). Similarly, incorporation of [3H]palmitate into C16-ceramide was also elevated (Fig. 6B), with a corresponding decrease of labeled long-chain hexosylceramides and a slight increase in [3H]sphingomyelin (Fig. 6C). As expected, FB1 not only decreased the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into ceramide (Fig. 4, B and C) but also into hexosylceramide induced by exogenous sphingosine (Fig. 6D). These results indicate that SPP-1 regulates recycling of sphingosine into long-chain ceramides, which are then further metabolized primarily to glycosphingolipids. SphK2 Acts in Concert with SPP-1 to Recycle Sphingosine to Ceramide—In yeast, a cycle of phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation is required for conversion of exogenous sphingoid bases to ceramide (24Funato K. Lombardi R. Vallée B. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7325-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine whether reutilization of sphingosine in mammalian cells proceeds similarly, the effects of SphK1 or SphK2 on SPP-1-mediated conversion of sphingosine to ceramide were examined. When SphK2 was co-expressed with SPP-1, basal ceramide levels were increased by 2-fold (Fig. 7A). In addition, co-expression of SphK2 and SPP-1 greatly increased the incorporation of exogenous sphingosine into ceramide, whereas co-expression with SphK1 did not potentiate the effects of SPP-1 (Fig. 7A). We next determined if the catalytic activity of SphK2 was required for these effects. Single point mutation of the second conserved glycine residue of the ATP-binding sequence of both SphKs resulted in a complete loss of sphingosine phosphorylating activity (11Johnson K.R. Becker K.P.

Expression of G82D-SphK1 or G231E-SphK2 did not significantly affect the increased ceramide levels induced by sphingosine in SPP-1-expressing cells (Fig. 7B), suggesting that incorporation of exogenous sphingosine mediated by SPP-1 requires enzymatically active SphK2. SphK2 expression has been shown to increase the levels of C16: 0-ceramide determined by ESI-MS/MS (35Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2005; 77: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In agreement, SphK2 also increased incorporation of [3H]palmitate into long-chain ceramides, especially in the presence of exogenous sphingosine (Fig. 7C). SphK2 also enhanced incorporation of exogenous sphingosine into ceramide stimulated by SPP-1 expression (Fig. 7, A and C). Moreover, transient expression of SphK2 also up-regulated the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into hexosylceramides, and to a lesser extent into sphingomyelin, in SPP-1-transfected cells treated with sphingosine (Fig. 7D).

Activation of caspase-9 by dimerization in apoptosomes then triggers a caspase signaling cascade. In addition, other apoptosis signaling molecules released from the mitochondrion, such as apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G, may induce caspase-9-independent apoptosis. To determine the signaling events induced by caspase-9, we used chemically induced dimerization for specific activation of caspase-9. We observed that caspase-9 dimerization resulted in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the cleavage of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. Moreover, cleavage-resistant Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 potently inhibited caspase-9-dependent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c.

In addition, double knock-outs of caspase-3 and caspase-7 also significantly delay the mitochondrial events during apoptosis (39Lakhani S.A. Masud A. Kuida K. Porter Jr., G.A. Booth C.J. Mehal W.Z.

However, the molecular mechanisms for caspases-3, -7, and -9 in mediating the mitochondrial events have not been resolved. In this study, we investigated whether specific engagement of caspase-9 could directly trigger the disruption of the mitochondrion. We utilized chemically induced dimerization for specific activation of caspase-9. We observed that dimerization of caspase-9 induced the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as the cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. Moreover, downstream effector caspases, including caspases-3, -6, and -7, may differentially regulate caspase-9-dependent cleavage of these anti-apoptotic molecules and mitochondrial events. Our data suggest a role for the caspase-9 signaling cascade in amplifying mitochondrial disruption through cleavage of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Cell Lines—Inducible caspase-9 (iCasp9) with caspase-9 protease domain fused to a modified FK506-binding protein and a5′ HA tag has been described previously (40Chen M. Orozco A. Spencer D.M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50761-50767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). H9 (ATCC) and Jurkat cells (clone E6-1, ATCC) were transfected with pcDNA3-iCasp9 by electroporation and selected with 0.5 and 1 mg/ml G418 (Cellgro), respectively. Three independent H9 or Jurkat clones were selected by limiting dilution, and no significant differences in caspase-9 signaling were observed between these clones. One H9-iCasp9 and one Jurkat-iCasp9 clones were used for subsequent experiments. AP20187 (41Fan L. Freeman K.W. Khan T. Pham E. Spencer D.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2273-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a dimeric FK506 analog (Ariad Pharmaceuticals) as the chemical inducer of dimerization (CID), was added to H9-iCasp9 or Jurkat-iCasp9 cells to induce dimerization and activation of caspase-9. Apoptosis Assays—For apoptosis assays, H9-iCasp9 or Jurkat-iCasp9 cells (105/well) were incubated in 96-well plates with the indicated concentrations of AP20187 or 40 μm etoposide (Sigma). Cells were cultured for 20 h, and the percentage of cell loss was determined by propidium iodide exclusion assays as described (40Chen M. Orozco A. Spencer D.M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50761-50767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Alternatively, iCasp9 or Jurkat-iCasp9 cells were cultured with 100 nm AP20187 for indicated times, followed by staining with FITC-annexin V and analysis by flow cytometry. RNA Interference—To make RNA interference constructs, heteroduplex oligonucleotides targeting different caspases were cloned into the pSUPERretro vector (OligoEngine). The forward oligonucleotides contained a 19-nucleotide targeting sequence, and its antisense sequence was separated by a 9-nucleotide spacer. After annealing to their reverse complementary oligonucleotides and cloning into the pSUPERretro vector, each pSUPER-RNAi vector was co-transfected with the corresponding caspase expression vector into 293T cells, followed by Western blot analysis to verify efficient suppression of targeted caspases. 4M. Chen, A. D. Guerrero, L. Huang, Z. Shabier, M. Pan, T.-H. Tan, and J. Wang, unpublished data. The pSUPER-RNAi vector was then transfected into H9-iCasp9 cells by electroporation, and stable transfectants were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Specific suppression of the targeted caspases in H9-iCasp9 cells was confirmed by Western blot analyses. The 19-nucleotide targeting sequences are as follows: caspase-2, ACAGCTGTTGTTGAGCGAA; caspase-3, TGACATCTCGGTCTGGTAC; caspase-6, CATGACAGAAACAGATGCC (42Rathore N. Matta H. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol.

Dominant-negative Caspase-9 Clones—cDNA encoding a protease-deficient caspase-9 (casp9dn) with a cysteine to serine substitution at Cys-315 of the protease-active site (40Chen M. Orozco A. Spencer D.M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50761-50767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was cloned into a pSH1 vector containing a puromycin resistance gene. This expression construct was transfected into H9 or Jurkat cells by electroporation. Stable H9 and Jurkat transfectants expressing casp9dn were selected with 0.5 and 1 μg/ml puromycin, respectively. The expression of casp9dn was confirmed by probing with anti-HA in Western blot (data not shown). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science, and 10 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD) on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were then used for SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then probed with various antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology), and developed with the Supersignal Dura substrate (Pierce). The following antibodies were used to probe different proteins in Western blot analyses: mouse monoclonal antibodies to caspase-2, caspase-7, caspase-9 (Cell Signaling), Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome c (BD Biosciences), caspase-6 (Medical & Biological Laboratories), FLAG (Sigma), HA1.1 (Covance), and polyclonal rabbit antibodies to Bak (Upstate Biotechnology), caspase-3, Bcl-xL (Cell Signaling), and Mcl-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Some blots were also probed with monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) (Abcam) to ensure equal loading. Analysis of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—iCasp9 cells were treated with CID or etoposide for different times, followed by incubation with 50 nm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 20 min to measure mitochondrial membrane potential. In some experiments, the cells were stained with Mitocasp dual sensor (Cell Technology) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. Briefly, after induction of apoptosis for various times, the cells were incubated with the mitochondrial membrane potential dye and FAM-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone in culture medium at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. In immunocytochemistry analyses, the cells were stained with 100 nm Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 20 min. The cells were then washed and added to polylysine-coated glass slides by cytospin. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, the slides were incubated with anti-cytochrome c (BD Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). The cells were then counterstained with DAPI using VectaShield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and visualized under a fluorescent microscope. Establishment of H9-iCasp9 Cells Expressing Wild Type or Cleavage-resistant Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1—Cleavage-resistant Bcl-2D/A mutant with Asp to Ala substitution at Asp-34 (D34A) and Bcl-xLD/A with D61A and D76A substitutions were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Mcl-1D/A with D127A and D157A substitutions was provided by Dr. Patrick Auberger (29Herrant M. Jacquel A. Marchetti S. Belhacene N. Colosetti P. Luciano F. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7863-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild type or cleavage-resistant Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 was fused to HA or FLAG tag and cloned into pSH1 plasmid containing a puromycin resistance gene. The vectors were transfected into H9-iCasp9 cells, and stable cell lines were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. The transfected cells were treated with CID for 6 h and stained with Mitocasp (Cell Technology), followed by flow cytometry analysis. Percentage of the loss of Δψm+ cells was calculated as follows: (control - treated sample)/control × 100%. Statistical significances were analyzed by Studentŉs t test using GraphPad Prism version 4 for Macintosh. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Subcellular Fractionation—Fractionation of cytosol and particulate fractions containing mitochondria was performed according to an established protocol (43Gottlieb R.A. Granville D.J. Methods (San Diego). 2002; 26: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells (106) were resuspended in 30 μl of homogenization buffer (75 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml digitonin) and incubated on ice for 5 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge 5417c. Supernatants were collected as cytosol and the pellets as the particulate fractions. The samples were used for Western blot analysis of cytochrome c. Activation of a Caspase Cascade by Dimerization of Caspase-9—Biochemical studies and crystal structural analyses suggest that caspase-9 is activated in apoptosomes through formation of caspase-9 dimers (7Srinivasula S.M.

Structure (Lond.). 2005; 13: 1725-1735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed iCasp9 by fusing the caspase-9 protease domain to a mutated FK506-binding protein to induce caspase-9 dimerization (40Chen M. Orozco A. Spencer D.M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50761-50767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A dimeric FK506 analog, AP20187, was used as a CID to dimerize iCasp9 (41Fan L. Freeman K.W. Khan T. Pham E. Spencer D.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2273-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Human leukemia H9 and Jurkat cells stably expressing iCasp9 were generated (Fig. 1A). Clones with the expression of iCasp9 at levels comparable with endogenous caspase-9 were selected (Fig. 1A). As expected, dimerization of iCasp9 induced rapid processing of iCasp9 and cell death in H9-iCasp9 and Jurkat-iCasp9 cells, but not in control H9 or Jurkat cells (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that chemically induced dimerization is suitable for inducing caspase-9 activation and apoptosis in these cell lines. Direct activation of caspase-9 by dimerization would bypass the requirement for the disruption of mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c to activate caspase-9. Consequently, dimerization of caspase-9 would lead to rapid activation of downstream caspases and apoptosis. Indeed, apoptosis manifestation could be detected by annexin V staining in H9-iCasp9 and Jurkat-iCasp9 cells after dimerization of caspase-9 for 2 h (Fig. 2A). Consistently, the activation of downstream effector caspases, including caspases-3, -6, and -7, as well as caspase-2, was detectable 1 h after dimerization of caspase-9 (Fig. 2B). We also expressed a caspase-9 with cysteine to serine mutation at the protease-active site as a dominant-negative mutant (casp9dn) to inhibit the signaling of endogenous caspase-9. As expected, treatments with etoposide induced the activation of caspases-2, -3, -6, and -7 in control H9 or Jurkat cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the activation of these caspases was inhibited by casp9dn (Fig. 2C). This suggests that the activation of caspases-2, -3, -6, and -7 was dependent on endogenous caspase-9. These results also indicate that chemically induced dimerization of caspase-9 mimics endogenous caspase-9 in inducing the activation of downstream caspases. A Caspase-9 to Caspase-3 Cascade in the Disruption of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm)—Caspases have been shown to contribute to mitochondrial disruption during apoptosis (32Susin S.A.

We observed that dimerization of caspase-9 induced rapid loss of Δψm in H9-iCasp9 cells, but not in H9 controls, by staining with a mitochondrial membrane potential dye, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (Molecular Probes) (Fig. 3). In contrast, the loss of Δψm was induced by etoposide in both H9-iCasp9 cells and H9 controls (Fig. 3). Similar results were observed in Jurkat-iCasp9 cells (Fig. 3). These results indicate that dimerization of caspase-9 could independently trigger the loss of Δψm. We also examined Δψm in H9-iCasp9 cells with Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes) in immunocytochemistry analyses. Consistent with the above studies, we observed that the staining of mitochondria with Mitotracker was decreased in H9-iCasp9 cells after dimerization of caspase-9 (Fig. 4A). In the untreated H9-iCasp9 cells, cytochrome c co-localized with Mitotracker staining (Fig. 4A). After treatment with CID, cytochrome c staining became diffused and did not co-localize with Mitotracker staining (Fig. 4A). Subcellular fractionation studies showed that cytochrome c was released into the cytosol after dimerization of caspase-9 (Fig. 4B). In addition, the disintegration of the nucleus was evident in H9-iCasp9 cells after dimerization of caspase-9 (Fig. 4A). By contrast, silencing of caspase-3 in H9-iCasp9 cells inhibited the loss of Mitotracker staining (Fig. 4A and Fig. 5A). Although caspase-9-induced diffusion of cytochrome c was observed in H9-iCasp9 cells with silencing of caspase-3, co-localization of cytochrome c with the mitochondria was still observed 8 h after caspase-9 dimerization (Fig. 4A). Consistently, significant inhibition of cytochrome c release into the cytosol by silencing of caspase-3 was observed in subcellular fractionation analyses (Fig. 4B). Also, caspase-9-induced nuclear disintegration was inhibited by silencing of caspase-3 (Fig. 4A). This suggests that a caspase-9 to caspase-3 signaling cascade mediates the loss of Δψm and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol in H9-iCasp9 cells.FIGURE 5Caspase-9-induced loss of Δψm after silencing of downstream caspases.A, H9-iCasp9 cells with the silencing of different caspases were lysed for Western blot analyses of caspases or tubulin. B, H9-iCasp9 cells with the silencing of downstream caspases were treated with 100 nm CID for 0, 3, 6, or 9 h. The cells were stained with Mitocasp and analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are representative of three independent experiments. RNAi, RNA interference; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also quantitated Δψm with MitoCasp dual sensor containing the mitochondrial membrane potential dye to measure Δψm and DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone to detect caspase activation (Cell Technology). The mitochondrial membrane potential dye contains a cationic mitochondrial dye that accumulates in intact mitochondria to emit red fluorescence (Cell Technology). Consistently, dimerization of caspase-9 induced the loss of Δψm in control H9-iCasp9 cells (Fig. 5B). This was accompanied by an increase in caspase activities shown by increased cleavage of DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone (Fig. 5B). Consistent with immunocytochemistry studies, silencing of caspase-3 significantly inhibited caspase-9-mediated loss of Δψm and caspase activation (Fig. 5, A and B). This suggests that caspase-3 is essential for caspase-9-induced loss of Δψm. In contrast, silencing of caspase-2 did not affect the caspase-9-mediated loss of Δψm or caspase activation (Fig. 5, A and B), whereas silencing of caspase-6 or caspase-7 partially inhibited the caspase-9-induced loss of Δψm as well as caspase activation (Fig. 5, A and B). This indicates that caspases-6 and -7 are involved in caspase-9-mediated disruption of the mitochondria and caspase activation, whereas caspase-2 is not required. A Critical Role for Caspase-3 in Caspase-9-induced Cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1—Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 have been shown to undergo caspase-dependent cleavage that inactivates their anti-apoptotic activities (24Cheng E.H.

We therefore investigated whether caspase-9 signaling could also mediate the cleavage of these anti-apoptotic molecules. We observed that dimerization of caspase-9 induced the cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 in H9-iCasp9 cells (Fig. 6A). In contrast, pro-apoptotic Bak or Bax was not cleaved in H9-iCasp9 cells (Fig. 6A). Consistently, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 were also processed in Jurkat-iCasp9 cells after dimerization of caspase-9 (Fig. 6A). The Jurkat-iCasp9 clone was derived from a Jurkat clone E6-1 (ATCC) that appeared to be deficient in Bax (Fig. 6A). Nevertheless, Bak was not processed in Jurkat-iCasp9 cells after dimerization of caspase-9 (Fig. 6A). These observations with H9-iCasp9 and Jurkat-iCasp9 cells suggest that dimerization of caspase-9 induces the processing of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. Because these anti-apoptotic molecules are important for protecting the integrity of the mitochondria, cleavage-induced inactivation of their anti-apoptotic functions potentially contributes to caspase-9-mediated loss of Δψm. Because silencing of downstream caspases differentially affected caspase-9-dependent loss of Δψm (Fig. 5), we examined whether these caspases were involved in the processing of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. Silencing of caspase-3 significantly inhibited the cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 after dimerization of caspase-9 (Fig. 6B), suggesting an essential role for the caspase-9 to caspase-3 signaling cascade in the cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. In contrast, silencing of caspase-2 had no effects on caspase-9-dependent processing of these molecules (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, silencing of caspase-6 or caspase-7 inhibited caspase-9-mediated processing of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1 (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that caspase-3 is required for caspase-9-mediated processing of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, whereas caspase-6 and caspase-7 are also involved in the processing of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Inhibition of the Loss of Δψm and Cleavage of Anti-apoptotic Molecules by a Dominant-negative Caspase-9—We further determined the loss of Δψm and the processing of anti-apoptotic molecules in H9 and Jurkat cells expressing the protease-deficient casp9dn. Compared with control H9 or Jurkat cells, etoposide-induced loss of Δψm was inhibited by the expression of casp9dn (Fig. 7A). This indicates that interference with endogenous caspase-9 inhibited the loss of Δψm during apoptosis. Similar to CID-induced dimerization of caspase-9 in H9-iCasp9 or Jurkat-iCasp9 cells, treatments with etoposide induced the processing of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 in H9 or Jurkat cells (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, expression of casp9dn inhibited the processing of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 in H9 and Jurkat cells (Fig. 7B). This suggests that endogenous caspase-9 is involved in the processing of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 during apoptosis either directly or indirectly. These results are consistent with our conclusions that caspase-9 could induce the loss of Δψm and the processing of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 (Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6). Inhibition of Caspase-9-mediated Loss of Δψm by Cleavage-resistant Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1—We next determined whether the cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 was indeed involved in caspase-9-dependent loss of Δψm.

Wild type or cleavage-resistant mutants of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 were transfected into H9-iCasp9 cells, and stable transfectants were generated (Fig. 8A). We noticed that Bcl-xLD/A and Mcl-1D/A migrated slightly faster than their wild type counterparts (Fig. 8A). This is potentially because of the replacement of two bulky aspartate residues with the smaller alanine in these mutants. As expected, these cleavage-resistant mutants were resistant to processing after dimerization of caspase-9 (Fig. 8B). These transfectants were then treated with CID to dimerize iCasp9. The cells were stained with the mitochondrial membrane potential dye (Cell Technology), and Δψm+ cells were then quantitated by flow cytometry. Overexpression of Bcl-2D/A, Bcl-xLD/A, or Mcl-1D/A potently inhibited caspase-9-induced loss of Δψm in H9-iCasp9 cells (Fig. 8C). Although wild type Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 also reduced caspase-9-induced loss of Δψm, the effects were weaker than those of their cleavage-resistant mutants (Fig. 8C). In addition, Bcl-2D/A, Bcl-xLD/A, and Mcl-1D/A were more efficient than their wild type counterparts in attenuating caspase-9-induced release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (Fig. 8D), as well as apoptosis (Fig. 8, E and F). This suggests that caspase-9-induced loss of Δψm, the release of cytochrome c, as well as cell death involve the cleavage of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. In this study, we observed that chemically induced dimerization of caspase-9 mimicked the activation of endogenous caspase-9 in inducing a downstream caspase cascade. Direct activation of caspase-9 by chemically induced dimerization would bypass the requirement for the disruption of the mitochondrion; however, a loss of Δψm was observed after dimerization of caspase-9. This suggests that caspase-9 could mediate feedback disruption of the mitochondrion. Caspase-9-induced loss of Δψm was accompanied by the cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. The balance between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic molecules determines whether a cell lives or dies (44Opferman J.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 inactivates the anti-apoptotic functions of these molecules, and their cleavage products may also be pro-apoptotic (24Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R.

Cleavage of a portion of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 will potentially disrupt the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules and induce cell death. We observed that cleavage-resistant mutants of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 potently inhibited caspase-9-mediated loss of Δψm as well as the release of cytochrome c. Our data suggest that caspase-9-mediated disruption of the mitochondrion involves the cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. Consistent with the loss of Δψm induced by dimerization of caspase-9, the use of a protease-deficient caspase-9 as a dominant-negative mutant also inhibited the loss of Δψm in H9 or Jurkat cells after treatments with etoposide. Moreover, the protease-deficient caspase-9 also suppressed the processing of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 after treatments of cells with etoposide, and this is consistent with the role for caspase-9 in inducing mitochondrial disruption through cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. To determine the roles of downstream caspases in caspase-9 signaling, we silenced individual effector caspases in H9-iCasp9 cells. Silencing of caspase-3 virtually blocked caspase-9-induced loss of Δψm, as well as the cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. Silencing of caspase-6 or caspase-7 also partially inhibited caspase-9-induced loss of Δψm and the cleavage of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. This suggests that caspase-3 plays an essential role in mediating caspase-9-induced loss of Δψm through cleavage of anti-apoptotic molecules, whereas caspases-6 and -7 also contribute to the loss of Δψm and promote the cleavage of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Although caspase-2 was activated after dimerization of caspase-9, silencing of caspase-2 did not affect caspase-9 in inducing the loss of Δψm or cleavage of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1. Therefore, caspase-2 does not appear to be required for caspase-9-mediated mitochondrial events. Although caspase-3 deficiency inhibited the loss of Δψm during apoptosis, additional caspase-7 deficiency led to more severe defects in the loss of Δψm (39Lakhani S.A. Masud A. Kuida K. Porter Jr., G.A. Booth C.J. Mehal W.Z. Inayat I. Flavell R.A. Science. 2006; 311: 847-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). This suggests that caspase-7 may play a nonredundant role in mediating mitochondrial disruption. However, unique molecular targets for caspase-7 in mediating the mitochondrial events remain to be identified. It has been well established that caspase-9 is an initiator caspase to trigger the activation of effector caspases for the execution of apoptosis. Our data indicate that caspase-9 may also serve as an amplifier of apoptosis by promoting feedback disruption of the mitochondrion. Effector caspases activated by caspase-9, including caspases-3, -6, and -7, may mediate such feedback regulation by cleaving anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1."

However, AS binding to phospholipid membranes leads to a distinct change in protein conformation, stabilizing an extended amphipathic α-helical domain reminiscent of the exchangeable apolipoproteins. To better understand the significance of this conformational change, we devised a novel bacteriophage display screen to identify protein binding partners of helical AS and have identified 20 proteins with roles in diverse cellular processes related to membrane trafficking, ion channel modulation, redox metabolism, and gene regulation. To verify that the screen identifies proteins with specificity for helical AS, we further characterized one of these candidates, endosulfine α (ENSA), a small cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein implicated in the regulation of insulin secretion but also expressed abundantly in the brain. We used solution NMR to probe the interaction between ENSA and AS on the surface of SDS micelles. Chemical shift perturbation mapping experiments indicate that ENSA interacts specifically with residues in the N-terminal helical domain of AS in the presence of SDS but not in aqueous buffer lacking SDS. The ENSA-related protein ARPP-19 (cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19) also displays specific interactions with helical AS. These results confirm that the helical N terminus of AS can mediate specific interactions with other proteins and suggest that membrane binding may regulate the physiological activity of AS in vivo. α-Synuclein (AS) is an intrinsically unstructured protein in aqueous solution but is capable of forming β-sheet-rich fibrils that accumulate as intracytoplasmic inclusions in Parkinson disease and certain other neurological disorders.

Upon prolonged incubation in aqueous solution, the protein forms amyloid fibrils rich in β-sheet secondary structure, reminiscent of the pathological fibrils found in Lewy bodies. However, in the presence of acidic phospholipid vesicles, the N terminus of AS folds into an amphipathic helical conformation that mediates membrane binding (13Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 14Perrin R.J. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic face of this helix, which is presumably exposed to the neuronal cytosol (16Jao C.C. Der-Sarkissian A. Chen J. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8331-8336Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), is highly conserved at the level of individual amino acids (10George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), suggesting that interactions with other binding partners have constrained its evolution.Conventional methods for identifying protein binding partners in solution (e.g. immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid screening) are unsuitable for study of interactions that depend on the helical conformation of AS. Under intracellular conditions, AS appears to be in dynamic equilibrium between membrane and cytosol, and there is thus no practical way to enrich for a particular conformation in vivo. We therefore developed a novel in vitro approach utilizing bacteriophage display to screen for proteins that bind selectively to AS in its lipid-associated helical conformation. Applying this method, we identified 20 human brain proteins that interact specifically with phospholipid-bound AS. One of these proteins, endosulfine α (ENSA), was chosen for further investigation because its small size (13 kDa) is compatible with solution NMR. To characterize the interaction between ENSA and AS in detail, we employed chemical shift perturbation mapping experiments that demonstrate a highly selective interaction between ENSA and specific residues in the N-terminal helical domain of AS. This observation was extended by demonstration of a similar interaction between AS and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19 (ARPP-19), a protein highly related to ENSA that is also enriched in brain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPhage Display—N-terminally His-tagged human AS protein was expressed in Escherichia coli via the vector pET28a (Novagen) and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Phospholipid vesicles (3:1 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidic acid) were prepared according to published protocols (14Perrin R.J. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F.

Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar); our previous studies indicate that stabilization of the AS helical domain requires acidic phospholipids and that helix content is specifically maximized by the inclusion of phosphatidic acid (13Davidson W.S.

Protein-vesicle complexes were incubated with T7 bacteriophage displaying cDNA from human brain (Novagen T7 Select). 1 × 107 plaque-forming units were incubated with 5 μg of vesicle-bound AS for 1 h at room temperature. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) were added, and the mixture was incubated end-over-end for 2 h at 4 °C. The suspension was poured into a column, and the beads were washed with 20 mm imidazole to remove unbound phage, followed by phospholipid vesicles (protein-free) to elute phage with specificity for 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidic acid vesicles. Finally, bacteriophage that bound to membrane-bound AS were eluted by the addition of purified AS-vesicle complexes. The eluates were pooled and amplified in E. coli and then subjected to three more cycles of biopanning. After the final round, the eluates were applied to an affinity column prepared with His-tagged AS alone, and the flow-through was collected to select for phage that did not bind to unstructured (lipid-free) AS. Individual bacteriophage clones were amplified and subjected to sequencing to identify the human brain protein sequences displayed by each.Recombinant Protein Expression—Human ENSA was cloned from the full-length phage clone into the vector pDEST17 (Invitrogen), which encodes the N-terminal His-tagged linker MSYYHHHHHHLESTSLYKKAGSAAAPFT. The ARPP-19 cDNA (Origene) was also cloned into pDEST17. Recombinant protein expression was induced with 0.2% arabinose at 30 °C for 3-4 h (ENSA) and 5 h (ARPP-19) and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's directions.An untagged ENSA construct was made in the vector pET21 (Novagen). Protein was expressed by induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C, followed by alkaline lysis, boiling, and precipitation with 60% ammonium sulfate. Precipitates were purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a HiPrep 16/10 Butyl Fast Flow Sepharose column (GE Biosciences) and eluted with decreasing salt. ENSA-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated and then subjected to high resolution gel filtration chromatography (HiPrep 16/160 Sephacryl S-200; GE Biosciences). Purity of recombinant ENSA, His-tagged ENSA, and His-tagged ARPP-19 proteins were confirmed by Coomassie staining. All proteins were shown to be immunoreactive with a chicken polyclonal antibody raised against full-length human ENSA (catalog number ab14297; Abcam) (Fig. 1). In addition, predicted molecular weights of recombinant proteins were verified by mass spectroscopy (data not shown).Full-length, untagged AS protein was produced for NMR experiments according to published procedures (18Kloepper K.D. Woods W.S. Winter K.A. George J.M. Rienstra C.M. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 48: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For isotopically labeled protein, cultures were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 2 g of [13C]glucose, 2 g of [15N]ammonium chloride, 10 mg of biotin, 10 mg of thiamine, and 10 ml of [13C,15N]Bioexpress (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA). The final steps of the purification (size exclusion chromatography and filtration (0.2 μm)) were performed immediately prior to NMR experiments in order to avoid the presence of oligomeric species of AS.NMR Spectroscopy—Solution NMR spectra were acquired at the VOICE NMR facility on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm, triple resonance (1H-13C-15N) triaxial gradient probe, using VNMRJ version 2.1B with the BioPack suite of pulse programs released in early 2006. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were measured typically for 2 h per spectrum, digitizing 512 complex points in the indirect 15N dimension (t1max = 232 ms). Further details specific to each spectrum are provided in the figure captions. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11388) Google Scholar) and analyzed in Sparky (20Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY3 Version 3.112. University of California, San Francisco, CA2005Google Scholar), using the previously established assignments of 15N and 1H chemical shifts of AS in the free (21Bussell R.J. Eliezer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45996-46003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and micelle-bound states (15Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 22Chandra S. Chen X. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The free state consisted of 0.2-0.5 mm 15N-labeled AS in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10% D2O, and 0.1% 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate as an internal chemical shift reference. The micelle-bound state of AS was prepared by the addition of SDS directly to the NMR tube, achieving a final concentration of at least 28 mm (i.e. a 140:1 molar ratio of SDS to AS, with the concentration of SDS significantly above its critical micelle concentration). The critical micelle concentration in 50 mm phosphate buffer at 25 °C was determined to be ∼2mm using isothermal titration calorimetry (data not shown). In all NMR experiments, the [15N]AS sample was examined in the unfolded state to confirm sample integrity; subsequently, SDS was added to prepare the micelle-bound state, and natural abundance partner proteins were titrated immediately thereafter. Control spectra of AS were highly reproducible and showed no evidence of aggregation, such as peak broadening, changes in chemical shifts as a function of time, or signal intensity losses.Partner Protein Titrations—For each partner protein, two series of titration experiments were performed. First, free [15N]AS was prepared as described above, and the control HSQC spectrum was acquired. To this, 0.2 mm AS solution (400 μl) and ∼40-μl aliquots of natural abundance partner protein (0.2 mm) were added. HSQC spectra were acquired at each step, up to the point at which AS and the partner protein had equal concentrations. Second, a fresh sample of [15N]AS was prepared in the micelle-bound state, the control HSQC spectrum was acquired, and titrations of the same partner protein (without additional SDS) were performed over a range of AS to partner protein ratios of 1:0 to 1:1. In a subset of the experiments, the order of addition was changed by first mixing the AS and partner protein in their free states and then adding an excess of SDS, and in yet another case, the partner protein (ENSA) was first bound to excess SDS before the addition to the AS-SDS solution. These procedures all resulted in HSQC spectra corresponding to the final step of the partner protein titration, which were identical to within the limit of statistical significance (∼0.01 ppm). The chemical shift perturbation integrating both changes in 1H and 15N chemical shifts was defined as δ = ([0.1 δN]2 + δ 2H)½, considering that the 15N shift covers a range ∼10 times that of 1H.RESULTSIdentification of Binding Partners of Helical α-Synuclein by Phage Display—Vesicle-bound AS was used to pan a human brain bacteriophage display library as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 3-5 rounds of selection, individual clones from the pool were amplified, and their inserts were determined by sequencing with primers flanking the insertion site in the gene encoding coat protein 10B. 338 bacteriophage clones were sequenced, of which 38 yielded readable in-frame sequences of identified human brain proteins. These 38 sequences represented 20 unique proteins, seven of which were isolated more than once and 13 that were single isolates.In Table 1, the candidates are sorted based upon the functional data available in the literature. Seven of these proteins have been reported previously to interact physically or functionally with AS under various conditions. These proteins include α-tubulin, the sequence isolated with the greatest frequency overall (six of 38 bacteriophage clones). Our laboratory has previously reported that AS binds monomers of α- and β-tubulin (23Payton J.E. Perrin R.J. Clayton D.F. George J.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 95: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and it was recently reported that AS binds monomeric tubulin and stimulates microtubule polymerization (24Alim M.A. Ma Q.L. Takeda K. Aizawa T. Matsubara M. Nakamura M. Asada A. Saito T. Kaji H. Yoshii M. Hisanaga S. Ueda K. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2004; 6: 435-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Like α-tubulin, septin 4 (also known as CDCrel-2) is a filament-forming G protein thought to function as a scaffolding protein for membrane/cytoskeleton interactions (reviewed in Ref. 25Spiliotis E.T. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar); septin 4 was shown to bind AS when the two proteins are co-expressed in cultured cells and to co-associate with AS in Lewy bodies (26Ihara M. Tomimoto H. Kitayama H. Morioka Y. Akiguchi I. Shibasaki H. Noda M. Kinoshita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24095-24102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Kinesin light chain 1S and dynein heavy chain I are components of microtubule motors critical for vesicular and organellar trafficking in neurons and other cells. Our identification of these proteins confirms a previous report by Utton et al. that AS interacts with complexes containing either dynein or kinesin-1 in neurons (27Utton M.A. Noble W.J. Hill J.E. Anderton B.H. Hanger D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4645-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As previously reported by Elkon et al. (28Elkon H. Don J. Melamed E. Ziv I. Shirvan A. Offen D. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2002; 18: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we find that AS binds to cytochrome c oxidase, the mitochondrial complex IV enzyme. FK506-binding proteins, members of the immunophilin protein family, were recently reported to stimulate fibril formation by α-synuclein (29Gerard M. Debyser Z. Desender L. Kahle P.J. Baert J. Baekelandt V. Engelborghs Y. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); one of these family members, FKBP52, was recovered in our screen. Of the remaining proteins in Table 1, only G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 has been reported to interact with AS in prior studies. G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 phosphorylates AS at serine 129, a modification that enhances AS inclusion formation in cell culture (30Smith W.W. Margolis R.L. Li X. Troncoso J.C. Lee M.K.

These may represent interactions that depend specifically on assumption of a lipid-dependent helical structure. Each of these interactions is worthy of specific study; here we focus on detailed characterization of the interaction with ENSA, the smallest protein in the set. ENSA was originally described as an endogenous ligand for the sulfonylurea receptor SUR1 (32Virsolvy-Vergine A. Leray H. Kuroki S. Lupo B. Dufour M. Bataille D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6629-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a subunit of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel. ENSA is abundant in the brain, where its expression is down-regulated in Alzheimer disease (33Kim S.H. Lubec G. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 310: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Down syndrome (34Kim S.H. Lubec G. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 2001; 61: 1-9Google Scholar).NMR Characterization of AS-ENSA Interactions—NMR chemical shift perturbation mapping experiments were undertaken to determine the conformation dependence and structural specificity of the interactions between AS and ENSA. First, we tested for interactions between nonhelical AS and ENSA. [15N]AS was prepared in aqueous buffer at ∼0.5 mm concentration. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was acquired and confirmed to be consistent with the unfolded state of AS as previously reported by Eliezer et al. (15Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 35Bussell R. Eliezer D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Superimposed on the spectrum of pure [15N]AS is the spectrum of [15N]AS with an equimolar quantity of ENSA. The peak positions throughout the spectrum remain essentially unchanged, with the exception of a portion of the C-terminal domain of AS, where some changes on the order of 0.01 ppm were observed. Elsewhere, changes in the spectra were within the random error of the chemical shift measurements (δ ∼0.01 ppm). Sources of uncertainty in the chemical shifts include slight changes in pH or buffer concentration; therefore, all of the protein solutions were prepared by dialysis against a common buffer solution to minimize such effects.FIGURE 3[15N]HSQC NMR spectra of ENSA interacting with AS. This interaction requires an anionic micelle. A, spectrum of 0.5 mm free AS (red) overlaid with the spectrum of the sample after the addition of ENSA in a 1:1 molar ratio (blue).

Although all six subunits function at the replication fork, only a specific subcomplex consisting of the MCM4, 6, and 7 subunits (MCM467) and not the MCM2-7 complex exhibits DNA helicase activity in vitro. To understand why MCM2-7 lacks helicase activity and to address the possible function of the MCM2, 3, and 5 subunits, we have compared the biochemical properties of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MCM2-7 and MCM467 complexes. We demonstrate that both complexes are toroidal and possess a similar ATP-dependent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding activity, indicating that the lack of helicase activity by MCM2-7 is not due to ineffective ssDNA binding. We identify two important differences between them. MCM467 binds dsDNA better than MCM2-7. In addition, we find that the rate of MCM2-7/ssDNA association is slow compared with MCM467; the association rate can be dramatically increased either by preincubation with ATP or by inclusion of mutations that ablate the MCM2/5 active site. We propose that the DNA binding differences between MCM2-7 and MCM467 correspond to a conformational change at the MCM2/5 active site with putative regulatory significance.

Cellular DNA is double-stranded, yet during DNA replication it must be separated into component single strands. Although DNA polymerases require a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 2The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; MCM, minichromosome maintenance protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). template for activity, they have little or no intrinsic ability to unwind double-stranded DNA (dsDNA; reviewed in Ref. 1Kawasaki Y. Sugino A. Mol. Cells. 2001; 12: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar). DNA unwinding requires an ATP-dependent molecular motor termed the replicative helicase (reviewed in Ref. 2Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the loading and activation of this helicase is a central and limiting event during DNA replication. Initiation culminates in replicative helicase loading, whereas the start of elongation requires extensive separation of duplex DNA by the helicase (reviewed in Refs. 3Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar and 4Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the critical importance of the replicative helicase, both its exact identity and mechanism remain controversial in eukaryotes. Numerous studies implicate the minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCMs) as the replicative helicase. The MCMs are evolutionarily conserved from archaea to eukaryotes, with the archaea usually having a single MCM gene (5Myllykallio H. Forterre P. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 537-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and eukaryotes having six distinct and essential MCM genes (reviewed in Ref. 6Forsburg S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Each MCM protein (numbered 2-7) is an AAA+ ATPase, whose members include DNA helicases such as SV40 large T antigen and the papilloma virus E1 protein (7Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Similar to prokaryotic replicative helicases (reviewed in Ref. 8McMacken R. Silver L. Georgopoulos C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimirium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1987: 564-612Google Scholar), the six MCM subunits are both physically present in initiation and elongation complexes and functionally essential for both phases of DNA replication, evidence strongly suggesting that all six MCM subunits unwind DNA at the replication fork (reviewed in Ref. 3Bell S.P.

Despite in vivo similarities to other replicative helicases, biochemical examination of the MCM complex has provided confounding results. Whereas the archaeal MCM proteins have robust helicase activity (9Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, a hexameric subcomplex that specifically contains MCM4, 6, and 7 (MCM467) possesses a weak helicase activity (13Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 15You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6148-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Despite the apparent dispensability of the MCM2, 3, and 5 subunits for in vitro helicase activity, their ATP active sites are essential in vivo. Mutational analysis of the Walker A ATP-binding motif indicates that all six MCM subunits require this motif for both viability and S phase progression (17Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 19Gomez E.B. Catlett M.G. Forsburg S.L. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro analysis of the corresponding MCM2-7 mutant complexes, however, indicates that the six MCM subunits fall into two functionally distinct subgroups (17Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The Walker A motif in the MCM4, 6, and 7 subunits is essential for ATPase activity, whereas the ATP-binding motifs of the MCM2, 3 and 5 subunits contribute little to steady-state ATP hydrolysis hydrolysis (17Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between the in vivo involvement of all six subunits in DNA replication and the in vitro participation of only a specific subgroup of MCM subunits in DNA unwinding remains unexplained. Recently, MCM2-7 has been isolated in vivo as part of a larger macromolecular complex having ATP-dependent helicase activity; this complex additionally contains the essential GINS complex and CDC45, suggesting that these factors are activators of MCM helicase activity (20Aparicio T. Ibarra A. Mendez J. Cell Div. 2006; 1: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although MCM467 has been extensively characterized biochemically, little work has been done with the MCM2-7 heterohexamer. To determine why the MCM2-7 complex lacks helicase activity, as well as to elucidate the function of the MCM2, 3, and 5 subunits, we have undertaken a comparative analysis of the ssDNA binding activity of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MCM2-7 and MCM467 complexes. Our studies with MCM2-7 indicate that its lack of DNA helicase activity is not due to an inability to bind ssDNA, because both complexes have similar ssDNA binding affinities. However, we find an important difference between these complexes in ssDNA association rates. Because these two complexes differ in subunit composition (i.e. MCM2, 3, and 5), the functional difference between them suggests that the additional subunits regulate the manner in which the MCM2-7 complex interacts with DNA. Buffers and Reagents—Buffers used include B1 (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 m sodium chloride, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA)), B2 (25 mm potassium-HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 μm zinc acetate, 100 μm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol), B3 (25 mm potassium-HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 μm zinc acetate, 100 μm EDTA, 10% glycerol), and B4 (25 mm sodium-HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 μm zinc acetate, 100 μm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA). 1× TBE contains 90 mm Tris base, 90 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, adjusted to pH 8.0 with HCl. Radiolabeled nucleotides were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences or MP Biomedical, and unlabeled ATP was obtained from GE Healthcare. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA; supplemental Table S1). Polynucleotide substrates were from GE Healthcare or Sigma. Nucleotide and DNA concentrations were calculated from absorbance at 260 nm. All other reagents were of the highest available purity. Proteins and Purification—Hexameric MCM2-7 and MCM467 complexes were expressed and purified as described (17Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The presence of individual MCM subunits were either directly visualized following separation by SDS-PAGE (for MCM6, 3, and 5) or using Western blot analysis with subunit-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz anti-MCM2 (sc-6680) and anti-MCM7 (sc-6688) and anti-MCM4 monoclonal antibody (AS6.1). 3A. Schwacha and S. Bell, unpublished observations. MCM subcomplexes were purified similar to the hexameric complexes and were made using specific mixtures of recombinant baculoviruses that each encode the desired MCM subunits, with one MCM subunit containing a C-terminal His tag to facilitate metal chelate chromatography. SV40 large T-antigen was expressed in insect cells and purified as a C-terminal His-tagged protein; details are available upon request. All of the proteins were dialyzed against B2 buffer containing 100 mm potassium chloride and protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were quantified using a Fuji FLA-5100 laser imager on SDS-PAGE-separated protein bands stained with Sypro orange (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) using known amounts of BSA as a standard; protein concentrations unless otherwise noted are in pmol or nm of hexamer. MCM genes containing the Walker A (KA) or arginine finger (RA) alleles were completely sequenced to verify the constructs and used to make MCM complexes in a manner identical to the wild type complexes (17Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Helicase Assay—The helicase assay was performed essentially as described (21Kaplan D.L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49171-49182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, synthetic replication forks were prepared by annealing an equimolar mixture of oligonucleotides 233 and 235 (supplemental Table S1) and then filling in the resulting 5′ overhang with [32P]dATP in the presence of the other dNTPs using reverse transcriptase. The resulting forks were then gel-purified from an 8% native acrylamide gel following electroelution into a dialysis membrane, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended to a concentration of ∼1 μm in 1× TE. The reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, stopped by the addition of unlabeled oligonucleotide 235 to 20 nm, proteinase K to 4 mg/ml, SDS to 0.4%, and a one-tenth volume of 10 × stop-load (25% w/v Ficoll (type 400), 100 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol) and heated at 50 °C for 20 min. The samples were then separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel at room temperature. The gel was subsequently dried, and the results were imaged and quantified using Fuji FLA-5100 phosphorimaging and Image Gauge software. Double Filter Binding Assay—The DNA double filter binding assay was based on the work of Wong and Lohman (22Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose (BA85; Schleicher & Schuell) and DEAE-cellulose (DE81, Whatman) filters were prepared as described. The ssDNA substrates were 5′ radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The dsDNA substrate was made by annealing an equimolar amount of nucleotide 510 to oligonucleotide 806 (supplemental Table S1), which was extended using exo- Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) in the presence of unlabeled dNTPs spiked with [α-32P]dATP. Standard ssDNA binding reactions contained 4 nm of unlabeled nucleotide substrate spiked with a small quantity of 32P labeled substrate, 120 nm MCM hexamer, 5 mm of either ATP or ATPγS, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate all in 1× buffer B2 with a final volume of 12.5 μl. The reactions were incubated for 30 min (unless otherwise indicated) at 30 °C and then spotted onto a filter stack and quickly washed with an additional 500 μl of B2. After filtration using a FH 225V Filter Manifold (GE Healthcare), the nitrocellulose and DEAE membranes were separated and quantified by scintillation counting. The amount of DNA bound was calculated using Equation 1, DNAbound=CNCCNC+CDEAE(Eq. 1) where CNC and CDEAE are the radioactive counts retained on the nitrocellulose and DEAE membranes, respectively. The data points represent the averages of ≥3 repeats of the same experiment, and the error bars correspond to the standard deviations. The association kinetics were plotted as described (23Riggs A.D. Bourgeois S. Cohn M. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 401-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 24Winter R.B. Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6961-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) using Equation 2, 1(R)−(O)ln(O)[(R)−(RO)](R)[(O)−(RO)]=kat where (R) and (O) are the total concentrations of MCM and ssDNA, respectively, and (RO) is the concentration of the MCM·ssDNA complex at time t. Magnetic Bead Binding Assay—Streptavidin-coated Dynabeads (M280, Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo, Norway) were prepared per the manufacturerŉs instructions. Biotinylated oligonucleotide 455 (supplemental Table S1) was immobilized on the beads in buffer B1 for ≥30 min at 22 °C, and the oligobound beads were separated by a magnet and washed to remove unbound oligonucleotide. Experiments using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide indicate that about 90 pmol of oligonucleotide were bound per 1 mg of beads. For each binding experiment, 20 μl of beads were used. Following equilibration in buffer B3, the beads were resuspended in 25-μl reactions containing B3, protein, and nucleotide as indicated and incubated for ≥30 min at 22 °C. The beads were separated from unbound reaction components with a magnet, washed once with 50 μl of either B3 or B3 supplemented with additional sodium chloride as indicated, resuspended in 10 μl B3, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Sypro orange staining as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Binding reactions contained protein as indicated, 4 nm of radiolabeled oligonucleotide 3 (supplemental Table S1), and 5 mm ATPγS. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and then separated by electrophoresis at 4 °C through a prechilled 3.5% native polyacrylamide gel (30:1 acrylamide:bis containing 0.5× TBE, 5% glycerol, 67 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10 mm magnesium acetate) using 0.5× TBE running buffer supplemented with 80 μg/ml BSA and 10 mm magnesium acetate at 15 volts/cm. Protein·ssDNA complexes were imaged and quantified using Fuji FLA-5100 phosphorimaging. MCM2-7 and MCM467 Form Toroidal Complexes of Differing Helicase Activity—Hexameric preparations of S. cerevisiae MCM2-7 and MCM467 were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified to homogeneity (supplemental Fig. S1). Gel filtration and co-immunoprecipitation of the final preparations demonstrated that the complexes retained their hexameric size as was observed previously (17Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and these preparations contained approximately equal stoichiometry of the specified MCM subunits as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and quantitative Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S1). As described below, these preparations demonstrated an ATP-dependent ssDNA binding activity; the average specific activity of our preparations for this activity is ≥50% of total protein (supplemental Fig. S1). Using transmission electron microscopy, the MCM2-7 and MCM467 preparations appear largely homogeneous (Fig. 1A), with many individual complexes having a diameter (top) and height (side) of ∼145 Å and an apparent central cavity 25-30 Å wide. Examination of hundreds of complexes from both preparations demonstrates that 20-30% appear as ring-shaped structures, with about half containing six distinct lobes (Fig. 1A, small insets). Image reconstruction of the ring-shaped structures indicates that both complexes are of similar size and have pseudo 6-fold symmetry (Fig. 1A, large insets). These results are consistent with the published size and toroidal subunit organization of both eukaryotic MCM complexes (25Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M.

Although the MCM467 complex displays ATP-dependent helicase activity (Fig. 1B, lanes 4-7) similar to that of the SV40 large T antigen helicase (lane 3), MCM2-7 displays no appreciable DNA unwinding (lane 8) and has an activity comparable with MCM467 in the presence of ATPγS (lane 7). The difference in helicase activity between these two complexes reconfirms previous results (13Ishimi Y. J. Biol.

ATP-dependent ssDNA Binding Activity of the MCM Complexes—The ability of each MCM preparation to bind a short mixed sequence oligonucleotide (85 nt, oligonucleotide 510; supplemental Table S1) using a filter binding assay was examined. Both complexes demonstrate ATP-dependent ssDNA binding as a function of either MCM or ssDNA concentration (Fig. 2, A and B). Little ssDNA binding occurs in the absence of ATP (data not shown) or in the presence of GTP (Fig. 2A). This interaction requires ATP binding but not hydrolysis; the poorly hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS (17Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) stimulates the extent of ssDNA binding for both complexes relative to ATP (Fig. 2A). Further, this binding activity is MCM-dependent, because it is abolished upon preincubation of either the MCM2-7 or MCM467 complex with a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the Walker B site in each MCM subunit (antibody AS1.1; data not shown (32Claycomb J.M. MacAlpine D.M. Evans J.G. Bell S.P. Orr-Weaver T.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)). 4A. Schwacha and J. Bowers, unpublished observations. These data fit a hyperbolic function, consistent with a homogeneous population of molecules demonstrating noncooperative binding. Repeats of this assay with shorter probes (oligonucleotides 3 (44 nt) and 775 (40 nt); supplemental Table S1) generate similar results (data not shown). MCM phosphorylation appears to have little effect on ssDNA binding. Neither treating the complexes with lambda phosphatase to remove phosphorylation that may occur during insect cell expression nor adding phosphates with a recombinant preparation of CDC28/CLB5 (a gift from S. P. Bell, Massachusetts Institute of Technology) appreciably alters ssDNA binding levels (data not shown). From these graphs, an apparent Kd for ssDNA binding can be determined; using either ATP or ATPγS, both MCM complexes have a Kd of ∼35 ± 15 nm. The independent Kd values calculated from either the binding as a function of [MCM] (Fig. 2A) or [ssDNA] (Fig. 2B) are in good agreement (supplemental Table S2). These values are in the range of those previously observed for MCM467 (apparent Kd of ∼2nm using a 37-mer oligonucleotide (26Sato M. Gotow T. You Z. Komamura-Kohno Y. Uchiyama Y. Yabuta N. Nojima H. Ishimi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)) and the archaeal MCM complex (apparent Kd of ∼150-200 nm using a fork substrate (33Barry E.R. McGeoch A.T. Kelman Z. Bell S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 988-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)) and are typical of hexameric helicases (60 pm to 200 nm (2Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar)). ATP-dependent ssDNA binding was further examined as a function of nucleotide concentration (Fig. 2C). Both MCM complexes have similar ATP dependences (the k½(ATP) values for MCM2-7 and MCM467 being 248 ± 152 and 177 ± 82 μm, respectively) with maximal ssDNA binding coinciding with physiological ATP concentrations (∼3mm (34Traut T.W. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar)). The nucleotide specificity of ssDNA binding by both MCM complexes was also tested (Fig. 2D). The triphosphate form of adenosine is needed to promote ssDNA binding, because neither ADP, AMP, dADP, nor any non-adenosine nucleotide support this activity (Fig. 2D). The Identity of MCM Subunits within the MCM·ssDNA Complexes—The protein requirements for ssDNA binding were examined next. Filter binding experiments using various MCM subcomplexes demonstrated little or no ssDNA binding; however, when these subcomplexes were combined to generate either a MCM467 (MCM4/6 dimer + MCM7 monomer) or MCM2-7 (MCM2/4/6 trimer + MCM3/5/7 trimer) complex, high levels of ssDNA binding were recovered (data not shown and Fig. 3A). These results indicate that ssDNA binding is not an intrinsic property of any individual subunit but requires considerable oligomerization of MCM subunits. The only subcomplex that demonstrated substantial ssDNA binding was a MCM pentamer lacking MCM6 (Fig. 3A). This subcomplex is largely present as a variety of split ring structures rather than a closed toroid as visualized by electron microscopy (data not shown) and illustrates that although higher order MCM oligomerization is required for ssDNA binding, closure of the ring structure is not. To identify the MCM subunits that stably associate with ssDNA, binding experiments were performed using magnetic streptavidin beads coupled to biotinylated ssDNA (Fig. 3B). Following the addition of either the MCM2-7 or MCM467 complexes, the beads were washed in buffers of increasing salt concentration, and the proteins retained on the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by either silver staining (Fig. 3B) or Western blotting to identify co-migrating MCM subunits (data not shown). In both cases, all input MCM subunits were retained on the beads in a ssDNA-dependent manner, strongly consistent with the notion that intact MCM hexamers bind ssDNA. Furthermore, these interactions are stable in moderate concentrations of salt as observed for MCM complexes on chromatin isolated during S phase (stable to >250 mm (35Coue M. Amariglio F. Maiorano D. Bocquet S. Mechali M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)), in contrast to the salt-sensitive chromatin binding observed during the G1 phase (35Coue M. Amariglio F. Maiorano D. Bocquet S. Mechali M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Edwards M.C. Tutter A.V. Cvetic C. Gilbert C.H. Prokhorova T.A.

To examine the oligomeric state of the MCM·ssDNA complexes, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used (Fig. 3C). The ability of MCM complexes to bind ssDNA in this assay varies widely; several studies only observe a shift of MCM467 in the presence of a cross-linking agent (15You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol.

Biol. 2005; 21: 529-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Proteins are targeted to this complex by hydrophobic signal sequences (3von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), and the signals and subsequent hydrophobic segments of the polypeptide are integrated into the bilayer as transmembrane helices. The translocon consists of Sec61α (Sec61p in yeast) with 10 transmembrane domains, and the single spanning proteins Sec61β (Sbh1p) and Sec61γ (Sss1p), corresponding in bacteria to SecY/SecG/SecE. The crystal structure of the SecY complex of the archaebacterium Methanococcus jannaschii (4den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) revealed a compact helix bundle that can form a hydrophilic channel with a lateral exit site. The central passage is blocked by a lumenal plug domain and a central constriction ring. To open, the plug needs to move out, and the ring must expand (5Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6Saparov S.M. Erlandson K. Cannon K. Schaletzky J. Schulman S. Rapoport T.A. Pohl P. Mol.

Cell. 2007; 129: 97-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggest that the translocation channel is formed by a single heterotrimer, although it has been proposed that upon opening of the channel two or more complexes may cooperate (8Alder N.N. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22787-22790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9Mitra K. Schaffitzel C. Shaikh T. Tama F. Jenni S. Brooks C.L. 3rd Ban Frank N. Nature. 2005; 438: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The simplest case of protein topogenesis is the orientation of a signal sequence upon entering the translocon. Cleavable signal sequences assume a Ncyt/Cexo orientation (cytoplasmic N and exoplasmic C terminus), whereas noncleavable signal-anchors of membrane proteins insert in Nexo/Ccyt or Ncyt/Cexo direction to translocate either their N- or their C-terminal end, respectively. Best established is the role of charged residues on either side of the hydrophobic core of the signal, which according to the “positive-inside rule” (10von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) generally results in the more positive end to be cytosolic. Additional determinants are the folding of sequences N-terminal to an internal signal that may sterically hinder N-translocation (12Denzer A.J. Nabholz C.E. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the hydrophobicity of the apolar signal core (13Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Rösch K. Naeher D. Laird V. Goder V. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14916-14922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Analysis of model proteins with very hydrophobic N-terminal signal-anchors and positive N-terminal flanking charge indicated that the signal initially enters the translocon to produce an Nexo/Ccyt orientation followed by inversion (16Goder V. Spiess M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Inversion appeared to be driven by charge interactions and to be slowed down by hydrophobic interactions of the signal core with the translocon or the membrane. At which point in the process, the plug domain moves out of its lumenal binding cavity is not known. Systematic mutation of conserved charged residues in Sec61p identified three residues that affected model protein topogenesis as predicted by the positive-inside rule (17Goder V. Junne T. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar): Glu382 at the cytoplasmic-end of transmembrane segment TM8 and Arg67 and Arg74 in the plug domain. Additional mutations in the plug domain, including its complete deletion, all prove viable without growth defect, but show the same effect on signal orientation (22Junne T. Schwede T. Goder V. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The plug deletion was partially defective in co- and post-translational translocation and appeared to be inefficient in Sec61 complex assembly. To obtain more insight into the mechanism of topogenesis, we now used a screen to isolate mutations in Sec61p that influenced the orientation of diagnostic signal-anchor proteins. We identified 18 single-residue mutations that could be grouped into three classes with distinct effects on topology. One of them, also including all known plug mutations and the full plug deletion, showed suppression of signal sequence mutations, i.e. a prl phenotype, as previously observed only in prokaryotes (18Emr S.D. Hanley-Way S. Silhavy T.J. Cell. 1981; 23: 79-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 19Veenendaal A.K. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Smith M.A. Clemons Jr., W.M. DeMars C.J. Flower A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6454-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, prlA mutations in SecY were isolated as altering protein localization of proteins with mutated signal sequences. In view of the translocon structure and supported by experimental data, prlA effects are explained by destabilization of the closed state of the translocon and facilitated pore opening (4den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 5Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6Saparov S.M. Erlandson K. Cannon K. Schaletzky J. Schulman S. Rapoport T.A. Pohl P. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6454-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The close correlation between a prl phenotype and a specific effect on signal orientation thus sheds light on the role of translocon gating in the process of protein insertion. Yeast Strains and Model Protein Constructs—Yeast strain VGY61 (17Goder V. Junne T. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) corresponds to RSY1293 (matα, ura3-1, leu2-3, -112, his3-11,15, trp1-1, ade2-1, can1-100, sec61::HIS3, [pDQ1]) (21Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) in which pDQ1 (i.e. YCplac111 (LEU2 CEN) containing SEC61 with codons 2-6 replaced by codons for H6RS and with its own promoter) was exchanged for YCPlac33 (URA3 CEN) with the same SEC61 gene. This made it possible to introduce mutant sec61 in YCplac111 (LEU2 CEN) by plasmid shuffling using 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5FOA). VGY61 with a disruption of SSH1 is described previously (17Goder V. Junne T. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Sec61p mutant strains with the mutations L63N, L66N, L70N, the triple mutation LLLNNN, the deletions ΔL70, Δtip (residues 67-72 replaced by a glycine), and Δplug (residues 52-74 replaced by a glycine) have been reported previously (22Junne T. Schwede T. Goder V. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Model constructs 40[Leu16](+5), 60[H1](+1), and [Leu16](-3) (shown schematically in Fig. 1) were described previously (17Goder V. Junne T. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and expressed in pRS426 (URA3 2 μm) with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) promoter. Constructs 40[H1](+5) and 60[H1](+5) were generated in the same manner using the signal-anchor of H1-4 and H1-3, respectively. Construct 40[H1](+5)LacZ (Fig. 1) was made by inserting the sequence encoding residues 10-1024 of E. coli β-galactosidase (LacZ) preceded by the linker GLINGACDP between the carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) segment and the triple-HA tag of 40[H1](+5). This construct with a GPD promoter and phosphoglycerate kinase terminator was cloned into the TRP1 integration vector pRS404 and integrated into trp1-1 of VGY61 to produce the screening strain. To analyze membrane insertion of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAPB), CPY, invertase, and α-factor, the coding sequences of DAP2, PRC1, SUC2, and MFα1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fused to a C-terminal triple-HA epitope tag. Signal sequence truncations were produced by PCR using mutagenic primers. Codons 34-235 of ATP2p (the β subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase, deleting the leader peptide) and codons 1-200 of Gal1p (cytosolic galactokinase) were fused to a sequence encoding EFNNSTEMMMMMACYPYDVPDYAGYPYD-VPDYAYPYDVPDYA with a glycosylation site (in bold) and triple-HA tag (underlined), producing Atp2pΔ-g and Gal1pΔ-g, respectively. To test the glycosylation tag, codons 1-80 of H1 including its signal-anchor were fused in front of the Atp2p construct (H1Atp2pΔ-g). These constructs were cloned into pRS426 with a GPD promoter. Mutagenesis of Sec61p and Library Construction—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using appropriate mutagenic primers and Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Random in vitro mutagenesis of SEC61 was performed by error-prone PCR using 0.1 μg of template plasmid, 150 pmol of each primer, and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 400 μm MgCl2, 300 μm MnCl2. Four sets of primers were designed to amplify four quarters of ∼350 bp of the coding sequence delimited by unique restriction sites: XbaI, SacI (created by a silent mutation), StuI, AccI, and BamHI (introduced after the stop codon) at nucleotide positions 27, 343, 710, 1099, and 1470 from the initiation codon, respectively. For each segment, four parallel PCR reactions with three dNTPs at 200 μm and the fourth at 40 μm were performed (30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 46 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C) and the products gel-purified, pooled, digested with the restrictions enzymes for the flanking sites, gel-purified, and ligated into pDQ1SacBam (pDQ1 with the additional SacI and BamHI sites). Upon electroporation into E. coli DH5α, ∼40,000 colonies were obtained for each mutagenized segment, scraped into medium, incubated at 37 °C for 10 h followed by purification of the plasmid DNA. Screening Procedure—The four plasmid libraries were transformed into the screening strain, grown for 4 days at 30 °C on SD-Leu plates, replica-plated on 5FOA plates, and grown for 2 days at 30 °C to select cells that had lost the wild-type SEC61 URA3 plasmid. Resistant colonies were replica-plated onto YPD with adenine (YPDA), incubated for 1 day at 30 °C, overlaid with 0.5%-agarose in 0.5 m KHPO4, pH 7, containing 0.1% SDS, and 400 μg/ml X-gal (Applichem) and incubated for 6 h at 30 °C and then at 4 °C for further color development. For each segment library, ∼3000 colonies were screened. Colonies with darker or lighter color were streaked on YPDA plates, and the color assay was repeated. Plasmids were rescued by the procedure of Robzyk and Kassir (23Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), amplified in DH5α, transformed into VGY61, selected on SD-Leu, and replica-plated on plates containing 5FOA to eliminate the wild-type SEC61 plasmid. The plasmids encoding the model constructs were separately transformed into the resulting strains. Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Yeast cells were in vivo pulse-labeled for 5 min with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (GE Healthcare), lysed with glass beads, heated at 95 °C for 5 min with 1% SDS, cleared by centrifugation, subjected to immunoprecipitation, and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (22Junne T. Schwede T. Goder V. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Signals were quantified by phosphorimager. Competition between Wild-type and Mutant Sec61p—To analyze the stability of Sec61p mutants in the presence of wild-type Sec61p, the sec61 coding sequences were extended by a sequence encoding a triple-HA epitope tag, cloned with the original promoter into YCplac111 (LEU2 CEN), transformed into VGY61, and grown on SD-Leu-Ura to maintain both wild-type and HA-tagged mutant copy of Sec61p. Cells were lysed in SDS-sample buffer with glass beads, boiled for 10 min, separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and decorated with a rabbit antiserum against the C terminus of Sec61p, a gift by C. Stirling (University of Manchester, UK; 24Stirling C.J. Rothblatt J. Hosobuchi M. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), or with an anti-HA antibody. Antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). A Screen for Sec61p Mutations Affecting Protein Topology—To identify mutations in Sec61p that affect membrane protein topogenesis, we devised a screen based on the color reaction catalyzed by the model protein 40[H1](+5)LacZ (Fig. 1). It is a derivative of the asialoglycoprotein receptor H1, a type II single-spanning membrane protein. Because of inversion of the flanking charges of its signal-anchor sequence (resulting in a charge difference Δ(C-N) of +5 according to 11), it inserts with mixed orientations into the ER membrane (25Beltzer J.P. Fiedler K. Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Handschin C. Wessels H.P. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 973-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is thus a sensitive reporter of alterations affecting topology. The C-terminal sequence was replaced by a segment of yeast CPY and the coding sequence of bacterial β-galactosidase (LacZ), which is active in the cytosol but inactive, when translocated. Mutations in Sec61p that affect the membrane orientation of 40[H1](+5)LacZ result in changes in enzyme activity detectable using the color substrate X-gal. The coding sequence of Sec61p was mutagenized by errorprone PCR and transformed on a CEN plasmid with its own promoter into the yeast strain VGY61 with a chromosomally integrated 40[H1](+5)LacZ gene. After elimination of the wild-type copy of SEC61, colonies were analyzed for LacZ activity. Colonies deviating in color intensity from the background of colonies with wild-type Sec61p were picked, and the plasmids were isolated and transformed into VGY61 cells expressing 40[H1](+5) without the LacZ domain (construct A in Fig. 1). Upon elimination of wild-type SEC61, the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and construct A was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In this manner, 29 Sec61 plasmids from a total of ∼12,000 transformants were identified to produce an increase and 46 to produce a decrease in glycosylated, i.e. C-terminally translocated, forms of construct A. Upon sequencing, 18 single point mutations were identified to affect the topology of construct A. Sec61p Mutations Display Distinct Topology Effects—The effects of these mutants as well as of R67E, R74E, and E382R analyzed previously (17Goder V. Junne T. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and I91T (one of four mutations in Sec61-23; 21) on topology were tested for the five model proteins shown in Fig. 1. Construct B is identical to A except for the hydrophobic core of the signal-anchor that consists of a Leu16 stretch instead of the natural transmembrane segment of H1. Upon expression in yeast cells, three forms were produced corresponding to the protein without glycans or with two or three glycans (17Goder V. Junne T. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because the glycosylation sites are in the C-terminal domain, the glycosylated species represent polypeptides with a Ncyt/Cexo orientation. In cells expressing wild-type Sec61p, 40% of construct A and 46% of construct B were glycosylated (22 and not shown). In cells expressing mutant Sec61p, this fraction was either increased or reduced as summarized in Fig. 2. The effects were essentially the same for constructs A and B, indicating that the hydrophobic cores of the two signals were handled identically. No singly glycosylated forms were detectable for any mutant (data not shown) indicating that glycosylation efficiency was not affected by the mutations. The signal-anchors of constructs A and B have a positive charge difference Δ(C-N) typical of proteins with a Nexo/Ccyt orientation. Based on studies in mammalian cells (12Denzer A.J. Nabholz C.E. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Beltzer J.P. Fiedler K. Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Handschin C. Wessels H.P. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 973-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they insert with mixed topologies because the 40-amino acid N-terminal domain of H1 hinders N-translocation. In construct C, this domain was in part replaced by the N-terminal translocated sequence of Ste2p, resulting in reduced C-translocation with wild-type Sec61p (12%). All Sec61p mutants that increased C-translocation of A and B, also did so for C (Fig. 2). Those that reduced C-translocation of A and B showed no significant effect, most likely because construct C was close to minimal C-translocation already with wild-typeSec61p. With a reduced charge difference Δ(C-N) of +1, i.e. with two positive flanking charges at the N- and three positive charges at the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain, construct D was again at the center of the diagnostic range (60% C-translocation with wild-type Sec61p; 22), and all mutant translocons affected the ratio of orientations. Except for mutants W35R, T185K, and P200L, they did so in the same direction as with constructs A and B (Fig. 2). With the Ste2p sequence at the N terminus of constructs C and D, an efficient N-glycosylation site was introduced so that polypeptides integrated into the ER membrane in either orientation were glycosylated: two or three times when the C terminus was translocated, and once when the N terminus was translocated. The appearance of unglycosylated products thus revealed polypeptides that were not integrated into the membrane. When expressed in cells with wild-type Sec61p, 5.3% (±1.4%, n = 8) of construct D were unglycosylated (17Goder V. Junne T. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Except for P292S, which generated ∼25% nonintegrated products, none of the mutants produced more than 10% of this form, indicating that they did not cause a significant defect in membrane integration. Finally, model protein E differs from all others in that its signal-anchor is at the very N terminus (Fig. 1). Despite a negative charge difference of -3, this protein is inserted with ∼30% Ncyt/Cexo orientation by wild-type Sec61p, because of its highly hydrophobic signal-anchor (22Junne T. Schwede T. Goder V. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Many Sec61p mutants also affected the insertion behavior of this protein, mostly by reducing C-terminal translocation (Fig. 2). In our analysis, as summarized in Fig. 2, the observed changes in model protein orientation versus wild-type Sec61p generally ranged from 5 to 20% age points and are therefore in the range that is also observed for single charge mutations flanking the signals of substrate proteins (17Goder V. Junne T. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on their effects on the different model proteins, the mutants could be grouped into three classes. Class 1 mutants consistently increased translocation of the more positively charged end of the signal-anchor of all substrates tested. This corresponds to the phenotype of a weakened positive-inside rule. The plug deletion and all other plug mutants previously prepared by directed mutagenesis also belong to this class (22Junne T. Schwede T. Goder V. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, class 3 mutants generally reduced C-translocation. Class 2 mutants only differed from class 3 in having the opposite effect on substrate D. Translocation Efficiency and Stability of Mutant Translocons—In addition to Sec61p, Sbh1p, and Sss1p, yeast expresses a second nonessential translocon complex consisting of Ssh1p (Sec61 homolog), Sbh2p, and Sss1p (26Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In Δssh1 cells lacking the second translocon, topology changes by mutations D61N, W35R, and Q93R (as representatives of the three classes) were essentially the same 4T. Junne and M. Spiess, unpublished observations. , as previously shown for R67E, R74E, and E382R (17Goder V. Junne T. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). None of the Sec61p mutants displayed a growth defect at 30 °C (not shown) or at 39 °C even in the absence of Ssh1p (Fig. 3). Mutations I91T and P292S were cold sensitive and showed reduced growth in the presence of tunicamycin, which caused protein misfolding and ER stress (Fig. 3). I91T thus is responsible for the phenotype of Sec61-23, from which it is isolated. None of the other mutations showed sensitivity to cold or tunicamycin stress. Efficiency of translocation was tested using CPY and DPAPB (Fig. 4A), established post- and co-translational substrates, respectively (27Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), for all mutants including the plug mutations prepared previously. Most mutants are as efficient in translocation as wild-type Sec61p. Exceptions are P292S and the full plug deletion Δplug that produces significant levels of unglycosylated CPY and DPAPB. A post-translational translocation defect was in addition observed for I91T and most severely, the partial plug deletion Δtip. We previously observed that Δplug competes poorly with wild-type Sec61p for limiting factors in a heterozygous situation (22Junne T. Schwede T. Goder V. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When coexpressed with wild-type Sec61p, HA-tagged Δplug was hardly detectable in steady state by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4B, lane 30). In contrast, all HA-tagged point mutants were present in similar amounts as HA-tagged wild type in the presence of untagged wild-type Sec61p (Fig. 4B, lanes 1-29). These results show that the full plug deletion has additional defects compared with the point mutations in the plug or elsewhere. These are most likely the result of joining the lumenal ends of TM1 and TM2 by a very short connection and so immobilizing them in fixed relative position. Class 1 Topology Effects Correlate with a prl Phenotype—The mutations affecting topology are listed in Table 1, and their locations are indicated in the structure model of the yeast Sec61 complex in Fig. 5. Most mutated residues are well conserved between species. The mutations are not limited to a single domain of the protein, but are found throughout the sequence. New mutations were found in the plug domain (D61N) and in TM2 facing the plug (E79G). Plugs destabilizing mutations as well as partial or complete deletion of the plug have previously been shown to affect topology with class 1 effects (22Junne T. Schwede T. Goder V. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In our screen, mutations were also isolated in three of the six residues forming the central constriction ring (I86T, T185K, and M450K). Several mutations are concentrated where TM2 contacts TM8 (I91T, Q93R, Q96R, T379I, and E382R) and two mutations (K284E and E460K) disrupt the ion-bridge connecting the cytosolic ends of TM7 and TM10.TABLE 1Summary of Sec61p mutant phenotypesMutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec61paSingle amino acid mutations in S. cerevisiae Sec61p isolated in the topology screen are listed in the upper portion of the table together with point mutations generated previously (in italics).

https://openalex.org/W2083682157,"Constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB pathway by the Tax oncoprotein plays a crucial role in the proliferation and transformation of HTLV-I infected T lymphocytes. We have previously shown that Tax ubiquitylation on C-terminal lysines is critical for binding of Tax to IkappaB kinase (IKK) and its subsequent activation. Here, we report that ubiquitylated Tax is not associated with active cytosolic IKK subunits, but binds endogenous IKK-alpha, -beta, -gamma, targeting them to the centrosome. K63-ubiquitylated Tax colocalizes at the centrosome with IKK-gamma, while K48-ubiquitylated Tax is stabilized upon proteasome inhibition. Altogether, these results support a model in which K63-ubiquitylated Tax activates IKK in a centrosome-associated signalosome, leading to the production of Tax-free active cytoplasmic IKK. These observations highlight an unsuspected link between Tax-induced IKK activation and the centrosome."
https://openalex.org/W2062406075,"The FoxM1 transcription factor plays critical roles in the expression of genes that are essential for cell proliferation. FoxM1 null or depleted cells fail to progress through mitosis, as expression of several mitotic genes depends upon FoxM1. The transcriptional activity of FoxM1 is stimulated by cyclin-cdk-mediated phosphorylation at a site within the transcriptional activation domain. Here, we characterize the role of an N-terminal inhibitory domain in the transcriptional activity of FoxM1. Deletion of the N-terminal 232 amino-acid residues increases the transcriptional and transforming activities of FoxM1. Moreover, while the activity of the full-length FoxM1 is stimulated by growth factors, the activity of the N-terminal deletion mutant is constitutively high in all phases of the cell cycle. The N-terminal deletion also eliminates the requirement for cyclin-cdk to activate FoxM1. We provide evidence that the N-terminal domain interacts with the C-terminal half of the transcription factor to attenuate its transcriptional activity. Moreover, the N-terminal fragment inhibits the transcriptional activity of FoxM1 in G1/S cells, but not in G2/M cells. Our results suggest that cyclin-cdk phosphorylates FoxM1 to counteract the inhibition by the N-terminal domain to fully activate FoxM1 in G2/M phase."

The functions of the encoded proteins were screened in vitro and in a heterologous Escherichia coli system with plasmids conferring biosynthesis of the phycocyanobilin chromophore and of the acceptor proteins β-phycoerythrocyanin (PecB) or β-phycocyanin (CpcB). CpcT1 is a regioselective biliprotein lyase attaching phycocyanobilin exclusively to cysteine β155 but does not discriminate between CpcB and PecB. The in vitro reconstitutions required no cofactors, and kinetic constants were determined for CpcT1 under in vitro conditions. No lyase activity was found for the lyase homologues CpcS2 and CpcT2, but complexes are formed in vitro between CpcT1 and CpcS1, CpcT2, or PecE (subunit of phycoviolobilin:α-phycoerythrocyanin isomerase lyase). The genes coding the inactive homologues, cpcS2 and cpcT2, are transcribed in N-starved Nostoc. In sequential binding experiments with CpcT1 and CpcS1, a chromophore at cysteine 84 inhibited the subsequent attachment to cysteine 155, whereas the inverse sequence generates subunits carrying both chromophores."

Current work utilized metabolic labeling in cultured cells expressing wild type GFP-NHERF-1 to define the physiological importance of NHERF-1 phosphorylation. Treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A and okadaic acid enhanced NHERF-1 phosphorylation and inhibited its dimerization. Eliminating C-terminal serines abolished the modulation of NHERF-1 dimerization by phosphatase inhibitors and identified the phosphorylation of the PDZ1 domain that attenuated its binding to physiological targets, including β2-adrenergic receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and sodium-phosphate cotransporter type IIa. The major covalent modification of PDZ1 was mapped to serine 77. Confocal microscopy of cultured cells suggested key roles for PDZ1 and ERM-binding domain in localizing NHERF-1 at the cell surface. The substitution S77A eliminated PDZ1 phosphorylation and increased NHERF-1 localization at the cell periphery. In contrast, S77D reduced NHERF-1 colocalization with cortical actin cytoskeleton. These data suggested that serine 77 phosphorylation played key role in modulating NHERF-1 association with plasma membrane targets and identified a novel mechanism by which PDZ1 phosphorylation may transduce hormonal signals to regulate the function of membrane proteins in epithelial tissues.

Subsequent studies suggested a stable association of NHERF-1 with NHE3 in cells, and the contribution of NHERF-1 phosphorylation to hormonal control of NHE3 remains unknown. Subsequent studies identified additional NHERF-1 targets (9Voltz J.V. Weinman E.J. Shenolikar S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6309-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).β2-Adrenergic receptor (β2AR) bound NHERF-1 in agonist-dependent manner and competed with NHE3 for NHERF-1 binding and paradoxically activate NHE3 in some tissues (10Hall R.A.

Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Moreover, GRK-5 catalyzed the phosphorylation of β2AR within the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif to attenuate NHERF-1 binding and direct receptor internalization and degradation in lysosomes (11Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). These studies not only suggested a potential competition among PDZ targets for NHERF-1 binding but also pointed to a dynamic association of NHERF-1 controlled by ligand binding or receptor phosphorylation. However, no role for NHERF-1 phosphorylation has been established in the internalization and recycling of this or other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (12Weinman E.J. Hall R.A. Friedman P.A.

Unlike β2-AR, CFTR docked with both PDZ1 and PDZ2, and thus, a single NHERF-1 molecule could assemble a CFTR dimer (16Li J. Dai Z. Jana D. Callaway D.J. Bu Z. J. Biol.

Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9620-9625Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These studies provided the first hints that NHERF-1 phosphorylation may regulate the assembly and function of cellular NHERF complexes. However, serine 162 is not conserved in NHERF-1 from other species, and the physiological relevance of serine-162 phosphorylation remains to be established. Ligand-induced receptor dimerization and mitogenic signaling by the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) is enhanced by NHERF-1 binding (19Maudsley S. Zamah A.M. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8352-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and a complex of PDGFR with NHERF-1 and ERM proteins may regulate actin cytoskeleton and cell migration (20Takahashi Y. Morales F.C. Kreimann E.L. Georgescu M.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because PDGFR showed a preference for PDZ1, it was postulated that a NHERF-1 homodimer facilitated PDGFR signaling. However, later studies showed that PDGFR, like CFTR, could bind both PDZ1 and PDZ2 (21Morales F.C. Takahashi Y. Momin S. Adams H. Chen X. Georgescu M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that a monomeric NHERF-1 may also stabilize the ligand-bound PDGFR dimer. However, PDGFR signaling was unexpectedly enhanced rather than impaired in NHERF-1 null MEFs. This suggested quite a different role for NHERF-1, namely to promote the assembly of a complex containing PDGFR and PTEN, a phosphoinositide phosphatase that attenuates mitogenic signaling (20Takahashi Y. Morales F.C. Kreimann E.L. Georgescu M.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because PTEN also showed a preferential binding to PDZ1, it still remains unclear whether monomeric or dimeric NHERF-1 regulates PDGFR signaling. It is noteworthy that binding of many PDZ1 targets, including β2-AR and PDGFR, enhanced NHERF-1 dimerization in vitro (19Maudsley S. Zamah A.M. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

In this regard, a number of studies have shown that phosphorylation of NHERF-1 by GRK-6A, Cdk-2, and PKC in vitro modulated NHERF-1 dimerization (23Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N.

Structure-function studies of monomeric NHERF-1 also noted an intramolecular interaction of a C-terminal PDZ motif at the NHERF-1 terminus with PDZ2 (18Li J. Poulikakos P.I. Dai Z. Testa J.R.

On the other hand, NHERF-1 phosphorylation at a major C-terminal site (serine 289) that also enhanced dimerization appears to be constitutive (23Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N.

Finally, mass spectrometry of rat NHERF-1 expressed in HEK293 cells identified additional phosphorylations whose physiological role still remains to be investigated. The current studies focused on the analysis of NHERF-1 phosphorylation in cells with the goal of identifying covalent modifications that regulate the assembly of cellular complexes. Metabolic labeling of cells treated with the phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid, and calyculin A established that C-terminal phosphorylation of NHERF-1 inhibited its dimerization. Elimination of three major C-terminal sites identified a phosphorylation of PDZ1 domain of NHERF-1. Biochemical studies showed that the phosphorylation, which occurred at serine 77, attenuated NHERF-1 binding to several PDZ1 targets. Altered localization of mutant NHERF-1, specifically S77A and S77D, suggested a key role for association of PDZ1 targets for NHERF-1 localization at the plasma membrane and suggested a novel mechanism for hormonal regulation of NHERF-1-associated membrane processes in polarized epithelial cells. NHERF-1 Expression Plasmids—Human NHERF-1 cDNA was excised from plasmid encoding HA-tagged human NHERF-1 (26Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8572-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and inserted in-frame into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). GFP-D1 was generated by digesting GFP-NHERF-1 with SacI, the cDNA encoding amino acids 1-150 was religated into pEGFP-C2, and its orientation was verified by direct sequencing in the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center DNA sequencing facility. GFP-D2 was generated by digesting GFP-NHERF-1 with SacI and KpnI and inserted into pEGFP-C3 to yield GFP fused to amino acids, 151-358, of NHERF-1. For ΔERM, site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce stop codon at amino acids 331. NHERF-1 cDNAs with the individual PDZ-binding sequences, PNGYGF, modified to HNGAGA (the P to H substitution was fortuitous), were cloned into pET30a and pEGFR-C1. Serines 279, 289, and 301 were substituted with alanines using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit). Plasmids encoding hexahistidine-tagged NHERF-1, D1, and D2 were previously described (22Shenolikar S. Minkoff C.M. Steplock D.A. Evangelista C. Liu M. Weinman E.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transfection of Cultured Cells—COS7, HEK293, and NIH3T3 were maintained in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Transfections of plasmid DNA (1 μg) were performed in 6-well plates (Falcon) using 5 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in serum-free DMEM. After 3 h, the cells were restored to DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cell Treatment and Immunoblotting—Twelve to sixteen hours following transfection, the cells were treated for 20 min with okadaic acid (OA) or calyculin A (CalyA) obtained from Alexis. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine). The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes blocked in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 and 4% (w/v) dried milk were incubated overnight with antibodies at 4 °C, and immune complexes were detected by Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Metabolic Labeling with [32P]Orthophosphate—The cells (106/ml) were incubated in 6-well plates containing DMEM lacking phosphate with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. After 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were incubated with phosphate-free medium containing 500 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h. Following exposure to phosphatase inhibitors (see above), the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. The cell lysates were incubated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech) for 1 h at 4 °C, and immune complexes were isolated using 1:1 mixture of protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad) and protein G-agarose (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were analyzed by autoradiography (Kodak MR x-ray film) or phosphorimaging. Parallel gels were immunoblotted for protein expression using anti-GFP antibodies (Chemicon; 1:5000 dilution).

Gutmann, Washington University) were transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21, and bacteria were grown in 500 ml of LB medium at 37 °C until A600 between 0.6 and 0.8. Protein expression was induced by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) for 3 h. The bacteria were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm glutathione, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 15 min. Eluates, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, were stored at 4 °C. The protein concentration was estimated using Bio-Rad protein assay (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). NHERF-1 Dimerization—Cells transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-NHERF-1 proteins were lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 50 mm NaCl, and cell debris was removed at 1,000 × g for 30 min. Purified His-NHERF-1 proteins were incubated with cell lysates for 1 h at 4 °C before the addition of NTA-agarose (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and the bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western immunoblotting with anti-hexahistidine antibody (Sigma) and anti-GFP antibody monitored the association of His- and GFP-NHERF-1. NHERF-1 Binding by Cellular Targets—Lysates containing GFP-NHERF-1 were incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant GST fusion proteins for 30 min at 4 °C. The mixtures were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, and the beads were washed extensively prior to elution with SDS sample buffer and SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-GFP. Activity of GFP-NHERF-1—Prior studies used untagged (28Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and His-NHERF-1 (29Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) to transduce cAMP signals that inhibited NHE3 activity in PS120/NHE3V cells. Because GFP represented a larger (approximately 27 kDa) protein fusion that could potentially compromise NHERF-1 function, we analyzed the ability of GFP-NHERF-1 (expressed at various levels) to mediate cAMP inhibition of NHE3 in PS120-NHE3V cells. NHE3 activity in PS120-NHE3V cells expressing the highest levels of GFP-NHERF-1 was inhibited 40-50% by 10 μm Fsk. (supplemental Fig. S1). Comparison at different protein expression levels suggested that GFP-NHERF-1 was functionally indistinguishable from untagged or His-NHERF-1 (Fig. 1). Treatment of PS120/NHE3V with GFP-NHERF-1 with 100 nm CalyA, a cell-permeable phosphatase inhibitor, achieved similar inhibition of NHE3 (supplemental Fig. S1). These studies showed that PKA activation or phosphatase inhibition resulted in a similar decrease in NHE3 activity. The combined effects of CalyA and Fsk were similar to either agent alone, suggesting a common mechanism for NHE3 inhibition. NHERF-1 Dimerization in Cells—Prior studies used okadaic acid to inhibit NHERF-1 dimerization in cells (22Shenolikar S. Minkoff C.M. Steplock D.A. Evangelista C. Liu M. Weinman E.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because okadaic acid displayed significant cytotoxicity in some cells, we re-evaluated NHERF-1 dimerization by coexpressing HA-NHERF-1 and His-NHERF-1 in PS120 cells (Fig. 2) treated with either vehicle or 100 nm CalyA. Although equal amounts of His-NHERF-1 bound NTA-agarose from control and CalyA-treated cells, HA-NHERF-1 cosedimented with His-NHERF-1 was greatly reduced (75-80%) by 100 nm CalyA. No detectable HA-NHERF-1 bound NTA-agarose when cells did not also express His-NHERF-1. Comparison of cells expressing His- and HA-ΔPDZ1/2 showed that the mutant protein dimerized effectively, and its dimerization was also inhibited by CalyA. This suggested that NHERF-1 dimerization and modulation by phosphatase inhibitors did not require functional PDZ domains. To identify NHERF-1 domains required for CalyA-regulated dimerization, we modified the above assay. Lysates of cells expressing WT GFP-NHERF-1 were incubated with defined quantities of recombinant His-NHERF-1, and GFP-NHERF-1 was sedimented using NTA-agarose (Fig. 3). WT GFP-NHERF-1 expressed in COS-7 cells (or HeLa cells; data not shown) migrated as two bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). The upper band represented phosphorylated NHERF-1 as it was completely eliminated by incubation of NHERF-1 complexes bound to NTA-agarose with calf intestinal phosphatase (or bacteriophage λ phosphatase; data not shown). Pulldowns with full-length or truncated (D1 and D2) His-NHERF-1 showed that they preferentially bound the lower unphosphorylated or less phosphorylated form of GFP-NHERF-1. These data suggested that NHERF-1 dimerization in cells was mediated by both D1 and D2 regions and was inhibited by phosphorylation. Moreover, GFP-NHERF-1 binding by all three baits was inhibited 75-80% by CalyA. Prior studies identified three major phosphorylated serines, 279, 289, and 301, near the C terminus of NHERF-1 that modulated dimerization (24He J. Lau A.G. Yaffe M.B. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41559-41565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8572-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We expressed GFP-AAA, a fulllength NHERF-1 with alanines substituted in place of serines 279, 289, and 301. Compared with WT-NHERF-1, GFP-AAA migrated as a single polypeptide, suggesting that phosphorylation of one or more of these C-terminal serines generated the slower migrating form of NHERF-1. In pulldowns, GFP-AAA bound His-NHERF-1 (Fig. 3B), but treatment of cells with CalyA resulted in little or no diminution of GFP-AAA bound by His-NHERF-1. Thus, inhibition of NHERF-1 dimerization was mediated by CalyA-induced phosphorylation of some or all of these C-terminal serines. Calyculin A Induced PDZ1 Phosphorylation—For direct analysis of CalyA-induced phosphorylation, COS7 cells expressing GFP-NHERF-1 were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. GFP-NHERF-1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP and immunoprecipitates subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 4A) or phosphorimaging. As previously seen in HEK293 and PS120 cells (23Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24328-24334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 30Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6123-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), full-length NHERF-1 is extensively phosphorylated in COS7 cells under basal conditions. NHERF-1 phosphorylation was further increased 1.5-2-fold in cells treated with CalyA with maximum 32P-labeling occurring between 10 and 100 nm CalyA. Substitution of alanines in place of serines 279, 289, and 301 eliminated the basal phosphorylation of GFP-AAA. However, when cells were exposed to 100 nm CalyA, the phosphorylation of GFP-AAA was readily visible. GFP-D2 was highly phosphorylated in untreated cells, and its phosphorylation was moderately increased when cells were treated with 100 nm CalyA, consistent with the presence of the C-terminal serines 279, 289, and 301. By comparison, GFP-D1 showed no detectable basal phosphorylation but was phosphorylated only in response to 100 nm CalyA. OA differs from CalyA in the inhibition of type I and type II serine/threonine phosphatases in being a more potent inhibitor of type 2 phosphatases. Metabolic labeling of COS7 cells treated with increasing concentrations of OA showed that GFP-D1 phosphorylation was enhanced between 1 and 10 μm OA (Fig. 4B) to a level similar to 100 nm CalyA. The data suggested that GFP-D1 phosphorylation was most likely reversed by type I protein serine/threonine phosphatase that required OA concentrations higher than 1 μm for effective inhibition. Because 100 nm CalyA lacked the cytotoxicity seen with micromolar concentrations of OA, subsequent analyses of GFP-D1 phosphorylation utilized cells treated with CalyA. Calyculin A-stimulated Phosphorylation Sites in PDZ1—NHERF-1 is a phosphoprotein, whereas its structural homologue, NHERF-2, is not. There are 6 serines and threonines in NHERF-1 D1 region, and some within the PDZ1 domain are also conserved in NHERF-2 (Fig. 5A). We substituted alanines in place of serines 2, 46, 77, and 143 and threonines 71 and 95, whereas serine 143 was eliminated by the C-terminal truncation, Δ140 (Fig. 5A). Mutant GFP-D1 proteins were expressed in COS7 cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence of 100 nm CalyA. Immunoblotting with anti-GFP established equivalent expression of all GFP-D1 peptides. Autoradiography of anti-GFP immunoprecipitates showed that eliminating serines 2 and 46 and threonine 71 had no significant effect on the in vivo labeling of GFP-D1 (Fig. 5B). By comparison, T95A and Δ140 consistently showed 10-20% reduced phosphorylation compared with WT GFP-D1. Most strikingly, the in vivo phosphorylation of S77A was reduced 75-85%, identifying serine 77, uniquely present in PDZ1 of NHERF-1, as the major site of CalyA-induced phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Serine 77 Attenuates Binding of PDZ1 Targets—To assess the function of CalyA-induced phosphorylation, GFP-D1 was sedimented from lysates of cells treated with CalyA using recombinant GST-βAR encompassing the C terminus of β"
https://openalex.org/W2155934484,"Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes play a central role in cellular signaling. Levels of PKC control the amplitude of agonist-induced signaling and alterations in these levels are associated with disease states, most notably cancer, yet mechanisms that control the turnover of the protein are poorly understood. Here we identify an E3 ligase that catalyzes the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PKC. Specifically, we identified a RING finger domain-containing protein, RINCK (for RING-finger protein that interacts with Ckinase) from a yeast two-hybrid screen using the amino terminus of PKCβ as bait. RINCK encodes a protein of 581 amino acids that contains a RING finger domain, a B-box, and two coiled-coil regions, the three domains that form the signature motif of the large family of diverse TRIM (tripartite motif) proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using tsA201 cells reveal that RINCK and PKC associate with each other in cells. Studies using fragments of PKCβ reveal that this interaction is mediated by the C1A domain of PKC. RINCK induces the ubiquitination of PKC both in vitro and in cells. Overexpression of RINCK reduces the levels of PKC in cells, whereas genetic knockdown of endogenous RINCK increases the levels of PKC. This increase was observed for all PKC isozymes examined (including conventional, novel, and atypical). The RINCK-mediated degradation of PKC occurs independently of the classic phorbol ester-mediated down-regulation: genetic depletion of RINCK had no effect on the phorbol ester-mediated down-regulation and, additionally, up-regulated the levels of isozymes that cannot bind phorbol esters.

Phosphorylation controls the stability of PKC, thus setting the signaling amplitude in pathways controlled by PKC. Binding of lipid second messengers to its regulatory domains reversibly controls the acute propagation of PKC signals, thus setting the gain (1Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Chronic activation of PKC, as occurs with phorbol esters, results in its ultimate degradation, a process referred to as “down-regulation” (2Parker P.J. Bosca L. Dekker L. Goode N.T. Hajibagheri N. Hansra G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies characterizing both the phorbol ester-mediated down-regulation of PKC and the effect of phosphorylation on protein stability, the molecular mechanisms controlling the degradation of PKC are poorly understood. PKC levels are altered in a variety of diseased states, most notably cancer (3Clark A.S. West K.A. Blumberg P.M. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 780-786PubMed Google Scholar, 4D'Costa A.M.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8905-8911Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), underscoring the importance of understanding how the lifetime of the protein is controlled. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a major role in controlling protein degradation in the cell and mounting evidence points to a key role in controlling the lifetime of signaling molecules such as protein kinases (8Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Conjugation of ubiquitin, a 76-residue polypeptide, on Lys residues of target proteins proceeds via three sequential steps: activation of ubiquitin by an activating enzyme E1, transfer of ubiquitin to a conjugating enzyme E2, and transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate facilitated by the ubiquitin ligase E3 (9Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar, 10Pickart C.M. Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Specificity is dictated by the E3 ligase, which recognizes specific determinants on both the substrate and the E2 enzyme (11Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). E3s fall into two major classes, those containing a HECT domain and those containing a RING domain. HECT domain E3 ligases participate in the catalytic step by forming a thioester intermediate during ubiquitin transfer, whereas RING E3 ligases serve as a scaffold to bring together the substrate and the E2 and do not participate in the catalytic step. The RING domain is an ∼70-residue globular domain with defined spacing of Cys and His residues to coordinate two zinc ions that maintain the fold of the domain (9Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar); this module binds E2. PKC comprises a family of 10 isozymes, grouped into conventional (α, γ, and two C-terminal splice variants, βI and βII), novel (δ, ϵ, η, θ), and atypical (ζ, ι/λ) isozymes based on their cofactor dependence. All isozymes contain a C1 domain, a membrane-targeting module that binds phosphatidylserine and, in the case of all but the atypical isozymes, binds diacylglycerol/phorbol esters. Novel PKCs and conventional PKCs also contain a C2 domain; this domain serves as a Ca2+-regulated membrane-targeting module in conventional PKC isozymes. PKC isozymes are processed by a series of ordered phosphorylations that converts all family members into mature, stable species. Impairment of this processing results in rapid degradation of PKC by an as yet unidentified quality control pathway. For example, PKC isozymes are depleted in cells lacking the upstream kinase that initiates the ordered phosphorylations, the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK-1 (12Balendran A. Hare G.R. Kieloch A. Williams M.R. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition to unprocessed PKC, the ligand-activated form of PKC is highly sensitive to dephosphorylation and degradation (13Hansra G. Garcia-Paramio P. Prevostel C. Whelan R.D. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Most notably, constitutive activation of PKC by phorbol esters leads to the eventual down-regulation of phorbol estersensitive PKCs by a process that requires the intrinsic activity of PKC (14Jaken S. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2175-2181PubMed Google Scholar, 15Solanki V. Slaga T.J. Callaham M. Huberman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1722-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the mechanism of this down-regulation remains to be elucidated. Several studies indicate that PKC isozymes become ubiquitinated following activation. PKC α, δ, and ϵ have been reported to become ubiquitinated following treatment of cells with phorbol esters or another potent PKC agonist, bryostatin (16Lee H.W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Smith J.B. Mol.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The specific machinery controlling the degradation of unprocessed or activated PKC remains to be elucidated. In this report we identify a novel RING domain E3 ligase that specifically binds the C1A domain of PKC isozymes and causes their ubiquitination and degradation. The protein, named RINCK (RING protein that interacts with Ckinase) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for binding partners of PKCβ. We show that the protein causes the ubiquitination of PKCβII, but not the related kinase protein kinase A, in vitro and that it ubiquitinates PKC isozymes in cells. Knockdown experiments show that RINCK controls the stability of PKC by a mechanism distinct from that driving phorbol ester-mediated down-regulation. Rather, RINCK sets the level of PKC in the cell, thus controlling the amplitude of signaling by PKC. Materials and Antibodies—The large T-antigen-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (tsA201) were the generous gift of Dr. Marlene Hosey (Northwestern University). The cDNA of rat PKCβII was a gift of Dr. Daniel E. Koshland, Jr. (University of California, Berkeley), and the cDNA of rat PKCα was a gift of Dr. Alex Toker (Harvard Medical School). The cDNA of HA-ubiquitin was a gift of Dr. Clive Palfrey (University of Chicago). Purified PKA was a gift from Dr. Susan Taylor (University of California, San Diego). Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and MG132 were obtained from Calbiochem. PKCα and βII were purified from the baculovirus expression system, as previously described (21Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against PKCβII (C-18, α-PKCβII) and a polyclonal antibody against PKCα (C-20, α-PKCα) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A monoclonal antibody against a determinant in the regulatory domain of PKCα was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. PDBu, N-ethylmaleimide, antibodies to α-tubulin, and FLAG epitope were obtained from Sigma. A monoclonal antibody against ubiquitin was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. The polyclonal anti-RINCK antibody was produced in two rabbits with His-RING (residues 20-210 in RINCK) as an antigen (Strategic Biosolutions, DE). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The cDNA encoding the NH2-terminal tail of rat PKCβII (residues 1-111) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the NcoI (5′ site) and BamHI sites (3′ site) of pAS2.1 (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was used as bait to screen a cDNA library derived from 9.5- and 10.5-day-old mouse embryos (22Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Approximately 100,000 yeast CG1945 transformants were grown in the absence of tryptophan, leucine, and histidine at 30 °C for 8 days. Colonies that grew in this minimal selective media condition were scored for β-galactosidase activity by colony lift assay according to the Clontech MatchMaker protocol. Prey plasmid DNA from the double-positive (His+/LacZ+) colonies was rescued by electroporation into Escherichia coli HB101 (Invitrogen) and then retransformed back into yeast strain SFY526 containing the original bait plasmid and various control plasmids for one-to-one interactions. Both strands of the DNA insert from these clones were sequenced by automated sequencing (DNA Sequencing Shared Resource, Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego). cDNA Cloning—The full-length RINCK1 and RINCK2 were PCR amplified from human heart total cDNA (Clontech) by using primers in 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. The PCR products were cloned into TA cloning vector (Promega) and sequenced by automated sequencing. Northern Blotting Analysis—A multiple tissue blot of human poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) was probed with random-primed 32P-labeled DNA probes containing the original cDNA fragment that was obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screen. Hybridization was carried out at 68 °C by using ExpressHyb solution (Clontech), and the blot was washed under high stringency conditions (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C). Plasmid Constructs and Mutagenesis—The cDNAs encoding RINCK1 and RINCK2 were subcloned into pCMV-3FLAG vector (Sigma) for expression in mammalian cells following PCR amplification of the relevant sequences using pTA-RINCK1/RINCK2 as templates. Specifically, the primers used for the PCR amplification introduced an EcoRI site and a BamHI site at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR products were subcloned into the pCMV-3FLAG vector digested with EcoRI and BamHI. The C20A point mutations in RINCK1/RINCK2 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. The cDNA encoding the wild-type PKCβII was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector for expression in mammalian cells (23Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pseudosubstrate region (N-PS, residues 1-31), the C1A domain (N-C1A, residues 1-111), the C1 domain (N-C1, residues 1-170), and the C2 domain (C2, residues 171-288) were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in mammalian cells following PCR amplification of the relevant sequences using pcDNA3-PKCβII as the template. Specifically, the primers used for the PCR amplification introduced a BamHI site and a ClaI site at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR products were subcloned into the pEBG vector (a Gift from Dr. Bruce Mayer at University of Connecticut Health Center) digested with BamHI and ClaI. In Vitro Pull-down Assay—The coding region of RINCK was cloned into pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences), and GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21, purified, and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described in Amersham Biosciences instruction manual. 0.5 μg of pure PKCβII/α was incubated with 0.5 μg of fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Beads were then washed twice with the incubation buffer, 500 mm NaCl and twice with the incubation buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Treatment—HEK, tsA201, HeLa, COS7, H157, MCF7 and C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient transfection of tsA201 cells was carried out using Effectene transfection reagents (Qiagen). The specific transfection procedures were performed according to the protocol suggested by Qiagen using 1 μg of DNA. For siRNA studies, HeLa cells were transfected with 200 nm control nonspecific siRNA or siRNAs against 4 different regions in RINCK (combination of 50 nm each) (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). The siRNA sequences (Set 1) were: 1) ATATGGTCCAGGTGATTCG; 2) AAGGAGACTTTCAATAGGTGT; 3) AATGAGCCGGATGTTCTGT; and 4) CAGACCGGCCAGAATTTAG. In addition, H157 and MCF7 cells were similarly transfected with SmartPool siRNA (Set 2, a different set of 4 sequences; Dharmacon). These sequences were: 1) CAAUAGGUGUGAAGAGGUAUU; 2) CCQQUAUGGUCCAGGUGAUUU; 3) GAGAUGAGUUAGAUCGGGAUU; and 4) UAGCUUCACUUGAGAGAGAUU. Cells were harvested 3 days after transfection. For MG132 experiments, cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 or Me2SO for 6 h. For PKC degradation with siRNA and PDBu experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs and incubated for 3 days and treated with 200 nm PDBu for various times. In Vivo GST Fusion Protein Pull-down Assay—To map the binding region of PKCβII to RINCK in vivo, the N-PS region, the N-C1A region, the C1 domain, and the C2 domain of PKCβ were expressed as GST fusion proteins in tsA201 cells together with FLAG-tagged RINCK. Approximately 40 h post-transfection, the transfected cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 nm microcystin-LR). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the resulting supernatant is referred to as the detergent-solubilized cell lysate. Five percent of the total cell lysate was kept in SDS sample buffer for further analysis, and the remaining whole cell lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times in buffer B (Buffer A plus 300 mm NaCl) and once in buffer A, the glutathione-Sepharose bound proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation—COS7 or tsA201 cells were transiently transfected with the constructs indicated in figure legends. About 40 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in buffer A or slightly modified buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate). Five percent of the total detergent-solubilized cell lysate was quenched in SDS sample buffer for further analysis, and the remaining detergent-solubilized cell lysate was incubated with appropriate monoclonal or polyclonal antibody and Ultra-link protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in buffer B and once in buffer A for PKCα immunoprecipitates and three times in Buffer C for all other immunoprecipitates. The proteins in the immunoprecipitates (entire sample) were separated using SDS-PAGE and analyzed using immunoblotting. Protein Purification and in Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—The coding regions of RINCK1, RINCK1 C20A, RINCK2, or RINCK2 C20A were cloned into pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences), and GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21, purified, and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described in the manufacturerŉs instructions. Assays for in vitro ubiquitination were carried out as described previously (24Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 μg of His-E1 (human) (25Anan T. Nagata Y. Koga H. Honda Y. Yabuki N. Miyamoto C. Kuwano A. Matsuda I. Endo F. Saya H. Nakao M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), 1 μg of His-UBC4 (human) (25Anan T. Nagata Y. Koga H. Honda Y. Yabuki N. Miyamoto C. Kuwano A. Matsuda I. Endo F. Saya H. Nakao M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), 2.5 μg of ubiquitin (bovine, Sigma), 2.5 μg of GST fusion protein of RINCK, and the indicated amount of PKCβII were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min in 2 mm ATP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Ubiquitin immunoblots were analyzed as described (26Swerdlow P.S. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For some experiments, 1 μg of PKCβII was treated with 312.5 units ml-1 PP1 for 30 min at room temperature to dephosphorylate PKC. In some cases, samples were diluted with 100 μl of buffer A containing 1% SDS after the in vitro ubiquitination assay and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C to dissociate protein complexes. Boiled samples were then diluted with 900 μl of buffer A and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against PKC by incubation at 4 °C overnight. Cellular Ubiquitination Assays—TsA201 cells were transfected following a standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure. The amounts of DNA used were 5 μg of PKC, 1 μg of HA-ubiquitin, or 0.5 μg of FLAG-RINCK1 constructs. Cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 for 6 h before harvest; some of them were treated with 200 nm PDBu for 30 min. Cells were harvested in buffer A with 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide to preserve ubiquitinated species. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were incubated with an anti-PKCα antibody (Transduction Laboratories) overnight at 4 °C, and Ultralink protein A/G beads for 1 h. The immunocomplexes were washed three times with buffer B with 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide and once with buffer A with 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide. Cell Fractionation—C2C12 cells were harvested in buffer A without 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min, the pellet was resuspended in buffer A. The supernatant is assigned as the cytosol. After the second centrifugation, the supernatant, the detergent-soluble fraction, is assigned as membrane and the pellet is the detergent-insoluble fraction. Identification of RINCK—To identify novel PKC-binding proteins, we used a yeast two-hybrid approach to screen a mouse embryonic cDNA library with a sequence encoding the first 111 amino acids of rat PKCβ as bait. This sequence encodes the N-terminal tail, the pseudosubstrate sequence, and C1A domain of PKCβ. Five positive clones were obtained from ∼100,000 screened. One of these encoded a 72-amino acid sequence that data base analysis revealed was part of a novel gene predicted to encode a RING finger domain-containing protein. We named the putative protein RINCK for RING finger protein that interacts with Ckinase (Fig. 1A). The full-length RINCK cDNA was PCR amplified from human heart total cDNA. The first ATG in the RINCK cDNA complies with the Kozak rules and is preceded by an in-frame stop codon, located 63 bp upstream. The open reading frame of RINCK encodes a protein of 518 amino acids predicted to have a C3HC4-type RING finger, a Zn2+-containing domain present in many E3 ubiquitin ligases (orange), a B-box (blue), and two coiled-coil regions (green) (Fig. 1B). These three domains define RINCK as being a member of the large (currently over 70 members identified) TRIM (tripartite motif) family of proteins (27Nisole S. Stoye J.P. Saib A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 28Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). These proteins have also been referred to as RBCC (RING-B-box-coiled-coil) proteins (29Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In addition, RINCK contains a PRY domain, a segment of unknown function commonly found in TRIM proteins (Fig. 1B, pink). The human RINCK gene is located on chromosome 5 and contains eight coding exons. An alternatively spliced form of RINCK skips exon 4, causing a shift in reading frame that results in an Asp instead of Val at position 381 and an early stop directly after this residue (Fig. 1A, residue 381 boxed in yellow). We refer to the longer variant as RINCK1 and the shorter variant as RINCK2 henceforth. The original cDNA fragment we obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screen corresponds to residues 235-371 in RINCK (Fig. 1A, underlined sequence), which contains part of the B-box, the first coiled-coil region, and part of the second coiled-coil region. Northern blot analysis showed that the RINCK probe hybridized to two bands of 4- and 7-kb transcripts in multiple human tissues with the highest levels in heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1C). Following our cloning and initial characterization of RINCK1, Hanai and co-workers (30Tanaka M. Fukuda Y. Mashima K. Hanai R. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2005; 32: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) reported on the cloning of two members of the TRIM (tripartite motif) family of proteins that correspond to the RINCK subfamily. Specifically, they identified TRIM41β, which corresponds to RINCK1 and a larger splice variant (COOH-terminal extension resulting in 630 residue protein), which they refer to as TRIM41α (30Tanaka M. Fukuda Y. Mashima K. Hanai R. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2005; 32: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Taken together with our work, and supported by sequences in the EST data base, there are thus three splice variants of RINCK: 381 amino acids (RINCK 2), 518 amino acids (RINCK1/TRIM 41β), and 630 amino acids (TRIM41α). Given the role of these proteins in controlling PKC (see below), we retain the RINCK nomenclature. To examine the expression of endogenous RINCK protein, a polyclonal antibody was raised against a fusion protein comprising residues 20-210 of RINCK fused to an amino-terminal His tag. The Western blot in Fig. 1D shows that this antibody detected an ∼80-kDa protein in tsA201 cells transfected with the cDNA for FLAG-tagged RINCK1 (lane 4) and an ∼50-kDa protein in cells transfected with the cDNA for FLAG-tagged RINCK2 (lane 5). The antibody detected a band co-migrating with recombinant RINCK1, but not RINCK2, in tsA201, HeLa, and COS7 cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 1-3, respectively). Fractionation of C2C12 cells revealed that endogenous RINCK1 partitioned equally between the detergent-soluble membrane fraction (Fig. 1E, lane 3) and detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 1E, lane 4). A minor species of RINCK1 with a slightly faster mobility was detected in the cytosol (Fig. 1E, lane 2). These data reveal that RINCK1 is the major species expressed in cells, where it partitions equally between the membrane and detergent-insoluble fractions. In subsequent studies, we focused on RINCK1 because it is the predominant isoform. RINCK Interacts with PKC in Cells—We next asked whether PKC interacts with RINCK in cells. TsA201 cells were co-transfected with the cDNA for PKCα and FLAG-tagged RINCK1. RINCK1 was immunoprecipitated from the detergent-solubilized fraction of cell lysates using an anti-FLAG antibody and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed for bound PKCα by Western blot analysis. Fig. 2A reveals that recombinant PKCα was present in immunoprecipitates of FLAG-RINCK1 (lane 3) but not control immunoprecipitates in which lysate was incubated with control IgG (lane 2). Conversely, FLAG-RINCK1 associated with immunoprecipitated PKCα from tsA201 cells co-transfected with PKCα and RINCK1 (data not shown). We next asked whether endogenous RINCK and endogenous PKCα interact in cells. RINCK was immunoprecipitated from tsA201 cells and probed for bound PKCα. A discrete band co-migrating with PKCα was visible in Western blots of immunoprecipitated RINCK (Fig. 2B, lane 3), but not control beads incubated with preimmune serum (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Thus, RINCK forms a complex with PKCα in cells. To examine whether PKC binds RINCK directly, we performed an in vitro GST pull-down assay using recombinant PKCα purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells and either GST alone or a GST fusion protein of RINCK1 purified from bacteria. Proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were identified by Western blot analysis using an antibody against PKCα. Fig. 2C shows that PKCα bound to GST-RINCK1 (lane 2) but not to GST alone (lane 1), revealing that PKCα binds to RINCK directly. We next explored whether the interaction of RINCK with PKC was isoform-specific or general to all PKC family members. TsA201 cells were transfected with the cDNAs encoding a PKC from each class: PKCβII (another conventional isozyme), PKCδ (novel), or PKCζ (atypical). The Western blot in Fig. 3 shows that all three is"

Homocysteine has been proposed to inhibit the catabolic enzyme of ADMA, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), but the mechanism of this inhibition has not been fully elucidated. Here, the human DDAH isoform-1 (DDAH-1) is heterologously expressed and purified. Cys274 and His173 are identified as active site residues and the pH rate dependence is described. Because oxidation of the active site Cys has been suggested as an inhibitory mechanism in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, the sensitivity of DDAH-1 to inhibition by l-homocysteine, H2O2, and S-nitroso-l-homocysteine is quantified. DDAH-1 is surprisingly insensitive to inactivation by the powerful oxidant, H2O2 (0.088 m–1 s–1), possibly because of a substrate-assisted mechanism that allows the active site cysteine to remain predominantly protonated and less reactive in the resting enzyme. In contrast, DDAH-1 is sensitive to inactivation by S-nitroso-l-homocysteine (3.79 m–1 s–1). This work illustrates how a particular catalytic mechanism can result in selective redox regulation and has possible implications for hyperhomocysteinemia.

Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) regulates vasorelaxation as well as other vascular functions (1Vallance P. Leiper J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 939-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Endothelial dysfunction is observed in many conditions including hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, hyperhomocysteinemia, chronic renal failure, smoking, and aging, and often correlates with a decrease in endothelium-derived NO and the associated vasodilation (2Cooke J.P.

These two markers have been proposed to be mechanistically linked and to mediate at least part of the pathobiology of patients with hyperhomocysteinemia (6Dayal S. Lentz S.R. Vasc.

Circulation. 2001; 104: 2569-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Much of the pathway for inhibition of NO synthesis by ADMA is known. This endogenously produced arginine analog can be transported by the y+ cationic amino acid transporter (10Closs E.I. Basha F.Z. Habermeier A. Forstermann U. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and is known to be an inhibitor of all three NO synthase isoforms (11Knipp M. ChemBiochem. 2006; 7: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Pathological accumulation of ADMA has been proposed as a ubiquitous mechanism for endothelial dysfunction and has even been called an “über marker” for adverse cardiovascular conditions (12Cooke J.P. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The plasma concentrations of ADMA are partially controlled by one or both isozymes of the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH-1 and DDAH-2), which hydrolyze ADMA (Scheme 1, structure 1) to the non-inhibitory (or less-inhibitory) products citrulline (Scheme 1, structure 2) and dimethylamine (Scheme 1, structure 3) (11Knipp M. ChemBiochem. 2006; 7: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The systemic inhibition of DDAH activity by small molecules (13Rossiter S. Smith C.L. Malaki M. Nandi M. Gill H. Leiper J.M. Vallance P. Selwood D.L. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the transgenic overexpression of the DDAH-1 isoform (14Jacobi J. Sydow K. von Degenfeld G.

Circulation. 2005; 111: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) result in respective increases or decreases in blood pressure, as predicted, highlighting the importance of DDAH in controlling ADMA, NO, and vasodilation in vivo (15Achan V. Ho H.K. Heeschen C. Stuehlinger M. Jang J.J. Kimoto M. Vallance P. Cooke J.P. Vasc. Med. 2005; 10: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The pathway for tHcy inhibition of NO synthesis is less clear. Elevated tHcy levels have been proposed to increase plasma ADMA concentrations by inhibiting DDAH activity through a decrease in expression levels or through direct inhibition by Hcy, by associated reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, or by zinc ions released during oxidative stress (6Dayal S. Lentz S.R. Vasc. Med. 2005; 10: S27-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Stuhlinger M.C. Tsao P.S. Her J.H. Kimoto M. Balint R.F. Cooke J.P.

Here we report the heterologous expression, purification and characterization of the recombinant human DDAH-1 isoform and quantify its sensitivity to inhibition by l-homocysteine (Hcy), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and S-nitroso-l-homocysteine (HcyNO). The results clearly show that human DDAH-1 is not sensitive to inhibition by physiological concentrations of H2O2, despite having an active site cysteine nucleophile. However, DDAH-1 is irreversibly inhibited by HcyNO with sensitivity comparable with typical cysteine-dependent hydrolases. These data suggest that HcyNO may be a biological mediator in the endothelial dysfunction associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Cloning and Purification of Human DDAH-1—The coding region for human DDAH-1 (DDAH-1, Protein GI: 6831528) was amplified from an I.M.A.G.E. clone (5189970) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 7273181, Manassas, VA) using two specific end primers: 5′-CTAGCTAGCATGGCCGGGCTCGGCCACCCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGGAGTCTACTTTCTTG-3′. The forward primer contains an NheI restriction site (underlined) followed by 21 bases corresponding to the DDAH-1 coding sequence. The reverse primer contains a BamHI restriction site (underlined) followed by 19 bases complementary to a stop codon and the end of the DDAH-1 coding sequence. Amplification was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using an MJ Research (Waltham, MA) PTC 200 thermal cycler, along with the aforementioned primers, ATCC 7273181, dNTPs, and pfu polymerase in the pfu polymerase buffer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following a temperature program: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a 10-min hold at 72 °C. The PCR-amplified product and the expression vector pET-28a (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) were digested with NheI and BamHI restriction enzymes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and Qiaquick (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) purified before ligation. The resulting plasmid (pET28-hddah1) was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5αE cells for amplification, and the insert was sequenced at the DNA Facility (Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, The University of Texas) to ensure that there were no undesired mutations. pET28-hddah1 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Typically, overexpression of DDAH-1 was carried out by inoculating 6 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin with 24 ml of inoculant from a saturated overnight culture and shaking at 37 °C. When the culture reached an A600 of 0.2, the expression temperature was decreased to 15 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm when the A600 of the culture was between 0.3 and 0.6. The incubation was continued for another 18 h before the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g. The cell pellets from 6 liters of culture were resuspended in 80 ml of lysis buffer (NaPi buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol at pH 8.0) supplemented with 5 mm imidazole). The resulting cell suspension was sonicated on ice for 4 min with 30 s burst/rest cycles followed by centrifugation at 34,500 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with 6 ml of Ni-NTA affinity resin (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4°C. After harvesting at 1,000 × g, the resin was loaded into a column and washed with 5 column volumes of lysis buffer, followed by 10 column volumes of wash buffer (NaPi buffer supplemented with 20 mm imidazole), and finally eluted with 4 column volumes of elution buffer (NaPi buffer supplemented with 60 mm imidazole). Fractions containing DDAH-1 were identified by SDS-PAGE and combined. The buffer was exchanged to buffer A (50 mm Na2HPO4 at pH 7.0 containing 1.2 m (NH4)2SO4 and 10% glycerol) using an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter with a 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) (Millipore, Billerica, MA) before the protein solution was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) hydrophobic column (1.5 × 18 cm). The column was washed with 60 ml of buffer A before the protein was eluted with a linear gradient between 150 ml of buffer A and 150 ml of buffer B (50 mm Na2HPO4 at pH 7.0 containing 10% glycerol). The purity of each resulting fraction was examined by SDS-PAGE, and those showing a single DDAH-1 band were pooled. Desalting and concentration were completed with a 10-kDa MWCO Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter. The N terminus is distant from the active site (16Murray-Rust J. Leiper J. McAlister M. Phelan J.

Structure. 2006; 14: 901-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), so the His6 tag was left attached. The final purified protein was made 10% in glycerol, flash frozen in N2(l) and stored at –80 °C. Characterization of DDAH-1—The molecular weight of purified DDAH-1 was analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectroscopy at the Analytical Core Facility (College of Pharmacy, University of Texas). To determine the metal content, a purified protein sample (80 μm) and a buffer sample were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry at the Department of Geological Sciences of the University of Texas at Austin. The metal content of the protein was determined by subtracting the concentration of metal found in the buffer from that found in the protein sample and dividing by the protein concentration. Protein concentrations were determined either according to Bradford with bovine serum albumin as the standard or by measuring the absorption at 280 nm. The extinction coefficient of the protein (8,400 m–1 cm–1) was calculated on the basis of the amino acid sequence using Vector NTI, version 10 (Invitrogen). Protein concentrations calculated from the two methods are comparable (within ± 10%). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Construction of expression vectors containing mutations at Cys274, Cys275, or His173 was achieved using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Three pairs of oligonucleotides: 5′-GGATGGGCTGCTCACCGCCTGCTCAGTTTTAAT-3′ and 5′-GTTAATTAAAACTGAGCAGGCGGTGAGCAGCCC-3′; 5′-GATGGGCTGCTCACCTGCGCCTCAGTTTTAATT-3′ and 5′-CTTGTTAATTAAAACTGAGGCGCAGGTGAGCAG-3′; 5′-CCAGTGGCAGATGGGTTGGCCTTGAAGAGTTTC-3′ and 5′-GCTGCAGAAACTCTTCAAGGCCAACCCATCTGC-3′, were used for mutations at Cys274, Cys275, and His173, respectively. Briefly, a reaction mixture containing the parent plasmid pET28-hddah1, the oligonucleotide pair, a dNTP mixture and pfuTurbo DNA polymerase in the manufacturer's buffer (Stratagene) was subjected to a temperature program of 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 16 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 13 min. The restriction enzyme DpnI was then added to the reaction mixture, which had been cooled down on ice, to digest the parent plasmid. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the remaining mutant plasmid was transformed into E. coli DH5αE competent cells. Amplified plasmid was extracted from a 5-ml E. coli DH5αE culture, and the coding sequence was verified by sequencing. Plasmids with the desired mutations were transformed to E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Overexpression and purification of the mutant proteins were conducted using the same conditions as described for wild-type DDAH-1. Steady-state Kinetic Studies—A discontinuous colorimetric ureido derivatization procedure was used to detect the reaction product, citrulline, as described previously (18Knipp M. Vasak M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Stone E.M. Fast W. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 343: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the steady-state catalytic rate constants of DDAH-1 were determined for hydrolysis of Nω,Nω-dimethyl-l-arginine (ADMA), Nω-monomethyl-l-arginine (NMMA), S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (SMTC), and l-arginine. Typically, various concentrations (10 μm to 10 mm) of each substrate were treated with enzyme (1 μm), all in Na2HPO4 buffer (100 mm) at pH 7.5, 25 °C, and incubated for 30 min before the reaction was quenched with addition of trifluoroacetic acid (0.3 n). Control reactions indicate that citrulline production is linear over this time scale. A control reaction without enzyme was also performed at each substrate concentration, enabling background citrulline levels to be subtracted. A citrulline standard curve (0–400 μm), prepared in the same buffer allowed for quantification of any product absorption observed at 540 nm. Concentration dependence of the observed rates was fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. All of the fits in this work were completed using either Grafit software, version 3.09b (Erithacus Software Ltd., Surrey, UK) or KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). pH Dependence of DDAH-1-catalyzed Hydrolysis of ADMA—Steady-state rate constants for DDAH-1 catalyzed hydrolysis of ADMA were determined as described above at pH values ranging from 4.5 to 10.6. The buffers used were: at pH 4.5–5.0, sodium acetate (20 mm); at pH 5.5–6.5, MES (20 mm); at pH 7.0–8.0, HEPES (20 mm); at pH 8.5–10.0, CHES (20 mm); at pH 10.2–10.6, CAPS (50 mm). All buffers contained 100 mm KCl. Reactions were done at least in duplicate at each pH value, and the observed rates were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The resulting curves for the pH dependence of both kcat and kcat/Km were fit with a single pKa model (see Equation 1), in which y is substituted by either kcat/Km or kcat, accordingly. The term ymin was fixed at 0. log[yobs]=log[ymin+(ymax-ymin)1+10(pka-pH)](Eq. 1) Synthesis of Inhibitors—Because of the short half lives and limited stability of these inhibitors, thiol and nitrosothiol containing compounds were synthesized immediately prior to use. Unless otherwise stated, all of the chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. l-Homocysteine (Scheme 1, structure 4; l-Hcy) was prepared according to the method of Duerre and Miller (20Duerre J.A. Miller C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 17: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, l-homocysteine thiolactone·HCl (30 mg) was dissolved in NaOH (5 n, 200 μl), and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction mixture was neutralized with HCl (2 n), and the final volume was adjusted to 1 ml with ammonium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0), which was prepared in 99% D2O. The product was characterized by 1H NMR acquired on a Varian Unity 300 MHz spectrometer (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas). The chemical shifts (δ in parts per million, ppm) are given relative to that for tetramethylsilane. 1H NMR (D2O): δ 2.18 (2H, m, 3-H), 2.67 (2H, m, 4-H), 3.90 (1H, t, J = 6.2 Hz, 2-H). S-Nitroso-l-homocysteine (Scheme 1, structure 5; HcyNO) was prepared according to the method of Stamler and Feelisch (21Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. J. Wiley, Chichester, New York1996: 521-539Google Scholar). Briefly, 150 μlofa l-Hcy solution (0.2 N) prepared above was mixed with an equal volume of NaNO2 (0.2 n). Upon acidification with 100 μl of 2 n HCl, which was prepared in 99% D2O, the solution immediately turned red. The incubation was continued at room temperature for 15 min before the final product was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. 1H NMR (D2O): δ 2.05 (2H, m, 3-H), 3.55 (2H, m, 4-H), 3.97 (1H, t, J = 6.2 Hz, 2-H). Subsequently, the absorption spectrum of the product was recorded from 250 to 700 nm and showed distinct absorption maxima at 331 and 545 nm. The concentration of the product was determined based on the absorption coefficient of 16.7 m–1 cm–1 at 545 nm (21Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. J. Wiley, Chichester, New York1996: 521-539Google Scholar). Calculating from the proton integrals of 1H NMR, the conversion from l-Hcy to HcyNO was >99%. Reversible Inhibition by l-Homocysteine or l-Lysine—Varying concentrations of l-Hcy (10 μm -2 mm) were mixed with ADMA (0.2 mm) in K2HPO4 buffer (100 mm) at pH 7.5. Reactions were initiated upon addition of DDAH-1 (2 μm) and incubated at 37 °C for 25 min before product concentrations were determined. The resulting data were fit to Equation 2 to obtain an IC50 value. Hcy is known to be a competitive inhibitor of both bovine DDAH-1 (17Frey D. Braun O. Briand C. Vasak M. Grutter M.G. Structure. 2006; 14: 901-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and an N-terminal glutathione transferase-human DDAH-1 fusion enzyme (9Stuhlinger M.C. Tsao P.S. Her J.H. Kimoto M. Balint R.F. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2569-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Ki values for l-Hcy were calculated using Equation 3 (22Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12266) Google Scholar). %Activity=1001+[Inhibitor]IC50(Eq. 2) Ki=IC50[ADMA](Eq. 3) Varying concentrations of l-Lys (0–40 mm) and ADMA (20 μm to 4 mm) were mixed in K2HPO4 buffer (100 mm) at pH 7.5 and analyzed as described above. For easy visual interpretation, a Lineweaver-Burk plot was constructed. To obtain a numerical value for Ki, the initial rate data were fit directly using a competitive inhibition model (Equation 4) to determine α values, and a linear fit of these α values to Equation 5. v0=Vmax[S]αKM+[S](Eq. 4) α=1+[l]Ki(Eq. 5) Time- and Concentration-dependent Inhibition of DDAH-1—To monitor any time-dependent inactivation of DDAH-1 activity by l-Hcy, DDAH-1 (40 μm) was incubated with l-Hcy (800 μm) in K2HPO4 buffer (100 mm) at pH 7.5, 37 °C. An aliquot (10 μl) of the preincubation mixture was withdrawn at various time points between 0–30 min and diluted 20-fold into a reaction mixture containing ADMA (0.5 mm) in K2HPO4 buffer (100 mm) at pH 7.5. The resulting reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min before their citrulline concentrations were determined as described above. To monitor the time-dependent inactivation of DDAH-1 by H2O2, enzyme (40 μm) was incubated with various concentrations of H2O2 (5–25 mm) in K2HPO4 buffer (100 mm) at pH 7.5. Before each experiment, H2O2 was freshly diluted from a concentrated stock (9.78 m, 33%) and quantified using ϵ240 nm = 43.6 m–1 cm–1. At various time points between 0 and 20 min, aliquots (10 μl) of the preincubation mix were diluted 20-fold into a reaction mixture containing ADMA (0.1 mm) and 60 units of bovine liver catalase, all in K2HPO4 buffer (100 mm) at pH 7.5. The resulting reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min before the product concentrations were determined as described above. As an inhibitor-protection experiment, preincubation of DDAH-1 with H2O2 (20 mm) was also repeated in the presence of l-lysine (25 mm). The amounts of catalase and l-lysine included did not interfere with the l-citrulline standard curve. At each H2O2 concentration, remaining DDAH-1 activity was fitted to Equation 6. Remainingactivity(%)=100×exp(-kobs×t)+C(Eq. 6) The observed pseudo first-order inactivation rates, kobs, were then plotted against the concentrations of H2O2, and the second-order rate constant was obtained as the slope of the resulting linear plot. To monitor the time-dependent inactivation of DDAH-1 by HcyNO, enzyme (40 μm) was incubated with varying concentrations of freshly prepared HcyNO (0.2–4 mm) in K2HPO4 buffer (100 mm) at pH 7.5. At various time points between 0 and 30 min, aliquots (10 μl) of the preincubation mixture were diluted 20-fold into a reaction mixture containing ADMA (0.5 mm) and K2HPO4 buffer (100 mm) at pH 7.5. The resulting reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min before the product concentrations were determined. Inhibitor-protection experiments were also conducted by including either l-lysine (25 mm) or l-Hcy (1 mm) in preincubation mixtures containing 800 μm HcyNO. The amounts of l-Hcy and HcyNO used here do not interfere with the citrulline standard curve. The pseudo first-order inactivation rates and the second-order rate constant for inactivation were obtained as described above. Reversibility of Inactivation by H2O2 and HcyNO—DDAH-1 (40 μm) was fully inactivated using H2O2 (20 mm) as described above and then treated with bovine liver catalase (100 units) to degrade all remaining H2O2. Subsequent addition of DTT (25 mm) or glutathione (25 mm) to this treated preincubation mix was followed by 20-fold dilution of aliquots (10 μl) at various timepoints (0–20 min) into a reaction mixture containing ADMA (0.1 mm) in K2HPO4 buffer (100 mm) at pH 7.5, which was assayed for remaining DDAH-1 activity as described above. The concentrations of catalase, DTT and glutathione used here did not interfere with citrulline standard curves. In a separate set of experiments, DDAH-1 was fully inactivated using HcyNO and any remaining HcyNO was removed by a size-exclusion spin column (10 kDa MWCO) (Millipore, MA). The preincubation solution was then treated with DTT (5 mm) and recovery of activity was monitored as described above. Expression, Purification, and Characterization of DDAH-1—Protein expression at 15 °C reduced the formation of inclusion bodies and increased the yield of soluble protein to ∼5 mg/liter. The His6-tagged DDAH-1 showed only weak binding affinity for Ni-NTA resin and was eluted with relatively low imidazole concentrations (60 mm). Some impurities co-eluted with DDAH-1 and were subsequently removed by hydrophobic phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography. The resulting purified DDAH-1 was homogeneous as gauged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Characterization of DDAH-1 by ESI-MS showed a major peak at 33435 ± 10 Da which matches (within error) the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence of His6-tagged DDAH-1 after removal of the N-terminal methionine residue (33441 Da). Some preparations also showed a +177 Da peak due to non-enzymic Nα-gluconylation, as described previously (23Stone E.M. Person M.D. Costello N.J. Fast W.

However, zinc is an inhibitor for human DDAH-1. 3Y. Wang and W. Fast, unpublished observations. Determination of Steady-state Rate Constants—ADMA and NMMA are comparable substrates for wild-type DDAH-1 as reflected in their similar kcat/Km values (Table 1). The kcat values for these natural substrates are somewhat slow, but comparable to those reported for other mammalian DDAH enzymes. The artificial substrate SMTC is a better substrate of DDAH-1, with kcat/Km values 10-fold greater than those of ADMA or NMMA. In contrast, turnover of l-arginine, which lacks any terminal methyl groups, was not detected within the limits of our assay.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters of DDAH-1 catalysisSourceVariantSubstrateaNω,Nω-dimethyl-l-arginine (ADMA); Nω-methyl-l-arginine (NMMA); S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (SMTC).kcatKmkcat/Kmmin−1μmmin−1mm−1HumanbThis study, at pH 7.5 and 24 °C.WTADMA1.66 ± 0.02170 ± 109.8 ± 0.7NMMA0.79 ± 0.0290 ± 109 ± 1SMTC1.6 ± 0.215 ± 5110 ± 50l-ArginineNDcNone detected (ND) above background (<0.008 s−1).—iNot determined.—C275AADMA0.93 ± 0.07350 ± 402.7 ± 0.5NMMA0.42 ± 0.02190 ± 202.2 ± 0.3C274AADMAND——H173AADMAND——HumanWTADMA1.5dCalculated from specific activity given in Ref. 51, at pH 6.5, 37 °C; substrate was not specified, but was presumably either ADMA or NMMA.214eGlutathione transferase-DDAH-1 fusion protein (9), at pH 7, 37 °C.—RatfFrom Ref. 52, at pH 6.5, 37 °C.WTADMA9.218051RatfFrom Ref. 52, at pH 6.5, 37 °C.WTNMMA5.636016BovinegFrom Ref. 53, at pH 6.2, 37 °C, using apo protein.WTADMA6.1 ± 0.8810 ± 1208 ± 2PaohPao stands for P. aeruginosa; from Ref. 39, at pH 8.0, 25 °C.WTADMA76 ± 239 ± 92000 ± 500PaohPao stands for P. aeruginosa; from Ref. 39, at pH 8.0, 25 °C.WTNMMA35 ± 144 ± 1800 ± 100a Nω,Nω-dimethyl-l-arginine (ADMA); Nω-methyl-l-arginine (NMMA); S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (SMTC).b This study, at pH 7.5 and 24 °C.c None detected (ND) above background (<0.008 s−1).d Calculated from specific activity given in Ref. 51Kimoto M.

We examined the individual roles that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP), two intracellular cAMP receptors, play in this synergistic effect. Our studies demonstrate that PKA is responsible for the observed synergism with GC, whereas Epac exerts a weak antagonistic effect against GC-induced apoptosis. We find that endogenous PKA activity is higher in the GC-sensitive clone than in the GC-resistant clone. In the GC-sensitive clone, higher PKA activity is associated with lower Hedgehog (Hh) activity. Moreover, inhibition of Hh activity by Hh pathway-specific inhibitors leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CEM (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T lineage) cells, and the GC-sensitive clone is more sensitive to Hh inhibition. These results suggest that Hh activity is critical for leukemia cell growth and survival and that the level of Hh activity is in part responsible for the synergism between cAMP and GC.

Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2002; 3: 47-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The secreted protein Hh exerts its effects through binding to its receptor PTCH (Patched), which releases its inhibition of another transmembrane protein SMO (Smoothened). Activated SMO regulates gene transcription by activating transcription factors GLIs (glioblastoma gene products). In mammalian cells, Hh has three isoforms: Shh (sonic hedgehog), Dhh (desert hedgehog), and Ihh (Indian hedgehog); of these, Shh is best studied. Constitutive activation of the Shh signaling pathway is associated with several forms of malignant disease, including basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, rhabidomyosarcoma, prostate cancer, hepatacellular cancer, pancreatic cancer, and some gut cancers (13Bale A.E.

Because of the important role that the Hh pathway plays in lymphoid cell development, differentiation, and survival and because PKA has been identified as a negative regulator of Hh pathway in Drosophila as well as mammalian cells, we hypothesize that the Hh pathway contributes to the lymphoid malignant cell growth and survival and that PKA exerts its synergism with GC through regulating Hh signaling in CEM cells. In this study, we used human GC-sensitive and -resistant CEM cells as model systems to test our hypothesis. We report that Hh pathway activity is inversely correlated with cellular PKA activity as well as the GC sensitivity. Reagents—Cyclopamine and tomatidine were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Canada). Dexamethasone (Dex) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Forskolin was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Rp-cAMP and 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, an Epac activator, was purchased from Biolog Life Institute (Bremen, Germany). Caspase 3 substrate was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Auraro, OH). A Peptag PKA activity assay kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Alamar Blue dye was purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Cell Culture—Human CEM clonal cell lines C7–14, C1–15, and C1–8 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). 1% fetal bovine serum was used if cells were treated with KAAD-cyclopamine. The human CEM cell line was isolated from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Subclone C7–14, sensitive to GC-evoked apoptosis, was derived from the original sensitive C7 clone. Subclone C1–15, which was derived from the original resistant C1 clone, remains resistant to GC. Many properties of the two original clones were similar. Each was pseudodiploid, contained similar concentrations of GR (12,000–14,000 GR sites/cell) and showed a similar affinity (Kd =∼20 nm) for Dex (25Zawydiwski R. Harmon J.M. Thompson E.B. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3865-3873PubMed Google Scholar). The subclones were retested as soon as they grew out and were selected for further study on the basis of their similarity to the phenotypes of their parental clones. C7–14 was found to have 9,900 GR sites/cell, and C1–15 had 10,350. They were pseudodiploid (26Medh R.D. Webb M.S. Miller A.L. Johnson B.H. Fofanov Y. Li T. Wood T.G. Luxon B.A. Thompson E.B. Genomics. 2003; 81: 543-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Subclone CEM C1–8 is a GC-sensitive spontaneous revertent from the GC-resistant C1 clone. PKA Activity Assay—A radioisotopic method (27Cheng X. Phelps C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4102-4108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was used to measure PKA activity in the cell lysate. The kinase reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mm Mops (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm kemptide substrate, and 0.1 mm ATP at 100 cpm/pmol, 20 μg of total cell lysate protein, and 10 μm cAMP. The reaction was pre-equilibrated at room temperature for 10 min and initiated by adding the kemptide substrate. Following a 10-min incubation, aliquots (45 μl) were withdrawn, spotted onto discs of Whatman P81 paper, and immediately immersed in 75 mm phosphoric acid (10–20 ml/sample) to terminate the reaction. After washing three times in phosphoric acid and once with ethanol, the discs were dried under a heating lamp. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Background counts measured from reactions that did not contain kemptide were subtracted for each sample. Peptag® nonradioactive PKA assays were performed according to the Promega instructions. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells as previously described (28Mei F.C. Young T.W. Liu J. Cheng X. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Real time PCR analysis was conducted using an Applied Biosystems Prism 7000 sequence detection system and TaqMan® gene expression assays for relative quantification of GLI1 (Hs00171790_m1) and PTCH (Hs00181117_m1) mRNA. Duplicate CT values were analyzed in Microsoft Excel using the comparative CT (ΔΔCT) method as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The amount of target (2–ΔΔCT) was obtained by normalizing to endogenous reference (18 s) and relative to number obtained from vehicle-treated C1–15 cells. Caspase 3 Activity Assay—CEM cells were grown in 100-mm plates to log phase, then harvested, and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and once in wash buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin). The cells were lysed on ice for 30 min with frequent mixing in 150 μl of lysis buffer (wash buffer plus 1% Triton X-100). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysate protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Caspase 3 activities were measured using fluorogenic substrates DEVD-AFC that is specific for caspases 3, by monitoring the release of free AFC as determined using a Fluoroskan fluorescence microplate reader with excitation and emission set to 405 and 510 nm, correspondingly. The caspase 3 activity was then normalized to that of a Me2SO-treated sample. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell cycle stage was determined using flow cytometry. Briefly, treated CEM cells were fixed with 70% ethanol at –20 °C for 1 h. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) and RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells (104 cells/analysis) were examined by flow cytometry (Coulter, Hialeah, FL), and the cell cycle distribution was determined by DNA content. Cells distributed in sub-G1 were defined as apoptotic according to the criteria described by others (29Oancea M. Mazumder S. Crosby M.E. Almasan A. Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 129: 279-290PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Viability Assay—Cell growth was determined by Alamar Blue assay. The cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells (100 μl)/well in 96-well plates. The plates were incubated with drugs for specified amount of time. Alamar Blue (10 μl) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Alamar Blue is a fluorescent substrate reduced by mitochondrial enzyme activity in viable cells. Fluorescence intensity was determined using a Molecular Devices plate reader (SpectraMax M2) with an excitation wavelength at 530 nm and an emission wave-length at 590 nm. The fluorescence readings were then normalized to readings from vehicle-treated cells (at day 0 for time course experiments). The error bars indicate standard deviations from the means of at least two independent experiments as defined in the figure legends. PKA, not Epac, Is Responsible for the Synergistic Killing Effects Mediated by cAMP and GC—The effects of cAMP are mediated by two intracellular cAMP receptors, PKA and Epac (30Bos J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 680-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Because Epac and PKA are ubiquitously expressed and distinctively localized in cells (31Qiao J. Mei F.C. Popov V.L. Vergara L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26581-26586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 32DiPilato L.M. Cheng X. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16513-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 33Mei F.C. Cheng X.D. Mol. Biosystems. 2005; 1: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it was possible that the synergistic effect of cAMP is mediated by PKA, Epac, or both. We examined the contribution of PKA or Epac to the cAMP-mediated synergistic cell killing effect in CEM cells using pharmacological activators and inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 1, the increase in intracellular cAMP induced by forskolin, demonstrated previously in these cells (10Medh R.D. Saeed M.F. Johnson B.H. Thompson E.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3684-3693PubMed Google Scholar), led to synergistic killing of both GC-sensitive and -resistant cell lines when they were cotreated with Dex. On the other hand, selective activation of Epac using 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, an Epac-specific activator that did not activate PKA under the concentration used for our study, showed no synergetic effect with Dex in either C1–15 or C7–14 cells (Fig. 1). On the contrary, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP partially antagonized the killing effect of Dex in GC-sensitive clone C7–14 cells (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of PKA by Rp-cAMP, a specific PKA inhibitor, significantly reversed the synergy between Dex and forskolin in C1–15 cells (Fig. 1A). Taken together; these results demonstrate that PKA, not Epac, is responsible for the cAMP-mediated synergistic killing effect in CEM cells. PKA Activity Is Lower in GC-resistant Leukemia Cell Line—Because PKA is implicated for cAMP-mediated synergistic killing effect in CEM cells, we examined the regulation of PKA in GC-sensitive and -resistant CEM cells. As shown in Fig. 2, PKA activity in the GC-resistant clone C1–15 cells, measured by the classic radioactivity kinase assay with a saturating concentration of cAMP (10 μm), was significantly lower than that in the GC-sensitive clone C7–14 cells. The difference between C1–15 and C7–14 clones, although only about 20%, is statistically significant and reproducible. In addition, when PKA activities in GC-sensitive and -resistant CEM cells were measured under a more physiological concentration of cAMP (1 μm) using an independent commercial PepTag PKA activity assay from Promega (Madison WI), the difference of PKA activity levels in GC-sensitive and -resistant CEM cells was more dramatic (Fig. 2, inset). These results indicate that the level of PKA activities is correlated to GC sensitivity in these CEM clones. Increased Hh Pathway Activity in GC-resistant Leukemia Clone—In different cellular settings, PKA can have growth promoting or growth inhibiting effects. The precise mechanisms for this differential effect are unknown. Recent findings that PKA inhibits Hh pathway activity provide a clue for its anti-growth properties under certain cellular scenarios (34Sheng T. Chi S. Zhang X. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To test whether PKA exerts its synergetic killing effect in CEM cells through the inhibition of Hh pathway, we first determined whether the Hh pathway was activated in our CEM clones. Hh pathway activity was determined by monitoring the expression of Hh target genes GLI1 and PTCH, by real time PCR. Although both GC-sensitive and -resistant cell lines showed activation of the Hh pathway, the GC-resistant clone C1–15 cells displayed significantly and consistently higher levels of GLI1 and PTCH mRNAs compared with the GC-sensitive clone C7–14 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). When treated with forskolin, both cell lines showed a significant decrease of GLI1 and PTCH mRNA expression. Although Dex treatment alone had no effects on GLI1 and PTCH expression in either clone, more pronounced inhibition of Hh target gene expression was seen in both clones when cotreated with both Dex and forskolin compared with single forskolin treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, suppressing basal PKA activity in C7–14 cells by myristoylated PKI, a membrane-permeable PKA-specific inhibitor, led to a reciprocal increase of GLI1 mRNA levels as measured by real time PCR (Fig. 3C). These data suggested that PKA negatively regulates Hh activation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia CEM cells and that inhibition of the Hh pathway by PKA might be involved in GC-induced cell death and may account for the synergistic effect of cAMP and Dex. To further determine whether Hh signal repression by cAMP/PKA is GC/GR-dependent or -independent, we cotreated CEM cells with forskolin and dexamethasone mesylate, a GR antagonist (35Simons Jr., S.S. Thompson E.B. Johnson D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), dexamethasone mesylate did not block the inhibitory effects of forskolin. These observations suggest that Hh signal repression by cAMP/PKA is GC/GR-independent. Inhibition of Hh Pathway Induces Cell Apoptosis in Both GC-sensitive and -resistant Cell Lines—If PKA-induced Hh inhibition is responsible for cAMP-mediated synergistic killing in CEM cells, one would expect that a Hh pathway-specific inhibitor would induce cell death in these cell lines. To test this hypothesis, both C1–15 and C7–14 cells were treated with various concentrations of KAAD-cyclopamine, a specific Hh pathway inhibitor that binds to SMO and inhibits the activation of the downstream transcriptional factor GLI (36He J. Sheng T. Stelter A.A. Li C. Zhang X. Sinha M. Luxon B.A. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35598-35602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). KAAD-cyclopamine at 10 μm almost completely inhibited cell growth in both cell lines (Fig. 4A), but a structurally related inactive analog, tomatidine, had no effect. When lower KAAD-cyclopamine concentration (2.5 μm) was used, the GC-sensitive clone C7–14 cells with lesser PKA activity showed an increased sensitivity to KAAD-cyclopamine inhibition as compared with the GC-resistant clone C1–15 cells (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained when another small molecular inhibitor, Smo antagonist 1 (SANT-1), was used (Fig. 5). SANT-1 is a Hh pathway-specific inhibitor that is structurally and mechanistically distinct from cyclopamine (37Chen J.K. Taipale J. Young K.E. Maiti T. Beachy P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14071-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). We also observed that KAAD-cyclopamine, but not its analog tomatidine, induced cell death (Fig. 4A). To confirm that KAAD-cyclopamine indeed induced apoptosis in these cells, we measured caspase 3 activities after treatment with the inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 6A, KAAD-cyclopamine treatment led to a significantly increased caspase 3 activity in C1–15 cells. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis based on flow cytometry showed that KAAD-cyclopamine treatment caused a significant increase in cell populations at sub-G1 and G0/G1 phases (Fig. 6B). These data are consistent with the need for Hh pathway activation for cell growth and survival of CEM lymphoid cells.FIGURE 5Effects of Hh antagonist SANT-1 on CEM cells growth and survival.

The mechanism of GC sensitivity reversion of C1–8 cells is unknown, If our theory that increased PKA activity and subsequently decreased Hh activity are responsible for GC sensitivity in CEM cells is correct, one can predict that the C1–8 GC-sensitive revertant cells will have higher PKA activity, lower basal Hh pathway activity and greater sensitivity to cyclopamine-induced growth arrest and cell death when compared with the sister clone C1–15 GC-resistant cells. To examine our hypothesis, PKA activities in C1–8 and C1–15 cells were measured. C1–8 cells, like C7–14, showed a small but significant increased level of PKA activity as compared with the C1–15 cells (Fig. 7A). Again, this difference of PKA activity levels was confirmed using an independent PKA activity assay (Fig. 7A, inset). The increased PKA activity in C1–8 cells was accompanied by a decreased Hh pathway activity, as reflected by the lower Hh target gene expression measured by real time PCR (Fig. 7B). As expected, C1–8 cells were also more sensitive to KAAD-cyclopamine treatment when compared with C1–15 cells (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that higher PKA activity inhibits Hh pathway activity, and this contributes to the restored GC sensitivity of C1–8 cells. Increased intracellular cAMP can either inhibit or promote apoptosis, depending upon the specific cellular context (7Coffino P. Bourne H.R. Friedrich U. Hochman J. Insel P.A. Lemaire I. Melmon K.L. Tomkins G.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1976; 32: 669-684PubMed Google Scholar). The determinants for cAMP-mediated cell cycle arrest and cell death are poorly understood. Previous studies on CEM cell lines have documented that cAMP elevating agents such as forskolin synergistically promote Dex-induced cell death in both GC-sensitive and -resistant CEM clones (10Medh R.D. Saeed M.F. Johnson B.H. Thompson E.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3684-3693PubMed Google Scholar), thus implicating the involvement of cAMP signaling in the GC-induced apoptotic process. In the current studies, we demonstrate that between the two intracellular cAMP receptors, Epac and PKA, PKA is responsible for the synergistic killing effects observed in CEM cells. This is consistent with a previous report that cAMP exerts its growth arrest effect through PKA instead of Epac pathway in Jurkat T cells (38Fuld S. Borland G. Yarwood S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 309: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activation of Epac, on the other hand, weakly antagonizes the apoptotic effect of Dex, consistent with our earlier observation that Epac and PKA can mediate the opposing cellular effects of cAMP (39Mei F.C. Qiao J. Tsygankova O.M. Meinkoth J.L. Quilliam L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11497-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 40Yu S. Fan F. Flores S.C. Mei F. Cheng X. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15318-15326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In agreement with the important role that PKA plays in cAMP-mediated synergism with GC, the cellular activity of PKA is significantly higher in GC-sensitive CEM cells. This increased PKA activity is further associated with a decreased Hh activity in GC-sensitive C7–14 cells. We also find that forskolin suppresses Hh pathway activity in both GC-resistant and sensitive CEM cells. Moreover, whereas Dex alone does not significantly suppress Hh activity, the inhibitory effect of forskolin on Hh activity is synergistically potentiated by Dex. Therefore, our studies for the first time suggest that inhibition of Hh pathway activity by PKA may represent one of the mechanisms that cAMP and GC converge to induce cell apoptosis in CEM cells. Hh signaling regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in some adult tissues in addition to its important roles during development (41Molofsky A.V. Pardal R. Morrison S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 700-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of the Hh pathway has been implicated in many human cancers (13Bale A.E. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2002; 3: 47-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 42Rubin L.L. de Sauvage F.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Our findings that the Hh pathway is activated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells broadens the growing list of Hh-associated cancers. Although the mechanism underlying Hh-mediated tumorigenesis is poorly understood, several studies indicate a role for Hh as a regulator of the cell cycle machinery (23Trowbridge J.J. Scott M.P.

Development. 2006; 133: 3929-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These studies are in agreement with our observations that inhibition of Hh pathway by a SMO inhibitor KAAD-cyclopamine leads to cell cycle arrest in G1/S, whereas a structurally related analog, tomatidine, shows no effect on the cell cycle progression. Hh pathway blockade by pharmacological agents or small interference RNA induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis in several solid tumors and inhibits tumor growth in mouse xenograft models (17Thayer S.P. di Magliano M.P. Heiser P.W. Nielsen C.M. Roberts D.J. Lauwers G.Y. Qi Y.P. Gysin S. Fernandez-del Castillo C. Yajnik V. Antoniu B. McMahon M. Warshaw A.L. Hebrok M.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12561-12566Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Again, these studies are consistent with our findings that Hh-specific inhibitors induce apoptosis in CEM cells. PKA is a negative regulator of Hh signaling. In the mammalian system, Hh-activated transcription factors, GLI2 and GLI3, are sequentially phosphorylated by PKA, glycogen synthase kinase 3, and casein kinase I, before being targeted for proteolytic processing to generate a repressor form or completely degraded by the 26 S proteosome complex (49Wang Y. McMahon A.P. Allen B.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition to affecting GLI protein stability, phosphorylation of GLI1 by PKA also prevents GLI1 translocating from cytoplasm to nucleus in COS7 cells (34Sheng T. Chi S. Zhang X. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, our study indicates that PKA down-regulates Hh pathway activity, and PKA/Hh activities correlate with GC sensitivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Our findings that increased PKA activity suppresses basal Hh activity in GC-sensitive cells provide a molecular explanation for the synergistic killing effects between GC and cAMP. Most importantly, this relationship between PKA/Hh activities and GC sensitivity is confirmed in the GC-sensitive revertant C1–8 cell line, which also contains a higher level of PKA activity, lower Hh pathway activity, and increased sensitivity to Hh inhibition. Synergy between cAMP/PKA and GCs in promoting apoptosis perhaps involves cooperative effects on gene transcription by GRs and the PKA pathway (10Medh R.D. Saeed M.F. Johnson B.H. Thompson E.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3684-3693PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of BIM expression has been implicated as a common target for both PKA and GCs (9Zhang L. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been shown that GC treatment of sensitive clones and GC/forskolin treatment of a resistant clone lead to increased BIM expression (5Miller A.L. Webb M.S. Copik A.J. Wang Y. Johnson B.H. Kumar R. Thompson E.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1569-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Miller A.L. Garza A.S. Johnson B.H. Thompson E.B. Cancer Cell Int. 2007; 7: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our results that forskolin and Dex synergistically suppress Hh pathway activity and promote apoptosis in CEM cells provide another important mechanism toward understanding the synergy between PKA and GCs. Overall, our results suggest that suppressing the Hh pathway is an important part of the mechanism of synergistic cell killing of lymphoid cells by GCs and PKA. Overactivation of Hh signaling in GC-resistant CEM cells may be one of the mechanisms leading to GC resistance. The Hh pathway thus appears to be a molecular target of cAMP/PKA signaling and in part determines GC sensitivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. This finding is very important from the clinical viewpoint, because it suggests that Hh pathway inhibitors may be used to effectively treat GC-resistant leukemia.

A role of Twist1 as transactivator has also been reported but, so far, without providing a mechanism for such an activity. Here we show that heterodimeric complexes of Twist1 and E12 mediate E-box-dependent transcriptional activation. We identify a novel Twist1 transactivation domain that coactivates together with the less potent E12 transactivation domain.

When the human genome was sequenced, one of the surprising results was the low number of genes, summing up to only about one-tenth of the expected number. Explanations for this apparent lack of genes were found in differential gene splicing and protein modification as well as in the combinatorial use of regulating signals and transcription factors. A third explanation, multifunctional proteins, has so far received little attention. Here we show that the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 2The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; AD, activation domain; nls, nuclear localization signal; Luc, firefly luciferase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CDS, coding sequence; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NT, amino-terminal; CT, C-terminal; D-Twist, Drosophila Twist; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; MSV, murine sarcoma virus; WT, wild type; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor. 2The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; AD, activation domain; nls, nuclear localization signal; Luc, firefly luciferase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CDS, coding sequence; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NT, amino-terminal; CT, C-terminal; D-Twist, Drosophila Twist; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; MSV, murine sarcoma virus; WT, wild type; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor. protein Twist1, a known transcriptional inhibitor, can also function as an activator, depending on the regulatory sequences of the target genes. Identification of this additional molecular mechanism may aid in explaining the pleiotropic effects of Twist1 in development and in understanding the complex phenotype of the human Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, which is caused by haploid insufficiency of Twist1. Tissue-specifically expressed bHLH transcription factors are important regulators during embryonic development and postnatal life. They mediate their function through binding to DNA elements of the NCANNTGN consensus sequence termed E-boxes (1Kophengnavong T. Michnowicz J.E. Blackwell T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). The evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanisms leading to DNA binding have been firmly established. In brief, two amphipathic α-helices connected by a loop region form the HLH motif, a protein interaction domain through which bHLH factors form homo- or heterodimers. A region of basic residues N-terminal to the HLH motif is necessary for DNA binding. Members of a class of ubiquitously expressed bHLH factors termed E-proteins serve as activating dimerization partners for tissue-specific bHLH factors (3Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 4Lassar A.B.

In general, single E-boxes are sufficient for bHLH responsiveness, yet cooperative binding to dual E-boxes has been observed (5Weintraub H. Davis R. Lockshon D. Lassar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Id proteins constitute a specific class of inhibitory HLH factors, which are unable to bind DNA due to a lack of basic regions (6Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). The Id proteins consequently function as negative regulators. Although dimerization and DNA binding are mechanistically similar for all bHLH proteins, the transactivational mechanisms are often of different evolutionary origin. The closely related myogenic bHLH factors Myf5 and MyoD1 both up-regulate muscle-specific genes such as muscle creatine kinase, yet the sequences of their activation domains (AD) are unrelated (7Weintraub H. Dwarki V.J. Verma I. Davis R. Hollenberg S. Snider L. Lassar A. Tapscott S.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 8Braun T. Winter B. Bober E. Arnold H.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DNA binding by bHLH factors is not necessarily followed by transactivation. E-proteins, which transactivate immunoglobulin genes (9Bain G. Gruenwald S. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3522-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and Twist1, are both capable of binding to muscle creatine kinase E-boxes as either homodimers or heterodimers yet without being able to induce transcription (10Hebrok M. Füchtbauer A. Füchtbauer E.-M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The internal and the flanking bases of the E-box may determine the functional response as even very simple reporter constructs reveal the gene specificity of bHLH complexes. Other cellular factors such as kinases and acetyltransferases can also regulate the function of bHLH factors by modifying dimerization, DNA binding, or even the activity of transactivation domains (12Sloan S.R.

The bHLH factor Twist was first identified as a mesodermal specifier in Drosophila (16Thisse B. el Messal M. Perrin-Schmitt F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3439-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 17Simpson P. Genetics. 1983; 105: 615-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bodmer R. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Development (Camb.). 1990; 110: 661-669PubMed Google Scholar), where it, potentially in synergy with Dorsal, activates genes such as Tinman, D-Mef2, Rhomboid, Snail, and Heartless (19Ip Y.T. Park R.E. Kosman D. Yazdanbakhsh K. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1518-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 20Isaac A. Cohn M.J. Ashby P. Ataliotis P. Spicer D.B. Cooke J. Tickle C. Mech.

Kosman D. Bier E. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). D-Mef2 and most likely also Tinman are induced by direct binding of Drosophila Twist (D-Twist) homodimers to enhancer E-boxes (23Lee Y.M. Park T. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17531-17541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Yin Z. Xu X.L. Frasch M.

D-Twist thus induces cellular differentiation by direct transcriptional activation. It was therefore surprising that the mouse homologs Twist1 and Twist2 did not specify cellular differentiation but actually inhibited myogenic differentiation (27Hebrok M. Wertz K. Füchtbauer E.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 28Gong X.Q. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12310-12317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that Twist proteins directly inhibit a number of myogenic transactivators including the bHLH factors MyoD1 and Myf5, the MADS transcription factor Mef2, and the acetylating co-activators p300/CBP and PCAF (10Hebrok M. Füchtbauer A. Füchtbauer E.-M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B.

Cell. 1999; 96: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The mammalian Twist proteins thus utilize several mechanisms to inhibit transcriptional activation of myogenic targets. The mammalian Twist proteins also directly inhibit the transactivation domain of the Dorsal homolog NFκB (31Sosic D. Richardson J.A. Yu K. Ornitz D.M. Olson E.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 169-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), thereby providing a negative feedback, which contrasts the D-Twist/Dorsal synergy observed in Drosophila. Twist1 also functions as a proto-oncogene by protecting cells from p53-dependent apoptosis (32Maestro R. Tos A.P.D. Hamamori Y. Krasnokutsky S. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Doglioni C. Beach D.H. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2207-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The direct inhibition of the p53 transactivation domain by Twist1 and E1A (30Hamamori Y. Sartorelli V.

Cell. 1999; 96: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) suggests inhibition of the p300/PCAF co-activators. These co-activators are also involved in myogenic transactivation (33Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y. Graessmann A. Nakatani Y. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 34Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), where they indeed are directly inhibited by Twist1 (30Hamamori Y. Sartorelli V. Ogryzko V. Puri P.L. Wu H.Y. Wang J.Y. Nakatani Y. Kedes L. Cell. 1999; 96: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In addition to its anti-apoptotic function, Twist1 plays a role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In epithelial-derived tumors, overexpression of Twist1 results in epithelial-mesenchymal transition due to down-regulation of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and up-regulation of mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin (35Yang J. Mani S.A. Donaher J.L. Ramaswamy S. Itzykson R.A. Come C. Savagner P. Gitelman I. Richardson A. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3068) Google Scholar), which is directly up-regulated by Twist1 (36Alexander N.R. Tran N.L. Rekapally H. Summers C.E. Glackin C. Heimark R.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Also, other tumor-related genes such as akt2 and gli1 have been suggested to be targets of Twist1 mediated up-regulation (37Villavicencio E.H. Yoon J.W. Frank D.J. Füchtbauer E.M. Walter-house D.O. Iannaccone P.M. genesis. 2002; 32: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Cheng G.Z. Chan J. Wang Q. Zhang W. Sun C.D. Wang L.H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Twist1 therefore promotes development of malignant tumors by supplementing the anti-apoptotic role with an increased rate of metastasis. Consistently, Twist1 has been shown to be overexpressed in several types of cancer (32Maestro R. Tos A.P.D. Hamamori Y. Krasnokutsky S. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Doglioni C. Beach D.H. Hannon G.J.

Tsuneyoshi M. Tanaka M. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 120: 1634-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the function of Twist1 as an inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition may reflect a role in embryonic development (44Füchtbauer E.M. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 45Chen Z.F. Behringer R.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 686-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), particularly during the migration of neural crest cells (46O'Rourke M.P. Tam P.P. Int. J. Dev.

In humans and mice, the haploid insufficiency of Twist1 results in a variety of developmental defects described in humans as Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (48Howard T.D. Paznekas W.A. Green E.D. Chiang L.C. Ma N. Ortiz de Luna R.I. Garcia Delgado C. Gonzalez-Ramos M. Kline A.D. Jabs E.W. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 49El Ghouzzi V. Le Merrer M.

The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome frequently includes cranial malformations, which suggests an involvement of Twist1 in the cranial formation. Furthermore, Twist1 and Twist2 both inhibit osteogenic differentiation (51Funato N. Ohtani K. Ohyama K. Kuroda T. Nakamura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7416-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 52Lee M.S. Lowe G. Flanagan S. Kuchler K. Glackin C.A. Bone. 2000; 27: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by direct inhibition of the osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 (53Bialek P. Kern B. Yang X. Schrock M. Sosic D. Hong N. Wu H. Yu K. Ornitz D.M. Olson E.N. Justice M.J. Karsenty G. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), of which transcription is also induced by Twist1 (54Yousfi M. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In summary, the majority of activities assigned to the mammalian Twist proteins indicates inhibitory functions in a number of different processes. In contrast to these antagonizing functions of Twist1, a positive correlation has in several contexts been found between the expression of Twist1 and the osteogenic factor FGFR2 (55Rice D.P. Aberg T. Chan Y. Tang Z. Kettunen P.J. Pakarinen L. Maxson R.E. Thesleff I. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1845-1855PubMed Google Scholar, 56Guenou H. Kaabeche K. Mee S.L. Marie P.J. Hum. Mol.

Dyn. 2006; 235: 1345-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consequently, the mammalian Twist proteins most likely function as inducers in the early phases and inhibitors in later differentiation, thereby playing a dual role in osteogenesis. A direct transactivation of mammalian FGFRs would parallel observations from invertebrates, where positive targets of Twist in Drosophila include the FGFR Heartless (21Shishido E. Higashijima S. Emori Y. Saigo K. Development (Camb.). 1993; 117: 751-761PubMed Google Scholar), and in Caenorhabditis elegans, the FGFR egl-15 (58Harfe B.D. Vaz Gomes A. Kenyon C. Liu J. Krause M. Fire A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2623-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the transactivation appears to be mediated by homodimers of D-Twist (26Castanon I. Von Stetina S. Kass J. Baylies M.K. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3145-3159PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in C. elegans, heterodimers of CeTwist and E-proteins (Daughterless) most likely mediate the transactivation (58Harfe B.D. Vaz Gomes A. Kenyon C. Liu J. Krause M. Fire A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2623-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 59Corsi A.K. Brodigan T.M. Jorgensen E.M. Krause M. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2761-2772PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, homodimers of Twist1 up-regulate transcription of FGFR2 and periostin, whereas transcription of thrombospondin is induced by heterodimers of Twist1 and E12 (57Connerney J. Andreeva V. Leshem Y. Muentener C. Mercado M.A. Spicer D.B. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 1345-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 60Oshima A. Tanabe H. Yan T. Lowe G.N. Glackin C.A. Kudo A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The choice of E-box target sequences may thus be determined by the dimerization partner. When Twist genes from C. elegans, Drosophila, and human were expressed in Drosophila imaginal wing discs, distinct functional differences were observed (61Gullaud M. Delanoue R. Silber J. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the different Twist proteins have functionally diverged, properties such as the positive regulation of FGFRs are apparently conserved. It should, however, be noted that transactivation of proposed Twist1 target genes is not necessarily direct. Twist1 could inhibit the induction of a repressor and thereby increase transcription of “indirect target genes.” Such an indirect up-regulation by Twist1 has been reported (27Hebrok M. Wertz K. Füchtbauer E.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and a direct assay is needed to rule out this possibility. Here we report a mechanism of direct transcriptional activation by murine Twist1. We provide evidence that in mammalian cells, Twist1-E12 complexes bind E-box elements and thereby activate transcription. We further identify a transactivation domain in the C terminus of Twist1, which functions independently of and more potently than the E12 activation domain AD2. Finally, we have identified three specific residues essential for the transactivating function of murine Twist1. The spacing of these residues suggests that the activation domain adopts an α-helical structure. Gene-specific Reporters—The pCaSpeR-Tinman::lacZ (pTinE1/E2/E3, courtesy of Dr. M. Frasch) was used as a Twist-responsive reporter (24Yin Z. Xu X.L. Frasch M. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 4971-4982PubMed Google Scholar). From this reporter, which contains three Tinman E-boxes, constructs pTinE1/E2, pTinE3, and placZ were made, which contained two, one, and no Tinman E-boxes, respectively (see Fig. 1B for details). The pCaSpeR-Mef2::lacZ (courtesy Dr. R. Cripps) was used as an alternative Twist-responsive reporter (25Cripps R.M. Black B.L. Zhao B. Lien C.L. Schulz R.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 422-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The pMyf4::CAT (pMyf4, courtesy Dr. H. H. Arnold) was used as a myogenic reporter (62Salminen A. Braun T. Buchberger A. Jurs S. Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Expression Vectors—The pEMSV scribe α2 (pEMSV (63Harland R. Weintraub H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)) plasmid served as expression vector for all transfactors used in this study. Expression vectors for Twist1 deletion constructs were constructed by PCR-directed strategies on pEMSV Twist (10Hebrok M. Füchtbauer A. Füchtbauer E.-M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) followed by conventional cloning. Residues of the murine Twist1 (GenBank™ accession number AAH83139) expressed by these constructs include amino acids 2–206 (nlsTw), 113–206 (nlsTwΔNT), 2–166 (nlsTwΔCT), 2–111 (nlsTwNT), 113–169 (nlsTwbHLH), and 170–206 (nlsTwCT), respectively. Each truncated mutant was preceded by a start codon followed by an SV40 nuclear localization signal (MDPKKKRKLRSTP-, nls). As a positive control for activation, D-Twist was used. For comparing expression levels, the D-Twist CDS was cloned from pCS2 D-Twist (courtesy Dr. A. Firulli) into the EcoRI site of pEMSV. For expression of a dimerization partner for the murine Twist1, the previously described pEMSV E12 (2Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) was used. A full-length E12 CDS was cloned from pcDNA3 E12WT (courtesy Dr. R. Benezra) into the EcoRI site of pEMSV. In addition, an expression vector was constructed by conventional cloning for expression of an E12 mutant devoid of the entire N-terminal region. Residues of the human E12 factor (E2A, GenBank accession number AAA61146) expressed by these three constructs include amino acids 217–654 (E12), 1–654 (E12WT), and 415–654 (E12ΔNT), respectively. Constructs for expression of Twist1 and E12 factors tethered by a flexible (GGGS)5-polylinker were made by conventional cloning, linking the following polypeptides: 1–206Twist1∼2–206Twist1 (Tw∼Tw), 1–206Twist1∼227–654E12 (Tw∼E12), 217–654E12∼2–206Twist1 (E12∼Tw), and 217–654E12∼227–654E12 (E12∼E12), respectively. Specific point mutations were introduced into Twist1 and E12 expression vectors using QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on pEMSV templates. The coding region of each construct was verified by sequencing to contain only the desired point mutation (BigDye 3, Applied Biosystems). The pEMSV Myf5 construct (64Braun T. Buschhausen-Denker G. Bober E. Tannich E. Arnold H.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), which expresses human Myf5 (GenBank accession number AAH69373), served as positive control for transactivation of the myogenic reporter. In addition, constructs were made for expression of a C-terminally truncated Myf5 (residues 1–126, Myf5ΔCT) and a Myf5ΔCTTwCT fusion factor (residues 1–134Myf5∼165–206Twist1). The pEMSV Myf5ΔCT and pEMSV Myf5-TwCT were constructed by PCR-directed strategies on pEMSV Myf5. An expression vector for firefly luciferase (Luc) was constructed by conventional cloning of the Luc CDS from pGL3-Control (Promega) into pEMSV. Similarly, an expression vector for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was constructed by conventional cloning of the EGFP CDS from pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) into pEMSV. The two vectors were used as quantitative (Luc) and visual (EGFP) controls, respectively. The HT1080 human cell line (65Rasheed S. Nelson-Rees W.A. Toth E.M. Arnstein P. Gardner M.B.

Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar) were each propagated in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) and sodium pyruvate (1%). One day prior to transfection, cells were trypsinized and distributed in a density that, upon overnight incubation, would yield cells at ∼50% confluence. The transfections were performed using a mix of 1.0 μg of reporter plasmid, 1.0 μg of E12 (or empty) expression vector, 1.0 μg of Twist1 (or empty) expression vector, and 0.25 μg each of the Luc and EGFP expression vectors. Cells evenly distributed in triplicate 35-mm wells were accordingly transfected with a total of 3.5 μg of DNA per triplicate. HT1080 cells were transfected using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, the medium was changed to growth medium. After a 24-h incubation, the cells were collected and harvested. C2C12 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight incubation in growth conditions, the medium was changed to differentiation conditions (2% fetal calf serum). The cells were collected 48 h later and harvested. Confluent cells were harvested in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1.0 m EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, resuspended in 50 μl of Tris-HCl (0.25 m, pH 8.0) per 35-mm dish, and lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles. After centrifugation, the soluble supernatant was used for analysis. For quantification of lacZ reporter activity, β-galactosidase assays were performed on 5–10 μl of cellular extract using the Galacton system (Applied Biosystems) (67Jain V.K. Magrath I.T. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase assays were performed on 5–10 μl of cellular extract using 50 μl of 10% luciferase assay reagent (Promega) in Tris-HCl (0.25 m, pH 8.0) and measured immediately with a luminometer. Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase assays were performed as described previously (68Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Quantification of Luc expressed from a co-transfected MSV-driven reporter plasmid demonstrated that transfection efficiencies differed insignificantly within a single setup. Also, transfection efficiencies both within single setups and between independent setups were estimated visually (EGFP) to be highly similar. Within single setups, the activity of the gene-specific reporter was therefore used directly as a measure for transcriptional activation, whereas independent assays were correlated by setting the average Twist1-E12 transactivation to 100% (each assay included 4–6 measurements; five independent assays thus represent 20–30 measurements). The E-box E3 sequence of Tinman was used to design a double-stranded oligonucleotide (ccccccCAACATATGGCGcccccc, Tinman sequence in capitals, E-box underlined), which served as probe for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled by kinase reaction using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and then mixed, denatured, and annealed. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed on a spin column (Qiagen nucleotide removal Kit). EMSAs were performed in 20-μl binding reactions as described previously (4Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). For supershift assays, 0.5 μl of specific antibody was added. For competition assays, 5.0 pmol of unlabeled double-stranded probe with either a WT or a mutated (ccccccCAATCTGAAGCGcccccc, mutated bases underlined) E-box was added. Western blot assays were performed according to standard protocols using E12-CT (V-14: sc349)-, Twist1-CT (C-17: sc6269)-, or Twist1-NT (N-19: sc6070)-specific primary antibodies in recommended dilutions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies (Dako) were used as secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit for V-14 and anti-goat for C17/N19, respectively. Chemiluminescence detection reactions were performed using ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). T"

ITF2357 0.1 μM blocked proliferation and induced apoptosis in AML1/ETO-positive Kasumi-1 cells, while AML1/ETO-negative HL60, THP1 and NB4 cell lines were sensitive only to 1 μM ITF2357. Apoptosis was induced by 0.1 μM ITF2357 in AML1/ETO-positive primary blasts and U937-A/E cells induced to express AML1/ETO, but not in U937-A/E cells non-expressing AML1/ETO. In Kasumi-1 cells 0.1 μM ITF2357 induced AML1/ETO degradation through a caspase-dependent mechanism. ITF2357 0.1 μM also determined DNMT1 efflux from, and p300 influx to, the nucleus. Moreover, 0.1 μM ITF2357 determined local H4 acetylation and release of DNMT1, HDAC1 and AML1/ETO, paralleled by recruitment of p300 to the IL-3 gene promoter. ITF2357 treatment, however, did not induce re-expression of IL-3 gene. Accordingly, the methylation level of IL-3 promoter, as well as of several other genes, was unmodified. In conclusion, ITF2357 emerged as an anti-leukaemic agent very potent on AML cells, and on AML1/ETO-positive cells in particular. More relevantly, clearly emerged from our results that ITF2357 could be an ideal agent to treat AML subtypes presenting AML1/ETO fusion protein which determine HDAC involvement in leukaemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2012276222,"Human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a cell surface adhesion molecule member of the Immunoglobulin Superfamily (IgSF). Aberrant upregulation of CEA is a common feature found in a wide variety of human cancers such as colon, breast and lung. Previous in vitro and in vivo results have demonstrated that CEA can have tumorigenic effects including the inhibition of cell differentiation and anoikis, a specific type of apoptosis triggered by the absence of extracellular matrix–cell contacts. In the present work, we investigate the involvement of the caspase cascade in CEA-mediated inhibition of anoikis and the structural requirements for this signal. Expression of CEA and/or a chimeric protein consisting of the NCAM extracellular domain attached to the CEA-GPI anchor correlates with an early inactivation of caspase-9 and activation of the PI3-K/Akt survival pathway, and at later times, inactivation of caspase-8. The CEA-mediated caspase inactivation as well as activation of Akt was not observed by expression of a CEA molecule incapable of self-binding (ΔNCEA). These results suggest that the intrinsic caspase pathway is involved in the inhibitory effects of anoikis by CEA and this signal is dependent on the presence of self-adhesive extracellular domains and a CEA-GPI anchor."
https://openalex.org/W2083249050,"The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) has the dual capability to negatively regulate both E2F-induced cell cycle entry and E2F1-induced apoptosis. In this report, we characterize a unique pRB-E2F1 interaction. Using mutagenesis to disrupt E2F1 binding, we find that the ability of pRB to regulate E2F1-induced apoptosis is diminished when this interaction is lost. Strikingly, this mutant form of pRB retains the ability to control E2F responsive cell cycle genes and blocks cell proliferation. These functional properties are the reciprocal of a previously described E2F binding mutant of pRB that interacts with E2F1, but lacks the ability to interact with other E2Fs. Our work shows that these distinct interactions allow pRB to separately regulate E2F-induced cell proliferation and apoptosis. This suggests a novel form of regulation whereby separate types of binding contacts between the same types of molecules can confer distinct functional outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2089607336,"The expression of bacterial virulence genes is tightly controlled by the convergence of multiple extracellular signals. As a zoonotic pathogen, virulence gene regulation in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium must be responsive to multiple cues from the general environment as well as from multiple niches within animal and human hosts. Previous work has identified combined magnesium and phosphate limitation as an environmental cue that activates genes required for intracellular virulence. One unanswered question is how virulence genes that are expressed within the host are inhibited in non-host environments that satisfy the phosphate and magnesium limitation cues. We report here that thermosensing is the major mechanism controlling incongruous activation of the intracellular virulence phenotype. Bacteria grown at 30 °C or lower were unable to activate the intracellular type III secretion system even under strong inducing signals such as synthetic medium, contact with macrophages, and exposure to the murine gut. Thermoregulation was fully recapitulated in a Salmonella bongori strain engineered to contain the intracellular virulence genes of S. enterica sv. Typhimurium, suggesting that orthologous thermoregulators were available. Accordingly, virulence gene repression at the nonpermissive temperature required Hha and H-NS, two nucleoid-like proteins involved in virulence gene control. The use of combined environmental cues to control transcriptional “logic gates” allows for transcriptional selectivity of virulence genes that would otherwise be superfluous if activated in the non-host environment. Thus, thermosensing by Salmonella provides integrated control of host niche-specific virulence factors.

Thus, thermosensing by Salmonella provides integrated control of host niche-specific virulence factors. Salmonellae are Gram-negative bacteria that infect humans and animals using virulence factors that promote invasiveness and intracellular survival. Such zoonoses frequently cause gastroenteritis, but the spectrum of disease can include major extraintestinal morbidity following systemic spread. Costs associated with human salmonellosis in the United States are in the several billion dollar range (1World Health Organization Drug-resistant Salmonella, Report 139. Geneva, Switzerland2005: 1-4Google Scholar), making this pathogen an enormous economic and public health problem. One of the major virulence factors in Salmonella enterica is a type III secretion system (T3SS) 3The abbreviations used are: T3SS, type III secretion system; SPI-2, Salmonella pathogenicity island 2; LPM, low phosphate and magnesium; RIVET, recombinase-based in vivo expression technology; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome. encoded in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2). This horizontally acquired genomic island contains genes whose products activate and assemble the T3SS that is required during intracellular infection (2Hensel M. Shea J.E. Waterman S.R. Mundy R.

SPI-2 T3SS activity directs intraphagosomal bacteria to a protective compartment within host cells by disengaging these vacuoles from the classical phagosome maturation pathway that terminates at lysosome fusion and degradation of vacuolar contents. Activation of the SPI-2 T3SS is achieved in part by the genetically linked two-component regulatory system comprising a sensor kinase, SsrA, and a response regulator, SsrB (7Garmendia J. Beuzon C.R. Ruiz-Albert J. Holden D.W. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Worley M.J. Ching K.H. Heffron F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). One barrier to bacteria benefiting from horizontal gene transfer is appropriate integration of new genes into the regulatory circuits of the host bacterium. To understand this problem, we have been studying the regulation of the SPI-2 T3SS and characterizing the positive activators (9Coombes B.K. Brown N.F. Valdez Y. Brumell J.H. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49804-49815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and repressors (10Silphaduang U. Mascarenhas M. Karmali M. Coombes B.K. J.

Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have determined that this system is activated in vitro by acidification of culture medium containing micromolar concentrations of Mg2+ and PO3–4 ions. To understand the virulence associated with S. enterica sv. Typhimurium, we are interested in defining the full range of environmental signals necessary to activate intracellular virulence in this organism. Temperature is one environmental cue sensed by bacterial pathogens (13Hurme R. Rhen M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Goransson M. Sonden B. Nilsson P. Dagberg B. Forsman K. Emanuelsson K. Uhlin B.E. Nature. 1990; 344: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 15Umanski T. Rosenshine I. Friedberg D.

Microbiol. 2002; 291: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); however, the role of thermoregulation of the Salmonella Typhimurium SPI-2 virulence system has not been addressed. We report here that environmental cues such as low phosphate and magnesium, interaction with host cells, and exposure to intestinal contents is not sufficient for induction of intracellular virulence genes in S. enterica sv. Typhimurium. A necessary environmental cue accompanying these other signals is mammalian body temperature, and we determine that the intracellular virulence phenotype is strictly thermoregulated by the SsrA-SsrB activator system and two nucleoid-like repressor proteins, Hha and H-NS (10Silphaduang U. Mascarenhas M. Karmali M. Coombes B.K. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Madrid C. Nieto J.M. Juarez A. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The strict requirement of mammalian body temperature for virulence gene activation in this pathogen thus prevents premature expression of virulence genes in non-host environments that may happen to satisfy the phosphate and magnesium limitation cues but that would be incongruent with virulence-associated type III secretion. We suggest that thermosensing is an evolutionary strategy used by Salmonella to coordinate environmental cues at the cell surface and activate appropriate promoter elements controlling niche-specific virulence factors. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Routine propagation of Salmonella was in LB broth supplemented with antibiotics as appropriate. When used, antibiotic concentrations were as follows: streptomycin, 50 μg ml–1; tetracycline, 12 μg ml–1; chloramphenicol, 10 μg ml–1; ampicillin, 100 μg ml–1. Salmonella mutants were isogenic derivatives of the wild type strain SL1344 (S. enterica serovar Typhimurium). SL1344 PsseA::pPsseA-tnpR-lacZ ushA::cat was used for recombinase-based transcriptional reporter experiments and has been described elsewhere (18Brown N.F. Vallance B.A. Coombes B.K. Valdez Y. Coburn B.A. Finlay B.B. Plos Pathog. 2005; 1: e32Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Salmonella bongori SARC12 containing a bacterial artificial chromosome encoding the SPI-2 genomic island (pB6) was obtained from Dr. Michael Hensel (Erlangen, Germany) (19Hansen-Wester I.

Open table in a new tab Protein Expression Assays—Overnight cultures of Salmonella were washed in LPM and subcultured (1:50) into LPM at 37, 30, or 25 °C with shaking for 5 h (9Coombes B.K. Brown N.F. Valdez Y. Brumell J.H. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49804-49815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Whole bacterial cells were solubilized in SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 200 mm dithiothreitol) adjusted according to the optical density of the culture. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using mouse anti-hemagglutinin antibody clone HA.11 (1:1000, Cedarlane Laboratories), mouse anti-DnaK antibody (1:5000, StressGen), rabbit anti-SseB antiserum (1:2000), and mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody clone M2 (1:2000, Sigma). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and detected using chemiluminescence. Transcriptional Reporter Experiments—Transcriptional activity of the sseA promoter within SPI-2 was examined using a chemiluminescent β-galactosidase assay (10Silphaduang U. Mascarenhas M. Karmali M. Coombes B.K. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and recombinase-based in vivo expression technology reporters (18Brown N.F. Vallance B.A. Coombes B.K. Valdez Y. Coburn B.A. Finlay B.B. Plos Pathog. 2005; 1: e32Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). First, sseA promoter activity was examined using transcriptional fusions to lacZ and a chemiluminescence assay described previously (10Silphaduang U. Mascarenhas M. Karmali M. Coombes B.K. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, a single copy chromosomal fusion of lacZ to the sseA promoter (PsseA::lacZ) was constructed in wild type Salmonella and various mutants by homologous recombination. Reporter strains were cultured overnight in LB medium containing ampicillin and then washed in either LB or LPM medium and subcultured in fresh medium. Cultures were incubated with shaking at 225 rpm at 37 or 25 °C. Relative light units of β-galactosidase activity were measured in either white microtiter plates (for experiments performed in noninducing medium) or black microtiter plates (for experiments performed in LPM) using a top-reading plate luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To facilitate direct comparisons between strains, β-galactosidase activity was normalized to the optical density of the paired culture. H-NS Dominant-negative Assay for the Thermoregulation of SsrB-FLAG—Plasmids pMPM-T6Ω, pT6-HNS-WT, and pT6-HNS-Q92am (Table 1) were introduced into S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 (ssrB::3xFLAG). The resulting transformants were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB with shaking. Cultures were then washed and subcultured into 3 ml of LPM medium as described above for protein assays, in the presence or absence of 0.1% arabinose to induce dominant-negative hns expression. Total protein extracts from lysed bacterial cells were probed by Western blot using monoclonal anti-FLAG® M2 antibody (1:2000; Sigma) and anti-maltose-binding protein antibody (1:10,000; New England Biolabs). Recombinase-based in Vivo Expression and Infection of Murine Macrophages—RAW264.7 cells were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The day prior to infection, 5 × 105 cells were seeded into 24-well cell culture plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transcriptional reporter activity using RIVET strains (18Brown N.F. Vallance B.A. Coombes B.K. Valdez Y. Coburn B.A. Finlay B.B. Plos Pathog. 2005; 1: e32Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), RAW264.7 macrophage cells were infected with opsonized stationary-phase S. enterica sv. Typhimurium RIVET strains for 30 min at 4 °C and then washed and shifted to either 37 or 25 °C. Intracellular bacteria were harvested at various time points as indicated by selective lysis of macrophages with 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS. Bacteria were plated on streptomycin-containing medium and then replica stamped onto chloramphenicol medium to calculate resolution. For RIVET reporter experiments using tissue from the murine intestine, small and large intestine was harvested from C57BL/6 mice and placed into ice-cold sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Tissues were immediately homogenized, diluted, and incubated with S. enterica sv. Typhimurium RIVET reporter strains for various times at either 37 or 25 °C. Resolution was determined as described above. Expression of Intracellular Virulence Genes Is Thermoregulated in S. enterica sv. Typhimurium—The SPI-2 T3SS of S. enterica sv. Typhimurium is a horizontally acquired genomic island needed for virulence in the mammalian host environment (21Morgan E. Campbell J.D. Rowe S.C. Bispham J. Stevens M.P. Bowen A.J. Barrow P.A.

During our work with temperature-sensitive σ factor mutants of Salmonella, we took notice of a temperature dependence for expression of the SPI-2-encoded T3SS. To further understand the environmental cues controlling intracellular virulence, we cultured wild type S. enterica sv. Typhimurium and mutants lacking either the SsrA sensor kinase or the SsrB response regulator in LPM synthetic medium that is a potent activator of SPI-2 gene expression (9Coombes B.K. Brown N.F. Valdez Y. Brumell J.H. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49804-49815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown at 37 and 25 °C or shifted from 25–37 °C for 5 h and examined for the production of SseB, a SPI-2 protein that encodes part of the needle complex of the intracellular T3SS. Wild type bacteria grown at 37 °C or those shifted from 25 to 37 °C showed a rapid accumulation of SseB (Fig. 1A). In contrast, SseB was detected weakly in whole cell lysates (Fig. 1A) and was undetectable from the secreted protein fraction (data not shown) from bacteria cultured at 25 °C even under these strong inducing conditions. In contrast, DnaK expression was similar at both temperatures. SseB production at the permissive temperature required the SsrA sensor kinase and SsrB response regulator because SseB was absent in mutants deleted for ssrA or ssrB. S. bongori is a Salmonella species that lacks the SPI-2 genomic island and is a commensal of cold-blooded animals. To confirm the thermoregulation of the SPI-2 T3SS, we used an S. bongori strain engineered to contain the SPI-2 genomic island, including SsrA-SsrB, on a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (3Coombes B.K. Lowden M.J. Bishop J.L. Wickham M.E. Brown N.F. Duong N. Osborne S. Gal-Mor O. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Hansen-Wester I. Chakravortty D. Hensel M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2879-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). S. bongori containing an empty BAC (pBelo) did not express SseB as expected because it lacks SPI-2. However, upon transfer of SPI-2 to S. bongori, temperature-dependent accumulation of SseB was recapitulated (Fig. 1B), similar to that observed in S. enterica sv. Typhimurium. We hypothesized that lack of SseB at the nonpermissive temperature was the result of reduced transcriptional activity of the sseB promoter element (PsseA) (9Coombes B.K. Brown N.F. Valdez Y. Brumell J.H. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49804-49815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To address this, we constructed a transcriptional fusion of PsseA to lacZ and integrated a single copy into the S. enterica sv. Typhimurium chromosome. Reporter bacteria grown in inducing LPM medium showed high level expression of β-galactosidase at 37 °C and upon shifting from 25 to 37 °C. However, β-galactosidase reporter activity was not induced in bacteria grown at 25 °C or at any temperature when we introduced an ssrB deletion into the reporter strain (Fig. 2A). To show that thermoregulation was not specific to the sseA promoter, we constructed another transcriptional fusion that reports on promoter activity from the sseE promoter (9Coombes B.K. Brown N.F. Valdez Y. Brumell J.H. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49804-49815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and we performed a time course of β-galactosidase activity in reporter strains grown at different temperatures. No transcriptional activity was detected from the sseE promoter when the reporter strain was cultured at 25 °C; however, temperature-inducible activity was detected in a similar manner to PsseA when the strains were grown at 37 °C or shifted to this temperature after preincubation at 25 °C (Fig. 2B). Previous studies showed that S. enterica sv. Typhimurium grown in medium that is noninducing for SPI-2 activity (LB or LPM, pH 7.0) could activate gene expression within SPI-2, but this activity was detectable only after prolonged growth, and the mechanism behind this was thought to be simply transition into stationary phase (9Coombes B.K. Brown N.F. Valdez Y. Brumell J.H. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49804-49815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Silphaduang U. Mascarenhas M. Karmali M. Coombes B.K. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test whether this SPI-2 activity was also thermoregulated, we grew the wild type sseA::pPsseA-lacZ reporter strain overnight in LB at 25 °C, split the culture into fresh LB, and shifted it to either 37 °C or kept it at 25 °C until stationary phase was reached for both cultures. β-Galactosidase activity and culture optical density was monitored in the cells over time. As expected (10Silphaduang U. Mascarenhas M. Karmali M. Coombes B.K. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), sseA promoter activity increased in bacteria growing at 37 °C in LB as the culture density increased (Fig. 2C). This activity was strictly thermoregulated because cultures grown at 25 °C, although ultimately reaching similar densities to those at 37 °C, repressed SPI-2 transcriptional activity throughout the course of the experiment (Fig. 2C). Together, these data establish mammalian body temperature as a major environmental cue driving expression of intracellular virulence factors that are critical for S. enterica sv. Typhimurium pathogenesis. Thermoregulation of the Horizontally Acquired Response Regulator, SsrB—Thermoregulation of some bacterial genes is controlled by the nucleoid-associated transcriptional repressor, H-NS. Because activation of the intracellular virulence regulon in S. enterica sv. Typhimurium requires the response regulator, SsrB, we designed experiments using an SL1344 ssrB::3xFLAG strain containing a mutant allele of hns to test whether thermoregulation of SPI-2 genes takes place at the level of SsrB expression. Deletion of hns has pleiotropic effects leading to toxicity in S. enterica sv. Typhimurium unless additional compensatory mutations are introduced (24Navarre W.W. Porwollik S. Wang Y. McClelland M. Rosen H. Libby S.J. Fang F.C. Science. 2006; 313: 236-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). We overcame this by choosing a dominant-negative strategy to examine the role of H-NS on SPI-2 gene expression. hnsQ92am is a dominant-negative hns mutant that gives rise to a C-terminal truncation at position 92 due to introduction of an amber mutation (25Ueguchi C. Suzuki T. Yoshida T. Tanaka K. Mizuno T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We constructed an hnsQ92am allele in pMPM-T6Ω for arabinose-inducible expression of H-NSMet1–Ala91 from the pBAD promoter and transferred the construct into SL1344 expressing SsrB-FLAG from the chromosome. At 37 °C, SsrB-FLAG was robustly expressed in a wild type strain containing the empty plasmid, pMPM-T6Ω, but was almost undetectable from the same strain grown at 25 °C, thus establishing thermoregulation of the response regulator (Fig. 3A). We then performed expression experiments in the presence of arabinose to induce expression of either wild type H-NS (pT6-HNS-wt) or the H-NSMet1–Ala91 dominant-negative mutant (pT6-HNS-Q92am). Under these conditions, thermoregulation of SsrB-FLAG was maintained in the presence of wild type H-NS, but the strain expressing the H-NSQ92am dominant-negative mutant exhibited a temperature-blind phenotype and accumulated SsrB-FLAG at 25 °C (Fig. 3A). Omitting arabinose from these cultures such that the dominant-negative H-NS was not expressed restored thermoregulation of SsrB. As well, overexpression of wild type H-NS with arabinose reduced by ∼50% the level of SsrB-FLAG from Salmonella grown at 37 °C and to undetectable levels when grown at 25 °C. In contrast, the expression of the maltose-binding protein, which was tested as a control, was not thermoregulated (Fig. 3A). Hha and H-NS, but Not YdgT, Thermoregulate Intracellular Virulence Genes—We speculated that the effect of H-NS on thermoregulation of SsrB would influence genes downstream of this response regulator. To test this we examined production of SseB, which lies downstream of the SsrB activation cascade, following expression of H-NSQ92am. SseB levels from whole cell lysates were examined by immunoblot following arabinose induction of H-NSQ92am at 25 and 37 °C. In accord with the regulation data for SsrB, SseB levels increased when H-NSQ92am was overexpressed at 37 °C and decreased when wild type H-NS was overexpressed (Fig. 3B). In addition, overexpression of H-NSQ92am caused a temperature-blind phenotype leading to SseB accumulation at the nonpermissive temperature of 25 °C, which could be corrected if the dominant-negative construct was not induced with arabinose (Fig. 3B). Several other small regulatory proteins are members of the nucleoid-like family of transcriptional regulators that includes H-NS (26Dorman C.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 27Tendeng C. Bertin P.N. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To understand further the molecular mechanism of thermoregulation, we turned our attention to two small nucleoid-like proteins, YdgT and Hha, which we have shown previously to repress transcription of SPI-2 genes (10Silphaduang U. Mascarenhas M. Karmali M. Coom"

HT-hi/diss and HT-lo/diss were compared by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses for mRNA and protein expression of nine MMPs (MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10, -13, and -14) and three TIMPs (TIMP-1, -2, and -3) in cultured cells in vitro and in primary tumors in vivo. MMP-1 and MMP-9 were more abundant in the HT-hi/diss variant, both in cultures and in tumors, whereas the HT-lo/diss variant consistently expressed higher levels of MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2. Small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 increased intravasation of HT-lo/diss cells. Coordinately, treatment of the developing HT-hi/diss tumors with recombinant TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 significantly reduced HT-hi/diss cell intravasation. However, a substantial increase of HT-hi/diss dissemination was observed upon small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of three secreted MMPs, including the interstitial collagenase MMP-1 and the two gelatinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9, but not the membrane-tethered MMP-14. The addition of recombinant pro-MMP-9 protein to the HT-hi/diss tumors reversed the increased intravasation of HT-hi/diss cells, in which MMP-9 was stably down-regulated by short hairpin RNA interference. This rescue did not occur if the pro-MMP-9 was stoichiometrically complexed with TIMP-1, pointing to a direct role of the MMP-9 enzyme in regulation of HT-hi/diss intravasation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that tumor-derived MMPs may have protective functions in cancer cell intravasation, i.e. not promoting but rather catalytically interfering with the early stages of cancer dissemination.

Functional activity of MMPs is tightly regulated through transcriptional and translational expression, proenzyme activation, and inhibition of activated enzymes by natural tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). There is much evidence that up-regulated expression of many MMPs and, paradoxically, TIMPs is correlated with tumor aggressiveness in various cancers. The pivotal role of the MMP/TIMP system in tumor metastasis has been clearly demonstrated for some of the initial steps of the metastatic cascade, including tumor invasion and angiogenesis (1Chantrain C.F.

However, depending on tissue context, individual MMPs and TIMPs have specific effects on the cell environment, either promoting or inhibiting various steps in tumor progression.Early events in tumor dissemination include intravasation, the process whereby cancer cells enter the vasculature. Although it appears to be a rate-limiting step of the metastatic cascade, studies of MMPs and TIMPs in intravasation are very limited. This limitation stems largely from the lack of quantitative experimental models to analyze intravasation in mammals. Most intravasation experimental systems are based on intravital imaging in mice and rats at the site of tumor development, requiring sophisticated equipment and software but not allowing for a straightforward quantitation of intravasation events nor direct pharmacological intervention (9Condeelis J. Segall J.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 10Condeelis J. Singer R.H. Segall J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Therefore, intravasation studies remain mainly observational albeit insightful, and the limited experimental manipulations have included a collection of invasive, but not intravasated, cells within primary tumors (12Wang W.

This model system, employing grafting of human cancer cells on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chick embryo, has been repeatedly and successfully utilized to examine early steps of the metastatic cascade, including tumor cell invasion, vasculotropism, and intravasation (14Scher C.

Within 4-7 days following grafting on the CAM, several types of human cancer cells develop aggressive primary tumors, from which tumor cells escape and enter the CAM vasculature. These escaped tumor cells can be detected in the distal portions of the CAM, which serves as a unique repository for intravasated cells. Subsequently, the disseminated tumor cells can be traced to the internal organs of the embryo such as liver, lungs, and bone marrow. The actual numbers of human tumor cells present in the chick embryo tissues can be determined by a quantitative PCR (qPCR) detecting Alu repeats unique for a primate genome (17Kim J. Yu W.

These two cell variants are characterized by high and low dissemination and therefore have been named HT-hi/diss and HT-lo/diss, respectively. They differ by 50-100-fold in their ability to intravasate to the CAM vasculature and metastasize to the internal organs such as liver and lungs. This tumor cell dissemination is partially MMP-dependent because the broad scale MMP inhibitor GM6001 (Ilomastat) effectively, but not completely, inhibits HT-hi/diss intravasation and metastasis (21Deryugina E.I.

The parental HT-1080 cell line was shown to express a wide repertoire of MMPs, including MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10, -13, and -14 and three TIMPs, including TIMP-1, -2, and -3 (26Tsuchiya Y.

Therefore, a comparison of our two HT-1080 intravasation variants, HT-hi/diss and HT-lo/diss, would be highly instructive for examining the possible role of individual tumor MMPs and TIMPs in the intravasation step of the metastatic cascade. In recent studies, activity-based protein profiling of HT-hi/diss and HT-lo/diss serine hydrolases has already implicated the ability of HT-hi/diss cells to activate uPA as one of the key determinants of their efficient intravasation (35Madsen M.A. Deryugina E.I. Niessen S. Cravatt B.F. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15997-16005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In this study, we performed an extensive MMP and TIMP gene and protein expression analysis of HT-hi/diss and HT-lo/diss, both in cell cultures and primary tumors. We identified significant differentials between the two intravasation variants in the expression levels of several MMPs, i.e. MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9, and two TIMPs, i.e. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. These results determined the overall strategy of a functional analysis for individual MMPs and TIMPs, i.e. using siRNA- and shRNA-mediated down-regulation of those proteins that were differentially overexpressed in the corresponding intravasation variant. Although down-regulation of TIMP-2 in HT-lo/diss significantly increased its dissemination, down-regulation of secreted tumor MMPs, namely interstitial collagenase MMP-1 and gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, repeatedly enhanced intravasation and metastasis of HT-hi/diss. Collectively, the findings of this study highlight pleiotropic and contrasting functions of the tumor MMP/TIMP system, including its ability to negatively regulate tumor cell intravasation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Culture Conditions—HT-hi/diss and HT-lo/diss cell variants were selected in vivo from HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma (ATCC, Manassas, VA) for a 50-100-fold differential in their ability to intravasate in the chick embryo model (21Deryugina E.I.

Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (D-10) in a humidified incubator in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The day before all experiments, the cells were passaged and, following an overnight incubation, detached with trypsin/EDTA solution, washed, and resuspended at a desirable concentration in serum-free DMEM (SF-DMEM).Human Tumor/Chick Embryo CAM Assay—Levels of intravasation and metastasis were analyzed in a chick embryo model essentially as described (21Deryugina E.I. Zijlstra A. Partridge J.J. Kupriyanova T.A. Madsen M.A. Papagiannakopoulos T. Quigley J.P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10959-10969Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, fertilized SPAFAS White Leghorn eggs (Charles River Laboratories, North Franklin, CT) were incubated in a humidified rotary incubator at 38 °C. On day 10 of incubation the CAM was dropped, and 0.4-1 × 106 cells were grafted on the CAM in a 25-μl volume. Following an additional 4-6 days of incubation, the embryos were sacrificed. The primary tumors were excised, weighed, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for gene and protein analyses or fixed in Zn-formalin (Fisher) and embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura FineteK, Inc., Torrance, CA) for histological examination. Portions of the distal CAM and liver were harvested, frozen on dry ice, and analyzed by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) to determine numbers of intravasated and metastasized human cells.Real Time PCR for Quantitative Detection of Human Tumor Cells—The number of human cells within chick embryo tissues was determined by qPCR of the Alu repeats (Alu-qPCR) as described (21Deryugina E.I. Zijlstra A. Partridge J.J. Kupriyanova T.A. Madsen M.A. Papagiannakopoulos T. Quigley J.P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10959-10969Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from harvested tissues using the Puregene kit (Genta Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Human Alu sequences were amplified by qPCR using 60 ng of genomic DNA as template in a 10-μl reaction, containing 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, 0.4 units of Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), 1:105 dilution of SYBR®Green dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and 0.4 μm of each Alu- sense (5′-ACGCCTGTAATCCCAGCACTT-3′) and Alu-anti-sense (5′-TCGCCCAGGCTGGAGTGCA-3′) primers. Alu- qPCR was carried out at 95 °C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Each assay included negative controls (water and samples of tissues from the embryos that have not received any human cells), a positive control (human genomic DNA), and experimental samples in duplicate. The number of tumor cells in each tissue sample was determined using a standard curve generated by a serial (10-fold) dilution of HT-1080 cells within a constant number (106) of chick embryo fibroblasts.Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total RNA was harvested from cell cultures or CAM tumors in 2-3 independent experiments and isolated with RNAqueous 4PCR (Ambion, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad), and the resulting cDNA library was diluted 100-fold. Specific primers for individual human MMPs and TIMPs (Table 1) were designed using the on-line Primer 3 software and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The sequence for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used to normalize the amount of total human cDNA. qRT-PCR was performed using an I-cycler real time PCR machine (Bio-Rad). Each reaction (a total volume of 25 μl) contained 5 μl of the diluted cDNA library as template, SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 0.4 μm each of forward and reverse primers. PCR conditions included heating for 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and then 30 s at 72 °C. A melt curve analysis was performed to ensure specific amplification. For each target gene, relative levels of expression were normalized using the GAPDH signal (ΔCt = |CtGAPDH - CtTarget|). Difference in the expression levels between the two HT-1080 variants was determined according to the following formula: 2ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = |ΔCtHT-hi/diss -ΔCtHT-lo/diss|. The differences from the qPCR of individual RNA preparations were statistically analyzed to get means ± S.E.TABLE 1Human MMPs and TIMPs analyzed by quantitative real time RT-PCR for gene expression and Western blotting for protein expressionGene name (other name)Primer sequence used in real time RT-PCR (forward and reverse)Antibody used in Western blotting (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IH) (host, clone, source; Ref.)MMP-1 (fibroblast collagenase)5′-ACAGCCCAGTACTTATTCCCTTTG-3′WB, mouse mAb 36665 (R & D Systems)5′-GGGCTTGAAGCTGCTTACGA-3′MMP-2 (gelatinase A)5′-CCCCAAAACGGACAAAGAG-3′WB, mouse mAb 42-5D11 (Calbiochem)5′-CACGAGCAAAGGCATCATCC-3′IH, mouse mAb VB3 (Calbiochem)MMP-3 (stromelysin-1)5′-GGAAGCTGGACTCCGACACTC-3′WB, mouse mAb 905 and goat Ab AF513 (R & D Systems)5′-TGGTGTATAATTCACAATCCTGTATGTAA-3′MMP-7 (matrilysin)5′-GGTCACCTACAGGATCGTATCATAT-3′WB, mouse mAb ID2 (Calbiochem)5′-CATCACTGCATTAGGATCAGAGGAA-3′MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase)5′-TGGACCCAATGGAATCCTTGC-3′WB, rabbit Ab RP1-MMP-8 (Triple Point Biologics)5′-ATAGCCACTCAGAGCCCAGTA-3′MMP-9 (gelatinase B)5′-CACTGTCCACCCCTCAGAGC-3′WB, mouse mAb 7-11C (72)5′-GCCACTTGTCGGCGATAAGG-3′IH, mouse mAb 8-3H (72)MMP-10 (stromelysin-2)5′-ATTTTGGCCCTCTCTTCCAT-3′WB, mouse mAb IVC5 (Lab Vision Corp.)5′-TTGTCCGCTGCAAAGAAGTA-3′MMP-13 (collagenase-3)5′-TTGTTGCTGCGCATGAGTTCG-3′WB, rabbit Ab RP2-MMP-13 (Triple Point Biologics)5′-GGGTGCTCATATGCAGCATCA-3′MMP-14 (MT1-MMP)5′-CGCTACGCCATCCAGGGTCTCAAA-3′WB, mouse mAb 114-IF2 (Calbiochem)5′-CGGTCATCATCGGGCAGCACAAAA-3′IH, rabbit Ab M 3927 against anti-hinge region (Sigma)TIMP-15′-GACGGCCTTCTGCAATTCC-3′WB, mouse mAb 7-6C1 (Calbiochem)5′-GTATAAGGTGGTCTGGTTGACTTCTG-3′TIMP-25′-GAGCCTGAACCACAGGTACCA-3′WB and IH, mouse mAb T2-101-5 (Oncogene)5′-TCTGTGACCCAGTCCATCCA-3′TIMP-35′-CCAGGACGCCTTCTGCAA-3′WB, mouse mAb 136-13H4 (Calbiochem)5′-CCCCTCCTTTACCAGCTTCTTC-3′GAPDH5′-TCAACGGATTTGGTCGTATTGGG-3′Not employed in this study5′-TGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Immunohistochemistry—Primary tumors were excised from the CAM of chick embryos at days 4-5 and were fixed in Zn-formalin and paraffin-embedded or frozen in the O.C.T. compound. Paraffin-embedded sections were used in staining with anti-MMP-9 and MMP-14 antibodies (Table 1) after antigen retrieval with the antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Frozen sections were fixed with cold methanol and used for MMP-2 and TIMP-2 staining with corresponding antibodies (Table 1). Tissue sections were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and blocked with PBS supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum. Sections were incubated with individual primary antibodies (10 μg/ml blocking solution) overnight at 4 °C, then with corresponding secondary biotinylated antibodies for 1 h, followed by incubation with avidin D-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min, and development with a diaminobenzidine chromogenic substrate. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Digital images were captured using the Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with a digital DVC video camera and processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software.Generation and Purification of Recombinant Pro-MMP-9-TIMP Complex—Human recombinant pro-MMP-9 (rMMP-9) was mixed with a 5 m excess of recombinant TIMP-1 (both a generous gift from Dr. R. Fridman, Wayne State University, School of Medicine, Detroit, MI), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The formed rMMP-9-TIMP-1 complexes were purified and separated from the unbound excess TIMP-1 by gelatin-Sepharose chromatography. Control preparation of rMMP-9 was prepared in an identical way except that TIMP-1 was omitted during preincubation. The proteins bound to gelatin-Sepharose were eluted with 10% Me2SO and analyzed by Western blotting and zymography.Western Blot Analysis and Zymography—Cell cultures were initiated in D-10; after reaching confluence, culture medium was changed for SF-DMEM and conditioned medium was harvested 18 or 48 h later. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed in modified RIPA (mRIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). To extract proteins from the primary CAM tumors, samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground, and lysed in mRIPA buffer. Equivalent amounts of proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml antibodies specific for human MMPs and TIMPs (Table 1). The blots were incubated with corresponding secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Pierce), and the proteins were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).To verify the presence of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the rMMP-9-TIMP-1 complexes eluted from gelatin-Sepharose, the membrane with the transblotted proteins was cut at approximately a 40-kDa level, and the upper portion was probed with MMP-9-specific mAb 7-11C, whereas the lower portion was probed with mAb against TIMP-1.For zymography, equal amounts of proteins eluted from gelatin-Sepharose or proteins from conditioned media, lysed cells, or primary tumors were separated on 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100, incubated overnight at 37 °C in 40 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, supplemented with 200 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (G-250) and destained in distilled water to visualize bands of gelatinolytic activity.MMP and TIMP Down-regulation by RNA Interference (RNAi)—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting individual MMPs and TIMPs were synthesized (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) against the human sequences indicated in Table 2. Negative control siRNA constructs with no known homology to mammalian genes included nonsilencing, nonspecific, and GFP sequences (Table 2). Transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with 10 or 100 nm of individual siRNAs using HiPerFect (Qiagen) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively. The siRNA-treated cells were harvested 18-24 h later, washed, resuspended in SF-DMEM, and used in further experiments.TABLE 2Target sequences for MMP and TIMP siRNA and shRNA constructsGeneTarget sequenceRef./SourceMMP-15′-AAGATGTGGACTTAGTCCAGA-3′51MMP-25′-AAGAACCAGATCACATACAGG-3′Designed by using Qiagen siRNA design toolMMP-95′-AACATCACCTATTGGATCCAA-3′73MMP-145′-AACAGGCAAAGCTGATGCAGA-3′51TIMP-15′-AAGATGTATAAAGGGTTCCAA-3′HP Genome Wide, Qiagen, catalog number SI00745318TIMP-25′-CAGGCACATTATGTAAACATA-3′HP Genome Wide, Qiagen, catalog number SI03071285Nonsilencing5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′Qiagen, catalog number 1022076Nonspecific5′-AAATTCTATCACTAGCGTGAC-3′74Scrambled5′-AAGTGATCAAGCACCGAAGAG-3′51GFP5′-CGGCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCAT-3′Qiagen catalog number 1022064 Open table in a new tab Stable suppression of MMP-9 was achieved by infection of HT-hi/diss cells with a lentiviral construct.

https://openalex.org/W2035633599,"The multizinc finger transcription factor Sall1 is a critical developmental regulator that mediates repression through the recruitment of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Although a short conserved peptide motif in Sall1 is sufficient to recruit NuRD, its ability to regulate native Sall1 target genes in vivo has not been demonstrated. In this report, we demonstrate an in vivo role for the Sall1 repression motif and describe a novel direct target gene of Sall1, Gbx2, that is directly repressed in a NuRD-dependent fashion. The ability of Sall1 to repress Gbx2 was impaired in Xenopus embryos expressing mutant forms of Sall1 that are defective for NuRD binding. Finally, we demonstrate that protein kinase C phosphorylates serine 2 of the Sall1 repression motif and reveal that a phosphomimetic mutation of serine 2 disrupts the ability of Sall1 to repress Gbx2 in cell culture and Xenopus embryos. Together, these studies establish that Sall1 recruits NuRD via the Sall1 repression motif to mediate repression of a native target gene and suggest a model in which dynamic control of gene expression by Sall1 is modulated by serine phosphorylation of the Sall1 repression motif."
https://openalex.org/W2157003093,"Oligopeptide repeats appear in many proteins that undergo conformational conversions to form amyloid, including the mammalian prion protein PrP and the yeast prion protein Sup35. Whereas the repeats in PrP have been studied more exhaustively, interpretation of these studies is confounded by the fact that many details of the PrP prion conformational conversion are not well understood. On the other hand, there is now a relatively good understanding of the factors that guide the conformational conversion of the Sup35 prion protein. To provide a general model for studying the role of oligopeptide repeats in prion conformational conversion and amyloid formation, we have substituted various numbers of the PrP octarepeats for the endogenous Sup35 repeats. The resulting chimeric proteins can adopt the [PSI+] prion state in yeast, and the stability of the prion state depends on the number of repeats. In vitro, these chimeric proteins form amyloid fibers, with more repeats leading to shorter lag phases and faster assembly rates. Both pH and the presence of metal ions modulate assembly kinetics of the chimeric proteins, and the extent of modulation is highly sensitive to the number of PrP repeats. This work offers new insight into the properties of the PrP octarepeats in amyloid assembly and prion formation.

Prions were originally recognized as the causative agent of several mammalian neurodegenerative disorders, including scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). According to the prion hypothesis, these maladies are due to a conformational conversion of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) 4The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular prion protein; PrPSc, pathological isoform of cellular prion protein; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; YPD, yeast peptone dextrose medium; AFM, atomic force microscopy; ThT, Thioflavin T; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; AFM, atomic force microscopy; ThT, thioflavin-T; SOD, superoxide dismutase. into an abnormal pathological isoform (PrPSc), a portion of which becomes highly resistant to proteinase-K digestion. Once prion formation is initiated (i.e. spontaneous conversion of cellular PrPC to PrPSc to generate infectivity), the PrPSc conformers can self-replicate by templating the conformational conversion of other PrPC molecules (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Several prion-like proteins identified in yeast can also perpetuate their conformational states through a protein-based templating mechanism. Instead of causing fatal diseases, however, the yeast prions are sometimes beneficial, and can act as protein-only elements of inheritance (2Shorter J. Lindquist S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). For instance, the yeast prion phenotype [PSI+] is the result of the self-replicating conformational conversion of the protein Sup35, a translation termination factor. In its prion conformation, Sup35 is sequestered from its normal function, resulting in increased read-through of nonsense codons. This read-through can ultimately confer a wide spectrum of heritable new phenotypes (3Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S.

In vitro the Sup35 prions can form amyloid fibers in a template-based reaction that is thought to parallel in vivo prion conformational conversion and is reminiscent of the fiber formation of a wide range of amyloidogenic proteins (2Shorter J. Lindquist S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The mammalian PrP and yeast Sup35 share several similar structural characteristics, including a well-folded C-terminal core and a natively unfolded N terminus. The N termini of both proteins contain oligopeptide repeats that influence their conformational conversion to the prion state (6Goldmann W. Chong A. Foster J. Hope J. Hunter N. J. Gen.

Sup35 with an expanded number of repeats, however, induces a new and stable prion state much more frequently than wild-type Sup35 (7Liu J.J. Lindquist S.

Oligopeptide repeats of various lengths and compositions appear in several other amyloid-forming proteins in addition to prion proteins.

The major and minor components of the Escherichia coli curli protein each consist of five 16-18 mer repeats, which are required for the formation of curli amyloid fibers and are involved in cell aggregation, biofilm formation, and surface adhesion (22Barnhart M.M. Chapman M.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 23Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J.

Although oligopeptide repeats are clearly a crucial feature of these amyloid-forming proteins, the exact structural and functional role of these repeats remains unclear. Compared with these other oligopeptide repeats, the biophysical properties of the PrP octarepeats are well characterized. The octarepeat of PrP can selectively bind Cu(II) ions (24Millhauser G.L. Accounts Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and the histidine residues in the octarepeats act as the primary anchor point for Cu(II) binding (24Millhauser G.L. Accounts Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Structurally, Cu(II) binding can induce a conformational conversion of PrPC into protease-resistant species (10Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. Biochemistry-US. 2005; 44: 6776-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and the efficiency of this conversion depends on the number of octarepeats (17Leliveld S.R. Dame R.T. Wuite G.J. Stitz L. Korth C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3268-3275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cu(II) ions combined with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) can even induce spontaneous conformational change and aggregation of HuPrP-(23-98), a variant that only contains the octarepeat region of human PrP (25Shiraishi N. Utsunomiya H. Nishikimi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34880-34887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Functionally, Cu(II) binding to the octarepeats induces PrPC endocytosis in neuronal cells, indicating a role for PrPC in Cu(II) sensing, uptake and/or transport (26Perera W.S. Hooper N.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activities have also been reported for the Cu(II)-bound PrPC, suggesting a neuronal function of PrPC as an anti-oxidant (27Jones S. Batchelor M. Bhelt D. Clarke A.R.

Treatment of scrapie-infected mice with Cu(II) chelator d-(-)-penicillamine (d-PEN) delays the onset of prion disease in mice (31Sigurdsson E.M. Brown D.R. Alim M.A. Scholtzova H. Carp R. Meeker H.C.

While the biophysical properties of the PrP repeats have been studied extensively, the role of the repeats in prion conformational conversion is not well understood, particularly because of the lack of knowledge on many details of PrP prion formation. One the other hand, the factors that guide prion conformational conversion have been best defined for Sup35. These factors include molecular chaperones that influence conformational conversion (32Shorter J. Lindquist S.

To provide a new model for studying prion conformational conversion and to better understand the role of the oligopeptide repeats in amyloid formation, we explored the role of the PrP octarepeats in the context of the yeast prion protein Sup35. We created chimeric proteins in which different numbers of hamster PrP repeats were substituted for the endogenous Sup35 repeats. Facilitated by the powerful genetic and biophysical techniques developed for yeast prions, we were able to characterize how the PrP octarepeats influence the conformational conversion and amyloid formation of these chimeric prion proteins both in vivo and in vitro. We find that increasing the number of PrP repeats in the chimeric proteins increases the spontaneous appearance of the [PSI+] phenotype in vivo and accelerates amyloid formation in vitro. Conformational conversion and amyloid formation by the chimeras are modulated by both pH and the presence of metal ions. Further, the manner in which these factors modulate conversion is highly sensitive to the number of PrP repeats. Our work offers new insight into the role of the PrP octarepeats in amyloid formation and prion formation, with implications for prion structure. It also allows us to control protein assembly by simply altering environmental conditions. This control will be useful for further functional and structural work and could provide a practical means of controlling assembly for biomaterial and biotechnology applications. Plasmid Construction and Gene Integration—A Sup35 integrative vector was constructed using pRS306 (41Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment spanning from 1360 nucleotides upstream of Sup35 through a5′-region of Sup35 with a BspE1 site after the first Sup35 repeat was amplified (PCR primers 5′-CGACGGTATCGATAAGCTTG-3′ and 5′-GATAGCCTCTAGATTGGTATCCGGAATAACCTTG-3′) and ligated into pRS306 between ClaI and XbaI sites. A second fragment spanning from Sup35 downstream from the repeats with an EagI site just after the repeats to 800 nucleotides downstream from Sup35 was amplified (PCR primers 5′-CAGCAATCTAGACCACAAGGCGGCCGTGGAAATTAC-3′ and 5′-CGAATTGGAGCTCTTACTCG-3′) and ligated into the plasmid between XbaI and SacI sites. This plasmid was sequenced through the entire Sup35 region, and was named pRS306Sup35R1. The first two PrP repeats were added to pRS306Sup35R1 by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides and inserting them between the BspE1 and EagI sites. To ensure high purity of these lengthy oligos, they were ordered PAGE-purified and phosphorylated from Research Genetics (oligo sequences 5′-CCGGATATCCACAAGGTGGAGGTACTTGGGGTCAACCCCATGGAGGTGGTTGGGGTCAACCACAAGGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCCTTGTGGTTGACCCCAACCACCTCCGGGTTGACCCCAAGTACCTCCACCTTGTGGATAT-3′), and contained a BstXI site. The resulting plasmid was named pRS306Sup35R1+2. Subsequent repeats were added by inserting annealed oligos encoding three PrP repeats in the BstXI site (oligo sequences 5′-GAGGTTGGGGTCAACCCCATGGAGGAGGTTGGGGTCAACCCCATGGAGGTGGTTGGGGTCAACCCCATGGAG-3′ and 5′-ATGGGGTTGACCCCAACCACCTCCATGGGGTTGACCCCAACCTCCTCCATGGGGTTGACCCCAACCTCCTCC-3′). The addition of one copy of these annealed oligos created pRS306Sup35R1+5. The oligos contained two BstXI sites, so digestion with BstXI and self-ligation created pRS306Sup35R1+4, while digestion with BstXI and insertion of another copy of the annealed oligos created pRS306Sup35R1+7. In a similar manner, pRS306Sup35R1+6 and pRS306Sup35R1+8 were created. All of these plasmids were sequenced through the repeat region to confirm accuracy. The plasmids for the R1+8H1Q chimera were created by the same method, inserting oligos encoding PrP repeats in which the histidines were changed to glutamines into pRS306Sup35R1+2 (oligo sequences 5′-GAGGTTGGGGTCAACCC CAAGGAGGAGGTTGGGGTCAACCCCAAGGAGGTGGTTGGGGTCAACCCCAAGGAG-3′ and 5′-TTGGGGTTGACCCCAACCACCTCCTT GGGGTTGACCCCAACCTCCTCCTTGGGGTTGACCCCAACCTCCTCC-3′). The plasmids pRS306Sup35R1+8H1Q was created in this manner and sequenced through the repeat region. Note that these plasmids still contained the one histidine that was present in the repeats in pRS306Sup35R1+2. Bacterial expression constructs for R1+4, R1+8, and R1+8H1Q were created by excising the repeat region from the corresponding integration constructs with BstEII and MscI and ligating it into these sites in the expression construct pJC25NMstop (42Scheibel T. Kowal A.S. Bloom J.D. Lindquist S.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 366-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These constructs were named pJC25R1+4stop, pJC25R1+8stop and pJC25R1+8H1Q. These plasmids were sequenced through the repeat region to confirm accuracy. Gene Integration and Replacement—The integration constructs were linearized with MluI and transformed into a [psi−] 74-D694 (genotype: ade1-14(UGA), trp1-289(UAG), his3Δ-200, ura3-52, leu2-3,112) strain. Transformants were selected on uracil-deficient medium (S.D.-Ura), and recombinant excision events were selected on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. Strains in which the wild-type Sup35 gene had been replaced by the mutant copy were identified by PCR of a portion of the genomic Sup35 gene. The repeat region of the Sup35 gene was sequenced to confirm accuracy. Spontaneous Appearance of [PSI+] in R1+X Yeast Strains—All R1+X strains were grown on YPD plates, and then inoculated in liquid YPD. After overnight growth, the cells were plated on ADE- at 0.7 × 106, 1.4 × 106, and 6 × 106 cells/plate. After 7 days of incubation, colonies were counted. Protein Purification—Crude preparations of proteins were purified as previously described (43Serio T.R. Lindquist S.L. Annual Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 661-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis yielded the following masses: R1+4 was 27171.1 Da (calculated value is 27170.1 Da), R1+8 was 30277.6 Da (calculated value is 30277.3Da), and R1+8H1Q was 30222.9 Da (calculated value is 30223.3 Da). Protein concentrations were determined using the absorbance at 280 nm with molar extinction coefficients calculated as 25,600 (NM), 39400 (R1+4), 62160 (R1+8), and 62160 (R1+8H1Q). Fiber Formation—Proteins were dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride as a stock solution, and the concentration was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm. Solutions for unseeded polymerization reactions were prepared by dilution of the stock solution into aqueous buffers and allowed to assemble at room temperature either with our without agitation. Seeds for seeded reactions were prepared by sonicating preformed fibers in a VWR Aquasonic 50T water bath sonicator, and all seeded reactions contained 2% (w/w) of the seeds. The buffers for the tests at different pH values are: pH 7.2, 20 mm MOPS with 100 mm sodium chloride; pH 6.2, 5 mm potassium phosphate with 50 mm sodium sulfate; pH 4.9, 3.9, and 2.9, 5 mm potassium acetate with 50 mm sodium sulfate. Cu(II) Binding Reactions—Lyophilized protein was first dissolved in acidified 25 mm NEM, 300 mm NaCl and spin filtered through a 300 kDa cutoff membrane. An appropriate volume of 100 mm CuCl2 in deionized water was added and samples were mixed. Then samples were diluted to 5-20 μm final protein concentration using 30 mm NEM pH 8.1. All EPR samples contained 20% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy—X-band spectra (9.43 GHz) were acquired using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 spectrometer and a TE102 cavity. Measurements were performed at ∼115-125K in a nitrogen vapor using cavity equipped with variable temperature control. The total bound Cu(II) was quantified by spin integration and comparison to accurate standard solutions containing Cu(II) in 10 mm imidazole at pH 7.4. Thioflavin-T Binding—Fiber formation was monitored by Thioflavin-T (44Krebs M.R.H. Bromley E.H.C. Donald A.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) in both seeded and unseeded reactions (45Glover J.R. Kowal A.S. Schirmer E.C. Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1997; 89: 811-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Attenuated Thioflavin T (ThT) intensity was observed at acidic pHs and in the presence of Cu(II), when SDS assay showed the same amount of free monomers left after polymerization reactions. ThT fluorescence intensity was baseline subtracted and then normalized to the maximum intensity when the polymerization reaction reached equilibrium. Monitoring Fiber Formation by SDS Solubility—At the indicated time points, 20 μl of the assembly mix was withdrawn and added to SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. The percentage of soluble protein was calculated by (gel band intensity at indicated time point) divided by (gel band intensity of zero hour sample after boiling). Chimeric Sup35 Proteins with PrP Repeats Can Support Both the Prion and Non-prion States—We first constructed chimeric proteins consisting of Sup35 with different numbers of PrP repeats substituted for the repeats of Sup35. Because the first repeats of Sup35 and PrP are the least similar to each other in sequence, and since the first Sup35 repeat is spatially separated from the others, we kept it intact. The last four full Sup35 repeats were replaced with the repeats from hamster PrP: one copy of the first hamster PrP imperfect repeat (PQGGGTWGQ) followed by varying numbers of the perfect hamster PrP repeats (PHGGGWGQ), as shown in Fig. 1A. Because our chimeras contained the first repeat (R1) of Sup35 plus two, four, five, six, seven, and eight repeats, they were named R1+2, R1+4, R1+5, R1+6, R1+7, and R1+8. We first asked how these chimeric proteins affected yeast prion biology in vivo. Starting with [psi−] cells, the wild-type SUP35 gene was replaced with a gene encoding R1+2, R1+4, R1+5, R1+6, R1+7, or R1+8 by homologous recombination. The strain we employed contains a nonsense codon in the ADE1 gene. In [PSI+] cells, wherein most of the Sup35 translation termination factor is sequestered in prion aggregates, ribosomes sometimes read through the stop codon. This allows the cells to grow on adenine deficient media (S.D.-Ade) and causes them to form white colonies when grown on rich media (YPD) (46Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 47Derkatch I.L. Chernoff Y.O. Kushnirov V.V. IngeVechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The [psi−] cells do not grow on S.D.-Ade, and produce red colonies on YPD because of the accumulation of a metabolic by-product of adenine biosynthesis (46Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Strains in which wild-type Sup35 was replaced with R1+2 through R1+8 substitutions remained [psi−]. Increasing the Number of PrP Repeats Destabilizes Both the [psi−] and [PSI+] States—When wild-type cells are grown in YPD, they are stable in both the [PSI+] and the [psi−] states, and the rate of spontaneous conversion between these states is very low (7Liu J.J. Lindquist S. Nature. 1999; 400: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To determine the stability of the [psi−] state in our mutant strains, we observed the spontaneous appearance of [PSI+] by streaking [psi−] cells on YPD followed by an S.D.-Ade plate. Wild-type Sup35 [psi−] strains produced colonies on S.D.-Ade medium rarely, approximately one per 106 cells/plate. R1+2, R1+4, R1+5, also rarely produced colonies. In contrast, colonies appeared ∼10-fold more frequently on S.D.-Ade medium with R1+6 and ∼100-fold more frequently with R1+7 and R1+8 strains. The colonies were confirmed as being true [PSI+] colonies by taking advantage of the fact that cells can be cured of the prion state by growing them on media containing guanidine hydrochloride. This produced red colonies that could not grow on S.D.-Ade medium. Thus, repeat expansion increased rate of spontaneous conversion from the [psi−] to the [PSI+] state. Next we examined the spontaneous conversion of R1+X [PSI+] strains to [psi−]. To create [PSI+] strains of R1+2, R1+4, R1+5, and R1+6, large numbers of the [psi−] strains were plated on S.D.-Ade and colonies that grew were selected. All of the [PSI+] strains were confirmed by growth and curing in the presence of 5 mm Gdn·HCl. Fig. 1B shows the growth of R1+X strains in both [psi−] and [PSI+] states on YPD. When R1+2, R1+4, R1+5, and R1+6 [PSI+] strains were grown on YPD-rich medium, the colonies appeared white, and red colonies were rarely observed, similar to wild-type Sup35 [PSI+] strains. Thus, the [PSI+] states of R1+2, R1+4, R1+5, and R1+6 were maintained stably. However, R1+7 and R1+8 strains frequently converted to [psi−] on YPD plates, with the colonies sectoring to red around the perimeter. Thus, extra copies of the PrP octarepeats destabilize both the prion and non-prion states. Increasing the Number of PrP Repeats Dramatically Accelerates Amyloid Formation in Vitro—Sup35 can be divided into three distinct regions, the N terminus with the oligopeptide repeats (amino acids 1-123), a highly charged middle region, and the C terminus (amino acids 254-685), which functions as a translation termination factor. The N terminus (N) and the middle region (M) of Sup35, often called NM, forms the prion-determining (PrD) domain. In vitro assembly of NM amyloid fibers recapitulates the induction and propagation of yeast prions in vivo (7Liu J.J. Lindquist S.

https://openalex.org/W2022013564,"Epithelial cell scattering recapitulates the first steps of carcinoma invasion/metastasis. While the balance between cell–cell adhesive activity and cell motility ultimately determines this process, its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Adherence junctions and tight junctions (TJs) are primarily responsible for cell–cell adhesive activity and subjected to dynamic remodeling. We previously showed that Rab13 and its effector protein JRAB/MICAL-L2 mediate the endocytic recycling of the integral TJ protein occludin and the assembly of functional TJs. In this study, we examined the role of Rab13 and JRAB/MICAL-L2 in the scattering of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Knockdown of Rab13 in canine MDCK cells suppressed the TPA-induced scattering, and this phenotype was restored by re-expression of human Rab13. During TPA-induced MDCK cell scattering, Rab13 was transiently activated and returned to its basal level, and both Rab13 and JRAB/MICAL-L2 were colocalized with F-actin at cell–cell contact sites and then accumulated at emerging lamellipodial structures. TPA-induced MDCK cell scattering was also inhibited by knockdown of canine JRAB/MICAL-L2 and rescued by re-expression of mouse JRAB/MICAL-L2. These results indicate that Rab13 and JRAB/MICAL-L2 are involved in epithelial cell scattering."
https://openalex.org/W2049986074,"Curculin isolated from Curculigo latifolia, a plant grown in Malaysia, has an intriguing property of modifying sour taste into sweet taste. In addition to this taste-modifying activity, curculin itself elicits a sweet taste. Although these activities have been attributed to the heterodimeric isoform and not homodimers of curculin, the underlying mechanisms for the dual action of this protein have been largely unknown. To identify critical sites for these activities, we performed a mutational and structural study of recombinant curculin. Based on the comparison of crystal structures of curculin homo- and heterodimers, a series of mutants was designed and subjected to tasting assays. Mapping of amino acid residues on the three-dimensional structure according to their mutational effects revealed that the curculin heterodimer exhibits sweet-tasting and taste-modifying activities through its partially overlapping but distinct molecular surfaces. These findings suggest that the two activities of the curculin heterodimer are expressed through its two different modes of interactions with the T1R2-T1R3 heterodimeric sweet taste receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2081823496,"Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is a hematopoietic cell-restricted member of the Ste20 serine/threonine kinase super family. We recently reported that the immunosuppressive eicosanoid, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), is capable of activating HPK1 in T cells. In this report, we demonstrate that unlike the TCR-induced activation of HPK1 kinase activity, the induction of HPK1 catalytic activity by PGE2 does not require the presence of phosphotyrosine-based signaling molecules such as Lck, ZAP-70, SLP-76, and Lat. Nor does the PGE2-induced HPK1 activation require the intermolecular interaction between its proline-rich regions and the SH3 domain-containing adaptor proteins, as required by the signaling from the TCR to HPK1. Instead, our study reveals that PGE2 signal to HPK1 via a 3′ -5 ′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-regulated, PKA-dependent pathway. Consistent with this observation, changing the serine 171 residue that forms the optimal PKA phosphorylation site within the “activation loop” of HPK1 to alanine completely prevents this mutant from responding to PGE2-generated stimulation signals. Moreover, the inability of HPK1 to respond to PGE2 stimulation in PKA-deficient S49 cells further supports the importance of PKA in this signaling pathway. We speculate that this unique signaling pathway enables PGE2 signals to engage a proven negative regulator of TCR signal transduction pathway and uses it to inhibit T cell activation.

HPK1–/– mice also exhibited a more severe autoimmune phenotype in the experimental model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These findings firmly validate the earlier biochemical findings that HPK1 functions as a negative regulator of T cell activation. The catalytic activity of HPK1 is elevated upon ligand engagement of a variety of cell surface receptors present on hematopoietic cells.

With the exception of TCR-mediated signal transduction where some mechanisms controlling HPK1 activation have been delineated, the exact biochemical mechanisms utilized by these receptors to activate HPK1 remain poorly understood. However, the signaling mechanisms utilized by these receptors can be grouped into three general categories: 1) Activation that depends on protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), their substrates, and the Src homology (SH) domain-containing adapter proteins that couple these molecules to HPK1 (3Liou J.

Med. 2001; 194: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); 2) Activation that relies on caspase activation and the subsequent cleavage of HPK1; 3) Activation that is presumed to utilize protein serine/threonine kinases (PS/TK) to conduct signals to HPK1 (13Zhou G. Lee S.C. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13133-13138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol.

Blood. 2003; 101: 3687-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Of these three categories, the PS/TK-dependent mechanism is the only mode of activation that has not been well characterized. We recently reported that exposing T lineage or myeloid lineage cell lines to physiological concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) would induce robust HPK1 kinase activity (17Sawasdikosol S. Russo K.M. Burakoff S.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 3687-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because the mechanisms that control PGE2-induced activation have not been delineated, we decided to characterize this signaling pathway by comparing it with the signaling mechanisms used by well characterized mechanism downstream of the TCR. Cell Lines—JE6.1 Jurkat and its mutants were grown in RPMI 1640 complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin). Lck-deficient JCaM 1.6 and the ZAP-70-deficient p116 Jurkat were obtained from ATTC (Mannasus, VA). The Lat-deficient ANJ Jurkat was a kind gift from Dr. Samelson (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health), and the SLP-76-deficient J14 Jurkat was a kind gift from Dr. Koretzky (University of Philadelphia, PA). Wild type S49 pre T cells and the PKA-deficient mutant, kin– S49, were kind gifts from Dr. Insel (University of California, San Diego, CA). Antibodies and Other Reagents—The horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20H) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-human HPK1 rabbit polyclonal antibody 47 (17Sawasdikosol S. Russo K.M. Burakoff S.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 3687-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was used to immunoprecipitate and immunoblot human HPK1. The anti-murine HPK1 antiserums 5, 6, and 7 were generous gifts from Dr. Kiefer (Max-Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine Münster, Germany). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of the ectopically expressed, hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged murine HPK1 were performed with the 12CA5 anti-HA mAb and anti-murine HPK1 rabbit polyclonal antibody 7 (2Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), respectively. Both the 12CA5 and the anti-human CD3ϵ (OKT3.14) mAbs used in TCR cross-linking experiments were purified from hybridoma supernatants in our laboratory. γ-[32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Anti-phospho-PKD (ser-916), clone MC29, and anti-PKD polyclonal antibody were purchased from Upstate (Charlotteville, VA). Anti-phospho-PKA was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Histone H2A was purchased from Roche Applied Science. PGE2, calyculin A, okadaic acid, cyclosporine A, cholera toxin, N6, O2′-dibutyryl-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, and forskolin were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Molecular Constructs—The pcDNA3.1 vector carrying the mouse cDNA that encodes the HA-tagged wild type murine HPK1 and the proline-rich-deleted construct (HA-HPK1 ΔP) were created by Dr. F. Kiefer (11Liu S.K. Smith C.A. Arnold R. Kiefer F. McGlade C.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PCR-assisted QuikChange mutagenesis system was used to introduce the desired point mutations (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each mutated construct was sequenced to verify the existence of the desired mutation and for the absence of PCR-generated mutations. Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose, and subsequently proteins were immunoprecipitated with either 1μg of anti-human HPK1 no. 47 or 1μl of each of the anti-murine HPK1 nos. 5 and 6 antibodies or an equal amount of normal rabbit Ig by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed extensively with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in immunoprecipitation wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3V4O7, 5 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin), and the bead-bound proteins were either subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction (described below) or they were directly separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Stimulation and in Vitro Kinase Assays—For stimulation by the anti-CD3ϵ antibody-mediated TCR cross-linking in suspension, Jurkat and its mutant lines were suspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium (1 × 107 cells/immunoprecipitation) and incubated with 1 μg of OKT3.14 anti-human CD3ϵ mAb at 4 °C as described previously (20Chang J.H. Pratt J.C. Sawasdikosol S. Kapeller R. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4986-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After 10 min on ice with the stimulating antibodies, 7.5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse antibody was added for cross-linking and incubated for an additional 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were then warmed to 37 °C for the indicated times prior to lysis. For stimulation with PGE2 or cAMP analogues, these reagents were added to the 4 °C cell suspension, and cells were immediately shifted to 37 °C for 5 min to facilitate signal transduction. In the situation where H-89 PKA inhibitor was used to block PKA activation, S49 cells were pretreated with 10 μm H-89 for 30 min prior to stimulation by PGE2. Whole cell lysates derived from resting or stimulated cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation by the indicated antibodies followed by in vitro kinase reactions as described (2Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated by cholera toxin for 30 min before whole cell lysate (WCL) is prepared. All stimulations were terminated by cell lysis, using a lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, as described above. PGE2-induced Activation of HPK1 Utilizes Signaling Mechanism Distinct from that Used by the TCR—TCR signal transduction pathways leading to HPK1 activation are the best understood among all known receptors capable of activating HPK1. Studies using mutant cell lines lacking Lck and ZAP-70 revealed that the presence of these PTKs is required for HPK1 activation by the TCR (3Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because some rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor use Lck to transduce signals via PTK-dependent pathways (21Gu C. Ma Y.C. Benjamin J. Littman D. Chao M.V. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20726-20733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we determined whether PGE2 receptors in T cells must also engage these PTKs to activate HPK1 kinase activity. First, we assessed whether PGE2 stimulation would induce general tyrosine phosphorylation in the Jurkat T cell line. Cells were left untreated or stimulated either with 10 nm PGE2 or by anti-CD3ϵ (OKT3.14) mAb-mediated TCR cross-linking. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of whole cell lysates revealed no detectable change in global tyrosine phosphorylation levels upon PGE2 stimulation, whereas robust tyrosine phosphorylation was observed upon TCR cross-linking (Fig. 1A). Identical phosphorylation pattern was observed when cells were stimulated for varying time ranging from 2 to 10 min, but a modest tyrosine phosphorylation was detected at 20 min time point - a substantial amount of time after HPK1 was activated (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Anti-phosphotyrosine blotting of immunoprecipitated HPK1 confirmed that, unlike prominent tyrosine phosphorylation induced by TCR cross-linking (Fig. 1B, lane 3), stimulation by PGE2 did not induce detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of HPK1 (lane 2). Western blot analysis using anti-human HPK1 antibody demonstrated that comparable amounts of HPK1 were present in all lanes (Fig. 1C). It also revealed that PGE2 stimulation did not lead to activation-induced cleavage of HPK1, thus ruling out the involvement of caspase-mediated activation. The immune complex in vitro kinase (IVK) assay revealed that as in the previously reported studies (3Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Sawasdikosol S. Russo K.M. Burakoff S.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 3687-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), both TCR and PGE2 receptors could activate HPK1 (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3). It has been shown that Jurkat somatic mutant cell lines that lack Lck and ZAP-70, J.CaM1 and p116, respectively, cannot activate HPK1 upon TCR engagement (3Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Through the use of these mutant cell lines, we assessed whether HPK1 would catalytically respond to stimulation by PGE2. Wild type or mutant Jurkat cell lines were left untreated or stimulated with either 10 nm PGE2 or by antibody-mediated TCR cross-linking. These cells were lysed, and the immunoprecipitated HPK1 was subjected to IVK analysis. We observed that the absence of Lck or ZAP-70 did not interfere with the ability of HPK1 to respond to PGE2 stimulation (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 8). As previously reported, the presence of these PTKs is required for an HPK1 response to TCR cross-linking (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 9). Western blot analysis using an anti-HPK1 antibody indicated that comparable amounts of immunoprecipitated HPK1 were used in all IVK reactions (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3 and 4–9). We conclude from these studies that PGE2 utilizes a PTK-independent pathway to induce HPK1 kinase activity. HPK1 Is Responsive to PGE2 Stimulation in Lat and SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T Cell Lines—Scaffolding proteins play a critical role in transducing activation signals from the TCR to HPK1. It has been shown that the presence of Lat, and to a lesser extent SLP-76, is required for TCR-induced HPK1 activation (3Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To assess the role of these scaffolding proteins in PGE2-induced HPK1 activation, we evaluated the mutant Jurkat T cell lines, ANJ3 and J14, which lacked the expression of Lat and SLP-76, respectively, for their ability to activate HPK1 in response to PGE2 stimulation. A wild type Jurkat T cell line and the Lat and SLP-76 mutants were stimulated with 10 nm PGE2 or by TCR cross-linking. Endogenous HPK1 was immunoprecipitated, and its catalytic activity was assessed by an IVK assay. Analysis of the receptor-induced HPK1 kinase activity revealed that all Jurkat cell lines could robustly induce HPK1 kinase activity upon PGE2 stimulation (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 11, and 14), whereas the mutant cell lines failed to activate HPK1 in response to TCR engagement (lanes 12 and 15). Western blot analysis using an anti-HPK1 antibody indicated that comparable amounts of immunoprecipitated HPK1 were used in all IVK reactions (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3 and 10–15). We conclude that, unlike TCR-induced signaling to HPK1, Lat and SLP-76 are not involved in PGE2-induced HPK1 activation. Proline-rich Regions of HPK1 Are Not Required for PGE2-induced HPK1 Activation—The interaction between SH3 domain-containing adapter proteins and the proline-rich motifs of HPK1 is critical for TCR-mediated signaling to HPK1 (3Liou J.

Three of the four proline-rich regions of HPK1 (P1, P2, and P4) conform to the class II consensus sequence for an SH3 protein interacting domain (11Liu S.K. Smith C.A. Arnold R. Kiefer F. McGlade C.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and are known interaction sites for SH3 domain-containing proteins (25Boomer J.S. Tan T.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To assess whether the proline-rich motifs in HPK1 are required in PGE2-induced HPK1 activation, we transfected constructs that encoded either the HA-tagged wild type HPK1 or a mutant form in which P1, P2, and P4 proline-rich motifs (HA-ΔP-HPK1) had been deleted. Transfectants were left untreated or stimulated with 10 nm PGE2 or by TCR cross-linking. The ectopically expressed HPK1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA mAb and subjected to IVK assay. Analysis revealed that, whereas the HA-HPK1 ΔP mutant was unable to respond to an TCR activation signal (Fig. 3A, lane 6), it responded robustly to PGE2 stimulation (lane 5). This observation is consistent with the previous report that this mutant also failed to undergo TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (11Liu S.K. Smith C.A. Arnold R. Kiefer F. McGlade C.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), an indication for TCR-induced HPK1 activation. HA-HPK1 responded to both forms of stimulation (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that the inability of the HA-HPK1 ΔP mutant was not because of epitope tagging or the overexpression of HPK1. Western blot analysis indicated that comparable amounts of HPK1 were present in all IVK reactions (Fig. 3B). Thus, this finding suggests that P1, P2, and P4 proline-rich regions of HPK1 do not contribute toward the PGE2-induced HPK1 kinase activation, thus it is unlikely that adapter proteins play a role in this process. Specific Serine/Threonine Phosphatase Inhibitors Activate HPK1 Kinase Activity—All E prostanoid receptors propagate PGE2-generated signals via PS/TK-dependent signal transduction pathways. To determine whether HPK1 kinase activity was regulated by PS/TK-dependent pathways, we compared HPK1 kinase activity from untreated Jurkat cells to those from cells treated with a panel of serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. Analysis of HPK1 IVK activity revealed that both calyculinA and okadaic acid, the inhibitors for protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A), were able to activate HPK1 kinase activity (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, cyclosporine A, the specific inhibitor of the TCR-responsive protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), failed to induce HPK1 kinase activity (lane 4). As reported previously (12Ling P. Meyer C.F. Redmond L.P. Shui J.W. Davis B. Rich R.R. Hu M.C. Wange R.L. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18908-18914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), treating Jurkat cells with pervanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, induced a robust response in HPK1 catalytic activity (Fig. 4, lane 5). These data indicated that the catalytic activity of HPK1 is controlled by PP1- and PP2A-regulated PS/TK as well as by tyrosine kinases. Elevation of cAMP Levels Induces HPK1 Activation—Prostaglandin E2 can bind with high affinity to each of the four E prostanoid receptors. However, EP2 and EP4, the receptors that couple with and signal through the stimulatory Gα (GαS) are the dominant receptors expressed in primary hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic cell lines (26Arakawa T. Laneuville O. Miller C.A. Lakkides K.M. Wingerd B.A. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29569-29575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Mori K.

The GTP-bound GαS subunit interacts with adenylyl cyclase and potentiates cAMP production upon PGE2 stimulation. To test whether elevation of intracellular cAMP levels would activate HPK1 in Jurkat T cells, we stimulated cells with cholera toxin, cell permeable cAMP analogues, and forskolin, a potent adenylyl cyclase activator, to elevate cAMP levels and assess the catalytic activity of HPK1 in response to these stimulations. Analysis by an IVK assay revealed that, despite our initial belief that HPK1 might use cAMP-independent signaling pathways to activate HPK1, our current data showed that HPK1 responded to the stimulation by cholera toxin, N6, O2′-dibutyryl-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, and forskolin (Fig. 5A, lanes 2–5). Western blot analysis revealed that comparable amounts of HPK1 were present in all lanes (Fig. 5B). Because PKA is the major effector molecule whose catalytic activity is regulated by the direct binding of cAMP, we tested whether PKA activity was required for PGE2-induced HPK1 activation. To test the involvement of PKA in this process, we stimulated the S49 pre-T cell line and its PKA-deficient mutant, the kin– S49 cell line, with PGE2 and compared the ability of HPK1 to respond to PGE2 stimulation. Similar to the response found in Jurkat cells, the catalytic activity of HPK1 in wild type S49 cells was elevated in response to stimulation by either PGE2 or forskolin (Fig. 5C, lanes 2 and 3). The response of HPK1 could be blocked by pretreating the S49 cells 30 min before stimulation with 10 μm H-89, an isoquinoline sulphoamide drug capable of specifically inhibiting PKA (Fig. 5C, lanes 4 and 5). In support of the critical role PKA plays in PGE2-induced HPK1 activation, the PKA-deficient kin– S49 mutant cell line was not able to activate HPK1 when stimulated by either PGE2 or forskolin (Fig. 5C, lanes 7 and 8), confirming the critical role that PKA plays in this signaling pathway. Western blot analysis using an anti-HPK1 antibody indicated that comparable amounts of immunoprecipitated HPK1 were used in IVK reactions (Fig. 5D, lanes 1–8). To verify that HPK1 is catalytically active and is capable of responding to PKA-independent signals, we stimulated kin– S49 cells with pervanadate, a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase and a robust activator of HPK1. Our analysis indicated that HPK1 in kin– S49 cells responded catalytically to pervanadate (Fig. 5E), despite its inability to respond to PGE2 stimulation (D). This finding suggests that HPK1 is catalytically active and is responsive to non-PKA-dependent signal transduction pathway. To further strengthen the evidence supporting the role of PKA in PGE2-induced activation of HPK1, we stimulated Jurkat cells with PGE2 for 5 min, in the presence or absence of H-89, and Western blotted the immunoprecipitated HPK1 with anti-phospho PKA substrate antibody. Analysis revealed that PGE2-activated HPK1 was recognized by anti-phospho PKA substrate antibody (Fig. 5F). This recognition was abrogated by H-89 pre-treatment (Fig. 5F), suggesting that PKA directly phosphorylated HPK1. The dependence on PKA for PGE2-induced HPK1 activation sets it apart from TCR-induced HPK1 activation where PKA does not play a role in signal transduction (30Arnold R. Patzak I.M. Neuhaus B. Vancauwenbergh S. Veillette A. Van Lint J. Kiefer F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2364-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Serine 171 Is Required for PGE2-induced HPK1 Activation—The susceptibility of PGE2-induced HPK1 activation to a PKA inhibitor, in conjunction with the inability of the PKA-deficient kin– S49 mutant cell line to activate HPK1 upon PGE2 stimulation, strongly suggest that PKA is a critical upstream regulator of PGE2-induced HPK1 activation. These findings led us to analyze the HPK1 amino acid sequence for the presence of the optimal consensus PKA motif, the amino acid sequence RRXS/T, where X represents any amino acid (31Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis identified serine 171, located within the “activation loop” of the kinase domain (the region flanked by the conserved “DFG” and “APE” amino acid sequences in the kinase subdomain VII and VIII), as the only optimal PKA site in HPK1 (Fig. 6A). Further analysis revealed that, whereas the arginine residue at–2 position relative to the serine 171 (arginine 169) was conserved in all KHS family members, only HPK1 possessed an arginine at the–3 (arginine 168) position relative to serine 171. The conserved double arginine sequence was also found in the murine HPK1 sequence, but not in the majority of Ste20 orthologues (data not shown). To assess the importance of arginine 168, arginine 169, and serine 171 in PGE2-induced HPK1 activation, we created a panel of mutant HPK1 expression constructs that encoded a point mutation at each of these amino acids by changing arginines to lysines and the serine to alanine. These mutant HPK1 constructs were transfected into Jurkat cells, and the ectopically expressed HA-tagged HPK1 were immunoprecipitated from resting or PGE2 stimulated cells. Analysis of HPK1 kinase activity revealed that the serine 171 mutation (S171A) completely ablated the response of HPK1 to PGE2 stimulation (Fig. 6B, lane 8). Arginine to lysine mutations at either residue 168 (R168K) or 169 (R169K) of HPK1 reduced the responsiveness to PGE2 stimulation by ∼90% (Fig. 6B, lanes 4 and 6). Western blot analysis using an anti-HPK1 antibody indicated that comparable amounts of immunoprecipitated HPK1 were used in the IVK reactions (Fig. 6C, lanes 1–8). This data suggest that the kinase, which phosphorylates serine 171 requires both arginine 168 and 169 to direct its substrate specificity. We report here that TCR and PGE2 receptors utilize distinct signaling mechanisms to activate HPK1. Whereas TCR relies on PTK-dependent signal transduction pathways and the intact proline-rich regions of HPK1 to transmit activation signals to HPK1, PGE2 signals via PKA to activate HPK1. The reliance on PKA as the activator of HPK1 is consistent with the existing belief that PS/TK can signal to HPK1. This belief is based in part on the fact that ligand engagement of TGF-βR, a receptor PS/TK, results in the activation of HPK1 (13Zhou G. Lee S.C. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13133-13138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, because TGF-β signaling pathways for HPK1 activation have not been characterized, the exact PS/TK pathway utilized by TGF-βR to activate HPK1 remains unknown. With our observation that PKA plays a prominent role in PGE2 signaling to HPK1, coupled with the recent report that TGF-β stimulation activates PKA in fetal skin fibroblasts (32Giannouli C.C. Kletsas D. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1417-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), these findings support the possibility that the TGF-βR may also use PKA to activate HPK1. Catalytic activity of many kinases can be regulated by the phosphorylation of residues located within the activation loop (33Bossemeyer D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 34Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Structural conformation of the activation loop blocks ATP access to the catalytic pocket and thus prevents the induction of catalytic activity by steric hindrance. Upon phosphorylation by the upstream kinase cascade, the conformation of the activation loop is changed and moved away from the active site, which allows ATP free access to the kinase domain. The loss of the ability of HPK1 to respond catalytically to PGE2 stimulation when serine 171 is mutated to alanine strengthens the hypothesis that PKA regulates HPK1 kinase activity by direct phosphorylation of the activation loop. The role of serine 171 in the regulation of HPK1 activity was further supported by a recent report that implicated PKD-dependent phosphorylation of serine 171 as one of the critical events necessary for TCR-induced activation of HPK1 (30Arnold R. Patzak I.M. Neuhaus B. Vancauwenbergh S. Veillette A. Van Lint J. Kiefer F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2364-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because PKD is not activated by PGE2 stimulation (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D), the requirement for serine 171 phosphorylation in two receptor systems that utilizes two different kinases highlights the importance of this phosphorylation in HPK1 activation. It is important to note here that, whereas our data and that of others indicate that serine 171 is indispensable for the activation of HPK1, we believe that the phosphorylation is a necessary, but not sufficient event that controls HPK1 kinase activity. Phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated HPK1 in vitro by purified PKA does not render HPK1 more catalytically active (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that other post-translational modifications, most likely additional phosphorylations by other PS/TK, are required to fully activate HPK1. The PGE2-induced phosphorylation of HPK1's serine 171 represents a novel PKA-dependent activation mechanism not described previously for HPK1 or for other KHS family members. Among mammalian Ste20 orthologues, only MST-3B, the brain-specific splice variant isoform of MST3 has been previously shown to be catalytically responsive to PKA-mediated phosphorylation (35Zhou T.H. Ling K. Guo J. Zhou H. Wu Y.L. Jing Q. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the case of MST-3B, however, the unique peptide segment that contains the PKA substrate motif is located N-terminal to the kinase domain. Thus, the inducible phosphorylation of HPK1's serine 171 represents the only report of a PKA-mediated inducible phosphorylation event that occurred within the activation loop of the mammalian Ste20 kinase domain. Perhaps this is a reflection of the infrequent occurrence of the double arginine motif in the activation loop of the Ste20 orthologues. Among the 31 human Ste20 orthologues identified by Sugen's genome analysis of human kinase genes, only MYO3, PAK4, SLK, and all MSN sub-family members (HGK, TNIK, MINK, and NRK) possess the double arginine motif at the location analogous to the double arginine residues of HPK1 (data not shown). We are currently investigating whether these kinases would respond catalytically to PKA. Most tumors overexpress cyclooxygenase-2 and consequently produce high level of PGE2. Although PGE2 stimulation favors tumor growth by activating the T cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer-binding factor signal transduction pathway in epithelial cells (36Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Science. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), it functions paradoxically as a potent inhibitor of T cell activation (37Chouaib S. Welte K. Mertelsmann R. Dupont B. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1172-1179PubMed Google Scholar, 38Anastassiou E.D. Paliogianni F. Balow J.P. Yamada H. Boumpas D.T. J.

Immunol. 1996; 171: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We propose here that HPK1, due in part to its hematopoietic cell-restricted expression pattern and responsiveness to PGE2, functions as a molecular switch that converts the pro-proliferation signal in epithelial cells into an inhibitory signal in hematopoietic cells. The fact that the PGE2-initiated signaling pathway converges on HPK1 despite the lack of overlapping membrane-proximal signaling mechanisms lends credibility to the proposal that PGE2 produced by tumors may “hijack” the normal negative regulatory pathway mediated by HPK1 and use it to suppress the immune response against tumors. Such possibility, if verified, may lead to the development of a novel therapeutic approach that could overcome tumor-mediated immune suppression by inhibiting the catalytic activity of HPK1.

https://openalex.org/W2030474076,"We used intrachromosomal substrates to directly monitor the effect of the cell cycle on the efficiency and the accuracy of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) in mammalian cells. We show that both KU and KU-independent (KU-alt) pathways are efficient when maintaining cells in G1/S, in G2/M or during dynamic progression through S phase. In addition, the accuracy of NHEJ is barely altered when the cells are blocked in G1/S or in G2/M. However, progression through S phase increases the frequency of deletions, which is a hallmark of the KU-alt pathway. Moreover, we show that the intermediates that are generated by the KU-dependent end joining of non-fully complementary ends, and which contain mismatches, nicks or gap intermediates, are less accurately processed when the cells progress through S phase. In conclusion, both KU and KU-alt processes are active throughout the cell cycle, but the repair is more error prone during S phase, both by increasing the mutagenic KU-alt pathway and decreasing the accuracy of the repair of the intermediates generated by the KU-dependent pathway."

To probe the proton transfer during the enzyme reaction, we used mutagenesis, chemical rescue, and kinetic isotope effects to investigate the release of protons. The kinetic isotope effects of DV and D2OV for wild-type enzyme are 1 and 2.1 at pL 10.4 (where L represents H, 2H), respectively, and suggest a rate-limiting step in the intramolecular proton transfer.

Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30888-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Structurally, 3α-HSD/CR has an α/β folding pattern very similar to a Rossmann fold, which consists of a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices (2Maser E. Xiong G. Grimm C. Ficner R. Reuter K. Chem.

In the binary complex, the NAD+ cofactor is bound at the carboxyl-terminal ends of the β-strands in the 3α-HSD/CR from C. testosteroni.3α-HSD/CR reversibly catalyzes the oxidation of the steroid alcohol using NAD+ as the oxidant. The reaction catalyzed by 3α-HSD/CR shows an ordered Bi Bi kinetic mechanism with oxidized dinucleotide added first and the reduced dinucleotide released last (4Skalhegg B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 50: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Studies of the pH profile and structural determinations elucidated the chemical mechanism of the 3α-HSD/CR-catalyzed reaction (2Maser E. Xiong G. Grimm C. Ficner R. Reuter K. Chem. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 3522-3528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The triad of Ser114, Tyr155, and Lys159 in the active site participates in the enzyme catalysis. The role of Lys159 is to lower the pKa of Tyr155 through electrostatic interaction between the protonated ϵ-amino of Lys159 and the hydroxy group of Tyr155, whereas the unprotonated form of Tyr155 with an apparent pKa of 7.2 acts as a catalytic base that abstracts a proton from the hydroxyl group of the substrate. Ser114 is in hydrogen bonding with the substrate during the reaction catalyzed by the WT enzyme and alternatively acts as the general base to rescue catalysis of proton transfer in the Y155F mutant enzyme. NAD+ cofactor bound in the syn conformation accepts a hydride from the 3β-position of androsterone through the “si face” of the nicotinamide ring to form androstanedione and NADH with the concomitant release of protons in the forward reaction direction. The overall oxidoreductive reaction catalyzed by 3α-HSD/CR is composed of the deprotonation of tyrosine, proton abstraction by the tyrosinate anion, and hydride transfer from the hydroxysteroid to NAD+, followed by the release of a proton from the hydroxy group of tyrosine to the solution (Fig. 1). A proton relay system is proposed in the SDR family through which protons are shuttled to bulk solvent. Analysis of the structures of 3α/17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and R-specific alcohol dehydrogenase suggests a proton transfer from the hydroxyl group of Tyr, via the 2′-OH of the nicotinamide ribose, the Lys side chain, and a water molecule hydrogen-bonded to the backbone carbonyl of Asn (6Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J. Knapp S. Prozorovski T. Nordling E. Ladenstein R. Jornvall H. Oppermann U. J. Biol.

The theoretical calculations of the ionization properties of the hydroxyl group of Tyr155, the O2′ ribose hydroxyl, and the Lys159 ϵ-amino group in the active site of Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase are consistent with the proton relay occurring in the SDR family (8Koumanov A. Benach J. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Karshikoff A. Ladenstein R. Proteins. 2003; 51: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SDR is a large protein family with highly diverse functions in pro- and eukaryotes and is composed of a majority of oxidoreductases with NAD(P)+ as cofactor (9Oppermann U. Filling C. Hult M.

Although sequence alignment between different SDR enzymes typically shows 15-30% identity, the conserved sequences include an N-terminal Gly-X3-Gly-X-Gly cofactor binding motif and a tetrad of catalytically important Ser, Tyr, Lys, and Asn residues, of which Tyr is the most conserved in the SDR family. The mechanistic roles of a catalytic tetrad have been elucidated through chemical modification, site-directed mutagenesis, sequence alignment, and structural comparison (5Hwang C.C. Chang Y.H.

Mutation of tyrosine, serine, and lysine residue results in the loss of most activity in the SDR family. Mutation of Asn111 to Leu in 3β/17β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase results in inactivation of the enzyme. The Asn residue is also important in maintaining the active site configuration and is involved in the proton relay during the catalysis. Hence, the catalytic tetrad of Asn, Ser, Tyr, and Lys is involved in catalysis in the SDR family. Proton transfer plays many roles in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. It participates in the stabilization of the transition state to enhance the rate through the acid-base catalysis and the formation of a low barrier hydrogen bond (11Cleland W.W. Kreevoy M.M.

The electron transfer is coupled with the movement of protons in many respiratory oxidases and results in a proton gradient across the membrane to drive ATP synthesis. The movement of protons through a protein scaffold is often essential for enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Protons may move inside proteins along pathways provided by a network of hydrogen-bonded amino acid side chains and water molecules (16Pankhurst K.L. Mowat C.G. Rothery E.L. Hudson J.M. Jones A.K.

Accounts of Chemical Research. 1997; 30: 290-296Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Here, we studied proton transfer in the 3α-HSD/CR-catalyzed reaction, examined the number of proton transfers in the transition state in the rate-limiting step, and evaluated the roles of the Lys159 residue in the active site. We studied deuterium and solvent kinetic isotope effects to determine the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction. We then substituted alanine or methionine for Lys159 to block the pathway for proton transfer, used small molecules to restore the proton shuttle, and carried out a proton inventory to investigate intramolecular proton transfer. Buffers and exogenous proton acceptors are capable of participating in catalysis when proton transfer is blocked in the K159A and K159M mutant enzymes. Furthermore, the bowl-shaped proton inventory gives two protons participating in proton transfer in the rate-limiting step. In addition to lowering the pKa of the general base Tyr155, the results further demonstrated the role of Lys159 in shuttling the protons to bulk solvent in the 3α-HSD/CR-catalyzed reaction. We used the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Androsterone and androstanedione were purchased from Steraloids, Inc., and NAD+ was from Roche Applied Science. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroids and CAPS were from Sigma. Ammonia was obtained from Showa (Japan). Methylamine, ethanolamine, 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine, and azide were purchased from Lancaster. Ethylamine and propylamine were from Acros, and ethylenediamine was from Tedia (Japan). Deuterated chemicals 1-deutero-glucose (95% 2H), perdeuterated ethanol, 2H2O (99.9% 2H), and NaO2H (30% (w/w), 99.5% 2H) came from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. All chemicals were of the highest purity available. [3α-2H]Androsterone was prepared by enzymatic synthesis from [4S-2H]NADH with 5α-androstan-3,17-dione catalyzed by 3α-HSD/CR. B-side [4S-2H] NADH was prepared according to the method of Viola et al. (22Viola R.E. Cook P.F. Cleland W.W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 96: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from L. mesenteroids reversibly catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of NAD+ from 1-deutero-glucose to form B-side-labeled NADH and gluconic acid-γ-lactone. The reaction essentially goes to completion due to the unstable gluconic acid-γ-lactone at pH 8.0, which is hydrolyzed to give gluconate. [4S-2H]NADH was separated from NAD+ by gradient elution of ammonium bicarbonate (10-500 mm) at pH 9.3 through DEAE-cellulose ionic exchange column. Fractions of [4S-2H]NADH were pooled and lyophilized. The labeled 3α-androsterone was further prepared by stereospecific oxidation of the resulting [4S-2H] NADH from 5α-androstan-3,17-dione as reversibly catalyzed by 3α-HSD/CR. The progress for reverse reduction of androstanedione with [4S-2H]NADH catalyzed by 3α-HSD/CR was followed by the disappearance of [4S-2H]NADH at 340 nm spectrophotometrically at pH 7.0. The reaction was quenched by the addition of CHCl3 to denature the enzyme after it reached equilibrium. Deuterated androsterone was extracted by ethyl acetate and further purified by reverse phase HPLC. Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes—Both wild-type and mutant genes were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Mutagenic replacements were performed using the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit and Pfu polymerase with pET-15b-3α-HSD/CR plasmid as template. The synthetic oligonucleotide primers used to create the cDNA for K159M were 5′-CTGGCCTATGCGGGCAGCATGAATGCTTTGACGGTGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCACCGTCAAAGCATTCATGCTGCCCGCATAGGCCAG-3′ (antisense). The boldface codons indicate the mutation on the amino acid residue by the replacement of the underlined codon. The mutant vector thus obtained was transformed into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The gene was sequenced for K159M mutation and compared with that of the wild-type 3α-HSD/CR using BLAST. The K159A mutant enzyme was prepared as described previously (5Hwang C.C. Chang Y.H. Hsu C.N. Hsu H.H. Li C.W. Pon H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3522-3528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, recombinant proteins were overexpressed in BL21(DE3) cells and grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6-1 at 600 nm in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) was added to the culture to induce protein expression. Growth was continued for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested and lysed by sonication. The overexpressed proteins were purified via an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column making use of the enzyme's His tag. SDS-PAGE was used to analyze protein purity. The protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Kinetic Studies—The oxidation of androsterone catalyzed by 3α-HSD/CR was monitored by the formation of NADH spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. A typical assay for the enzymatic reaction included 1 mm NAD+ and varied concentrations of androsterone in 0.1 m CAPS at pH 10.4 at 25 °C. All reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. Initial velocities for wild type and mutants were measured at varying concentrations of androsterone at several fixed concentrations of NAD+. Data were fitted using Sigmaplot software for appropriate rate equations to obtain kinetic parameters. Data for substrate saturation curves at a fixed concentration of the second substrate were fitted using Equation 1. In Equation 1, v and V represent the initial and maximum velocity, respectively, and Km is the Michaelis constant. Data for a sequential and a rapid equilibrium order kinetic mechanism were fitted to Equation 2 and 3, respectively, where A and B are the varied substrates, Kia is the inhibition constant for A, and KA and KB are the Michaelis constants for substrate A and B, respectively.

Primary amines included ammonia, methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, ethanolamine, and 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine. The assay mixtures contained 1 mm NAD+, 46.6 μm androsterone, and various concentrations of the rescue agents in 5 mm CAPS, pH 10.4, at 25 °C. The reactions were initiated by the addition of the mutant enzyme (0.19 μg for K159A mutant and 0.37 μg for K159M mutant). The initial rate was measured in the presence of different concentrations of the rescue agents ([amine]). Data were then fitted to Equation 4 to obtain the chemical rescue parameters, V/Et, V/Kd-baseEt, and Kd-base of chemical rescue reagents. vamine=(V[amine]/Kd-base+[amine])(Eq. 4) In Equation 4, V/Kd-baseEt is the second order rate constant for the chemical rescuer. Kd-base is the concentration of the rescue agent for which half of V was observed. vamine is the initial rate obtained by subtracting the rate in the absence of the external amine from the rate in the presence of amine. The concentration of conjugate base of the amine, [amine], was calculated based on Equation 5, [amine]=[amine]total/(1+([H+]/Ka))(Eq. 5) where Ka is the acid dissociation constant of the amine, and [amine]total is the total concentration of the added amine. Contributions from the electronic properties (pKa) and molecular volume of the primary amine to the efficiency of chemical rescue (V/Kd-baseEt) were analyzed by fitting data to Equation 6, LogV/Kd-baseEt=βpKa+V(molecularvolume)+C(Eq. 6) where β is the Brønsted coefficient, V is the molecular volume correction coefficient, and C is the constant term for the specific reaction. Isotope Effects and Proton Inventory—The primary kinetic isotope effects, DV and D(V/Kandrosterone), were determined by a direct comparison of the kinetic parameters Vmax and V/Kandrosterone with unlabeled and deuterated androsterone. Vmax and V/Kandrosterone were obtained by measuring the initial rate as a function of either the deuterated or unlabeled androsterone concentration at 1 mm NAD+. The concentrations of deuterated and unlabeled androsterone were determined in triplicate by end point assay. The solvent kinetic isotope effects (SKIE) were measured according to the method of Quinn and Sutton (24Quinn D.M. Sutton L.D. Cook P.F. Enzyme Mechanism from Isotope Effects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 73-126Google Scholar). In the case of reactions measured in 2H2O, all reactants were prepared and lyophilized twice in 2H2O. Buffers were titrated to the desired p2H (where p2H is equal to the pH meter reading plus 0.4) using NaO2H. Initial rates (v) were measured at varied concentrations of androsterone and 1 mm NAD+ in the presence of H2O or 2H2O. Data from the experiments were fitted to Equations 7, 8, 9, 10, when an isotope effect was observed on both V and V/K, an equal isotope effect on V and V/K, V only, and V/K only, respectively. v=VA/(Km(1+FiEv/k)+A(1+FiEv))(Eq. 7) v=VA/((Km+A)(1+FiEv,v/k))(Eq. 8) v=VA/(Km+A(1+FiEv))(Eq. 9) v=VA/(Km(1+FiEv/k)+A)(Eq. 10) In Equations 7, 8, 9, 10, Fi is the fraction of the deuterium label in the substrate, EV,V/K is the isotope effect minus 1 for an equal isotope effect on V and V/K, and EV and EV/K are the isotope effect minus 1 on V and V/K, respectively (25Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). To obtain information on the number and fractionation factors for proton(s) being transferred at the transition state(s), the proton inventory method was utilized (24Quinn D.M. Sutton L.D. Cook P.F. Enzyme Mechanism from Isotope Effects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 73-126Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters V and V/K were obtained by measuring the initial rate at different fractional concentrations of 2H2O in the reaction mixture by combining appropriate volumes of H2O or 2H2O. Data were then fitted to the Gross-Butler equation as follows, kn=kD2o(1-n+nϕT)Z-n/(1-n+nϕR)(Eq. 11) kn=kD2o(1-n+nϕT)(Eq. 12) kn=kD2o(1-n+nϕT)2(Eq. 13) where nk is the ratio of the rate constants (V or V/K) measured in different fractional concentrations of 2H2O compared with 100% 2H2O, D2Ok is the solvent deuterium isotope effect (i.e. the ratio of the rate constants (V or V/K) in H2O and 2H2O), n is the fractional concentration of 2H2O, ϕT is the corresponding deuterium fractionation factor for the exchangeable protonic sites relative to bulk water, and Z represents a medium effect. Data for the linear and bowl-shaped proton inventory were fitted to Equation 12 and 13, respectively. In Equation 13, two exchangeable protonic sites with identical fractionation factors are involved in the transition state and a unit fractionation factor of reactant state. Dependence of the Activity of the K159A Mutant Enzyme on Buffers—Substitution of alanine for lysine is expected to block the proton shuttle from the active site to the solvent. In an attempt to restore the proton transfer, an external proton acceptor was added to rescue the reaction catalyzed by the K159A mutant enzyme. We observed that the activity of the K159A mutant enzyme was dependent on the concentrations of CAPS. In comparison, the activity of the wild-type enzyme was not affected at either 5 or 100 mm CAPS at pH 10.4, indicating that the buffers participate in the reaction only when the Lys159 side chain is eliminated (Table 1). The initial rates of the K159A enzyme-catalyzed reaction exhibited a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of CAPS varying from 5 to 200 mm at 72 μm androsterone and 1 mm NAD+, pH 10.4. To elucidate the role of CAPS in the kinetic mechanism, an initial velocity pattern was obtained by varying the buffer concentrations at different fixed concentrations of androsterone at 1 mm NAD+, pH 10.4. The double-reciprocal plot intersected to the left of the ordinate, suggesting a sequential kinetic mechanism (see supplemental Fig. S1). Data were fitted to Equation 2; values for V/Et were 13 ± 2 s−1, and Km for androsterone and CAPS in the mutant enzyme was 34 ± 11 μm and 8 ± 4 mm, respectively.TABLE 1Comparison of the kinetic constants for wild-type and mutant 3α-HSD/CR in the presence of methylamineEnzymeCAPSMethylamineKandrosteroneV/EtV/KandrosteroneEtmmmmμms–1aThe-fold decrease shown in parenthesis is the ratio of the kinetic parameters for wild type at 5 mm CAPS versus enzyme in different concentrations of CAPS and methylaminem–1 s–1aThe-fold decrease shown in parenthesis is the ratio of the kinetic parameters for wild type at 5 mm CAPS versus enzyme in different concentrations of CAPS and methylamineWT505.1 ± 0.6118 ± 6(22 ± 1) × 106WT54008 ± 2138 ± 15 (0.9)(18 ± 3) × 106 (1.2)WT10007 ± 1133 ± 11 (0.9)(19 ± 2) × 106 (1.2)K159A5033 ± 56.3 ± 0.5 (19)(0.19 ± 0.03) × 106 (116)K159A540031 ± 435 ± 2 (3)(1.15 ± 0.08) × 106 (19)K159A100038 ± 413.7 ± 0.7 (9)(0.36 ± 0.04) × 106 (61)K159A20040042 ± 642 ± 3 (3)(1.00 ± 0.07) × 106 (22)a The-fold decrease shown in parenthesis is the ratio of the kinetic parameters for wild type at 5 mm CAPS versus enzyme in different concentrations of CAPS and methylamine Open table in a new tab Chemical Rescue of the Activity of the K159A Mutant Enzyme by Exogenous Proton Acceptors—To further characterize the contribution of the mutated side chain on the catalytic rate enhancement provided by wild-type enzyme, noncovalent chemical rescue reagents were used to restore the activity of the mutant enzyme. The small molecules used were the primary amines, ammonia, methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, ethanolamine, and 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine, as well as azide. Those molecules have different pKa values and different molecular volumes (26Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An increase in the initial rate of the mutant enzyme was observed in the presence of all of the chemical rescue agents with the exception of 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine (up to 0.4 m, pKa = 5.7) in the presence of 5 mm CAPS, pH 10.4. The activity of wild-type 3α-HSD/CR was unaffected by 0.4 m methylamine within the range of experimental error (Table 1). The activity of the K159A mutant enzyme in the presence of methylamine obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to androsterone as the varied substrate. The kinetic parameters we obtained for the K159A mutant-catalyzed reaction were compared in the absence and presence of 0.4 m methylamine at 5 mm CAPS, pH 10.4. No significant change in affinity for androsterone was observed in response to external amine. The V/Et and V/KandrosteroneEt for the K159A mutant enzyme at 5 mm CAPS was increased 6-fold with 0.4 m methylamine, which was up to 30% in V/Et and 5% in V/KandrosteroneEt of the wild-type level. The rescue of activity in K159A by external bases is shown in supplemental Fig. S2. The second order rate constant (V/KEt) for methylamine increased as the pH increased, indicating that the basic form of amine is an active species (data not shown). The concentration of the conjugated base form of the chemical rescuers was then calculated based on the pKa of the bases and the pH value in the solution according to the Henderson-Hasselbach Equation 5. Data were fitted to Equation 4 to obtain the second order rate constant, V/Kd-baseEt. The kinetic parameters V/Et, V/Kd-baseEt, and Kd-base that we obtained are shown in Table 2.TABLE 2Chemical rescue of activity in K159A and K159 M mutant enzymes by external base at pH 10.4 The reaction included 46.6 μm androsterone, 1 mm NAD+ at 5 mm CAPS, pH 10.4, and data were fitted to Equation 4 to obtain kinetic parameters V/Et, Kd-base, and V/Kd-baseEt.

A plot of log V/Kd-baseEt versus molecular volume showed a linear relationship with a slope of -0.0085 and intercept of 3.38. The decrease in log V/Kd-baseEt as the side chain increased in length indicates a steric discrimination in the active site of the K159A mutant enzyme. The result clearly indicated that the size of the external amine affected the catalytic efficiency in proton transfer for the K159A mutant enzyme. In contrast, the plot comparing log V/Kd-baseEt and pKa did not show a clear correlation. Therefore, data for rescue efficiency were fitted to Equation 6, resulting in a Brønsted coefficient β of 0.85 ± 0.09, a volume coefficient V of -0."
https://openalex.org/W2006888709,"KEG1/YFR042w of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential gene that encodes a 200-amino acid polypeptide with four predicted transmembrane domains. The green fluorescent protein- or Myc6-tagged Keg1 protein showed the typical characteristics of an integral membrane protein and was found in the endoplasmic reticulum by fluorescence imaging. Immunoprecipitation from the Triton X-100-solubilized cell lysate revealed that Keg1 binds to Kre6, which has been known to participate in β-1,6-glucan synthesis. To analyze the essential function of Keg1 in more detail, we constructed temperature-sensitive mutant alleles by error-prone polymerase chain reaction. The keg1-1 mutant cells showed a common phenotype with Δkre6 mutant including hypersensitivity to Calcofluor white, reduced sensitivity to the K1 killer toxin, and reduced content of β-1,6-glucan in the cell wall. These results suggest that Keg1 and Kre6 have a cooperative role in β-1,6-glucan synthesis in S. cerevisiae.

These results suggest that Keg1 and Kre6 have a cooperative role in β-1,6-glucan synthesis in S. cerevisiae. The fungal cell wall is an essential extracellular network composed of polysaccharides and proteins that contributes to protect the cell from internal turgor pressure and external harmful agents. It also contributes in the selective uptake and excretion of various materials and works in communication with the environment. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall is composed of polysaccharides (∼85%) and proteins (∼15%) and represents ∼30% of the cell dry weight (1Lesage G. Bussey H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Polysaccharides form a basal fibril network with branches and covalent linkage among the components. The proteins are heavily glycosylated with N- and O-linked saccharides mostly composed of mannose. Many of these mannoproteins are covalently linked to polysaccharide networks through glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor remnant or alkali-labile linkage (1Lesage G. Bussey H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 2Ecker M. Deutzmann R. Lehle L. Mrsa V. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11523-11529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Some proteins are physically trapped in the mesh of networks or are chemically linked with other proteins by a disulfide bond. Polysaccharides are long fibrillar and tensile β-1,3-glucans of ∼1500 glucose units/chain, amorphous and flexible β-1,6-glucans of ∼350 glucose units/chain, and linear microfibril chitins of β-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (1-2%). β-1,3-Glucan and chitin are synthesized by specific polymerases embedded in the plasma membrane using cytoplasmic UDP-sugars as the substrates. The localization and activity of polymerases are controlled by the actin cytoskeleton and secretory system according to the environmental stimuli and cell cycle regulatory system. Conversely, β-1,6-glucan synthesis is more complex, and the gene products whose mutations have defects in the β-1,6-glucan content are localized throughout the secretory pathway and at the cell surface (3Shahinian S. Bussey H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). KRE5 and CNE1, which encode UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase- and calnexin-related proteins, CWH41 and ROT2, which encode glucosidases I and II, respectively, fungus-specific genes BIG1, ROT1, KRE9 and its homologue KNH1, KRE6, and SKN1, which encode type II membrane protein with sequence and structural similarity to family 16 glycoside hydrolases, and KRE1, which encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cytoplasmic membrane protein, are involved. The relation among these gene products and their molecular roles in β-1,6-glucan synthesis remains obscure at present. The biochemical tools including in vitro biosynthetic assay are also still undeveloped practically (4Vink E. Rodriguez-Surez R.J. Gérard-Vincent M. Ribas J.C. de Nobel H. van den Ende H. Durán A.

However, a considerable number of genes still remain uncharacterized, because they are difficult to examine in a large scale analysis for various reasons. These include essential genes that are required for colony formation under the laboratory culture condition favorable for yeast. In many cases, the sequence homology or motif information did not suggest a possible candidate of their function, and the experiments available for such large-scale analyses as those that use promoter shutoff showed that the cells lost their colony-forming activity without showing a distinctive phenotype when the gene product was depleted. We have to study these remaining genes individually, employing approaches more specific for each gene to reach a more complete understanding of the S. cerevisiae genome. YFR042w is one of the uncharacterized essential genes, and the predicted gene product is a 200-amino acid hydrophobic polypeptide with four possible transmembrane domains. Because we have been studying the transport, modification, and localization of secretory proteins, which occurs during the intracellular membrane traffic from the ER 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein. via the Golgi to the cell surface, we examined if the product of YFR042w works in the ER or Golgi. In this paper we show that it localizes in the ER, associates with Kre6 protein, and has a role in the biosynthesis of β-1,6-glucan in the cell wall. The gene was named KEG1 for a Kre6-binding ER membrane protein responsible for β-1,6-glucan synthesis 1. Strains and Media—S. cerevisiae used in this study are listed in Table 1. They were grown in YPD (1% Bacto yeast extract (BD Biosciences), 2% Bacto peptone (BD Biosciences), and 2% glucose), or SD (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and appropriate supplements) medium at 30 °C unless other temperatures were indicated. SC medium was SD containing 0.2% vitamin assay casamino acids (BD Biosciences). Solid media were made with 1.5% agar. Twenty μg/ml each of histidine, tryptophan, and uracil and 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was added in SC to make a 5-fluoro-orotic acid plate for Ura3+ counter-selection, 300 μg/ml Geneticin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added in YPD to make a G418 plate, and 20 μg/ml Phloxine B (Sigma-Aldrich) was added in YPD to make a Phloxine plate (9Tsukada M.

The nucleotide sequences were confirmed after cloning in the plasmid. Low copy KEG1 plasmid (pCA69) was made by ligation of the PCR amplification fragment from the genomic DNA using the primers CA47 and CA48 into the plasmid pRS316 (CEN, URA3). The N-terminal tagging of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to Keg1 (pCA106) was made by ligation of the PCR amplification fragment using CA57 and CA48 into pCA42 (CEN, TRP1 YPT1promoter-GFP).

This fragment was cloned in the BamHI-SmaI site of pRS313 (CEN, HIS3). Then the 3′-259-bp fragment of pCA69 obtained by PCR amplification using primers YN228 and CA48 was inserted into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the newly generated plasmid. This plasmid was cleaved with EcoRI and mixed with DNA prepared by amplification under error-prone PCR conditions (10Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) using primers CA47 and CA48. CAY236 (Δkeg1, pCA106) was transformed with this mixture to integrate the PCR fragments into the plasmid by gap repair. The His+ transformants were replicated to 5-fluoro-orotic acid plates to remove pCA106 and then replicated to Phloxine B plates and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. The cells that formed pink colonies were tested for single colony formation at 25 and 37 °C. After confirming that the temperature sensitivity was due to the plasmid, the nucleotide sequences of the mutant keg1 were determined. The keg1-1 mutant gene with a single amino acid substitution H124L and good temperature-sensitive response was used to replace the authentic KEG1 of KSY99 to obtain AKY17 with chromosomal keg1-1 gene. Subcellular Fractionation and Solubility Test of Membrane Proteins—Cells were converted to spheroplasts and burst in B88 (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 200 mm sorbitol) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min to obtain the total cell lysate. For subcellular fractionation, total cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to generate the pellet (P10) and supernatant (S10), and then S10 was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to generate the pellet (P100) and supernatant (S100). Each fraction was adjusted to the original volume of the lysate, and the same amount was applied for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Anti-Scs2 rabbit antiserum (11Kagiwada S. Hosaka K. Murata M. Nikawa J. Takatsuki A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Satoshi Kagiwada (Nara Woman's University, Japan), and anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10; Berkeley Antibodies) was purchased. Antisera against Van1 and GFP were prepared by immunizing rabbits using appropriate GST fusion proteins. As a solubility test, a portion of lysate was mixed with the same amount of B88 containing 2% Triton X-100, 0.2 m Na2CO3, or 4 m urea and kept on ice for 15 min. After removing a sample as the total, the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The precipitate was suspended in the same volume of the same buffer as the supernatant and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Fixation and permeabilization of the yeast cells for indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described by Wooding and Pelham (12Wooding S. Pelham H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2667-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and subsequent steps were performed as described by Vashist et al. (13Vashist S. Frank C.G. Jakob C.A. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 21: 3955-3966Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with some modifications; a description of the procedure is as follows. Log-phase cells grown at 30 °C were fixed by adding 2.5 ml of fresh 10% paraformaldehyde to 7.5 ml of yeast culture and pelleted by centrifugation. They were resuspended in 3.2 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1.8 ml of paraformaldehyde solution was added, and fixation was continued for an additional 15 min. Cells were then washed 4 times in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 (PP) and resuspended in 1 ml of PP with 1.2 m sorbitol containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. 10 μl of lyticase was added, and incubation was continued at 30 °C. The spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm NH4Cl in SPP (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, with 1.2 m sorbitol) and then in SPP before being transferred to polylysine-coated slides. The slides were immersed in methanol for 6 min and acetone for 30 s, both at -20 °C, and then air-dried. The anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody was diluted to 1/40 in 1% skim milk, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), and incubations were carried out overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed and incubated in the secondary antibodies (rhodamine-conjugated goat antibody to mouse immunoglobulin G) for 2 h at room temperature, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted as described by Kilmartin and Adams (14Kilmartin J.V. Adams A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Images were obtained using an FV500 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were converted to spheroplasts and burst in B88 containing protease inhibitors. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cleared lysate was mixed with 1/10 volume of 10% Triton X-100 and kept on ice for 15 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was mixed with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and kept gently rotating at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) washed with B88 containing 1% Triton X-100 were added, and incubation was continued at 4 °C for an additional hour. The beads were washed 5 times with B88 containing 1% Triton X-100 and then suspended in the SDS sample buffer at 37 °C for 5 min to obtain the SDS-PAGE samples. Determination of the Cell-wall Glucan Contents—Alkali-insoluble β-glucan contents were determined as described by Umeyama et al. (15Umeyama T. Kanako A. Watanabe H. Hirai A. Uehara Y. Niimi M. Azuma M. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 2373-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with some modification. Cells grown in YPD at 25 °C until A600 nm = 1.0 were collected, washed, and broken with glass beads using a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka). The cell wall fraction was collected by centrifugation at 2600 × g for 5 min, washed 3 times with deionized water, and extracted 3 times with 3% (w/v) NaOH at 75 °C for 1 h. The pellet was washed twice with deionized water, suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1.0 mg/ml Zymolyase 100T, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min, and a half of the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The hexose contents of the pellet, the supernatant without dialysis, and the supernatant after dialysis were determined by the phenol-H2SO4 method. The content of alkali-insoluble β-1,3-glucan was calculated by subtracting the supernatant after dialysis from the supernatant without dialysis, and that of β-1,6-glucan was calculated by adding the pellet and supernatant after dialysis. The content of alkali-soluble β-1,3-glucan was also determined as described (16Imai K. Noda Y. Adachi H. Yoda K. J. Biol.

According to the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base, it encodes a 200-amino acid polypeptide of Mr = 23,555 and pI = 10.5, the biochemical function of which remains unknown. Homologous sequences were found in several fungal genome databases by a FASTAP search (Fig. 1A), but no homologues were found in the data base of higher eukaryotes. The similar sequences of Candida glabrata, Ashbya gossypii, and Kluyveromyces lactis have amino acid identities of 57, 50, and 45%, respectively. We routinely use two parental S. cerevisiae strains, KA31a in our laboratory stock and BY4741 obtained from the EUROSCARF Consortium. There are 10 base differences in the 2603-nucleotide fragment containing the whole KEG1 gene. As a result, the KA31a Keg1 protein has 3 amino acid substitutions, G3V, Y55C, and N84D, compared with the sequence of the BY4741 Keg1 protein as registered in the sequence data base. The amino acids of these three positions are not conservative and have wide varieties among the four homologous sequences. We used the KA31a KEG1 in this study unless otherwise indicated. The nucleotide sequence of KEG1 of the strain KA31a is registered in the EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ data base under the accession number AB303676. The hydropathy plot indicated that there are four hydrophobic segments in the Keg1 polypeptide (Fig. 1B), which suggests that Keg1 is a multimembrane-spanning integral protein. To facilitate detection of the Keg1 protein, we constructed a plasmid pCA106 that produces the N-terminal GFP-tagged Keg1 protein under the control of a moderate promoter of YPT1. A diploid strain in which one of the KEG1 alleles was replaced by kanMX4 was transformed with pCA106 and sporulated. Haploid keg1Δ::kanMX4/pCA106 (GFP-KEG1) strains, obtained by tetrad dissection, grew as well as the wild type, which indicated that the GFP-tagged Keg1 is functional in the cell (Fig. 2A). Plasmid for production of Myc6-Keg1 (pCA120) was similarly constructed, and the product was also functional (Fig. 2B). The GFP-Keg1 was detected by Western blotting using the anti-GFP antibody as a band of 36 kDa if the SDS-PAGE sample was prepared without being heated in boiling water. When the sample was subjected to boiling, no GFP-Keg1 signal was detected on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (data not shown), probably because the GFP-Keg1 became insoluble and was unable to migrate into the separation gel as is common of many multimembrane-spanning proteins. In a solubilization test, Myc6-Keg1(Fig. 3A) and GFP-Keg1 (Fig. 3B) were recovered exclusively in the precipitate, even in the presence of 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11, or 2 m urea. They were mostly recovered in the supernatant in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, although a small portion remained in the precipitate in comparison with the reference membrane proteins Scs2 or tagged Kre6. We concluded that Keg1 is an integral membrane protein as predicted by its amino acid sequence. The intracellular localization of GFP fusion protein was observed by fluorescent microscopy. The fluorescence signal of GFP-Keg1 was found in a central ring and ribbons at the cell periphery close to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). This is the typical pattern common to the ER-resident proteins that reside in the nuclear envelope and peripheral ER, distinct from the fluorescence images of the other large organelles such as the mitochondria and vacuole or the smaller organelles including the Golgi, endosomes, and peroxisome. The subcellular fractionation indicated that most of GFP-Keg1 was in the P10 fraction, and only a small portion was in the P100, as was the ER-resident marker membrane protein Scs2 (Fig. 5). In the same fractionation, the early Golgi membrane protein Van1 was found almost equally in the p10 and P100 fractions. We conclude that Keg1 is an ER-resident integral membrane protein.FIGURE 5Subcellular fractionation of Keg1 protein. The cells having GFP-Keg1 and Kre6-Myc6 (KNY19) were converted to spheroplasts and disrupted, and the total cell lysate (TCL) was subjected to differential centrifugations to obtain the 10,000 × g supernatant (S10) and pellet (P10) and then 100,000 × g supernatant (S100) and pellet (P100). The sample volumes were adjusted to the concentration of total cell lysate, and the proteins shown on the left were detected by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Isolation of the Temperature-sensitive keg1-1 Allele—To analyze the function of Keg1 protein in detail, we sought to construct temperature-sensitive keg1 mutant alleles. Fifteen temperature-sensitive keg1 mutant candidates were obtained by error-prone PCR mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The keg1-1 allele was selected for further study because it has a single amino acid alteration H124L and good temperature-sensitive response. The 124th amino acid, His, is well conserved among the four Keg1-related sequences (Fig. 1A). Fig. 6A shows the temperature sensitivity of the keg1-1 mutation. The colony formation defect was complemented by introducing either of the Myc6-KEG1 or GFP-KEG1 plasmid, which also indicated that these tagged polypeptides were functional. The keg1-1 mutant had an increased sensitivity to chitin binding dye Calcofluor white, which was also reversed by introducing GFP-KEG1 to near the wild type (Fig. 6B). The remaining sensitivity might be due to the codominant nature of the Keg1-1 mutant protein. To get a clue to uncover the function of Keg1, we screened for the multicopy suppressor genes of the temperature sensitivity of the keg1-1. The keg1-1 mutant did not form colonies on the YPD plate at 37 °C. We introduced a 2-μm plasmid library into the keg1-1 mutant cells, and obtained three transformants whose colony-forming activity at 37 °C was dependent on the introduced plasmids (data not shown). These plasmids had different DNA fragments, but the ROT1 gene was common in all inserts, and the ROT1 subclone had the multicopy suppressor activity for colony formation (Fig. 7A). Rot1 was previously reported as being a membrane protein required for maintaining normal levels of the cell wall β-1,6-glucan (18Machi K. Azuma M. Igarashi K. Matsumoto T. Fukuda H. Kondo A. Ooshima H. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3163-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and may function with BiP/Kar2 in protein folding (19Takeuchi M. Kimata Y. Hirata A. Oka M. Kohno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The Calcofluor white hypersensitivity of the keg1-1 mutant was partially recovered by introducing the multicopy ROT1 gene (Fig. 7B). The tagged version of ROT1 with GFP or 3HA either at the N or C terminus did not have the suppressor activity, which made it difficult to examine the protein-protein interaction between Rot1 and Keg1 in further detail. Using a guinea pig anti-Rot1 antiserum generously provided by Dr. Kenji Kohno (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan), the Rot1 signal was faintly detected in the negative control sample and not specifically enriched in the immunoprecipitate of Myc6-Keg1 (data not shown). Therefore, we could not conclude whether Rot1 and Keg1 have a physical interaction or not. Interaction and Colocalization of Keg1 Protein with Kre6 Protein—A physical interaction between Keg1 and Kre6 proteins was reported in the yeast two-hybrid interaction screening (20Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3911) Google Scholar). The KRE6 gene was discovered by the killer toxin resistant mutant phenotype and was found to encode an 80-kDa type II integral membrane protein that is required for β-1,6-glucan biosynthesis (21Roemer T.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4039-4048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the Keg1-Kre6 physical interaction biochemically by immunoprecipitation experiments, we constructed tagged KRE6-Myc6 and KRE6-GFP. Introduction of KRE6-Myc6 recovered the Calcofluor white sensitivity of Δkre6 partially, but KRE6-GFP did not have such activity, probably because a large GFP interferes with the Kre6 function (Fig. 6C). A Triton X-100-solubilized cleared lysate was prepared from the cells producing both GFP-Keg1 and Kre6-Myc6 and was subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. As a control, cells carrying the GFP-KEG1 plasmid and the Myc6 vector were used. Western blotting indicated that a part of GFP-Keg1 was recovered in the immunoprecipitate of Kre6-Myc6 (Fig. 8A). The control experiments indicated that nonspecific precipitation of GFP-Keg1 was undetectable. A reverse tag combination experiment was done using the cells producing"
https://openalex.org/W2087068205,"CD43 is a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of most hematopoietic cells. Expression of CD43 has also been demonstrated in many human tumor tissues, including colon adenomas and carcinomas, but not in normal colon epithelium. The potential contribution of CD43 to tumor development is still not understood. Here, we show that overexpression of CD43 increases cell growth and colony formation in mouse and human cells lacking expression of either p53 or ARF (alternative reading frame) tumor-suppressor proteins. In addition, CD43 overexpression also lowers the detection of the FAS death receptor on the cell surface of human cancer cells, and thereby helps to evade FAS-mediated apoptosis. However, when both p53 and ARF proteins are present, CD43 overexpression activates p53 and suppresses colony formation due to induction of apoptosis. These observations suggest CD43 as a potential contributor to tumor development and the functional ARF–p53 pathway is required for the elimination of cells with aberrant CD43 expression."

Models for the E. coli ring structure have been proposed based upon NMR solution structures and intersubunit cross-linking of Cys residues in the membrane. The E. coli models differ from the recent x-ray diffraction structure of the isolated Ilyobacter tartaricus c-ring. Furthermore, key cross-linking results supporting the E. coli model prove to be incompatible with the I. tartaricus structure. To test the applicability of the I. tartaricus model to the E. coli c-ring, we compared the cross-linking of a pair of doubly Cys substituted c-subunits, each of which was compatible with one model but not the other. The key finding of this study is that both A21C/M65C and A21C/I66C doubly substituted c-subunits form high yield oligomeric structures, c2, c3... c10, via intersubunit disulfide bond formation. The results indicate that helical swiveling, with resultant interconversion of the two conformers predicted by the E. coli and I. tartaricus models, must be occurring over the time course of the cross-linking experiment. In the additional experiments reported here, we tried to ascertain the preferred conformation in the membrane to help define the most likely structural model. We conclude that both structures must be able to form in the membrane, but that the helical swiveling that promotes their interconversion may not be necessary during rotary function.

Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The E. coli model differs most significantly from the I. tartaricus x-ray structure in the positioning of cTMH2 relative to cTMH1. In the E. coli model, Asp61 packs between the helices of interacting subunits and projects toward cTMH1 at the interior of the ring (Figs. 1A and 2A). In the I. tartaricus structure, Glu65 (the equivalent of E. coli Asp61) points toward the periphery of the c-ring (7Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The Na+ ion is chelated between the ionized Glu65 carboxyl group and the Gln32 side chain in one subunit and the Val63 backbone carbonyl and the Ser66 side chain hydroxyl in a second subunit. On the basis of the I. tartaricus structure, Meier et al. (7Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) have modeled what the E. coli c-ring would look like if equivalent residues were overlaid on the I. tartaricus backbone using the program WHATIF (Fig. 2B) (19Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). In the E. coli c-ring model of Dmitriev et al. (11Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), cTMH2 would have to be rotated by ∼160° to place Asp61 in the equivalent position (Figs. 1B and 2C). Upon comparison of the two models shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), we immediately realized that the I. tartaricus-based model with TMH2 rotated by 160° was incompatible with key cross-linking constraints that had been used to derive the original E. coli model (11Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Four sets of double Cys substitutions could be cross-linked into multimeric c-subunit “ladders” on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel that extended up to c10-oligomers (10Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The multimeric ladders formed with the 14/72, 20/66, and 21/65 Cys/Cys pairs could not be explained by models mimicking the I. tartaricus structure, whereas the multimeric ladder seen with the 70/72 Cys/Cys pair could be explained by either model. The positions of the 20/66 and 21/65 Cys/Cys pairs in the two models are shown in Fig. 1 (A and B). In the E. coli model (Fig. 1A), these Cys/Cys pairs are positioned such that intersubunit cross-links could form. After rotation of cTMH2 by 160° to a position equivalent to that seen in the I. tartaricus model (Fig. 1B), both the 20/66 and 21/65 Cys/Cys pairs are positioned such that intrasubunit (but not intersubunit) cross-links could form. The 14/72 intermolecular cross-link could also form from the positions shown in Fig. 1A, but not in the model shown in Fig. 1B. On the other hand, after a 160° clockwise rotation of TMH2, one might expect to see intersubunit cross-links with the 21/66 Cys/Cys pair (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 2Comparison of the relative orientations of TMH1 and TMH2 in the NMR structure of E. coli subunit c at pH 5 versus models of E. coli subunit c based upon the I. tartaricus x-ray structure.A, E. coli NMR structure at pH 5.

After constructing the 21/66 Cys mutant, we compared Cu2+-catalyzed cross-linking with that in the 21/65 Cys mutant and were surprised that multimeric ladders were formed in both double mutants. These findings immediately suggested that helical swiveling with resultant interconversion of the two conformers could be occurring over the time course of the experiment. Previously, the possibility of rare helical swiveling was suggested as an explanation for formation of low yield dimers when single Cys residues were introduced in the region of residues 62-66 near the essential Asp61 residue (10Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the additional experiments reported here, we tried to ascertain the preferred conformation in the membrane to help define the most likely structural model. We conclude that both structures must be able to form in the membrane, but also that the helical swiveling promoting the interconversion of structures may not be a necessary feature of rotary function. Mutant Plasmid Construction—The Cys substitutions were generated in plasmid pCMA113 (16Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCMA113 plasmid encodes the unc (atp) operon and additionally encodes a C-terminal His6 tag on subunit a, a C21S substitution in subunit b, and Ala substitutions for the remaining endogenous Cys residues in F1 (20Kuo P.H. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cys substitutions were created by a two-step PCR method of site-directed mutagenesis using a synthetic oligonucleotide with the codon change and two wild-type primers encoding known restriction sites (21Barik S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 68: 203-215Google Scholar). Mutant PCR products were ligated directly into plasmids pCMA113 and plasmid pPRS081 (pCMA113 with a deletion of the uncB gene encoding subunit a). Plasmid pPRS081 was generated by cloning the HindIII/BsrGI DNA fragment containing the uncB deletion from plasmid pVF208 (22Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) into the equivalent restriction sites in plasmid pCMA113. All experiments were carried out with plasmid transformants of strain JWP292, which carries a chromosomal deletion of the unc operon (5Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Copper-catalyzed Cross-linking—Cells were grown and membrane vesicles were prepared as described (23Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Membranes were centrifuged and resuspended in TMG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) at pH 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5 at a concentration of 5 mg/ml, and 45-μl aliquots were mixed with 5 μl of 15 mm CuSO4 and 45 mmo-phenanthroline (Cu2+(phenanthroline)2 (CuP)) stock solution in TMG buffer (at the appropriate pH) to initiate the reaction. Cross-linking reactions were incubated for variable times at variable temperatures. All reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1 volume of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 8.0) and 0.1 volume 0.5 mN-ethylmaleimide in ethanol and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The sample was then mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8% SDS, 24% glycerol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue) at room temperature for 1 h prior to SDS-PAGE. SDS Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Each sample was run via SDS-PAGE using the Tricine-buffered gel system described by Schägger and von Jagow (24Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) with 12% acrylamide and 0.375% bisacrylamide. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and transferred proteins were then blocked with 5% (w/v) blocking agent (GE Healthcare) in PBS-T (0.8% (w/v) NaCl, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm NaH2PO4, and 0.1% Tween 20). Immunoblotting was carried out in a 1:40,000 dilution of rabbit anti-subunit c serum (25Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2815-2817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in PBS-T containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin with a 1-h incubation at room temperature. Following washing with PBS-T, the membrane was incubated in a 1:40,000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare) in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing, each immunoblot was covered with West Pico chemiluminescence solution (Pierce) for 5 min and then exposed to HyBlot autoradiography film (Denville Scientific Inc., Metuchen, NJ) for protein visualization. Comparison of Cross-link Formation in 21/65 Versus 21/66 Double Cys Mutants—Membranes from the 21/65 and 21/66 double Cys mutants were treated with CuP to catalyze oxidative formation of Cys-Cys disulfide bonds. Subunit c and its cross-linked products were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Prominent oligomeric subunit c products were observed in both the 21/65 and the 21/66 double Cys mutants. Oligomers of the two mutants were found to migrate at slightly different rates on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Oligomers were absent in membranes that were not treated with CuP and also in wild-type membranes lacking Cys in subunit c. A prominent immunoartifact (labeled IA in Fig. 3) was seen in all membrane preparations. This antiserum-reacting band of unknown identity had been reported previously (10Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Distinct multimeric products (c2, c3... c10) maximizing at c10 were clearly observed with the Cys21/Cys65 membranes, as had been reported previously (5Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The bands seen in the Cys21/Cys66 membranes were always more diffuse, suggesting cross-linking heterogeneity. This heterogeneity was most apparent upon examination of the c2 and c4 products. We think that the heterogeneity is most likely due to dimer formation between Cys66 in two different subunits in addition to Cys21/Cys66 dimer and oligomer formation. As we have reported previously (10Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), mutant proteins with single Cys residues substituted into residues 62-66 of cTMH2 do form low yield dimers, with the yield of dimer being much more prominent for the Cys66 mutant versus the Cys65 mutant. The lower yield of the Cys65 dimer may explain the apparent absence of band heterogeneity in the 21/65 double Cys mutant. Finally, the oligomers formed with the 21/66 membranes do not maximize as cleanly at c10 and may suggest minor amounts of c11 and perhaps c12 products. Effects of Time, Temperature, and pH on Cross-link Formation—The cross-link formation seen in Fig. 3 occurred in reactions conducted over 60 min at room temperature at pH 8.0. We attempted to distinguish whether one type of cross-link occurred more rapidly than the other by varying the length of the reaction from 1 to 60 min (Fig. 4). The 21/66 mutant formed greater amounts of c4 product at the 5- and 10-min intervals, and the intensity of oligomeric products >c5 was also greater in this mutant at the 30- and 60-min intervals. However, the most obvious conclusion from the experiment is that cross-linking is generally slow in both membrane types. Cross-linking with both membrane types showed a strong temperature dependence, with virtually no cross-linking occurring at 0 °C over a period of 60 min (Fig. 5). Nearly equivalent amounts of oligomeric products ≤c5 were observed in the two membrane types at 16 °C. As the temperature was raised further, the 21/66 membranes showed greater formation of oligomeric products >c5. Cross-linking in both mutant membranes increased at alkaline pH, as would be expected if the Cys thiolate were the reactive species (Fig. 6). Virtually no cross-linking was observed at pH ≤7.0. The increase in extent of cross-linking seen between pH 8.0 and 8.5 was considerably greater for 21/65 than for 21/66 membranes and may indicate a difference in pKa for Cys65versus Cys66.FIGURE 5Cu2+-catalyzed intersubunit c cross-linking at varied reaction temperatures. Membranes with the A21C/M65C (21C65C) or A21C/I66C (21C66C) substitution were treated (+) or not (-) with CuP at pH 8.0 for 60 min at the indicated temperatures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Cu2+-catalyzed intersubunit c cross-linking at varied reaction pH. Membranes with the A21C/M65C (21C65C) or A21C/I66C (21C66C) substitution were treated (+) or not (-) with CuP at the indicated reaction pH for 60 min at 23 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cross-linking Is Enhanced by Removal of Subunit a—The structure of c-subunits packed next to subunit a in the membrane may differ from those elsewhere in the ring, and conceivably, the interaction with subunit a could affect the structures of all c-subunits in the ring in a cooperative manner. These packing interactions might also reduce helical swiveling within subunit c. To test the effects of subunit a on the cross-linking reactions, we generated the 21/65 and 21/66 substitutions in a plasmid in which the uncB gene encoding subunit a was deleted. Comparisons of cross-linking in membranes containing or lacking subunit a are shown in Fig. 7. Deletion of subunit a led to significant increases in the extent of cross-linking during a 30-min incubation for both the 21/65 and 21/66 membranes. The key finding in this study is that Cys21/Cys65 and Cys21/Cys66 substituted c-subunits both form oligomeric ladders via CuP-catalyzed disulfide bond formation. Multimeric subunit c ladder formation with the Cys21/Cys65 mutant is incompatible with a model of the c-ring based upon the I. tartaricus x-ray structure (7Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and ladder formation with the Cys21/Cys66 mutant is incompatible with the c-ring model based upon the NMR structure of subunit c at pH 5.5 and other cross-linking data (11Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Other models that would accommodate cross-linking of both Cys21/Cys65 and Cys21/Cys66 from a single structure, e.g. if TMH2 was rotated counterclockwise by 60° in Fig. 1A, would be incompatible with other cross-links observed by Jones et al. (10Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We believe that the most likely explanation for the apparently conflicting observations in the literature (7Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 10Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) is that the c-ring structure is inherently flexible, at least in E. coli, and that thermally induced helical movement and swiveling can take place in the membrane. Such movements may be relatively slow and normally may be rapidly reversed to the preferred structure. The observed cross-links may have trapped the swiveled helices in conformations that are inherently improbable. The distances between Cys β-carbons in the two modeled structures are 5.8 Å for Cys21/Cys65 (Fig. 1A) and 6.0 Å for Cys21/Cys66 (Fig. 1B). The average distance between β-carbons of disulfide-linked Cys-Cys residues in proteins is ∼4 Å (26Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Fasman G Prediction of Protein Structure and the Principles of Protein Conformation. Plenum Publishing Corp, New York1989: 1-98Crossref Google Scholar), and some motion is therefore likely necessary to facilitate cross-link formation. The cross-linking observed here did require relatively long periods of incubation and was markedly inhibited by reductions in temperature. The removal of subunit a led to increased rates of cross-linking, indicating that the c-ring might be stabilized while complexed with subunit a, with a resultant decrease in helical swiveling. None of these factors clearly distinguished the Cys21-Cys65versus Cys21-Cys66 cross-linking reactions. The inherent flexibility of c-ring structure and slowness of the cross-linking reactions preclude use of this type of approach in distinguishing mechanistic models. The molecular dynamics calculations of Aksimentiev et al. (27Aksimentiev A. Balabin I.A. Fillingame R.H. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1332-1344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with a modeled E. coli c-ring indicate that TMH2 can freely swivel at the TMH1 interface to move the Asp61 carboxyl group from the position shown in Fig. 1A to that shown in Fig. 1B. The NMR studies of Rastogi and Girvin (13Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) indicate that subunit c adopts two stable conformations in solution depending upon the pH. At pH 5, the structure is as shown in Figs. 1A and 2A. At pH 8, TMH2 rotates 140° clockwise to a position similar to that shown in Figs. 1B and 2(B and C). In the experiments in which we measured the effects of pH on cross-linking, we hypothesized that the more alkaline pH values might favor the Cys21-Cys66 cross-linking reaction because TMH2 is predicted to be turned as shown in Fig. 1B when Asp61 is ionized. However, in contrast to this prediction, the more alkaline incubation conditions at pH 8.5 enhanced Cys21-Cys65 cross-link formation. Upon comparison of the pH 5 and 8 NMR structures, major differences are seen in the short polar loop connecting TMH1 and TMH2 (13Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Similarly, the major differences between the pH 5 structure (Fig. 2A) and the modeled E. coli WHATIF structure (Fig. 2B) are in the loop region. When the dihedral angles for loop residues 37-49 are replaced with the equivalent dihedral angles from the I. tartaricus structure (Fig. 2D), a swiveling of helices and repositioning of residues occur to very closely mimic the structures shown in Fig. 2 (B and C). This exercise suggests that helical swiveling in the membrane may be mediated by structural changes in the loop residues. Does helical swiveling between the two conformations displayed in Fig. 1 play a functional role in the mechanical rotation of the c-ring, as suggested previously by our models (27Aksimentiev A. Balabin I.A. Fillingame R.H. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1332-1344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp.

These models now seem less likely, particularly if the swiveling is caused by major structural changes in loop residues. Mutations in loop residues are known to weaken the binding and coupling of F1 to F0 (30Mosher M.E. White L.K. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4807-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Miller M.J. Fraga D. Paule C.R. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10221-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the sites of binding of γ- and ϵ-subunits to loop residues of the c-ring have been mapped by Cys-Cys cross-linking (35Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 36Watts S.D. Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. Capaldi R.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The γ-subunit can be permanently cross-linked to subunit c and the enzyme retain nearly normal ATP-driven H+-translocation function (2Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 154-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 39Schulenberg B. Aggeler R. Murray J. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), so the γϵ-complex need not be displaced from the c-ring surface during multiple 360° c-ring rotations. Major changes in the loop region such as those observed in the pH 5 and 8 structures by Rastogi and Girvin (13Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) would be expected to alter γϵ binding and possibly displace F1 from F0. We think that the helical swiveling observed here could be taking place predominantly at subunits of the c-ring that are not binding γϵ or possibly occur during the periodic dissociation of F1 from F0 under these dilute solution conditions. The I. tartaricus c-ring structure is proposed to be very stable because of the liganding of Na+ between residues of two interacting subunits (3Dimroth P. von Ballmoos C. Meier T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 41Meier T. Dimroth P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1094-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For example, the c11-ring is stable in Tris-buffered octyl glucoside solution at 95 °C in the presence of Na+, but dissociates into monomeric subunits in the absence of Na+ (41Meier T. Dimroth P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1094-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to know whether the I. tartaricus ring is more resistant to helical swiveling than its E. coli counterpart and whether swiveling is inhibited by the binding of Na+. This can be tested by cross-linking experiments similar to those reported here. At present, the I. tartaricus c-ring structure, with the helices of all subunits positioned as shown in Fig. 1B, does provide structural explanations for several experimental observations made with E. coli F0. Using Cys-Cys cross-linking, Jiang and Fillingame (42Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) identified seven residues on one helical face of cTMH2 that can be cross-linked to Cys substituted into TMH4 of subunit a. The side chains of the seven membrane-spanning residues are positioned on the exposed, outer helical face of cTMH2 in the WHATIF model of the E. coli subunit c (Fig. 2B) (7Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The WHATIF model also provides a facile structural explanation for the function of the Asp interchange mutants, in which the essential aspartate was moved from position 61 in cTMH2 to position 24 in cTMH1 with retention of function (43Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 44Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5473-5479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2(B-D), the wild-type Ala24 side chain packs at a position where an Asp substitution would place the essential carboxyl in essentially the same position between the helices as when anchored at Asp61.

https://openalex.org/W1971406042,"Aneuploidy and genomic instability are common features of human cancers, including breast cancer; however, mechanisms by which such abnormalities develop are not understood. The exquisite dependence of the mammary gland on hormones for growth and development as well as hormonal contributions to breast cancer risk and progression suggest that tumorigenic mechanisms in the breast should be considered in the context of hormonal stimulation. We used transgenic mice that overexpress luteinizing hormone with subsequent ovarian hyperstimulation as a model to identify mechanisms involved in hormone-induced mammary cancer. Tumor pathology in these mice is highly variable, suggesting individual tumors undergo distinct initiating or promoting events. Supporting this notion, hormone-induced tumors display considerable chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, despite the presence of functional p53. The presence of extensive centrosome amplification in tumors and hyperplastic glands prior to tumor formation suggests that alterations in the ovarian hormonal milieu dysregulate the centrosome cycle in mammary epithelial cells, leading to aneuploidy and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1983377397,"The inhibitor of DNA-binding (ID) proteins are dominant-negative inhibitors of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that have multiple functions during development and cellular differentiation. High-level expression of some ID family members has been observed in human malignancies, and in some cases was correlated with poor clinical prognosis. Ectopic ID1 expression extends the life span of primary human epithelial cells, inhibits cellular differentiation and induces centrosome duplication errors, thus suggesting that ID1 may have oncogenic activities. ID1 can bind to the proteasomal subunit S5A/Rpn10, but the biological consequences of the interaction have not been studied in detail. Here, we show that ID1's ability to induce supernumerary centrosomes correlates with S5A binding. Similar to ID1, a fraction of the S5A protein localizes to centrosomal structures. Furthermore, partial depletion of S5A by RNA interference causes accumulation of cells with supernumerary centrosomes. These results are consistent with the model that ID1 dysregulates centrosome homeostasis at least in part by interfering with S5A activities at the centrosome."

Atrial natriuretic peptide is a circulating hormone that has been shown to be hepatoprotective. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide on potentially harmful elevations in cytosolic free Ca2+ and calpain activity induced by extracellular ATP in rat hepatocytes. We show that atrial natriuretic peptide, through protein kinase G, attenuated both the amplitude and duration of ATP-induced cytosolic Ca2+ rises in single hepatocytes. Atrial natriuretic peptide also prevented stimulation of calpain activity by ATP, taurolithocholate, or Ca2+ mobilization by thapsigargin and ionomycin. We therefore investigated the cellular Ca2+ handling mechanisms through which ANP attenuates this sustained elevation in cytosolic Ca2+. We show that atrial natriuretic peptide does not modulate the release from or re-uptake of Ca2+ into intracellular stores but, through protein kinase G, both stimulates plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux from and inhibits ATP-stimulated Ca2+ influx into hepatocytes. These findings suggest that stimulation of net plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux (to which both Ca2+ efflux stimulation and Ca2+ influx inhibition contribute) is the key process through which atrial natriuretic peptide attenuates elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ and calpain activity. Moreover we propose that plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux is a valuable, previously undiscovered, mechanism through which atrial natriuretic peptide protects rat hepatocytes, and perhaps other cell types, against Ca2+-dependent injury.

An early preliminary study showed that ANP attenuated both oxidant-induced cell injury and the accompanying [Ca2+]i rise (51Von Ruecker A.A. Wild M. Rao G.S. Bidlingmaier F. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 531-537PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the hepatoprotective effects of ANP may be mediated by mechanisms involved in Ca2+ homeostasis (51Von Ruecker A.A. Wild M. Rao G.S. Bidlingmaier F. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 531-537PubMed Google Scholar, 55Pella R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 549-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Bilzer M. Jaeschke H. Vollmar A.M. Paumgartner G. Gerbes A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1137-G1144PubMed Google Scholar). We have since examined the effects of ANP on physiological alterations in [Ca2+]c; we showed that ANP, through protein kinase G (PKG), attenuates [Ca2+]c oscillations, dramatically increases the basal rate of plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux and modestly inhibits basal Ca2+ influx in rat hepatocytes (56Green A.K. Zolle O. Simpson A.W.M. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1291-1303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although it has been demonstrated that ANP prevents oxidant-induced rises in hepatocyte [Ca2+]i (51Von Ruecker A.A. Wild M. Rao G.S. Bidlingmaier F. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 531-537PubMed Google Scholar), how ANP regulates pathophysiological elevations in hepatocyte [Ca2+]c has been very little studied. Cellular Ca2+ homeostasis is maintained through a complex interaction of Ca2+ fluxes between the cytosol, the intracellular stores of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and the extracellular milieu. A single early study based on 45Ca2+ flux measurements suggested the involvement of a decrease in Ca2+ influx in the hepatoprotective effect of ANP (55Pella R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 549-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this was not a true uni-directional measurement of Ca2+ influx and possible effects of ANP on other Ca2+ handling mechanisms were not investigated. Further investigation of the effects of ANP on pathophysiological [Ca2+]c and Ca2+ fluxes is therefore warranted. Here we examine the effects of ANP on sustained rises in both cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) and calpain activity and reduction in cell viability induced by extracellular ATP in single rat hepatocytes. ATP is released from cells, including hepatocytes, in response to stress, anoxia, or injury (15Chow S.C. Kass G.E.N. Orrenius S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that ATP increases hepatocyte calpain activity concomitantly with an increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that ATP stimulates calpain activity through elevation of [Ca2+]i. We show here that ANP attenuates ATP-induced sustained rises in [Ca2+]c. We also show that ANP protects hepatocytes against elevations in calpain activity and decreases in cell viability mediated by both ATP, and the hydrophobic bile acid, taurolithocholate (TLC). We therefore investigate the cellular Ca2+ handling mechanisms through which ANP attenuates the sustained elevation in [Ca2+]c. We show that ANP does not modulate the release from or re-uptake of Ca2+ into intracellular stores but, through PKG, stimulates plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux from and inhibits ATP-stimulated Ca2+ influx into hepatocytes. We therefore propose that stimulation of net plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux is the key process through which ANP protects hepatocytes against harmful rises in [Ca2+]c. Collagenase was from Roche Applied Sciences. Williams' medium E (WME) was from Invitrogen. ATP, [Arg8]vasopressin (AVP), ANP (rat atrial natriuretic factor 1-28), ionomycin, propidium iodide, sodium taurolithocholate (TLC), digitonin, BAPTA-AM, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and 8-bromo-cGMP were from Sigma. Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (TEA salt), thapsigargin, and MDL 28170 were from CN Biosciences. FMC Sea-Plaque-agarose and FMC SeaPrep-agarose were from Flowgen Instruments Ltd., Sittingbourne, UK. Fura-2 pentapotassium salt, fura-2 dextran (10 kDa), t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Met-7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin (Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L; 2 mg/ml) were from Molecular Probes. Caloxin 1b1 peptide was prepared by custom synthesis by Dalton Pharma Services, Toronto, ON, Canada. Primary anti-PKG antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Citifluor was from Agar Scientific Ltd., Essex, UK. All other chemicals (VWR International Ltd., Lutterworth, UK) were of the purest grade available. For preparation of the efflux medium, ultrapure water was prepared using the Milli-Q RG system (Millipore). Single hepatocytes were isolated from 150 to 250-g male Wistar rats by collagenase digestion as described previously (67Woods N.M. Cuthbertson K.S.R. Cobbold P.H. Cell Calcium. 1987; 8: 79-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For all experiments on populations of hepatocytes, cells were counted using a hemocytometer then stored in suspension in WME on ice. Isolated rat hepatocytes, at a cell density of 106/ml, were incubated in suspension in extracellular buffer (ECB) of composition: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.2, in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. ATP and ANP were added for the periods indicated. Cyclic GMP levels were measured using the acetylation method in a cGMP enzyme immunoassay system (Biotrak assays, GE Healthcare). Preparation of Single Cells for Microinjection—After harvesting, the hepatocytes were incubated at 37 °C at low density (∼103 cells/ml) in 1.7% SeaPrep-agarose in WME. Single hepatocytes were transferred to 0.1-mm path length microslides containing 1.2% FMC SeaPlaque-agarose in WME, which was subsequently gelled at 4 °C for 2 min. The cells were then held at 37 °C under a layer of liquid paraffin. Fura-2 Dextran Preparation—Fura-2 dextran (10 kDa) was dissolved in (in mm): KCl 150, PIPES 1, pH 7.2, to makea5mm stock solution that was stored at -70 °C. For microinjection, a small aliquot of 5 mm fura-2 dextran was held as a droplet under liquid paraffin. Microinjection and Data Acquisition—Freshly pulled pipettes were filled with fura-2 dextran by dipping the tip for a few seconds in the fura-2 dextran droplet. Individual hepatocytes were injected to ∼0.5% of the cell volume as described previously (68Dixon C.J. Green A.K. Petersen O.H. Measuring Calcium and Calmodulin Inside and Outside Cells. Springer-Verlag, New York2001: 65-90Crossref Google Scholar). The fura-2 dextran, thus localized in the cytoplasmic compartment, reports [Ca2+]c only. Injected cells of healthy appearance were transferred within microslides to a heated (37 °C) stainless steel perfusion chamber on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescence microscope. Cells were superfused with ECB to which ATP, ANP, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, and AVP were added as indicated. Cells were alternately excited at 340- and 380-nm wavelengths by means of a PTI D101 dual excitation light source. The 510-nm emission was detected by an ICCD camera (Photonic Science). [Ca2+]c was calculated by calibrating the fura-2 signal in situ as described previously (69Sanchez-Bueno A. Greenwood M.R. Varela-Nieto I. Marrero I. Gil B. Mato M.S. Cobbold P.H. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Calpain activity of intact rat hepatocytes in suspension was measured by the rate of generation of the fluorescent cleavage product of the calpain substrate Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC according to a method modified from those of Rosser et al. (18Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Han et al. (70Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC is a non-fluorescent, membrane-permeant compound that diffuses readily into hepatocytes, where it is conjugated to glutathione. Intracellular calpain activity cleaves the bond between the methionine and the MAC-thiol groups, liberating and unquenching the highly fluorescent, membrane-impermeant MAC-thiol moiety within the cell. The slope of the fluorescent change with respect to time represents the intracellular calpain activity (18Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 70Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Before each assay, ∼105 cells were washed 3 times in ECB. The cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of ECB at 37 °C, to which Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC (20 μm final concentration) was added. Fluorescence was measured, at 37 °C with constant stirring, using a PTI DeltaRam spectrofluorimeter, exciting at 380 nm and collecting emission at 460 nm. Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide fluorescence according to a method modified from that of Gores et al. (71Gores G.J. Nieminen A.-L. Fleishman K.E. Dawson T.L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C315-C322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before each assay, ∼105 cells were washed 3 times in ECB. The cells were then incubated with 1 μm propidium iodide in ECB containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min at 37 °C. 1 ml of the cell suspension was transferred to a fluorimeter cuvette and fluorescence was measured continuously (at 37 °C with constant stirring) using a PTI DeltaRam spectrofluorimeter, exciting at 515 nm and collecting emission at 610 nm. Agonists were added after 5 min (F0) and fluorescence was recorded for a further 15 min (F15). At the end of each experiment, digitonin (375 μm final concentration) was added to allow propidium iodide to enter cells and, after 20 min, produce maximum fluorescence (Fmax). The % non-viable cells after 15 min agonist exposure was calculated using equation: % nonviable cells = 100 × (F15 - F0)/(Fmax - F0). Before each assay, ∼106 cells were washed 3 times in ice-cold efflux medium, of composition: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.2. Ca2+ efflux from the intact rat hepatocytes was monitored by measuring the concentration of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium ([Ca2+]o) using fura-2 as extracellular Ca2+ reporter. Thus the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of efflux medium at 37 °C, to which the membrane-impermeant pentapotassium salt of fura-2 (10 μm final concentration) was added. Fluorescence was measured at 37 °C with constant stirring, using a PTI DeltaRam spectrofluorimeter, exciting alternately at 340 and 380 nm and collecting emission at 510 nm. [Ca2+]o was calculated by calibrating the photometric 340/380 nm ratio signal as described previously (56Green A.K. Zolle O. Simpson A.W.M. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1291-1303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]o never rose above 1.5 μm, ensuring a true, unidirectional, Ca2+ efflux measurement. Single hepatocytes, microinjected with fura-2 dextran (10 kDa), were superfused with 50 μm MnCl2 in ECB to which ATP, ANP, and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS were added as indicated. The fura-2 dextran, thus localized in the cytoplasmic compartment, reports Mn2+ influx into the cytosol only. Cells were alternately excited at 340 and 35"
