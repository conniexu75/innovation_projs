https://openalex.org/W4283314490,"The performance of perovskite solar cells with inverted polarity (p-i-n) is still limited by recombination at their electron extraction interface, which also lowers the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of p-i-n perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells. A MgF x interlayer with thickness of ~1 nanometer at the perovskite/C 60 interface favorably adjusts the surface energy of the perovskite layer through thermal evaporation, which facilitates efficient electron extraction and displaces C 60 from the perovskite surface to mitigate nonradiative recombination. These effects enable a champion open-circuit voltage of 1.92 volts, an improved fill factor of 80.7%, and an independently certified stabilized PCE of 29.3% for a monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell ~1 square centimeter in area. The tandem retained ~95% of its initial performance after damp-heat testing (85°C at 85% relative humidity) for &gt;1000 hours."
https://openalex.org/W4283321764,"The in vivo pathogenicity, transmissibility, and fitness of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant are not well understood. We compared these virological attributes of this new variant of concern (VOC) with those of the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in a Syrian hamster model of COVID-19. Omicron-infected hamsters lost significantly less body weight and exhibited reduced clinical scores, respiratory tract viral burdens, cytokine and chemokine dysregulation, and lung damage than Delta-infected hamsters. Both variants were highly transmissible through contact transmission. In noncontact transmission studies Omicron demonstrated similar or higher transmissibility than Delta. Delta outcompeted Omicron without selection pressure, but this scenario changed once immune selection pressure with neutralizing antibodies—active against Delta but poorly active against Omicron—was introduced. Next-generation vaccines and antivirals effective against this new VOC are therefore urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W4283322167,"Rivers support indispensable ecological functions and human health and infrastructure. Yet limited river sampling hinders our understanding of consequential changes to river systems. Satellite-based estimates of suspended sediment concentration and flux for 414 major rivers reveal widespread global change that is directly attributable to human activity in the past half-century. Sediment trapping by dams in the global hydrologic north has contributed to global sediment flux declines to 49% of pre-dam conditions. Recently, intensive land-use change in the global hydrologic south has increased erosion, with river suspended sediment concentration on average 41 ± 7% greater than in the 1980s. This north-south divergence has rapidly reconfigured global patterns in sediment flux to the oceans, with the dominant sources of suspended sediment shifting from Asia to South America."
https://openalex.org/W4283328497,"The human cerebral cortex houses 1000 times more neurons than that of the cerebral cortex of a mouse, but the possible differences in synaptic circuits between these species are still poorly understood. We used three-dimensional electron microscopy of mouse, macaque, and human cortical samples to study their cell type composition and synaptic circuit architecture. The 2.5-fold increase in interneurons in humans compared with mice was compensated by a change in axonal connection probabilities and therefore did not yield a commensurate increase in inhibitory-versus-excitatory synaptic input balance on human pyramidal cells. Rather, increased inhibition created an expanded interneuron-to-interneuron network, driven by an expansion of interneuron-targeting interneuron types and an increase in their synaptic selectivity for interneuron innervation. These constitute key neuronal network alterations in the human cortex."
https://openalex.org/W4283321377,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a critical host resistance factor against tuberculosis. However, excess TNF produces susceptibility by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS), which initiate a signaling cascade to cause pathogenic necrosis of mycobacterium-infected macrophages. In zebrafish, we identified the mechanism of TNF-induced mROS in tuberculosis. Excess TNF in mycobacterium-infected macrophages elevates mROS production by reverse electron transport (RET) through complex I. TNF-activated cellular glutamine uptake leads to an increased concentration of succinate, a Krebs cycle intermediate. Oxidation of this elevated succinate by complex II drives RET, thereby generating the mROS superoxide at complex I. The complex I inhibitor metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug, prevents TNF-induced mROS and necrosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected zebrafish and human macrophages; metformin may therefore be useful in tuberculosis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4283327986,"Cells of most bacterial species are around 2 micrometers in length, with some of the largest specimens reaching 750 micrometers. Using fluorescence, x-ray, and electron microscopy in conjunction with genome sequencing, we characterized Candidatus (Ca.) Thiomargarita magnifica, a bacterium that has an average cell length greater than 9000 micrometers and is visible to the naked eye. These cells grow orders of magnitude over theoretical limits for bacterial cell size, display unprecedented polyploidy of more than half a million copies of a very large genome, and undergo a dimorphic life cycle with asymmetric segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells. These features, along with compartmentalization of genomic material and ribosomes in translationally active organelles bound by bioenergetic membranes, indicate gain of complexity in the Thiomargarita lineage and challenge traditional concepts of bacterial cells."

https://openalex.org/W4283312488,"Comparative studies of mortality in the wild are necessary to understand the evolution of aging; yet, ectothermic tetrapods are underrepresented in this comparative landscape, despite their suitability for testing evolutionary hypotheses. We present a study of aging rates and longevity across wild tetrapod ectotherms, using data from 107 populations (77 species) of nonavian reptiles and amphibians. We test hypotheses of how thermoregulatory mode, environmental temperature, protective phenotypes, and pace of life history contribute to demographic aging. Controlling for phylogeny and body size, ectotherms display a higher diversity of aging rates compared with endotherms and include phylogenetically widespread evidence of negligible aging. Protective phenotypes and life-history strategies further explain macroevolutionary patterns of aging. Analyzing ectothermic tetrapods in a comparative context enhances our understanding of the evolution of aging."

Lipidomics has demonstrated the potential to add further essential insights on ocean ecosystem function but has yet to be applied on a global scale. We analyzed 930 lipid samples across the global ocean using a uniform high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometry analytical workflow, revealing previously unknown characteristics of ocean planktonic lipidomes. Focusing on 10 molecularly diverse glycerolipid classes, we identified 1151 distinct lipid species, finding that fatty acid unsaturation (i.e., number of carbon-carbon double bonds) is fundamentally constrained by temperature. We predict substantial declines in the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid over the next century, which are likely to have serious deleterious effects on economically critical fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W4283319988,"Oxidative DNA damage is recognized by 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), which excises 8-oxoG, leaving a substrate for apurinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) and initiating repair. Here, we describe a small molecule (TH10785) that interacts with the phenylalanine-319 and glycine-42 amino acids of OGG1, increases the enzyme activity 10-fold, and generates a previously undescribed β,δ-lyase enzymatic function. TH10785 controls the catalytic activity mediated by a nitrogen base within its molecular structure. In cells, TH10785 increases OGG1 recruitment to and repair of oxidative DNA damage. This alters the repair process, which no longer requires APE1 but instead is dependent on polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP1) activity. The increased repair of oxidative DNA lesions with a small molecule may have therapeutic applications in various diseases and aging."
https://openalex.org/W4283328116,"Is senescence inevitable and universal for all living organisms, as evolutionary theories predict? Although evidence generally supports this hypothesis, it has been proposed that certain species, such as turtles and tortoises, may exhibit slow or even negligible senescence-i.e., avoiding the increasing risk of death from gradual deterioration with age. In an extensive comparative study of turtles and tortoises living in zoos and aquariums, we show that ~75% of 52 species exhibit slow or negligible senescence. For ~80% of species, aging rates are lower than those in modern humans. We find that body weight positively relates to adult life expectancy in both sexes, and sexual size dimorphism explains sex differences in longevity. Unlike humans and other species, we show that turtles and tortoises may reduce senescence in response to improvements in environmental conditions."

https://openalex.org/W4283366445,"Purpose To compare the safety and efficacy of intense pulsed light (IPL) followed by meibomian gland expression (MGX), against monotherapy of MGX. Methods Patients with moderate to severe meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) were 1:1 randomized to 4 sessions of intense pulse light + MGX at 2-week intervals, or 4 sessions of Sham + MGX at 2-week intervals. Both patients and examiners were blinded to the allocation. Outcome measures, evaluated at the baseline (BL) and at a follow-up (FU) conducted 4 weeks after the last IPL session, included fluorescein tear breakup time (TBUT) as the primary outcome measure, OSDI (Ocular Surface Disease Index) questionnaire, Eye Dryness Score (EDS, a visual analog scale (VAS)-based questionnaire), Meibomian gland score (MGS, a score of meibum expressibility and quality in 15 glands on the lower eyelid), daily use of artificial tears, and daily use of warm compresses. In addition, during each treatment session, the number of expressible glands was counted in both eyelids, the predominant quality of meibum was estimated in both eyelids, and the level of pain/discomfort due to MGX and IPL was recorded. Results TBUT increased from 3.8±0.2 (μ±standard error of mean (SEM)) to 4.5±0.3 seconds in the control arm, and from 4.0±0.2 to 6.0±0.3 in the study arm. The difference between arms was statistically significant (P &lt; .01). Other signs/symptoms which improved in both arms but were greater in the study arm included MGS (P &lt; .001), EDS (P &lt; .01), the number of expressible glands in the lower eyelids (P &lt; .0001) and upper eyelid (P &lt; .0001), the predominant meibum quality in the lower eyelid (P &lt; .0001) and upper eyelid (P &lt; .0001), and the level of pain due to MGX (P &lt; .0001). Outcome measures which improved in both arms with no significant differences between the two were OSDI (P = .9984), and the daily use of artificial tears (P = .8216). Meibography, daily use of warm compresses, and severity of skin rosacea did not show statistically significant changes in either arm. No serious adverse events were observed. There was a slight tendency for more adverse events in the control group (P = 0.06). Conclusions The results of this study suggest that, in patients with moderate to severe symptoms, combination therapy of intense pulse light (IPL) and meibomian gland expression (MGX) could be a safe and useful approach for improving signs of dry eye disease (DED) due to meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Future studies are needed to elucidate if and how such improvements can be generalized to different severity levels of MGD."

https://openalex.org/W4283395973,"Curcuma wenyujin is the source plant of three traditional Chinese medicines, which have been widely used in clinical treatment over 1000 years. The content of terpenes, the major medicinal active ingredients, is relatively low in this plant. Studies have shown that MeJA can promote terpenes biosynthesis in plants. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of MeJA in C . wenyujin remains unclear. In this work, the transcriptome of C . wenyujin leaves with MeJA treatment was analyzed to elucidate the regulation mechanism of MeJA-mediated terpene biosynthesis. Based on the RNA-seq data, 7,246 unigenes were differentially expressed with MeJA treatment. Expression pattern clustering of DEGs revealed that unigenes, related to JA biosynthesis and signal transduction, responded to exogenous MeJA stimulation on the early stage and maintained throughout the process. Subsequently, unigenes related to terpene biosynthesis pathway showed a significant up-regulation with 6 h treatment. The analysis results suggested that MeJA induced the expression of JA biosynthesis genes (such as LOXs , AOSs , AOCs , OPRs , and MFPs ) and JA signal transduction core genes ( JAZs and MYCs ) to activate JA signaling pathway. Meanwhile, downstream JA-responsive genes presented up-regulated expression levels such as AACT , HMGSs , HMGRs , DXSs , DXRs , MCTs , HDSs , and HDRs , thus promoting terpenes biosynthesis. The transcriptional expressions of these genes were validated by qRT-PCR. In addition, six CwTPS genes in response to MeJA were identified. With MeJA treatment, the expression levels of CwTPSs were increased as well as those of the transcription factors MYB, NAC, bZIP, WRKY, AP2/ERF, and HLH. These TFs might potentially regulate terpenes biosynthesis. These results provide insights for regulation mechanism of terpenes biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4283317962,"Orthohepevirus B , commonly known as avian hepatitis E virus (aHEV), causes big liver and spleen disease (BLS) or hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome (HSS) in chickens. BLS is an emerging disease among chicken flocks in several countries around the world. In our previous studies, serology and molecular biology screening revealed that chicken flocks are widely affected by aHEV in Poland. The present study, which was conducted between 2019 and 2020, aimed to investigate the prevalence of aHEV in chicken flocks and other poultry, including ducks, geese, and turkeys. A total of 307 flocks were examined. In addition, 29 samples from captive wild birds (western capercaillies, Tetrao urogallus ) were analyzed. In all the investigated poultry species, except turkeys, the nucleic acid sequence covering part of the ORF1 gene of the aHEV genome was detected (34/336 samples, 10.1%). The infection rate was found to be the highest in broiler breeder chicken flocks (14/40 samples; 35%). Phylogenetic analysis of partial ORF1 gene, which encodes helicase, revealed that the obtained sequences belonged to genotypes 2 and 4, while one belonged to genotype 3. Genotype 2 was detected for the first time in domestic geese and ducks, and genotype 4 was detected for the first time in Poland. The study demonstrated the presence of aHEV among the investigated western capercaillies, suggesting that this species is susceptible to aHEV infections and biosecurity is therefore required in western capercaillie breeding facilities."

https://openalex.org/W4283376962,"No published studies have evaluated the accuracy of volumetric measurement of solid nodules and ground-glass nodules on low-dose or ultra-low-dose chest computed tomography, reconstructed using deep learning-based algorithms. This is an important issue in lung cancer screening. Our study aimed to investigate the accuracy of semiautomatic volume measurement of solid nodules and ground-glass nodules, using two deep learning-based image reconstruction algorithms (Truefidelity and ClariCT.AI), compared with iterative reconstruction (ASiR-V) in low-dose and ultra-low-dose settings. We performed computed tomography scans of solid nodules and ground-glass nodules of different diameters placed in a phantom at four radiation doses (120 kVp/220 mA, 120 kVp/90 mA, 120 kVp/40 mA, and 80 kVp/40 mA). Each scan was reconstructed using Truefidelity, ClariCT.AI, and ASiR-V. The solid nodule and ground-glass nodule volumes were measured semiautomatically. The gold-standard volumes could be calculated using the diameter since all nodule phantoms are perfectly spherical. Subsequently, absolute percentage measurement errors of the measured volumes were calculated. Image noise was also calculated. Across all nodules at all dose settings, the absolute percentage measurement errors of Truefidelity and ClariCT.AI were less than 11%; they were significantly lower with Truefidelity or ClariCT.AI than with ASiR-V (all P<0.05). The absolute percentage measurement errors for the smallest solid nodule (3 mm) reconstructed by Truefidelity or ClariCT.AI at all dose settings were significantly lower than those of this nodule reconstructed by ASiR-V (all P<0.05). Furthermore, the lowest absolute percentage measurement errors for ground-glass nodules were observed with Truefidelity or ClariCT.AI at all dose settings. The absolute percentage measurement errors for ground-glass nodules reconstructed with Truefidelity at ultra-low-dose settings were significantly lower than those of all sizes of ground-glass nodules reconstructed with ASiR-V (all P<0.05). Image noise was lowest with Truefidelity (all P<0.05). In conclusion, the deep learning-based algorithms were more accurate for volume measurements of both solid nodules and ground-glass nodules than ASiR-V at both low-dose and ultra-low-dose settings."
https://openalex.org/W4283383832,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated plasma glucose levels. It is often defined as a lifestyle disease having severe economic and physiological repercussions on the individual. One of the most prevalent clinical consequences of diabetes is the lagging pace of injury healing leading to chronic wounds, which still to date have limited treatment options. The objective of this research is to look into the wound healing capabilities of gallocatechin (GC) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) impregnated patches in diabetic rats. Experimental rats were dressed patches and the wound healing skin region was dissected at the end of the experiment for molecular analysis. The wound healing rate in diabetic rats dressed with CGP2 and CGP3 & silver sulfadiazine (AgS) patches were found to be high. While mRNA and immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry assays reveal that Wnt3a and β-catenin levels were higher with Gsk-3β and c-fos levels were lower in diabetic rats dressed with in CGP2 and CGP3 as compared with diabetic rats dressed with DC+CGP1. Furthermore, apoptosis markers such as caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax levels were reduced, whereas anti-apoptosis maker (Bcl-2) and proliferation marker (PCNA) levels were increased in diabetic rats dressed with CGP2 and CGP3 as compared with diabetic rats dressed with DC+CGP1. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that GC-AgNPs-CGP (CGP2 & CGP3) dressing on diabetes wound rats decreased changes in Wnt3a/β-catenin pathways, resulting in lower apoptosis and greater proliferation, so drastically improving diabetic wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W4283394477,"Communication is one of the most important abilities in human society, which makes clarification of brain functions that underlie communication of great importance to cognitive neuroscience. To investigate the rapidly changing cortical-level brain activity underlying communication, a hyperscanning system with both high temporal and spatial resolution is extremely desirable. The modality of magnetoencephalography (MEG) would be ideal, but MEG hyperscanning systems suitable for communication studies remain rare. Here, we report the establishment of an MEG hyperscanning system that is optimized for natural, real-time, face-to-face communication between two adults in sitting positions. Two MEG systems, which are installed 500m away from each other, were directly connected with fiber optic cables. The number of intermediate devices was minimized, enabling transmission of trigger and auditory signals with almost no delay (1.95–3.90 μ s and 3 ms, respectively). Additionally, video signals were transmitted at the lowest latency ever reported (60–100 ms). We furthermore verified the function of an auditory delay line to synchronize the audio with the video signals. This system is thus optimized for natural face-to-face communication, and additionally, music-based communication which requires higher temporal accuracy is also possible via audio-only transmission. Owing to the high temporal and spatial resolution of MEG, our system offers a unique advantage over existing hyperscanning modalities of EEG, fNIRS, or fMRI. It provides novel neuroscientific methodology to investigate communication and other forms of social interaction, and could potentially aid in the development of novel medications or interventions for communication disorders."

https://openalex.org/W4283323882,"Enhancing the acquisition of belowground resources has been identified as an opportunity for improving soybean productivity worldwide. Root system architecture is gaining interest as a selection criterion in breeding programs for enhancing soil resource acquisition and developing climate-resilient varieties. Here we are presenting two novel characteristics of soybean root system architecture that improve aboveground growth and yield. Eleven selected soybean genotypes were tested under rain-fed conditions in 2019 and 2020 at two locations in South Carolina, in which one of the locations was characterized by compacted soils. The elite SC breeding line SC07-1518RR, exotic pedigree line N09-12854, and slow wilting line N09-13890 were superior genotypes in terms of biomass production, seed yield, and/or water use efficiency. Genotypes N09-12854 and N09-13890 demonstrated reduced root development (based on total root count and length), likely to restrict belowground growth and allocate more resources for shoot growth. This characteristic, which can be referred as a parsimonious root phenotype, might be advantageous for soybean improvement in high-input production systems (characterized by adequate fertilizer application and soil fertility) that exist in many parts of the world. Genotype SC07-1518RR exhibited a similar strategy: while it maintained its root system at an intermediate size through reduced levels of total root count and length, it selectively distributed more roots at deeper depths (53-70 cm). The increased root distribution of SC07-1518RR at deeper depths in compacted soil indicates its root penetrability and suitability for clayey soils with high penetration resistance. The beneficial root phenotypes identified in this study (parsimonious root development and selective root distribution in deeper depths) and the genotypes that possessed those phenotypes (SC07-1518RR, N09-12854, and N09-13890) will be useful for breeding programs in developing varieties for optimal, drought, and compacted-soil conditions."

https://openalex.org/W4283392449,"By connecting corridors of river recovery, resilience can be built into river systems to mitigate against future floods and droughts driven by anthropogenic disturbance or climate extremes. However, identifying where these corridors can be built is still lacking in river management practice. The Open Access NSW River Styles database contains comprehensive information on geomorphic river condition and recovery potential. The database can be used to systematically analyse where corridors of river recovery could be created via conservation or rehabilitation. Analysis was undertaken in ArcGIS using the recovery potential layer along 84,342 km of freshwater stream length, across 20 catchments of coastal NSW. We identified 4,905 km of reach connections, defined as an upstream to downstream section of river that is connected end-to-end, and 17,429 km of loci connections defined as more isolated sections of river from which recovery can be seeded and extended into adjacent reaches. There was significant spatial variability in the types and lengths of connections made across the catchments. Some catchments have significant potential to build corridors of recovery along large sections of river, whereas other catchments are more fragmented. These results provide practitioners with a user-friendly distillation of where river conservation and rehabilitation activities could be focussed when working with river recovery in practice. Combined with local on-ground knowledge, this information forms an important input to evidence-based prioritisation and decision making in river management."
https://openalex.org/W4283315282,"Insulin resistance is a metabolic disorder characterized by the decreased response to insulin in muscle, liver, and adipose cells. This condition remains a complex phenomenon that involves several genetic defects and environmental stresses. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of known phytochemical constituents of Tinospora crispa and its interaction with insulin-resistant target proteins by using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Tinoscorside A, Makisterone C, Borapetoside A and B, and β sitosterol consider the main phytoconstituents of Tinospora crispa by its binding with active sites of main protein targets of insulin resistance potential therapy. Moreover, Tinoscorside A was revealed from the docking analysis as the ligand that binds most strongly to the target protein, PI3K. This finding was strengthened by the results of MD simulation, which stated that the conformational stability of the ligand-protein complex was achieved at 15 ns and the formation of hydrogen bonds at the active site. In conclusion, Tinospora crispa is one of the promising therapeutic agent in type 2 diabetes mellitus management. Regulation in glucose homeostasis, adipolysis, cell proliferation, and antiapoptosis are predicted to be the critical mechanism of Tinospora crispa as an insulin sensitizer."

Considering the documented adverse events of the current lipid-lowering medications which ultimately affect patient's compliance, substantial efforts have been made to develop new therapeutic strategies. Probiotics, on the other hand, are reported to have lipid-lowering activity with the added benefit of being generally well-tolerated making it an appealing adjuvant therapy.A total of fifty Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from raw milk (human and animal) and dairy products. Isolates demonstrating promising in vitro cholesterol removal capabilities were morphologically and biochemically characterized. Lastly, two bacterial candidates were selected for evaluation of their potential hypolipidemic activity using a laboratory animal model. Statistical differences between the means were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Most of the isolates demonstrated an in vitro cholesterol removal activity. The six LAB isolates showing the highest cholesterol removal activity (36.5-55.6%) were morphologically and biochemically identified as Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Lactococcus species. The results demonstrated two promising antihyperlipidemic candidates, a Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis with an in vivo significant reduction of serum triglycerides (TG) levels by 34.3%, and a Pediococcus sp. that was able to significantly reduce both the serum TC and TG levels by 17.3% and 47.0%, respectively, as compared to the diet-induced hyperlipidemic animal group.This study further supports the growing evidence regarding the antihyperlipidemic activity among probiotics, presenting them as a promising therapeutic approach for the management of hyperlipidemia."

CDC20 knockdown does not increase TMZ- and radiation-induced DNA damage, or alter DNA damage repair, but rather promotes cell death through accumulation of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bim. Our results identify a CDC20 signaling pathway that regulates chemo- and radiosensitivity in GSCs, with the potential for CDC20-targeted therapeutic strategies in the treatment of glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W3184011581,"Motivated by the impressive success of deep learning in a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, we explore in this work the application of deep learning into a specific class of optimization problems lacking explicit formulas for both objective function and constraints. Such optimization problems exist in many design problems, e.g., rotor profile design, in which objective and constraint values are available only through experiment or simulation. They are especially challenging when design parameters are high-dimensional due to the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we propose a data-informed deep optimization (DiDo) approach emphasizing on the adaptive fitting of the the feasible region as follows. First, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) based adaptive fitting approach to learn an accurate DNN classifier of the feasible region. Second, we use the DNN classifier to efficiently sample feasible points and train a DNN surrogate of the objective function. Finally, we find optimal points of the DNN surrogate optimization problem by gradient descent. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our DiDo approach, we consider a practical design case in industry, in which our approach yields good solutions using limited size of training data. We further use a 100-dimension toy example to show the effectiveness of our approach for higher dimensional problems. Our results indicate that, by properly dealing with the difficulty in fitting the feasible region, a DNN-based method like our DiDo approach is flexible and promising for solving high-dimensional design problems with implicit objective and constraints."

M. azedarach extract (MAE) contains volatile organic plant-derived compounds with antimicrobial properties. MAE has a variety of physiological properties, including antimicrobial, insecticidal, and anti-inflammatory activity. This study aimed to investigate whether MAE-loaded PVA/PET hydrogels have protective effects against burn wound healing.To mix M. azedarach with the gel, nanoparticles containing M. azedarach were prepared using chitosan/maltodextrin as the wall material. A PVA/PET hydrogel containing M. azedarach was developed and its applicability as a wound dressing was evaluated. In the in vitro scratch assay, MAE treatment showed a scratch recovery-promoting effect comparable to that of the positive control TGF-β1. The MAE-PVA/PET hydrogel was found to be non-toxic, and the antibacterial activity of the hydrogel was excellent against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, as the formulated hydrogel demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity, its wound-healing efficacy was investigated in vivo using a rat model.MAE was found to be effective against burn wounds and to have antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4283321526,"Over the years, considerable research has been conducted to investigate the mechanisms of speech perception and recognition. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a powerful tool for identifying brain activity; therefore, it has been widely used to determine the neural basis of speech recognition. In particular, for the classification of speech recognition, deep learning-based approaches are in the spotlight because they can automatically learn and extract representative features through end-to-end learning. This study aimed to identify particular components that are potentially related to phoneme representation in the rat brain and to discriminate brain activity for each vowel stimulus on a single-trial basis using a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network and classical machine learning methods. Nineteen male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to microelectrode implantation surgery to record EEG signals from the bilateral anterior auditory fields were used. Five different vowel speech stimuli were chosen, /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/, which have highly different formant frequencies. EEG recorded under randomly given vowel stimuli was minimally preprocessed and normalized by a z-score transformation to be used as input for the classification of speech recognition. The BiLSTM network showed the best performance among the classifiers by achieving an overall accuracy, f1-score, and Cohen's κ values of 75.18%, 0.75, and 0.68, respectively, using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. These results indicate that LSTM layers can effectively model sequential data, such as EEG; hence, informative features can be derived through BiLSTM trained with end-to-end learning without any additional hand-crafted feature extraction methods."

Based on the macromorphology of the bony changes indicative of Hansen’s disease, KD271 (a middle-aged male) and KD520 (a middle-aged female) represent the two extremes of leprosy. KD271 appears to have an advanced-stage, long-standing near-lepromatous or lepromatous form of the disease, affecting not only the rhinomaxillary region but also both upper and lower limbs. This has led to severe deformation and disfigurement of the involved anatomical areas of the skeleton, resulting in his inability to perform the basic activities of daily living, such as eating, drinking, grasping, standing or walking. The skeleton of KD520 shows no rhinomaxillary lesions and indicates the other extreme of leprosy, a near-tuberculoid or tuberculoid form of the disease. As in KD271 , Hansen’s disease has resulted in disfigurement and disability of both of the lower limbs of KD520 ; and thus, the middle-aged female would have experienced difficulties in standing, walking, and conducting occupational physical activities. KD271 and KD520 are amongst the very few published cases with leprosy from the Avar Age of the Hungarian Duna-Tisza Interfluve, and the only examples with detailed macromorphological description and differential diagnoses of the observed leprous bony changes. The cases of these two severely disabled individuals, especially of KD271 –who would have required regular and substantial care from others to survive–imply that in the Avar Age community of Kiskundorozsma–Daruhalom-dűlő II there was a willingness to care for people in need."
https://openalex.org/W4283329821,"COVID-19 has impacted and increased risks for healthcare providers, including orthodontists. There is no information regarding the potential transmission risks in the orthodontic community. This study aims to compare the positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in orthodontic patients at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) orthodontic clinic to the positivity rate of the local population in Chicago. All orthodontic patients who sought treatment at the UIC orthodontic clinic from June 16 to October 31, 2021, were invited to participate in the study. Three milliliters of saliva from the participants were collected in the sample collection tubes and subjected to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay to detect SAR-CoV-2. All participants’ age, sex, history of COVID-19 infection, and vaccination status were recorded. The COVID-19 positivity rates of Chicago, Cook County of Illinois, and the orthodontic clinic at UIC were compared. One thousand four hundred and thirty-seven orthodontic patients aged 6 to 70 years old (41.8% males and 58.2% females) participated in the study. Among all participants, nine participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (5 males and 4 females). During the study, the average COVID-19 positivity rate at the UIC orthodontic clinic was 0.626%. All of the positive participants were asymptomatic, and two of the participants had a history of COVID-19 infection. Among all positive participants, three participants had received complete COVID-19 vaccination. An increased frequency of positive cases at the orthodontic clinic was observed during the time of high positivity rate in Chicago and Cook County. A potential risk of COVID-19 transmission from patients to orthodontic providers remains, even with asymptomatic and vaccinated patients."
https://openalex.org/W4283330985,"Obesity is a critical risk factor of several life-threatening diseases and the prevalence in adults has dramatically increased over the past ten years. In the USA the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in adults was 42.4%, i.e., with a body mass index (BMI, weight (kg)/height (m) 2 ) that exceeds 30 kg/m 2 . Obese individuals are at the higher risk of obesity-related diseases, co-morbid conditions, lower quality of life, and increased mortality more than those in the normal BMI range i.e., 18.5–24.9 kg/m 2 . Surgical treatment continues to be the most efficient and scientifically successful treatment for obese patients. Sleeve gastrectomy or vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is a relatively new gastric procedure to reduce body weight but is now the most popular bariatric operation. To date there have been few studies examining the changes in the cellular components and pacemaker activity that occur in the gastric wall following VSG and whether normal gastric activity recovers following VSG. In the present study we used a murine model to investigate the chronological changes of gastric excitability including electrophysiological, molecular and morphological changes in the gastric musculature following VSG. There is a significant disruption in specialized interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastric antrum following sleeve gastrectomy. This is associated with a loss of gastric pacemaker activity and post-junctional neuroeffector responses. Over a 4-month recovery period there was a gradual return in interstitial cells of Cajal networks, pacemaker activity and neural responses. These data describe for the first time the changes in gastric interstitial cells of Cajal networks, pacemaker activity and neuroeffector responses and the time-dependent recovery of ICC networks and normalization of motor activity and neural responses following VSG."
https://openalex.org/W4283333143,"The current study aimed to understand the perceptions and experiences of Iranian parents and principals of preschool children on weight management based on the PRECEDE-PROCEED Model (PPM), a comprehensive structure for assessing health needs for designing, implementing, and evaluating health promotion, and other public health programs. PRECEDE provides a structure for planning a targeted and focused public health program, and PROCEED provides a structure for implementing and evaluating the program. Data were gathered from 17 preschoolers’ parents and two principals using semi-structured interviews in the preschool setting in Tehran, the capital of Iran, in 2019. Data were analyzed manually through directed content analysis based on constructs in phases two and three of the PPM, simultaneously with data collection. This study identified genetic, behavioral (e.g., food preferences, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, the effect of parents’, peers’, principals’ and teachers’ behavior and also influence of grandparents’ and neighbors’ behaviors) and environmental (e.g., home, grandparents’ home and preschool) factors from the epidemiological construct. Also, predisposing (e.g., child’s attitude, parent’s and principals’ attitude, as well as parents’ knowledge and parents’ and principals’ beliefs), enabling (e.g., parental skills and skills of the principals and teachers, rules and laws in the preschools, and availability), and reinforcing (e.g., family support and influences, teachers’ encouragement and influences, and peers’ influences) factors were identified from the educational and ecological construct. Additionally, “quality of child-parent relationship” was determined as a new factor affecting preschoolers’ weight management promotion; however, it was not in the PPM. In the study, parents’ and principals’ experiences regarding preschoolers’ weight management promotion confirmed the genetic, behavioral, environmental, predisposing, enabling and reinforcing factors of the PPM. “Quality of child-parent relationship” factor may be related to the culture and family relationship type of Iranian people, which is suggested to be investigated in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4283369369,"Neurotropic pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) which result in chronic infections in the brain are associated with mental illnesses. In view of this, a growing body of literature has revealed the possible interaction of schizophrenia and T. gondii infection.A case-control study was conducted from February 2018 to January 2019 among 47 Schizophrenia patients and 47 age and sex-matched controls. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire. Serum was used for serological analysis of anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM antibodies through chemiluminescent immunoassay. Proportions and mean with standard deviations (SD) were used as descriptive measures and variables with p-values <0.05 were considered as statistically significant and independently associated with schizophrenia.The mean ages of schizophrenia patients and controls were 29.64 ± 5.8 yrs and 30.98 ± 7.3 yrs, respectively. We found that 81.9% (77/94) of the study subjects had a positive anti-T. gondii IgG antibody. While the difference is statistically insignificant, schizophrenic patients have a marginally higher seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis than controls (87.2% vs 80.9%; p = 0.398). Schizophrenia cases who live in homes with soil floors have a significantly higher T. gondii infection as compared to those who live in homes with cement/ceramic floors (90.9% vs 33.3%; p = 0.004). Furthermore, there was a significantly lower T. gondii infection among schizophrenic cases who were taking antipsychotic medication for more than three yrs (79.3% vs 100.0%, p = 0.039). On the other hand, among all study subjects who have T. gondii infection, subjects who are addicted to khat and alcohol were about seven times more likely to develop schizophrenia (71.4% vs 47.7%, OR = 7.13, p = 0.024).Our data is not sufficient to show a significant positive correlation between T. gondii infection and schizophrenia. For study subjects with T. gondii infection, addiction to khat and alcohol is one of the risk factors for schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W4283377318,"The population of the aged is increasing globally and in Ghana. In 2020, the population aged over 60 years in Ghana was 2,051,903 and this is expected to reach 2.5 million by 2025 and 6.3 million by 2050. Despite the envisaged increase in the number and life expectancy of the older population in Ghana that will require nursing care, there is a paucity of data on nursing staff knowledge and attitudes toward elderly patients in Ghana.This study, therefore, assessed factors affecting the care of elderly patients among nursing staff in a tertiary referral health facility in the Volta region of Ghana.The study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design using quantitative data collection approaches. A total of 150 nurses were sampled with a response rate of 95%. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23. The analysis included logistic regression to predict factors associated with nurses' knowledge and attitude in caring for elderly patients, after multicollinearity diagnosis and controlling the effect of confounding variables.Majority (83.8%) of the nurses demonstrated good knowledge of the aging process, knowledge in the care of the elderly (88.7%), and (84.5%) had a positive caring attitude towards the elderly. Professional education, professional qualification, and knowledge on aged care were significantly associated with nurses' attitude towards the elderly (p<0.001), (p<0.005), and (p<0.010), respectively. Lack of special wards/facilities emerged as the predominantly perceived barrier to caring for the elderly as per the nurses' responses.The majority of nurses demonstrated good knowledge and attitude in the aging process and care of the aged. Lack of special wards/facilities and lack of staff motivation were the leading perceived barriers to rendering care to the elderly. Scaling up gerontological nursing programs and establishing special aged care facilities in Ghana with appropriate policy guidelines and regulations for implementation of care will help improve nurses' knowledge and caring attitudes toward the care of elderly patients. Likewise, a national geriatric care policy would help consolidate standard geriatric care in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W4283380150,"Live oral rotavirus vaccines (LORVs) have significantly reduced rotavirus hospitalizations and deaths worldwide. However, LORVs are less effective in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Next-generation rotavirus vaccines (NGRVs) may be more effective but require administration by injection or a neonatal oral dose, adding operational complexity. Healthcare providers (HPs) were interviewed to assess rotavirus vaccine preferences and identify delivery issues as part of an NGRV value proposition.Determine HP vaccine preferences about delivering LORVs compared to injectable (iNGRV) and neonatal oral (oNGRV) NGRVs.64 HPs from Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Peru, and Senegal were interviewed following a mixed-method guide centered on three vaccine comparisons: LORV vs. iNGRV; LORV vs. oNGRV; oNGRV vs. iNGRV. HPs reviewed attributes for each vaccine in the comparisons, then indicated and explained their preference. Additional questions elicited views about co-administering iNGRV+LORV for greater public health impact, a possible iNGRV-DTP-containing combination vaccine, and delivering neonatal doses.Almost all HPs preferred oral vaccine options over iNGRV, with many emphasizing an aversion to additional injections. Despite this strong preference, HPs described challenges delivering oral doses. Preferences for LORV vs. oNGRV were split, marked by disparate views on rotavirus disease epidemiology and the safety, need, and feasibility of delivering neonatal vaccines. Although overwhelmingly enthusiastic about an iNGRV-DTP-containing combination option, several HPs had concerns. HP views were divided on the feasibility of co-administering iNGRV+LORV, citing challenges around logistics and caregiver sensitization.Our findings provide valuable insights on delivering NGRVs in routine immunization. Despite opposition to injectables, openness to co-administering LORV+iNGRV to improve efficacy suggests future HP support of iNGRV if adequately informed of its advantages. Rationales for LORV vs. oNGRV underscore needs for training on rotavirus epidemiology and stronger service integration. Expressed challenges delivering existing LORVs merit further examination and indicate need for improved delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4283380471,"More than a third of women in Nepal have to carry water from source to home to satisfy their families' daily needs. A cross-sectional study was carried out in a hilly area in Nepal to assess water-carrying practices and their association with women's health. Quantitative interviews were conducted with 1001 women of reproductive age and were complemented with health surveys carried out by health professionals and structured observations of water carrying. Multivariate mixed logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between water-carrying-related risk factors and health issues for women. Around 46% of women faced considerably increased to excessive physical stress due to water carrying during the dry season. Women suffered from a disproportionately high prevalence of back pain (61%), with about 18% of this pain being horrible to excruciating; pain in the knees (34%); uterine prolapse (11.3%); and at least one spontaneous abortion (9%). The risk category of water carrying was significantly associated with uterine prolapse (OR = 1.44, 95%CI = 1.12-1.85, p = 0.031) and pain in the hips (OR = 1.69, 95%CI = 1.27-2.26, p<0.001). Receiving help with water carrying during pregnancy and during the first three months after delivery was associated with reduced odds ratios for uterine prolapse (OR = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.01-0.87, p = 0.037), and strong back pain (OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12-0.87, p = 0.026). Improvements to water supply infrastructure and the promotion of social support for carrying water during pregnancy and after delivery are recommended to reduce water-carrying-related health risks."
https://openalex.org/W4283384239,"This qualitative study aimed to explore how the development of tolerance to both the psychoactive and respiratory depressant effects of heroin on re-exposure are experienced by people who use heroin.Semi-structured one-to-one interviews were conducted with 20 adults who currently or previously used heroin (for at least 6 months), with any type of administration (injected, smoked) and experience of abstinence (at least 2 weeks) and relapse. Topic guides explored the participants understanding of tolerance, their experience of developing tolerance to heroin and of tolerance following relapse. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to generate salient themes.The analysis produced three broad themes: lay understanding of tolerance; tolerating tolerance; and rapid tolerance development following relapse. Tolerance was defined as the body adapting to regular drug use, so that the drug no longer produced the same level of effect. Tolerance was experienced as interacting and co-developing with physical dependence and the symptoms of withdrawal. Indeed, several participants did not differentiate between tolerance and dependence. Most participants did not notice tolerance to respiratory depression. Tolerance levels fluctuated-increasing over periods of regular use and reducing when abstinent. Using more drug was the most common response to increasing tolerance to the desired effects. On re-use following abstinence, tolerance was experienced as developing more quickly in the most recent relapse compared to the first. Tolerance was also perceived to return more quickly with each abstinence-relapse cycle.Qualitative accounts of tolerance report that tolerance returns more quickly with each relapse episode. By elucidating the mechanism(s) involved and potentially discovering how they could be switched on prior to relapse occurring we might be able to develop a beneficial harm reduction treatment for people in abstinence that would protect against overdose occurring on subsequent relapse."
https://openalex.org/W4283387503,"Driving forces are the factors that lead to the observed changes in the quantity and quality of ecosystem services (ESs). The relationship between driving forces and ESs involves considerable scale-related information. Place-based ecological management requires this information to support local sustainable development. Despite the importance of scale in ES research, most studies have only examined the association between ESs and their drivers at a single level, and few studies have examined this relationship at various scales or analyzed spatial heterogeneity. The purpose of this paper is to explore the significance of the scale-dependent effects of drivers on ESs for localized ecological management. The biophysical values of ESs were calculated using several ecological simulation models. The effects of driving forces on ESs were explored using the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. Variations in the effects of driving forces on ESs were examined at three scales: provincial, ecoregional, and subecoregional scales. Finally, canonical correlation analysis was used to identify the major environmental factors associated with these variations in each ecoregion. Our results show that (1) the distribution of soil conservation and water yield is highly heterogeneous; (2) four driving forces have significant positive and negative impacts on soil conservation and water yield, and their effects on the two services vary spatially (p < 0.05); (3) the impacts of drivers on ESs vary across different spatial scales, with a corresponding shift in the related environmental factors; and (4) in the study area, at the provincial scale, physical, topographical, and biophysical factors were key factors associated with the variations in the relationship between ESs and drivers, and at the ecoregional and subecoregional scales, physical, socioeconomic, topographical, and biophysical factors all contributed to these changes. Our results suggest that significant differences in topographical conditions (e.g., altitude, slope) can be incorporated for exploring the relationship between drivers and ESs and optimizing ecological management at the provincial scale, whereas significant differences in physical and socioeconomic conditions (e.g., urbanization levels, human activity, vegetation coverage) are more meaningful for localized ecological management at the ecoregional and subecological scales. These findings provide a basis for understanding the relationship between drivers and ESs at multiple scales as well as guidelines for improving localized ecological management and achieving sustainable development."

https://openalex.org/W4283323861,"Deforestation continues at rapid rates despite global conservation efforts. Evidence suggests that governance may play a critical role in influencing deforestation, and while a number of studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between national-level governance and deforestation, much remains to be known about the relative importance of subnational governance to deforestation outcomes. With a focus on the Brazilian Amazon, this study aims to understand the relationship between governance and deforestation at the municipal level. Drawing on the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) as a guiding conceptual framework, and incorporating the additional dimension of environmental governance, we identified a wide array of publicly available data sources related to governance indicators that we used to select relevant governance variables. We compiled a dataset of 22 municipal-level governance variables covering the 2005-2018 period for 457 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon. Using an econometric approach, we tested the relationship between governance variables and deforestation rates in a fixed-effects panel regression analysis. We found that municipalities with increasing numbers of agricultural companies tended to have higher rates of deforestation, municipalities with an environmental fund tended to have lower rates of deforestation, and municipalities that had previously elected a female mayor tended to have lower rates of deforestation. These results add to the wider conversation on the role of local-level governance, revealing that certain governance variables may contribute to halting deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon."
https://openalex.org/W4283326723,"Background Despite broad awareness of the opioid epidemic and the understanding that patients require much fewer opioids than traditionally prescribed, improvement efforts to decrease prescribing have only produced modest advances in recent years. Methods and findings By using a collaborative model for shared expertise and accountability, nine diverse health care systems completed quality improvement projects together over the course of one year to reduce opioid prescriptions for acute pain. The collaborative approach was flexible to each individual system’s goals, and seven of the nine participant institutions definitively achieved their desired results. Conclusions This report demonstrates the utility of a collaborative model of improvement to bring about real change in opioid prescribing practices and may inform quality improvement efforts at other institutions."
https://openalex.org/W4283369640,"In low-resource settings, detection of healthcare-acquired outbreaks in neonatal units relies on astute clinical staff to observe unusual morbidity or mortality from sepsis as microbiological diagnostics are often absent. We aimed to generate reliable (and automated) early warnings for potential clusters of neonatal late onset sepsis using retrospective data that could signal the start of an outbreak in an NCU in Port au Prince, Haiti, using routinely collected data on neonatal admissions. We constructed smoothed time series for late onset sepsis cases, late onset sepsis rates, neonatal care unit (NCU) mortality, maternal admissions, neonatal admissions and neonatal antibiotic consumption. An outbreak was defined as a statistical increase in any of these time series indicators. We created three outbreak alarm classes: 1) thresholds: weeks in which the late onset sepsis cases exceeded four, the late onset sepsis rates exceeded 10% of total NCU admissions and the NCU mortality exceeded 15%; 2) differential: late onset sepsis rates and NCU mortality were double the previous week; and 3) aberration: using the improved Farrington model for late onset sepsis rates and NCU mortality. We validated pairs of alarms by calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the weeks in which each alarm was launched and comparing each alarm to the weeks in which a single GNB positive blood culture was reported from a neonate. The threshold and aberration alarms were the strongest predictors for current and future NCU mortality and current LOS rates (p<0.0002). The aberration alarms were also those with the highest sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value. Without microbiological diagnostics in NCUs in low-resource settings, applying these simple algorithms to routinely collected data show great potential to facilitate early warning for possible healthcare-acquired outbreaks of LOS in neonates. The methods used in this study require validation across other low-resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W4283372500,"Myopia is a known risk factor of pigmentary glaucoma (PG), and the increased prevalence of myopia in Asian countries indicates that more cases of PG will likely develop soon. However, there are no diagnostic criteria for PG for Asians. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the characteristics of PG in Japanese individuals and establish three diagnostic signs for PG.This was a single-center, retrospective, case series study of glaucoma patients who visited the Kagoshima University Hospital between January 2015 and January 2020. The inclusion criteria were age <50 years at time of diagnosis and presence of pigmentation in the anterior chamber (AC) angle including a Sampaolesi line. Eyes with pigmentation of the AC angle caused by other types of glaucoma such as uveitis, trauma, exfoliation, or childhood glaucoma were excluded. We investigated the classic diagnostic triad of signs of PG; posterior corneal pigmentation, mid peripheral iris transillumination defect, and pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork. We also examined the Sampaolesi line, iris concavity, and midperipheral iris depigmentation in eyes with PG.Ten eyes of 5 Japanese men and 10 eyes of 5 Japanese women were studied. Their age ranged from 13 to 46 years at the time of diagnosis. One eye had posterior corneal pigmentation and 6 eyes had pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork. None had mid peripheral iris transillumination defect. The Sampaolesi line, iris concavity, and midperipheral iris depigmentation were found in all patients except one patient who lacked the mid peripheral depigmentation. Two eyes had the pigment reversal sign, none had lens pigmentation, and 2 eyes had peripheral retinal degeneration.The presence of the Sampaolesi line, iris concavity, and midperipheral iris depigmentation may be appropriate signs for the diagnosis of PG in Asians."
https://openalex.org/W4283385466,"The Healthy 4U-2 randomised controlled trial demonstrated that a physical activity (PA) telephone coaching intervention was effective for improving objectively-measured PA and health-related outcomes. The current study reports on an economic evaluation performed alongside the trial to determine whether this effective intervention is also cost-effective from a healthcare funder perspective. Participants (N = 120) were insufficiently physically active adults recruited from an ambulatory care clinic in a public hospital in regional Australia. The primary outcome was change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) measured using accelerometers. Changes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were derived from the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-12). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each outcome. Uncertainty of cost-effectiveness results were estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity analyses. The mean intervention cost was $132 per person. The control group incurred higher overall costs compared to intervention ($2,465 vs. $1,743, respectively). Relative to control, the intervention resulted in incremental improvements in MVPA and QALYs and was deemed cost-effective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that compared to control, the intervention would be cost-effective for improving MVPA and QALYs at very low willingness to pay thresholds. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust to varied assumptions. This study shows that PA telephone coaching was a low-cost strategy for increasing MVPA and QALYs in insufficiently active ambulatory hospital patients. Findings of health benefits and overall cost-savings are uncommon and PA telephone coaching offers a potentially cost-effective investment to produce important public health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4283389298,"The aim of the present clinically controlled two-year study was to investigate the influence of laser-based cavity preparation on the long-term performance of Class V resin-composite fillings. Class V non-carious lesions (n = 75) were randomly assigned to two test and one control group. Cavities in both test groups were prepared using an Er,Cr:YSGG laser (Waterlase MD, Biolase, Irvine, California, USA). The device was operated at 3 W (150 mJ, 30 J/cm2), 50% water, 60% air, 30 Hz in H mode. Subsequently, laser-prepared tooth surfaces in test group I (n = 21) were additionally conditioned by acid etching (etch-and-rinse). Laser-prepared cavities of test group II (n = 21) received no additional acid conditioning. After application of an adhesive, all cavities were restored using the resin-composite Venus®. For cavities in the control group (n = 33) conventional diamond burs were used for preparation which was followed by an etch-and-rinse step, too. The fillings were evaluated immediately (baseline) and after 6, 12 and 24 months of wear according to the C-criteria of the USPHS-compatible CPM-index. The results showed that after 24 month of wear, laser-preparation was associated with fillings of high clinical acceptability. Compared to conventional bur-based treatment, laser-based cavity preparation resulted in fillings with high marginal integrity and superior marginal ledge configurations (p = 0.003). Furthermore, laser-preparation combined with additional acid-conditioning (test group I) resulted in fillings with the best marginal integrity and the lowest number in marginal discoloration, especially at the enamel-composite margins (p = 0.044). In addition, total loss of fillings was also less frequently observed in both laser groups as compared to the control. The results clearly demonstrate that laser-based cavity preparation will benefit the clinical long-time performance of Class V resin-composite fillings. Furthermore, additional acid-conditioning after laser preparation is of advantage."
https://openalex.org/W4283389491,"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) often suffer recurrent bronchial bacterial infections that lead to deterioration of lung function over time. The infections in CF patients are often due to S . aureus and P . aeruginosa that colonize the airways. Significantly, methicillin-resistant S . aureus (MRSA) makes it challenging for treatment in CF patients due to its feature of multiple antibiotic resistance. In bronchial airways, cationic antimicrobial peptides are often present in mucosa cells, neutrophils, and macrophages that interfere with bacterial proliferation. The major mechanism for resistance to the bactericidal activity of cationic peptides in S . aureus is mediated by the GraRS two-component system that activates expression of MprF and DltABCD to increase surface positive charge to repel interactions with cationic peptides. We recently found that VraG, a membrane permease component of the VraFG efflux pumps, harbors a long 200-residue extracellular loop (EL) that utilizes K380 to interact with the negatively charged 9-residue extracellular loop of the membrane sensor GraS to control mprF expression in a community-acquired MRSA strain JE2. In this study, we extended this observation to a CF MRSA strain CF32A1 where we affirmed that the EL loop of VraG controls GraS-mediated signal transduction; however, in contrast to community acquired MRSA strain JE2, the CF MRSA strain CF32A1 requires both K380 and K388 in the EL of VraG to properly modulate signal transduction mediated by GraS. This effect was not attributable to the several single nucleotide polymorphisms that exist between VraG and GraS in the two MRSA strains."
