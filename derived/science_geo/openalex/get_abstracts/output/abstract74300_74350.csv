https://openalex.org/W1982036760,"CLONES of Paramecium aurelia, heterozygous for two alleles at one of the loci specifying the immobilization antigens1, react to both parental type-specific antisera, but usually more strongly to one parental type than to the other. It is of considerable interest to determine whether these heterozygous antigens consist of one molecular species combining in varying degree the specific regions of the parental protein molecules or whether there is simply a mixture of the parental antigens. On the basis of refined serological tests, Finger and Heller2 have suggested that a single hybrid molecular species is present and that the variation between clones (sometimes even derived from the same mating) is due to the formation of a hybrid combining in different ways the characters and presumably primary structure of the parental proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2032870575,"SINCE its simultaneous discovery a decade ago in an American family of mixed Spanish, Guatemalan, and Indian ancestry1 and in Thais2, haemoglobin E has been found in a variety of ethnic groups a majority of which are located in the Middle East and Asia. It is particularly common among the peoples of south-east Asia where it had been found in relatively high incidence in Burmese3, Thais4–7 and Cambodians8, and in lower incidences in Vietnamese9, Malayans10,11, Indonesians12, Chinese13,14 and Filipinos15. The results in this communication confirm the occurrence of haemoglobin E among Vietnamese."

https://openalex.org/W2075523013,"THE metabolites appearing in the urine after an oral load of L-tryptophan have been separated by paper, thin-layer and column chromatography. After ingestion of L-tryptophan (70 mg/kg body-wt.) the urine was collected at timed intervals over the next 24 h. Aliquots of the urine were examined by two-way paper chromatography (n-butanol–acetic acid–water, 12 : 3 : 5, followed by 20 per cent KCl in water), and by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel using chloroform, methanol, acetic acid (76 : 22 : 2 by volume). The metabolites were located with Ehrlich and Pauly reagents1 and by fluorescence in ultra-violet light at two wave-lengths (253 and 366 mµ)."

https://openalex.org/W2017410041,"THE cause of renal stone formation is unknown. Of the many current theories, majority opinion probably favours a ‘supersaturation’ mechanism, in which the urine concentrations of the ions of a poorly soluble salt exceed the ‘precipitation product’ for that particular salt, thereby causing spontaneous nucleation and subsequent growth of salt crystals."

We recently had the opportunity to test the family and found the father, the mother, the daughter with the ring X chromosome, the normal daughter and the normal son all to be straightforward Xg(a+). Two examples of anti-Xga were used."

https://openalex.org/W2080087871,"WE were very interested in the article by De Somer et al.1. Their results are in good agreement with our earlier observation, where the influence of several antibiotics on the stability of fat emulsions was studied2,3. The emulsion was prepared by using a mixture of 3.0 ml. olive oil, 1.5 ml. 0.9 per cent NaCl and 1.5 ml. human duodenal juice; after 2 h of shaking the percentage of split ester bonds was estimated and the stability of emulsion was observed during the following 60 min. The addition of neomycin sulphate in concentrations (1 mg/ml., 10 mg/ml., 100 mg/ml.) corresponding to a dilution of a therapeutic dose in 10,000 and 1,000 ml. of digestive juice caused a significant decrease of lipolysis and prevented the formation of a stable emulsion. A similar effect was observed with some other antibiotics. In further experiments we observed that the addition of 30 mg neomycin sulphate to 1 ml. olive oil, administered intragastrically to rats, caused a decrease of alimentary lipaemia in the next 3 h (ref. 4)."
