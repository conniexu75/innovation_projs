https://openalex.org/W1605041458,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) increase [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycan (PG) by monkey arterial smooth muscle cells but have opposite effects on cell proliferation. The combination of these two growth regulatory peptides has an additive effect on PG synthesis but no effects on cell proliferation. The time course of sulfate incorporation after stimulation indicates that both growth factors cause maximal incorporation of sulfate into glycosaminoglycan chains by 12-18 h. The PG that is most affected is a large CSPG (Mr approximately 1.2 x 10(6)) which can be immunoprecipitated by an antibody against versican, a large CSPG synthesized by human skin fibroblasts. The hydrodynamic size of this molecule increases after PDGF and TGF-beta 1 stimulation, but the size of the core glycoprotein (Mr approximately 450,000) remains the same. Treatment with either growth factor leads to an increase in the amount of core glycoprotein for this PG. This increase correlates with an increase in the steady state level of mRNA identified by hybridization to a cDNA encoding versican. The two growth factors also increase the glycosaminoglycan chain length of this PG accounting for the greater hydrodynamic size of the molecule after stimulation. In contrast, PDGF and not TGF-beta 1 changes the composition of the glycosaminoglycan chains attached to this PG by doubling the ratio of chondroitin 6-sulfate to chondroitin 4-sulfate. These results indicate that although both of these growth factors increase the net synthesis of a large versican like CSPG, they differ in their effects on the structure of the glycosaminoglycan chains. These post-translational modifications may relate to the growth state of the cells."

https://openalex.org/W1512481003,"The acidic region of the Factor VIII light chain was studied with regard to structural requirements for the formation of a functional von Willebrand factor (vWF)-binding site. Factor VIII mutants lacking the B domain, with additional deletions and an amino acid replacement within the sequence 1649-1689 were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Cos-1 cells. These mutants, which were recovered as single-chain molecules with similar specific activities, were compared in their binding to immobilized vWF. Deletion of amino acids 741-1648 or 741-1668 did not affect the binding of Factor VIII to vWF. However, a mutant with a deletion of residues 741-1689 was no longer capable of interacting with vWF. This indicates a role for residues within the sequence 1669-1689 in the formation of a vWF-binding site. When recombinant Factor VIII was expressed in the presence of chlorate, an inhibitor of protein sulfation, the resulting Factor VIII displayed strongly reduced binding to vWF. vWF binding was completely abolished when within the sequence 1669-1689 the tyrosine residue Tyr1680, which is part of a consensus tyrosine sulfation sequence, was replaced by phenylalanine. The Factor VIII sequence 1673-1689 was identified as a high affinity substrate for tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (Km = 57 microM) in cell-free sulfation studies. It is concluded that sulfation of Tyr1680 is required for the interaction of Factor VIII with vWF. Two synthetic peptides that represent the sequence 1673-1689, but differ with respect to sulfation of Tyr1680 are shown to have vWF binding affinity that is considerably lower than the Factor VIII protein. Several models to accommodate our findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1486575517,"We report the isolation and characterization of two human liver cDNA clones, HUG-Br1 and HUG-Br2; each encodes a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme which glucuronidates bilirubin IX alpha to form both the IX alpha C8 and IX alpha C12 monoconjugates and a diconjugate. HUG-Br1 cDNA (2351 base pairs) and HUG-Br2 cDNA (2368 base pairs) encode proteins with 533 and 534 amino acid residues, respectively, with a typical membrane-insertion signal peptide, membrane-spanning domain, and 3 or 5 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. At the nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequence levels the two clones are 82% similar overall, 66% similar in the amino termini, and identical after codon 287, thus encoding proteins with the same carboxyl terminus. The mRNA encoding HUG-Br1 is of high abundance, and the one encoding HUG-Br2 is of low abundance; both are 2.6 kilobases in length. Both messages (2.6 kilobases) were present in the explanted liver of a Type I Crigler-Najjar patient, although the level for that of HUG-Br1 was reduced 4.5-fold. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the liver of an untreated and a phenobarbital-treated Erythrocebus patas monkey with 5'-specific probes for each clone indicated that the HUG-Br2-encoded message is induced two fold, but that for HUG-Br1 is not. These data indicate that bilirubin is glucuronidated by at least two different proteins, most likely present in very different amounts. These cDNAs which encode functional bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferases will allow the isolation of an appropriate gene to develop a gene therapy model for patients which have the totally deficient trait."
https://openalex.org/W1522954291,"Limonene has chemotherapeutic activity against chemically induced rat mammary carcinomas, many of which contain activated ras genes. Given the recent discovery of the post-translational modification of p21ras and other cell growth-associated proteins by intermediates in the mevalonic acid pathway, and the common biochemical origins of limonene and these isoprene products, we investigated the effect of limonene on protein isoprenylation. NIH3T3 and human mammary epithelial cells were incubated with lovastatin and [2-14C]mevalonolactone in the absence and presence of limonene. Labeled proteins were then subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Limonene inhibited isoprenylation of a class of cellular proteins of 21-26 kDa, including p21ras and possibly other small GTP-binding proteins, in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines. In contrast, limonene did not affect the isoprenylation of several other proteins, including nuclear lamins. Limonene is metabolized extensively in vivo but not in cultured cells. The two major rat serum metabolites of limonene, perillic acid and dihydroperillic acid, were more potent than limonene in the inhibition of isoprenylation. These results demonstrate that limonene selectively inhibits isoprenylation of 21-26-kDa proteins at a point in the mevalonic acid pathway distal to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and they provide a plausible explanation for its chemotherapeutic activity. Inhibition of isoprenylation of proteins such as p21ras and other small GTP-binding proteins would alter their intracellular localization and, hence, disrupt their biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1512187347,"Two pigmentation related genes have recently been cloned which map to the brown (b) and albino (c) loci of mice; these loci influence the quality and quantity, respectively, of melanin produced by melanocytes. Both these gene products are biochemically similar and have extensive amino acid sequence similarity to each other and to lower forms of tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1), a copper binding enzyme responsible for melanin production. In order to characterize the catalytic activities of these molecules, we have synthesized peptides and prepared antibodies to them which specifically recognize the gene products in question. By use of immune affinity purification protocols, we have isolated the proteins encoded by the brown and albino loci and have determined that both have the catalytic functions ascribed to tyrosinase, i.e. hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and the oxidation of DOPA to DOPAquinone. These are the critical reactions to melanogenesis since melanin pigment can be spontaneously produced from those products. The specific activity of the albino locus encoded product is considerably higher than that of the protein encoded by the brown locus, although the latter protein is present in higher quantity in melanocytes than is the protein encoded by the albino locus. These results are surprising since it was anticipated that tyrosinase was the product of single gene locus, and suggest that regulation of melanogenesis in mammals is controlled at the enzymatic level by several different gene products."

https://openalex.org/W1918420563,"The translocation of: (i) phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) from its site of synthesis on microsomal membranes to its site decarboxylation in mitochondrial membranes and (ii) phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from the mitochondria to its site of methylation to phosphatidylcholine on microsomal membranes has been reconstituted in cell-free systems consisting of rat liver mitochondria and microsomes. Two types of systems have been reconstituted. In one, the translocation of newly made PtdSer or PtdEtn was examined by incubation of microsomes and mitochondria with [3-3H]serine. In the other, membranes were prelabeled with radioactive PtdSer or PtdEtn, and the transfer of these two lipids between mitochondria and microsomes was monitored. For the transfer of both PtdSer from microsomes to mitochondria and PtdEtn from mitochondria to microsomes, newly made phospholipids were translocated much more readily than pre-existing phospholipids. The data suggest that with respect to their translocation between these two organelles, the pools of newly synthesized PtdSer and PtdEtn were distinct from the pools of older phospholipids pre-existing in the membranes. Transfer of neither phospholipid in vitro depended on the presence of cytosolic proteins (i.e. soluble phospholipid transfer proteins) or on the hydrolysis of ATP, although there was some stimulation of PtdSer transfer by ATP and several other nucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates. The data are consistent with a collision-based mechanism in which the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria come into contact with one another, thereby effecting the transfer of phospholipids. The proposal that there is contact between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria is supported by the recent isolation of a membrane fraction having many, but not all, of the properties of the endoplasmic reticulum, but which was isolated in association with mitochondria (Vance, J. E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7248-7256)."
https://openalex.org/W1574227588,"Cell lines expressing varying levels of ganglioside GM3 at the cell surface show different degrees of adhesion and spreading on solid phase coated with such glycosphingolipids (GSLs) as Gg3 (GalNAc beta 1—-4Gal beta 1—-4Glc beta 1—-1Cer), LacCer (Gal beta 1—-4Glc beta 1—-1Cer), or Gb4 (GalNAc beta 1—-3Gal alpha 1—-4Gal beta 1—-4Glc beta 1—-1Cer) (where Cer is ceramide), which may have structures complementary to GM3, but not on solid phase coated with various other GSLs. The degree of cell adhesion and spreading on Gg3 was correlated with the degree of cell-surface GM3 expression, as defined by reactivity with anti-GM3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) DH2. Only cells with high GM3 expression adhered on solid phase coated with LacCer or Gb4. Adhesion of GM3-expressing cells on Gg3-, LacCer-, and Gb4-coated solid phase is based on interaction of GM3 with Gg3 and, to a lesser extent, with LacCer and Gb4, as demonstrated by: (i) the interaction of the GM3 liposome with solid phase coated with Gg3, LacCer, and Gb4, respectively; (ii) the abolition of cell adhesion on each GSL-coated solid phase by treatment of cells with mAb DH2 or sialidase; and (iii) the inhibition of cell adhesion by treatment of GSL-coated solid phase with mAb specific to each GSL. Sialosyllactosyl-lysyllysine conjugate was bound to Gg3 adsorbed on a C18 silica gel column in the presence of bivalent cation, suggesting that the carbohydrate moiety of GM3 is involved in GM3-Gg3 interaction. Not only the adhesion and spreading of GM3-expressing cells, but also their cell motility was greatly enhanced on Gg3-coated solid phase, as determined by Transwell assay and phagokinetic track assay on a gold sol-coated surface. Spreading and motility of GM3-expressing cells on Gg3-coated solid phase were both inhibited by treatment of cells with mAb DH2 or sialidase. These results provide evidence that not only cell adhesion, but also spreading and motility in these cell lines are controlled by complementary GSL-GSL interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1499345269,"Salmonella typhimurium contains three distinct transport systems (CorA, MgtA, and MgtB) that move Mg2+ across the cytoplasmic membrane. Mutant strains containing only one of these three systems have been constructed and used to study each system in isolation. Characterization of these systems has been hampered, however, by the need to use 28Mg2+, a relatively unavailable, extremely expensive, and short lived radioisotope. This paper reports that 63Ni2+ is transported into the cell by all three of the S typhimurium Mg2+ transport systems. In a strain deficient in all three systems, uptake of 63Ni2+ was undetectable under the conditions used. Comparison of 63Ni2+ uptake kinetics and inhibition of 63Ni2+ transport by other divalent cations suggest that Ni2+ can be used as an analog of Mg2+ in the study of these three transport systems. Using 63Ni2+ to measure uptake, the effect of Mg2+ levels in the growth medium on transport by each system was tested. Transport by the CorA system was unaffected by changes in the amount of Mg2+ in the growth medium. In contrast, uptake via MgtA and MgtB was significantly increased in cells grown in 10 microM extracellular Mg2+ compared to cells grown in 10 mM Mg2+. The increases in uptake were the result of increases in Vmax without change in Km. This result suggests that, in low Mg2+ medium, cells contained higher levels of the transporters. Production of beta-galactosidase from mgtA::lacZ and mgtB::lacZ but not corA::lacZ fusions was also increased when cells were grown in low extracellular concentrations of Mg2+ indicating that the regulation occurs at the level of transcription. Expression of beta-galactosidase was also inhibited by the addition of other divalent cations including Ca2+ and Mn2+. Regulation of transcription from the mgtA and mgtB promoters was similar over the range of extracellular Mg2+ concentrations from 10 microM to 10 mM. At 1 microM, however, transcription from the mgtB promoter, as measured by beta-galactosidase levels in a mgtB::lacZ transcriptional fusion strain, was increased over 800-fold, and Ca2+ could no longer inhibit transcription effectively. In contrast, growth at 1 microM extracellular Mg2+ increased transcription from the mgtA promoter only about 30-fold and Ca2+ could still inhibit this increase. These results suggest that at least two distinct mechanisms are responsible for regulation of the mgtA and mgtB transcription in response to extracellular cation concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1484570673,"The human blood protein pre-alpha-inhibitor is composed of one heavy and one light protein chain. The chains are covalently linked to each other by a structure that has not previously been described, which we designate a protein-glycosaminoglycan-protein (PGP) cross-link. A combination of protein and carbohydrate analytical techniques indicates that the interchain linkage is mediated by a chondroitin 4-sulfate glycosaminoglycan that originates from a typical O-glycosidic link to Ser-10 of the light chain. The heavy chain is esterified, via the alpha-carbon of its C-terminal Asp, to C-6 of an internal N-acetylgalactosamine of the glycosaminoglycan chain. This PGP cross-link may be present in other proteins, but could have been overlooked due to the heterogeneous behavior of proteins containing glycosaminoglycan."

https://openalex.org/W1609484548,"Using differential hybridization, genes whose expression is induced at low temperatures were identified in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One of these genes that corresponds to an mRNA that is induced 6-8-fold within 2 h after shifting the culture temperature from 30 to 10 degrees C was further characterized. Surprisingly, its expression was also induced by heat shock, and thus the gene was designated TIP 1 (temperature shock-inducible protein gene). Southern hybridization analysis demonstrated that there are several genes homologous to the TIP 1 gene on the yeast genome. A TIP 1 disruption mutation exerted an observable effect neither on growth nor on viability after being exposed to freezing temperatures. The TIP 1 gene encodes a protein of 210 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 20,727, containing 20.0% alanine and 23.3% serine. The TIP 1 protein has a typical signal peptide at the amino-terminal end and an extremely hydrophobic sequence at the carboxyl-terminal end. The TIP 1 protein is thus likely to be secreted across the membrane and anchored on the outside surface of the plasma membrane. These results indicate that the TIP 1 protein is a new type of stress inducible protein in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1585371486,"The H-ras gene product p21H has been mutated at Phe-28, which makes a hydrophobic interaction with the guanine base of bound GDP/GTP. The mutation Phe-28----Leu drastically increases nucleotide dissociation rates without affecting association rates. This is due to a perturbed binding of base, alpha- and beta-phosphate, and Mg2+, as evidenced from 31P NMR and fluorescence measurements. The region around the gamma-phosphate appears normal. The affinity of Mg2+ for both the di- and the triphosphate conformation of the mutant was also measured by fluorescence. The association constant is 3.5 x 10(7) M-1 for the Gpp(NH)p complex, 500 times higher than for the GDP form. The mutation does not change appreciably the intrinsic or the GTPase activating protein (GAP)-stimulated GTPase. The mutated protein induces neurite differentiation however when pressure-loaded into PC12 cells, which is equivalent to transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. This shows that p21 (F28L) is converted to the GDP bound form by GAP but is transforming because the high dissociation rate for nucleotides leads to a protein predominantly in the active GTP bound form."
https://openalex.org/W1555904090,"Bacillus subtilis has an alkaline phosphatase multigene family. Two members of this gene family, phoAIII and phoAIV, were cloned, taking advantage of in vitro constructed strains containing a plasmid insertion within one or the other of the structural genes. The DNA sequences of the two genes showed approximately 64% identity at the DNA level and 63% identity in the deduced primary amino acid sequences. The phoAIII and phoAIV genes code for predicted proteins of 47,149 and 45,935 Da, respectively. Comparison of the deduced primary amino acid sequence of the mature proteins with other sequenced alkaline phosphatases from Escherichia coli, yeast, and humans shows 25-30% identity. Based on the refined crystal structure of E. coli alkaline phosphatase, it appears that the active site and the core of the structure are retained in both Bacillus alkaline phosphatases. However, both proteins are truncated at the amino terminus compared with other mature alkaline phosphatases, three sizable surface loops of E. coli are deleted, and a minidomain is replaced with a larger domain in the model. Neither Bacillus alkaline phosphatase sequenced contains any cysteine residues, an amino acid implicated in intrachain disulfide bond formation in other alkaline phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1564589796,"We have examined the levels of delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) mRNAs encoding the erythroid-specific (ALAS-E) and the nonspecific (ALAS-N) ALAS isozymes in murine Friend virus-transformed erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Both ALAS-E and ALAS-N mRNAs were detected in a clone of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-sensitive MEL cells, termed DS-19, without cross-hybridization. Untreated DS-19 cells contained approximately 10-fold more ALAS-E mRNA than ALAS-N mRNA. When DS-19 cells were treated with Me2SO or hemin, ALAS-N mRNA declined rapidly, which was followed by a marked increase in ALAS-E mRNA. Similarly, the immunoquantifiable ALAS-N protein decreased, while the ALAS-E protein increased upon Me2SO treatment. A clone of Me2SO-resistant cells, termed DR-1, which fails to undergo erythroid differentiation, was found to lack ALAS-E mRNA, whereas it showed significant induction responses of mRNAs for other heme pathway enzymes by Me2SO treatment. DR-1 cells contained a similar level of an erythroid-specific transcription factor, GATA-1, as did DS-19 cells, and had neither major deletion nor rearrangement of the ALAS-E gene. These findings indicate that the genes encoding the two ALAS isozymes are under separate controls and suggest that ALAS-E mRNA accumulation is responsible for increased heme synthesis in MEL cells undergoing erythroid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1606114692,"The photosynthetic membranes of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts were incubated with [gamma-32P] ATP. When the thylakoid membrane kinase was activated with light, the 25- and 27-kDa forms of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (LHC II) were phosphorylated on their amino termini. Treatment of the membranes with proteinase K or thermolysin released phosphopeptides which were purified by ferric ion affinity chromatography and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Sequencing of the phosphopeptides was performed with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. Three different phosphopeptides Ac-RKTAGKPKT, Ac-RKTAGKPKN, and Ac-RKSAGKPKN originating from class I LHC II were examined after release by thermolysin. One phosphopeptide, Ac-RRTVKSAPQ, originating from class II LHC II was examined after release by proteinase K. Each of the four LHC II phosphopeptides was derived from the amino terminus of a distinct protein. Peptides were acetylated at their amino-terminal arginine and were phosphorylated on either threonine or serine in the third position. We conclude that proteolytic processing of pre-LHC II occurs at a conserved methionyl-arginyl bond and is followed by amino-terminal acetylation of the arginine and nearby phosphorylation of the mature LHC II. Eight different peptides were synthesized in acetylated and nonacetylated forms as substrates for the thylakoid membrane kinase. From a comparison of the kinetics of phosphate incorporation into the peptides, we conclude that basic residues on both sides of the phosphorylation site are important for enzyme recognition. Acetylation of the amino terminus is not required for phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1947740626,"Adenylate cyclase (AC) toxin from Bordetella pertussis interacts with and enters eukaryotic cells to catalyze the production of supraphysiologic levels of cyclic AMP. Although the calmodulin-activated enzymatic activity (ability to convert ATP to cyclic AMP in a cell-free assay) of this molecule is calcium independent, its toxin activity (ability to increase cyclic AMP levels in intact target cells) requires extracellular calcium. Toxin activity as a function of calcium concentration is biphasic, with no intoxication occurring in the absence of calcium, low level intoxication (200-300 pmol of cyclic AMP/mg of Jurkat cell protein) occurring with free calcium concentrations between 100 nM and 100 microM and a 10-fold increase in AC toxin activity at free calcium concentrations above 300 microM. The molecule exhibits a conformational change when free calcium concentrations exceed 100 microM as demonstrated by shift in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, an alteration in binding of one anti-AC monoclonal antibody, protection of a fragment from trypsin-mediated proteolysis, and a structural modification as illustrated by electron microscopy. Thus, it appears that an increase in the ambient calcium concentration to a critical point and the ensuing interaction of the toxin with calcium induces a conformational change which is necessary for its insertion into the target cell and for delivery of its catalytic domain to the cell interior."
https://openalex.org/W2004270134,"APOLIPOPROTEIN(apo) B100 is required for the distribution of hepatic triglyceride to peripheral tissues as very-low-density lipoproteins. The translocation of apo B100 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its subsequent assembly into lipoprotein particles is of particular interest as the protein is both very large (relative molecular mass 512,000) and insoluble in water. It has been proposed that apo B translocation occurs in discrete stages and is completed post-translationally1. Several sites of arrest of translocation were reported to be present in apo B15 (the N-terminal 15% of the protein). We have re-examined this question by in vitro translation coupled with translocation into microsomes, and find no evidence for transmembrane segments in truncated apo B proteins. Translocated apo B17 is strongly associated with the membrane-of the ER, being only partially releasable with alkaline carbonate, and remaining bound to the microsomes following disruption with saponin. The efficient binding of short segments of apo B, despite the absence of transmembrane domains, suggests that apo B is cotranslationally inserted into the inner leaflet of the ER. This will obviate problems caused by the size and insolubility of apo B100, because the growing hydrophobic protein chains will never exist in a lipid-free form during translocation. From the inner leaflet, apo B in association with membrane-derived lipid can bud into the lumen of the ER to form nascent lipoprotein particles."
https://openalex.org/W2138448325,"Endonuclease V, a pyrimidine dimer-specific DNA repair enzyme, was chemically modified by reductive methylation, a technique that specifically methylates primary amino groups. Upon reaction of endonuclease V with [14C]formaldehyde (14CH2O) in the presence of the reducing agent sodium cyanoborohydride (Na-CNBH3), it was discovered that 0.8 methylation/endonuclease V molecule was required to reduce both the glycosylase and the phosphodiester lyase activities by 70-80%. Pyrimidine dimer-specific binding was not eradicated at a level of methylation equivalent to 0.8 CH3/endonuclease V molecule but was eradicated at higher levels of methylation. Endonuclease V that had been modified with an average of 1.6 CH3/molecule was digested with Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 protease and the peptides subsequently separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Radiolabel was found exclusively on the peptide including the amino terminus, as determined by the percent amino acid composition. Neither intact CH3-endonuclease V nor radiolabeled peptides were able to be sequenced by Edman degradation indicating blockage of the amino terminus by methylation. This study shows strong evidence for the unusual involvement of the alpha NH2 moiety in the chemical mechanisms of endonuclease V. A reaction mechanism that incorporates these findings is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1480281099,"The regional and tissue-specific expression of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, CaM kinase-Gr, were examined. The Mr 65,000 alpha-polypeptide of CaM kinase-Gr is expressed ubiquitously in different anatomical regions of rat brain, whereas an additional Mr 67,000 beta-polypeptide is observed solely in the cerebellum. The alpha-polypeptide appears in the neonatal rat forebrain and cerebellum, whereas the beta-polypeptide appears by the second postnatal week and may reflect cerebellar granule cell differentiation. Most peripheral tissues do not express either CaM kinase-Gr polypeptide. However, rat thymus and thymocytes derived therefrom express CaM kinase-Gr at levels comparable to those of the central nervous system. The identity of the enzyme in rat thymus was corroborated by immunoblot assays, Northern blots, and direct enzyme purification. Rat spleen and testis also produce CaM kinase-Gr, but at lower levels than either thymus or brain. These observations demonstrate selective regional and developmental expression of CaM kinase-Gr polypeptide in brain, and suggest that it may participate in Ca2+ signalling in cells derived both from the immune system as well as the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1504143645,"The function of the transferrin receptor is to transport iron-bound transferrin into the cell. In order to function properly, this dimeric glycoprotein must be expressed on the cell surface and be able to bind transferrin. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to abolish the three asparagine-linked glycosylation consensus sequences of the human transferrin receptor. The DNA encoding the mutated transferrin receptor was stably transfected into mouse fibroblasts. This form of the human transferrin receptor shows reduced transferrin binding, reduced intersubunit bond formation, and reduced cell surface expression, indicating that the transferrin receptor which lacks asparagine-linked glycosylation is not fully functional. In addition, the mutated form of the receptor is not processed as quickly. It shows an association with an endoplasmic reticular chaperone protein, binding immunoglobulin protein, leading to the hypothesis that the mutated transferrin receptor experiences increased retention in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1596908643,"Degranulation of neutrophils involves the differential regulation of the exocytosis of at least two populations of granules. Low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (LMW-GBPs) have been implicated in the regulation of vesicular traffic in the secretory pathways of several types of cells. In the present study we identify distinct subsets of LMW-GBPs associated with the membranes of neutrophil-specific and azurophilic granules. Ninety-four percent of total [35S]guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding activity was equally distributed between the plasma membrane and cytosol with the remaining 6% localized in the granules. In contrast, the cytosol contained only 10% of the total GTPase activity while the specific granules accounted for 13%. [alpha-32P]GTP binding to proteins transferred to nitrocellulose revealed LMW-GBPs in all fractions except the azurophilic granules. The specific granules contained three out of four bands which were found in the plasma membrane; these ranged from 20 to 23 kDa and all were resistant to alkaline extraction. Photoaffinity labeling with [alpha-32P]8-azido-GTP in the presence of micromolar Al3+ identified proteins of 25 and 26 kDa unique to azurophilic granules; these could not be labeled with [alpha-32P]8-azido-ATP and could be extracted by acidic but not alkaline pH. Botulinum C3-mediated [32P]ADP-ribosylation identified proteins of 16, 20, and 24 kDa both in plasma membranes and those of specific granules. An anti-ras monoclonal antibody, 142-24E5, recognized a 20-kDa protein localized to the plasma and specific granule membranes which could not be extracted by alkaline pH, was not a substrate for botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase, and was translocated from specific granules to plasma membrane after exposure of neutrophils to phorbol myristate acetate. We conclude that neutrophil-specific and azurophilic granules contain distinct subsets of LMW-GBPs which are uniquely situated to regulate the differential exocytosis of these two compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1597773648,"The lsp gene of Escherichia coli encodes the inner membrane enzyme, signal peptidase II (SPase II). SPase II is comprised of 164 amino acid residues and contains four hydrophobic domains. A series of lsp-phoA and lsp-lacZ gene fusions have been constructed in vitro to determine the topology of SPase II. The fusion junction for each of these gene fusions was determined by DNA sequencing. The lengths of the SPase II fragment in the fusions varied from 12 to 159 amino acid residues. Strains containing SPase II-PhoA fusions to the two predicted periplasmic loops exhibited higher levels of alkaline phosphatase activity than fusions to the predicted cytoplasmic domains. In contrast, SPase II-LacZ fusions at the cytoplasmic and the periplasmic domains of SPase II showed high and low levels of beta-galactosidase activity, respectively, a result opposite to those shown by SPase II-PhoA fusions located at precisely the same amino acid of SPase II. Taken together, these results strongly support the predicted model for SPase II topology, i.e. this enzyme spans the cytoplasmic membrane four times with both the amino and the carboxyl termini facing the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1544690761,"These experiments examine the role of conformation, hydrophobicity, and steric constraints in the function of the prokaryotic signal peptide cleavage region. The experimental strategy involves replacement of the wild type Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase signal peptide cleavage region with a series of idealized model sequences designed to epitomize the particular structural and physical variables under study. By analyzing model sequences whose conformations have been determined by physical studies, we have demonstrated that efficient transport does not depend on the structural preference of the cleavage region. Although previous studies based on Chou-Fasman analysis have suggested that the cleavage region forms a beta-turn which is required for transport, our results demonstrate that either a beta-turn- or alpha-helix-fostering sequence in the cleavage region functions indistinguishably from wild type. Furthermore, the presence of a proline residue between the core and cleavage region, although common in natural sequences, is not essential for export. Cleavage regions of varying hydrophobicities can support translocation across the inner membrane, but the placement of bulky residues at positions -1 and -3 upstream of the cleavage site abolishes processing and transport to the periplasm. By reducing the signal peptide to simplified, idealized segments, this study has identified a largely polymeric sequence, MKQST(L10)-(A6), that functions equivalently to the wild type alkaline phosphatase signal peptide. This work starts to provide a basis for the design of a universal prokaryotic signal peptide that incorporates all the critical physical and structural characteristics required for transport function."
https://openalex.org/W1562909549,"Transfection of the insulin-producing rat islet tumor cell line RIN-5AH with a full length cDNA of the rat hepatic growth hormone (GH) receptor (GH-R1-638) augments the GH-responsive insulin synthesis in these cells. Using this functional system we analyzed the effect of COOH-terminal truncation of the GH receptor. Two mutated cDNAs encoding truncated GH receptors, GH-R1-294 and GH-R1-454, respectively, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and transfected into the RIN cells. Both receptor mutants were expressed on the cell surface and displayed normal GH binding affinity. Whereas GH-R1-638 had a molecular mass of about 110 kDa, GH-R1-294 and GH-R1-454 showed molecular masses of 49 and 80 kDa, respectively. Cells expressing GH-R1-454 internalized GH to a similar extent as cells transfected with the full length receptor and the parent cell line, but GH-R1-294-expressing cells showed a markedly reduced capability of GH internalization. In contrast to cells transfected with GH-R1-638, none of the cell lines expressing truncated GH receptors exhibited any increase of the GH-stimulated insulin production. We conclude that domains within the COOH-terminal half of the cytoplasmic part of the GH receptor are required for transduction of the signal for GH-stimulated insulin synthesis, whereas cytoplasmic domains proximal to the transmembrane region are involved in receptor-mediated GH internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1543885109,"Abstract The region(s) of bovine galactosyltransferase that interacts with the lactose synthase regulatory protein alpha-lactalbumin was investigated using trace 3H acetylation to probe the effects of alpha-lactalbumin on the reactivities of the individual amino groups of galactosyltransferase. In the presence of Mn2+, alpha-lactalbumin was found to reduce the reactivities of lysines 93 and 181 and to increase the reactivities of one or more of lysines 230, 237, and 241. The addition of N-acetylglucosamine (20 mM), which enhances complex formation between the two proteins, did not significantly alter the pattern of perturbation. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal region of the catalytic domain of galactosyltransferase, and possibly part of the proline-rich stem region, is affected by the association with alpha-lactalbumin and is therefore implicated in the binding of acceptor substrates. In a separate study only cysteines 176, 266, and 342 of galactosyltransferase were found to react with [3H]iodoacetic acid under denaturing conditions. From their lack of reactivity it is deduced that the remaining two cysteines, residues 134 and 247, are joined in a disulfide linkage. From these results and those of a previous study of UDP-galactose binding (Yadav, S., and Brew, K. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14163-14169) it appears that the soluble form of galactosyltransferase is composed of two domains, the NH2-terminal 150 residues containing the Cys134-Cys247 disulfide bond, which functions in alpha-lactalbumin and acceptor binding, and the COOH-terminal region, which is involved in UDP-galactose binding."
https://openalex.org/W1564269821,"Abstract Sulfide-dependent partial electron-transport reactions were studied in thylakoids isolated from cells of the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria limnetica, which had been induced to perform sulfide-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis. It was found that these thylakoids have the capacity to catalyze electron transfer, from sulfide to externally added quinones, in the dark. Assay conditions were developed to measure the reaction either as quinone-dependent sulfide oxidation (colorimetrically) or as sulfide-dependent quinone reduction (by UV dual-wavelength spectrophotometry). The main features of this reaction are as follows. (i) It is exclusively catalyzed by thylakoids of sulfide-induced cells. Noninduced thylakoids lack this reaction. (ii) Plastoquinone-1 or -2 are equally good substrates. Ubiquinone-1 and duroquinone yield somewhat slower rates. (iii) The apparent Km for plastoquinone-1 was 32 microM and for sulfide about 4 microM. Maximal rates (at 25 degrees C) were about 75 mumol of quinone reduced per mg of chlorophyll.h. (iv) The reaction was not affected by extensive washes of the membranes. (v) Unlike sulfide-dependent NADP photoreduction activity of these thylakoids, which is sensitive to all the specific inhibitors of the cytochrome b6f complex, the new dark reaction exhibited differential sensitivity to these inhibitors. 2-n-Nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide was the most potent inhibitor of both light and dark reactions, working at submicromolar concentrations. 5-n-Undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole also inhibited the two reactions to a similar extent, but at 10 times higher concentrations than 2-n-nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide. 2,5-Dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone, 2-iodo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-2',4,4'-trinitrodiphenyl ether, and stigmatellin had no effect on the dark reaction at concentrations sufficient to fully inhibit the light reaction from sulfide. We propose that the sulfide-induced factor which enables the use of sulfide as the electron donor for anoxygenic photosynthesis in Oscillatria limnetica is a membrane-bound sulfide-quinone reductase. Its site of interaction is suggested to be either the cytochrome b6 (at the Qc quinone binding site or the bH site) or the plastoquinone pool. The analogy to other anoxygenic photosynthetic systems is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1551748714,"We have found that many dianionic species, at millimolar concentrations, significantly activate or inhibit the bovine carbonic anhydrase III-catalyzed hydration of CO2. Dianionic species such as HPO2-4 and SO2-3, with pKb values near 7, are activators, whereas weakly basis species such as SO2-4 act as inhibitors. Both activation and inhibition are partial hyperbolic in nature and do not appear to compete with monoanionic linear inhibitors like N-3. Our kinetic data are consistent with a formal mechanism of action for carbonic anhydrase III that is directly analogous to that of carbonic anhydrase II, in which Lys-64 of carbonic anhydrase III can act as an intramolecular H+ transfer group during CO2 hydration. Our data suggest that dianionic inhibitors depress the rate of H+ transfer during turnover by stabilizing the protonated form of Lys-64. We postulate that dianionic activators enhance the rate of a rate-limiting H+ transfer step in the mechanism, probably by acting directly as H+ acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1594053065,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Thr654. It has been proposed that the phosphorylation of this site is an important regulatory mechanism for the control of EGF receptor function. However, the physiological significance of the phosphorylation of EGF receptor Thr654 in intact cells is not understood. To address this question, the design of an experimental strategy is required that can be used to distinguish between the pleiotropic effects of kinase C activation and the specific effects of kinase C that are mediated by the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at Thr654. The approach that we used was to examine the function of EGF receptors that are constitutively phosphorylated at residue 654. It was observed that the constitutive phosphorylation of the EGF receptor blocked mitogenic signal transduction by the receptor. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at residue 654 in intact cells inhibits EGF-stimulated cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1604137981,"The structure of the gene for the human alpha 1(XIII) collagen chain (COL13A1) was determined from genomic clones spanning 140,000 base pairs (bp), including about 3,000 bp of the 5'-end-flanking region and 5,000 bp of the 3'-end-flanking region. The gene was shown to contain 39 exons. There were eight exons of 27 bp, five of 36 bp, four of 54 bp, three of 45 bp, and two of 42 bp. The rest of the exons coding for translated sequences had sizes varying between 24 and 153 bp. The genomic clones did not contain exons 3 and 4 whose sizes could, however, be estimated from cDNA clones. S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analyzes indicated five closely spaced initiation sites of transcription. Sequencing of the 5'-end-flanking region did not reveal a typical TATA box but a four times repeated TATTTAT sequence that may serve as true TATA boxes. Two CCAAT boxes were found starting at positions-13 and -194, and furthermore, the promoter region contains two GC boxes. Previous studies on alpha 1 (XIII) collagen cDNA and genomic clones showed that the primary transcript undergoes complex alternative splicing generating at least four different forms of mRNAs. The present work demonstrated that sequences of seven exons are alternatively used. These exons contain sequences coding for pure collagenous regions, pure noncollagenous regions, and an exon coding for a junction of a collagenous and noncollagenous domain."
https://openalex.org/W1542824093,"Glycogen-bound protein phosphatase G from rat liver was transferred from glycogen to beta-cyclodextrin (cycloheptaamylose) linked to Sepharose 6B. After removal of the catalytic subunit and of contaminating proteins with 2 M NaCl, elution with beta-cyclodextrin yielded a single protein on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two polypeptides (161 and 54 kDa) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Several lines of evidence indicate that the latter polypeptides are subunits of the protein phosphatase G holoenzyme. First, these polypeptides were also present, together with the catalytic subunit, in the extensively purified holoenzyme. Also, polyclonal antibodies against these polypeptides were able to bind the holoenzyme. Further, while bound to cyclodextrin-Sepharose, the polypeptides were able to recombine with separately purified type-1 (AMD) catalytic subunit, but not with type-2A (PCS) catalytic subunit. The characteristics of the reconstituted enzyme resembled those of the nonpurified protein phosphatase G. At low dilutions, the spontaneous phosphorylase phosphatase activity of the reconstituted enzyme was about 10 times lower than that of the catalytic subunit, but it was about 1000-fold more resistant to inhibition by the modulator protein (inhibitor-2). In contrast with the free catalytic subunit, the reconstituted enzyme co-sedimented with glycogen, and it was able to activate purified liver glycogen synthase b. Also, the synthase phosphatase activity was synergistically increased by a cytosolic phosphatase and inhibited by physiological concentrations of phosphorylase alpha and of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1582747744,"Serine 127 of human NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase was replaced by proline and alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The former mutation has been found in the genes of patients with hereditary deficiency of the enzyme. Both the mutant enzymes (Ser-127----Pro mutant and Ser-127----Ala mutant) were overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The two purified mutant enzymes showed indistinguishable spectral properties which differed from those of the wild-type enzyme. The mutant enzymes showed higher molecular extinction coefficients at 462 nm than that of the wild-type enzyme. Quenching of FAD fluorescence in these mutant enzymes was significantly less than that in the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, circular dichroism spectra of the mutant enzymes were different, in both the visible and ultraviolet regions, from that of the wild-type enzyme. The spectra of the mutant enzymes in the visible region were restored to almost the same spectrum as the wild type upon reduction with NADH. Ser-127----Pro mutant and Ser-127----Ala mutant showed very low Kcat/Km (NADH) values (5 x 10(7) and 3.5 x 10(7) s-1 M-1, respectively) with cytochrome b5 as an electron acceptor, than that of the wild-type enzyme (Kcat/Km (NADH) = 179 x 10(7) s-1 M-1), while the Kcat/Km (cytochrome b5) value for each enzyme was similar. The mutant enzymes were less thermostable than the wild-type enzyme. These results indicate that serine 127 plays an important role to maintain the structure of the NADH-binding site in the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1586610201,"Fusion proteins consisting of diphtheria toxin and a duplicated Fc-binding domain of protein A were made in vitro after amplification of the DNA template by the polymerase chain reaction. The fusion proteins bound avidly to Vero cells coated with antibodies. A fusion protein containing full-length diphtheria toxin was toxic at lower concentrations than diphtheria toxin alone, apparently due to more efficient binding. The enzymatic part of the fusion protein was translocated across the surface membrane upon exposure to low pH. Like authentic diphtheria toxin, the fusion protein formed cation selective channels at low pH. Excess amounts of unlabeled diphtheria toxin inhibited formation of pronase-protected fragments derived from radiolabeled fusion protein. Furthermore, conditions that down-regulate the diphtheria toxin receptors reduced the sensitivity of the cells to the fusion protein, supporting the notion that authentic diphtheria toxin receptors are required. At temperatures below 18 degrees C the toxicity of the fusion protein was strongly reduced, whereas there was no temperature block for authentic diphtheria toxin. Brefeldin A protected Vero cells against the fusion protein but not against diphtheria toxin. The results indicate that the diphtheria toxin receptor is required for efficient toxin translocation even under conditions where the toxin is bound by an alternate binding moiety, and they suggest that the intracellular routing of the fusion protein is different from that of diphtheria toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1507606121,"The in vitro interactions between vascular cells and fibronectin have been shown to influence phenotypic expression of both cultured endothelial and smooth muscle cells. To more effectively assess the potential functional role of fibronectin in vivo in modulating vascular phenotypes, we have established methodology for studying fibronectin biosynthesis in the rabbit aorta using aortic rings that are morphologically and functionally intact and metabolically active. Aortic rings were incubated with 35S-labeled methionine in a supplemented physiological salt solution. The tissue was fractionated, and quantitative immunoprecipitation was performed using a polyclonal antibody directed against human plasma fibronectin. Newly synthesized fibronectin was most abundant in the fraction solubilized using 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate and in the incubation medium. In all fractions studied, fibronectin was present predominantly as a dimer with no detectable aggregates of fibronectin. Pulse-chase experiments showed that a substantial amount of newly synthesized fibronectin was found in the 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate extract after only 1 h, suggesting that fibronectin was rapidly incorporated into the extracellular matrix. The more soluble forms of newly synthesized fibronectin appeared to be the precursors for secreted fibronectin, and no precursor-product relationship between soluble and insoluble fibronectin was found. Dissection of aortic rings following incubation with labeled methionine showed that newly synthesized fibronectin was uniformally distributed in both intima-media and media-adventitia segments. Endothelial cell denudation caused only a 20% decrease of fibronectin biosynthesis concomitant with similar changes in total protein biosynthesis, consistent with the medial smooth muscle cell as the major source of newly synthesized fibronectin. Biosynthesis of fibronectin was increased following a 24-h preincubation of the aortic rings, and concomitant increases in steady state mRNA for fibronectin were found. These in vitro studies documented the utility of aortic rings for the general purpose of studying protein synthesis in vascular cells and provide new information on the characteristics of fibronectin biosynthesis by aortic tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1543477643,"A 58-kDa Golgi protein (gp58) was previously identified and found to be concentrated in cis Golgi cisternae in several cell types (Saraste, J., Palade, G.E., and Farquhar, M.G. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 2021-2029). In this study the protein was partially purified from rat pancreas and mouse myeloma cells in order to characterize its oligosaccharides. It migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as a 57-58-kDa doublet under reducing conditions or as a single approximately 116-kDa band under nonreducing conditions. Pancreatic gp58 was susceptible to alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase digestion and it bound concanavalin A, Helix pomatia, Dolichos biflorus, soybean agglutinin, and Bauhinia purpurea lectins, but not Ricinus communis agglutinin or lectins from Griffonia simplicifolia-1, Arachis hypogaea, and Limulus polyphemus. It bound Ricinus communis agglutinin after galactosylation with GlcNAc galactosyltransferase. These data demonstrate that pancreatic p58 contains immature N-linked moieties with nonreducing terminal GlcNAc residues as well as the initiating GalNAc of O-linked glycoproteins. Myeloma gp58 was sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, and oligosaccharide analysis of its [3H]glucosamine-labeled glycopeptides indicated that it also contained immature N-linked glycans. Some of the latter consist of high mannose chains (high affinity for concanavalin A, endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive), but the predominant (95%) species are neutral tri- or tetraantennary N-linked chains containing GlcNAc (no binding to concanavalin A). Glycopeptides from biosynthetically labeled myeloma cells did not contain detectable base labile oligosaccharides, indicating that unlike pancreatic p58, myeloma gp58 may not be an O-linked glycoprotein. Neither pancreatic nor myeloma gp58 contained terminally processed oligosaccharides, indicating that gp58 has not been modified by trans-Golgi glycosyltransferases. Thus, the oligosaccharide content of gp58 is consistent with the assumption that this protein is retained in the cis Golgi cisternae during biosynthesis instead of being transported across the Golgi stacks and targeted back to the cis Golgi from the trans side."

Presence of the trimeric aggregates of the homologous subunits in the intact outer membrane, the liposome membrane, and the non-ionic surfactant were confirmed through cross-linking experiments and immunoblotting techniques. The protein D2 monomers prepared in 0.1% of sodium dodecyl sulfate at 23 degrees C spontaneously reassembled into the trimeric aggregate when the surfactant dropped below critical concentration. The diffusion rates of saccharides and beta-lactam antibiotics through the liposome membranes reconstituted from the reassembled protein D2 trimers were indistinguishable from those of the native protein D2. This study shed some light on the porin trimer assembly as well as on the mechanism of carbapenem diffusion through the protein D2 pores."
https://openalex.org/W1533097765,"Functional interactive cystine-lysine carriers have been expressed in Xenopus oocytes following the injection of RNA extracted from rat intestinal mucosa. Lysine-inhibitable cystine uptake was able to be measured 16 h after oocyte injection with RNA. The longer the oocytes were maintained after injection, the more cystine transport capability was induced. Uninjected or water-injected oocytes showed virtually no lysine-inhibitable cystine uptake, and no system developed after the oocytes had been isolated and maintained in vitro. The cystine uptake expressed after RNA injection was selectively inhibited by dibasic amino acids and phenylalanine but not by other amino acids or alpha-methyl-D-glucoside. Expression of the interactive cystine-lysine system was induced only by RNA isolated from intestinal tissue and not by RNA from rat liver. The Km for cystine uptake in RNA-injected oocytes was 0.01 mM and appears identical to the single system found in the RNA source tissue."

Under base-line conditions, PAI-1 antigen secretion was 4.3 +/- 1.0 micrograms (mean +/- S.D., n = 8) per 10(6) cells in 24 h. This PAI-1 had a low specific activity (6,000 +/- 1,600 units/mg) and Mr of 50,000, which was not altered by addition of rt-PA. In HUVEC cultured with 2 micrograms/ml rt-PA-Ala478, PAI-1 antigen secretion was 2.1 +/- 0.8 micrograms (n = 5) per 10(6) cells in 24 h with a specific activity of 120,000 +/- 42,000 units/mg and Mr of 50,000. Addition of rt-PA to this conditioned medium resulted in generation of three main components: 16% migrated as an Mr 106,000 rt-PA.PAI-1 complex, 16% as an Mr 81,000 degraded rt-PA.PAI-1 complex and the remainder as an Mr 45,000 degradation product of PAI-1. HUVEC cultured with 2 micrograms/ml rt-PA secreted 3.9 +/- 0.6 micrograms (n = 8) PAI-1 antigen per 10(6) cells within 24 h, of which 20-50% occurred as intact or degraded complexes with t-PA (Mr 106,000 and 81,000) and the rest as an inactive Mr 45,000 degradation product of PAI-1. PAI-1 mRNA levels, determined by Northern blot analysis and expressed relative to beta-actin mRNA levels, were very similar for HUVEC cultured in the absence or the presence of rt-PA or rt-PA-Ala478. It is concluded that PAI-1 is secreted by HUVEC in culture in fully active form which spontaneously inactivates. PAI-1 can be stabilized by addition of rt-PA-Ala478 to the culture medium, resulting in a 20-fold increase in specific activity. Interaction of rt-PA with active PAI-1 produces both t-PA.PAI-1 complex and an inactive degradation product of PAI-1."
https://openalex.org/W1573148085,"Abstract A high performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed for the assay of arginine-specific ADP-ribosyl transferases. The assay utilizes L-arginine methyl ester (LAME) as the acceptor substrate. ADP-ribosylated-LAME is separated from the reaction mixture using a C-8 reversed-phase column. Before injection, the assay mixture is derivatized with an orthophthaldialdehyde/2-mercaptoethanol reagent. Fluorescence detection of the orthophthaldialdehyde-derivatized product provides excellent sensitivity and a limit of detection of less than 100 fmol. The kinetic mechanism of two arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases, cholera toxin A subunit and an endogenous transferase from rabbit skeletal muscle, were both determined to be random sequential. The kinetic studies utilized 3-aminobenzamide and NG-monomethylarginine as competitive inhibitors for NAD and LAME, respectively. Cholera toxin was reported to have Km values of 5.6 and 39 mM for NAD and LAME, respectively. Km values of 0.56 and 1.2 mM were determined for NAD and LAME, respectively, using the transferase from rabbit skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1570829832,"The crystal structure of the transition state analog complex formed covalently between proteinase K and methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-chloromethyl ketone was determined by x-ray diffraction methods at a resolution of 2.2 A and refined by constrained least squares to an R factor of 19.8% for the 11864 structure amplitudes greater than 1 sigma F. The chloromethyl ketone group is covalently linked with the active site functional groups His69(N epsilon) and Ser224(O gamma). The former has substituted for chlorine and the latter has attacked the carbon of the ketone group, thereby forming the tetrahedral carbon atom of the transition state analog. The peptide part of the inhibitor is in an extended conformation and fills subsites S1 to S5 of the substrate recognition site. Its backbone hydrogens bond with strands 100-104 and 132-136 of the substrate recognition site as the central strand of a three-stranded antiparallel beta-pleated sheet. This sheet formation is associated with a movement by approximately 1 A of strand 100-104 which is probably associated with the insertion of the bulky proline side chain. The methoxysuccinyl group is stacked on the phenolic side chain of Tyr104 that is a part of the bottom of the recognition site. Biochemical studies show that shorter inhibitors of this type are less effective than the longer one, because there are fewer hydrogen bonding and van der Waals/stacking interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1538236582,"Modulator-1 and -2, proposed to be novel ether-linked aminophosphoglycerides, were originally identified as regulators of glucocorticoid receptor function (Bodine, P. V., and Litwack, G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9544-9554). We now demonstrate that these modulators are also potent new stimulators of protein kinase C activity in vitro. These endogenous biomolecules regulate purified protein kinase C activity in a biphasic and dose-dependent pattern, as determined by histone phosphorylation. Modulators, at concentrations within their apparent cellular range, stimulate protein kinase C-catalyzed histone phosphorylation 2-4-fold when added separately, or 10-12-fold when added together. This enhancement of kinase activity apparently is specific for protein kinase C, since neither protein kinase M, nor cAMP-dependent protein kinase A are stimulated by the modulators. The stimulation of purified protein kinase C occurs only when the enzyme has been initially activated by calcium, phosphatidylserine, and diacylglycerol, indicating that the modulators do not simply substitute for one of the enzyme cofactors. In addition, the modulators appear to interact directly with protein kinase C, perhaps with the regulatory domain of the enzyme, since these biomolecules inhibit the binding of phorbol ester to purified protein kinase C. Finally, time-course studies of protein kinase C-catalyzed histone phosphorylation indicate that the velocity of the enzyme reaction is increased by the modulators. Taken together, these results suggest that the modulators are a new class of regulators of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1500009526,"Wild type Escherichia coli cells containing elevated levels of DNA (cytosine-5)methyltransferases have increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of 5-azacytidine. The methyltransferases form tight binding complexes with azacytosine in DNA which could interfere with the recA recBCD repair pathway which is largely responsible for cell survival after treatment with the drug. We therefore determined if these complexes interfered with recA-mediated strand exchange in vitro. 32P-Labeled DNA fragments containing a single EcoRII site, with cytosine in the (-) strand replaced by 5-azacytosine, were prepared. We investigated the effect of the EcoRII methyltransferase on recA-mediated strand exchange with homologous M13 DNA by electrophoresis in agarose gels. In the absence of the methylase the rate and extent of strand exchange of azacytosine-containing DNA is the same as control DNA. In the presence of the methyltransferase strand exchange is inhibited, but some incorporation of duplexes into recA-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) complexes still occurs. The formation of these complexes is dependent on the length of the fragment 3' to the methylase binding site on the strand complementary to the ssDNA. The greater the length the greater the number of complexes that form. S-Adenosyl-L-methionine, which enhances binding of the methyltransferase to azacytosine-containing DNA, causes an increase in the inhibition of strand exchange and an increase in the number of inactive complexes formed. The complexes can be dissociated with guanidinium chloride which denatures the methyltransferase and leads to release of the (+) strand. The (-) strand remains associated with the ssDNA. This result implies that a plectonemic joint is formed between recA-ssDNA complexes and azacytosine-containing DNA-methyltransferase complexes. However, branch migration in these complexes is inhibited. Denaturation of the methyltransferase allows branch migration to proceed to completion, releasing the (+) strand."
